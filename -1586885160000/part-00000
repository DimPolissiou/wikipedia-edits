So I have a house where it's [[Frank Zappa|Frank Zappa's]] old [[Utility Muffin Research Kitchen|studio]], it's a live room, it's a big studio, it's beautiful. And I would be upstairs on the porch, outside the kitchen, and Bloodpop would come up and he'd go, 'Okay, come on, that's enough, off the porch,' and I would cry and I would say, 'I'm miserable, I'm sad, I\u2019m depressed,' and he'd go, 'I know, and we're gonna go make some music now. And then I'd go downstairs and I would write. This album is such a display of not only how you can reframe the way that you view the world, but I promise and I hope, that the love that was around me in the process of making this album is something that other people feel, that they know that artistically, like, you know how producers are, if one guy\u2019s working on it, or one girl\u2019s working on it, they don\u2019t want anyone else to work on it, they don\u2019t wanna share, they, everybody gets cocky, there was none of that. These records got passed around to so many different people, there were so many different iterations of these songs because we all wanted it to be perfect and literally nobody cared who put their fingerprints on it, as long as it was the dopest thing that we could give to the world and that it was meaningful, authentic, and completely me.<ref name=\"Beats1\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]'' released in March 2020, Gaga talked at length about numerous topics, including the recording process for ''Chromatica'', and confirmed that BloodPop was the \"center\" and her \"nucleus\" of production while creating the album and that he had a hand in the creation of every track.<ref name=\"Paper1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/lady-gaga-chromatica-2645479910.html |title=Lady Gaga: Life on Chromatica |last=Moran |first=Justin |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[Paper (magazine)|Paper]]}}</ref> It was also confirmed in the same interview that Gaga worked with a wide array of producers and musicians, such as [[Burns (musician)|Burns]], [[Axwell]] of [[Swedish House Mafia]], [[Tchami]], Benjamin Rice, and [[Rami Yacoub]], to create an album described as an \"[[electronic music|electronic]] [[tapestry]]\u201d by the interviewer.<ref name=\"Paper1\"/> In discussing the large collaborative atmosphere that enveloped the album's production, she said, \"It's easy to go into a computer and find a cool loop, but the producers I work with don't work this way.

So it's all the colors, all the sounds, you know, so we, we're talking about inclusivity and life and also a lot of what we see around us and what we're experiencing is math, which is very much like music and sound is math as well. So we talked about that, and then I sort of went back and I said, 'OK, well, yeah, it's inclusivity but it's really a way of thinking,' you know, it's not just, 'Oh, Chromatica, we're being inclusive with all the colors, all the people,' and when I say, 'All the colors, all the people'  I mean way more than we could possibly fathom.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork2020\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn April 5, 2020, the album's official cover was revealed.<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=ladygaga |number=1246905802952077312 |title=#Chromatica \u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udc932020 |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> It shows the singer with \"cotton candy pink\" hair, wearing a \"metallic bodysuit with spikes and studs sticking out of it\", \"a pair of platform boots with a tusk and a knife for its heels\" and a \"shoulder-to-fingertip sleeve covered in spikes\" on one of her hands.

The restrictions set in place were cause for hundreds of gay people to be forcibly outed and fired from the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. With a stroke of a pen, President Eisenhower expanded the federal government's anti-homosexual policies and procedures to include every department and agency and every private corporation with a government contract \u2013 affecting the job security of more than six million workers and armed forces personnel.<ref name=\"Berube 1990 269\">{{Cite book|title=Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II|last=Berube|first=Allan|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1990|location=Chapel Hill, NC|pages=269}}</ref> The executive order was also the cause for the firing of approximately 5,000 gay people from federal employment; this included private contractors and military personnel. Not only did the victims lose their jobs, but also they were forced out of the closet and thrust into the public eye as lesbian or gay.\n\nSpecifically, Truman's loyalty program had been extended through this executive order: \u201csexual perversion\u201d was added to a list of behaviors that would keep a person from holding a position in government. There were many new regulations and policies put into place to detect and remove gay, lesbian, and bisexual people. The new procedures to search out homosexuals were frequently to interview and look for signs of sexual orientation. They also looked at places these individuals frequently visited, such as gay bars, and they even found people guilty by association. If their friends or family showed signs of being homosexual, they might also be suspected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/items/show/1425|title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government \u00b7 OutHistory.org: It's About Time|website=outhistory.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1950s, similar repressive and oppressive policies had gone into effect in state and local governments which extended the prohibitions on the employment of lesbians and gay men to cover twelve million workers \u2013 more than twenty percent of the United States labor force \u2013 who now had to sign oaths attesting to their moral purity to get or to keep their jobs.<ref name=\"Berube 1990 269\"/> It was not until 1973 that a federal judge ruled a person's sexual orientation could not be the sole reason for termination from federal employment, and not until 1975 that the [[United States Civil Service Commission]] announced that they would consider applications by gays and lesbians on a case by case basis.

It was easy to convince a Congress dictated by a communist containment policy to respond to the perceived homosexual menace because they were already viewed to be not only subversive social elements of American culture, but subversive political elements. Homosexuality was directly linked to security concerns, and more government employees were dismissed because of their homosexual [[sexual orientation]] than because they were left-leaning or communist. George Chauncey noted that: \"The specter of the invisible homosexual, like that of the invisible communist, haunted Cold War America,\" and homosexuality (and by implication homosexuals themselves) were constantly referred to not only as a disease, but also as an invasion, like the perceived danger of communism and subversives.<ref>Field, Douglas, ed.

Wherry|Kenneth Wherry]] similarly attempted to invoke a connection between homosexuality and anti-nationalism. He said in an interview with [[Max Lerner]] that: \"You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives.\" Later in that same interview, he drew the line between patriotic Americans and gay men: \"But look, Lerner, we're both Americans, aren't we? I say, let's get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government.\"<ref>Lerner, Max, ''The Unfinished Country: A Book of American Symbols'' Simon and Schuster, 1959 pp 313\u2013316</ref>\n\nThe term \u201cHomintern\u201d was coined in the 1930s, possibly by Cyril Connolly, W.H. Auden, or Harold Norse, as a [[Camp (style)|camp]] term playing off of \"Comintern\" ([[Communist International]]). It was first used to describe an imagined group of gay men who controlled the art world, and later used in reference to \u201ca fantastical gay international that sought to control the world\u201d. In 1952, an article written by [[R. G. Waldeck|R.

They also looked at places these individuals frequently visited, such as gay bars, and they even found people guilty by association. If their friends or family showed signs of being homosexual, they might also be suspected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://outhistory.org/items/show/1425|title=The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government \u00b7 OutHistory.org: It's About Time|website=outhistory.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1950s, similar repressive and oppressive policies had gone into effect in state and local governments which extended the prohibitions on the employment of lesbians and gay men to cover twelve million workers \u2013 more than twenty percent of the United States labor force \u2013 who now had to sign oaths attesting to their moral purity to get or to keep their jobs.<ref name=\"Berube 1990 269\"/> It was not until 1973 that a federal judge ruled that a person's sexual orientation alone could not be the sole reason for termination from federal employment, and not until 1975 that the [[United States Civil Service Commission]] announced that they would consider applications by gays and lesbians on a case by case basis. Executive Order 10450 stayed partly in effect until 1995 when [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] rescinded the order and put in place the \"[[Don't ask, don't tell]]\" policy for admittance of gays into the military.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2011/08/05/288942/clinton-issued-order-letting-gays-get-security-clearances-16-years-ago-today/|title=Clinton Issued Order Letting Gays Get Security Clearances 16 Years Ago Today|website=ThinkProgress|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Association of communism with \"subversives\" ===\nBoth homosexuals and [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] members were seen as subversive elements in American society who all shared the same ideals of [[antitheism]], rejection of [[Bourgeoisie#Bourgeois culture|bourgeois culture]] and middle-class morality, and lack of conformity; they were also seen as scheming and manipulative and, most importantly, would put their own agendas above others in the eyes of the general population.<ref name=\"glbtq.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/mccarthyism_S.pdf|title=McCarthyism|last=Prono|first=Luca|date=|website=|publisher=[[glbtq.com]]|accessdate=}}</ref> McCarthy also associated homosexuality and communism as \"threats to the 'American way of life'.\"<ref>Carlson, Dennis. \"Gayness, multicultural education, and community.\" [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=K2_VMQyk-ZMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA233 Beyond black and white: New faces and voices in the U.S. Schools] (1997): 233\u2013256.</ref> [Homosexuals and communists] were perceived as hidden subcultures with their own meeting places, literature, cultural codes, and bonds of loyalty. [They] were thought to recruit the psychologically weak or disturbed [and] many believed the two were working together to undermine the government.<ref name=\":2\" /> David K. Johnson notes that without an idealized traditional American moral fiber, any citizen could succumb to immoral temptations such as homosexuality; and they could ultimately be seduced by communism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lavender Scare|last=Johnson|first=David K.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=95}}</ref> The association of homosexuality with communism proved to be a convenient political tool to develop and implement homophobic discriminatory policy throughout the federal government. It was easy to convince a Congress dictated by a communist containment policy to respond to the perceived homosexual menace because they were already viewed to be not only subversive social elements of American culture, but subversive political elements. Homosexuality was directly linked to security concerns, and more government employees were dismissed because of their homosexual [[sexual orientation]] than because they were left-leaning or communist. George Chauncey noted that: \"The specter of the invisible homosexual, like that of the invisible communist, haunted Cold War America,\" and homosexuality (and by implication homosexuals themselves) were constantly referred to not only as a disease, but also as an invasion, like the perceived danger of communism and subversives.<ref>Field, Douglas, ed.

Wherry|Kenneth Wherry]] similarly attempted to invoke a connection between homosexuality and anti-nationalism. He said in an interview with [[Max Lerner]] that: \"You can't hardly separate homosexuals from subversives.\" Later in that same interview, he drew the line between patriotic Americans and gay men: \"But look, Lerner, we're both Americans, aren't we? I say, let's get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government.\"<ref>Lerner, Max, ''The Unfinished Country: A Book of American Symbols'' Simon and Schuster, 1959 pp 313\u2013316</ref>\n\nThe term \u201cHomintern\u201d was coined in the 1930s, possibly by Cyril Connolly, W.H. Auden, or Harold Norse, as a [[Camp (style)|camp]] term playing off of \"Comintern\" ([[Communist International]]). It was first used to describe an imagined group of gay men who controlled the art world, and later used in reference to \u201ca fantastical gay international that sought to control the world\u201d. In 1952, an article written by [[R. G. Waldeck|R.
