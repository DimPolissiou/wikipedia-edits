Johann died in 1817 after being crushed by an overturned wagon. Stifter was educated at the '' Benedictine Gymnasium'' at [[Kremsm\u00fcnster Abbey|Kremsm\u00fcnster]], and went to the [[University of Vienna]] in 1826 to study law. In 1828 he fell in love with Fanny Greipl, but after a relationship lasting five years, her parents forbade further correspondence, a loss from which he never recovered. In 1835 he became engaged to Amalia Mohaupt, and they married in 1837, but the marriage was not a happy one. Stifter and his wife, unable to conceive, tried adopting three of Amalia's nieces at different times. One of them, Juliana, ran away several times and finally disappeared, only to be found drowned in the [[Danube]] four weeks later.\n\nAs a man of strong [[liberalism|liberal]] convictions who welcomed the [[1848 revolutions]] and allowed his name to go forward as a candidate in the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], even suspected by others of being a radical, the cornerstone of Stifter's philosophy was [[Bildung]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Swales |first1=Martin |title=Adalbert Stifter: A Critical Study |url=https://archive.org/details/adalbertstifterc0000swal |url-access=registration |date=1984 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/adalbertstifterc0000swal/page/2 2\u20133]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Mayer |first1=Mathias |title=Adalbert Stifter: Erz\u00e4hlen als Erkennen |date=2015 |publisher=Reclam Verlag |pages=16\u201318}}</ref> Instead of becoming a state official, he became a [[tutor]] to the aristocrats of [[Vienna]], and was highly regarded as such.
