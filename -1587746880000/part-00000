In [[RNA]], thymine is replaced with [[uracil]] in most cases.  In DNA, thymine (T) binds to [[adenine]] (A) via two hydrogen bonds, thereby stabilizing the nucleic acid structures.\n\nThymine combined with [[deoxyribose]] creates the [[nucleoside]] [[deoxythymidine]], which is synonymous with the term [[thymidine]]. Thymidine can be phosphorylated with up to three phosphoric acid groups, producing [[dTMP]] ('''d'''eoxy'''t'''hymidine '''m'''ono'''p'''hosphate), [[dTDP]], or [[dTTP]] (for the '''d'''i- and '''t'''ri- phosphates, respectively).\n\nOne of the common mutations of DNA involves two adjacent thymines or cytosine, which, in presence of [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet light]], may form [[thymine dimers]], causing \"kinks\" in the DNA molecule that inhibit normal function.\n\nThymine could also be a target for actions of 5-[[fluorouracil]] (5-FU) in [[cancer]] treatment. 5-FU can be a metabolic analog of thymine (in DNA synthesis) or uracil (in RNA synthesis).

It is one of seven special status cities (implementing several functions that counties normally provide) in [[Hesse]] and is located on the [[Main (river)|Main]], between Frankfurt and Mainz, only a few kilometres from its mouth in [[Mainz]]. The suburbs of Bauschheim and K\u00f6nigst\u00e4dten are included in R\u00fcsselsheim. R\u00fcsselsheim has attained international recognition through the presence of the German car company [[Opel|Adam Opel GmbH]].\n\n<!-- == Geography == -->\n== History==\nR\u00fcsselsheim's foundation goes back to a Frankish colony in the first half of the 5th century. The first written mention of \"Rucilesheim\", or \"the house of Rucile\", is in an inventory of royal hunting rights around the year 840. R\u00fcsselsheim emerged from a settlement of the Count of [[Katzenelnbogen]].\n\n[[Image:R\u00fcsselsheim De Merian Hassiae.jpg|thumb|circ. 1655]]\n\nOver time, the name of the city evolved from Rucilesheim to the current R\u00fcsselsheim:\n*764/5 Rucile(n)sheim\n*before 1130 Ruozcelenesheim\n*1336 Ruzelnsheim\n*1275 Ruozelsheim\n*1640 Ruselsem\n*1840 R\u00fcsselsheim\n\nIn the year 1435 the high noble Count John IV of [[Katzenelnbogen]]<ref>[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.de/  Katzenelnbogen and the First Riesling of the World]</ref> was the first to cultivate [[Riesling]] in R\u00fcsselsheim. Annual reports record that his administrator bought new vines for 22 Schilling. In the following years riesling grapes were planted down the river [[Rhine]] and up the river [[Moselle|Mosel]].  In the 18th and 19th centuries, R\u00fcsselsheim made a new contribution to the history of wine when famous wine-growing estates in the [[Rheingau]] recultivated their vineyards with vines from the R\u00fcsselsheim and [[Fl\u00f6rsheim]] Area (Allendorf, Rheingauer Weinbauverband EV 1980). After the First World War viticulture disappeared in R\u00fcsselsheim. In 1980 the mayor of R\u00fcsselsheim Dr. Karl-Heinz Storsberg set up a museum-vineyard near the castle which celebrates ''550 Years of Riesling''.\n\nThe town's population reached 1,422 by 1829, then doubled between 1875 and 1914 from 3,500 to 8,000. At the beginning of the Second World War, 16,000 people lived in R\u00fcsselsheim; only 9,500 remained at the conflict's end.   The population reached a new record of 63,000 inhabitants in 1978, with rapid post-war reconstruction fed first by refugees from the former German territories in Eastern Europe (''Heimatvertriebene''), then by immigrants attracted by the Opel factories. The proportion of people born overseas was 23% on 31 June 2014.<ref name=\"Ausl\u00e4nder\">{{cite web|title=Ma\u00dfgebliche Einwohnerzahlen (Stichtag: 30.06.2014) f\u00fcr die Ausl\u00e4nderbeiratswahl am 29.&nbsp;November 2015|publisher=Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt|url=http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/wahlen/daten/einwohnerzahl-auslaenderbeiratswahl-2015/index.html|url-status=dead|accessdate=2015-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913124736/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/wahlen/daten/einwohnerzahl%2Dauslaenderbeiratswahl%2D2015/index.html|archivedate=2015-09-13|language=German}}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe city's coat of arms features a silver \"Doppelhaken\" (double hook) and two silver stars on a blue background.\n\nThe \"Doppelhaken\" is also called a \"[[Wolfsangel]]\" (wolf hook), once possibly used to kill wolves, or as a grappling hook. It is now forbidden in Germany to use this symbol on the grounds that it has been used in the past as a symbol of some right-wing extremist groups, now banned. Civic coats of arms which traditionally used the ''Wolfsangel'' are exempt from the ban.<ref>[[:de:Wolfsangel]]</ref>\n\nThe two stars indicate that R\u00fcsselsheim used to belong to [[Katzenelnbogen|Katzenelnbogen County]], which also bore these stars on its coat of arms.\n\n===World War II===\n{{Further|R\u00fcsselsheim massacre}}\nDuring World War II, R\u00fcsselsheim was bombed several times by the British RAF. The RAF followed a policy of \"[[Area bombardment|area bombing]]\" of cities. The day after one such bombing, August 26, 1944, an American B-24 Liberator was shot down after bombing nearby Hanover (American policy did not allow for area bombing as did the British; the American crew had been bombing an airport). The nine member American crew was captured and under guard was placed on a train to a POW camp routed thorough R\u00fcsselsheim. Due to damage done to the railyards, the captured crew and their guards were forced to alight and walk to another location to catch another train. During this walk, residents of R\u00fcsselsheim saw the crew and vented their anger on the crew, shouting insults and spitting. Assuming the crew were \"Canadians\" and that they had taken part in the bombing of their city the night before, this group grew larger. One woman shouted out \"There are the terror flyers. Tear them to pieces! Beat them to death! They have destroyed our houses!\" She threw a brick at the crew and that precipitated a riot during which the residents attacked the crew with rocks, hammers, lumber and shovels. Six of the crew were killed. A local Nazi official administered a final shot to four of the men. The bodies of the dead crew were hidden at the rear of the city cemetery.\n \nAfter the War (1946) when R\u00fcsselsheim was under occupation by the American Army, the killings came to light and the bodies located. In the first war trials of Germans prior to the Nuremberg trials, five of the residents were tried as war criminals, found guilty and hanged. Three others received sentences to hard labour and were released in the 1950s. A later trial was held for two more citizens, one of whom was hanged. In all, eleven citizens were tried for war crimes and murder stemming from this incident, six of whom were executed. \n(see Wolfsangel: A German City on Trial 1945\u201348, by August Nigro (Brassey's Inc, London, August 2000; 186pp)({{ISBN|1574882457}}))\n\n===Lord Mayors===\n*1954\u20131965 [[Dr Walter K\u00f6bel]], [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n*1966\u20131981 Karl-Heinz Storsberg, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n*1981\u20131994 Norbert Winterstein, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n*1994\u20131999 Ottilia Geschka, [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]\n*1999\u20132011 Stefan Gieltowski, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n*2011\u20132016 Patrick Burghardt, [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]\n*2016\u2013present Udo Bausch,(independent politician)\n\n===City partnerships===\n\nSince 1961 R\u00fcsselsheim participates in a programme of international community partnership. A regular exchange of culture and sports takes place between the four partner communities. Among other things, there are regular competitions between the four municipalities.\n\nThe first partnership began in 1961 with the [[France|French]] town [[\u00c9vreux]], the capital of the ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Eure]], with approximately 50,000 inhabitants. Evreux is about 100&nbsp;km from both [[Paris]] and the [[Normandy|Normandy Coast]]. In terms of history, Evreux offers historical monuments from the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] period (3rd century) and a [[cathedral]] from the 13th century. The economy of the city is based on business from the printing, electronics and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nIn 1977 [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] ([[England]]) was added as the second partner town. The city has a population of about 70,000 and is located in [[Warwickshire]] County. It became well-known because of the public school with the same name, as well as the sport \"[[Rugby football|rugby]].\" Rugby is a transportation junction between [[London]], [[Birmingham]], and the north of England and its economy is based on industry and agriculture.\n\nIn 1979 the town of [[Varkaus]], in [[Finland]], was added. A quarter of the town is water, and as a town with bridges and canals, Varkaus is a popular [[tourist destination]], both in summer (baths and boot tours) and in winter (100&nbsp;km [[cross-country skiing|cross-country ski]] runs).\n\nIn 1991 the town of [[Kecskem\u00e9t]] formed a partnership with R\u00fcsselsheim and is its most recent addition. Kecskem\u00e9t is the capital of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] komitat [[B\u00e1cs-Kiskun]], with a population of about 100,000. Kecskem\u00e9t is located in the national park Kiskuns\u00e1g between [[Danube]] and [[Tisza|Theiss]]. Well-known people from the town include the playwright J\u00f3zsef Katona, the painter J\u00e1nos Murok\u00f6zy, and the composer [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]]. Art, education, and agriculture shape the town.\n\nAn attempt to add the Turkish spa town of [[Bodrum]] as a fifth partner town failed.\n\n== Economy==\nThe car manufacturer [[Opel]] and the ideal transportation location with many motorway connections and direct train connections from [[R\u00fcsselsheim station]] to [[Mainz]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Darmstadt]] have resulted in the establishment of many businesses and the attraction of many commuters in R\u00fcsselsheim.\n\n=== Local companies===\n;Opel:\nAbove all, R\u00fcsselsheim is known for its car manufacturer [[Opel]].

It is one of seven special status cities (implementing several functions that counties normally provide) in [[Hesse]] and is located on the [[Main (river)|Main]], between Frankfurt and Mainz, only a few kilometres from its mouth in [[Mainz]]. The suburbs of Bauschheim and K\u00f6nigst\u00e4dten are included in R\u00fcsselsheim. R\u00fcsselsheim has attained international recognition through the presence of the German car company [[Opel|Adam Opel GmbH]].\n\n<!-- == Geography == -->\n== History==\nR\u00fcsselsheim's foundation goes back to a Frankish colony in the first half of the 5th century. The first written mention of \"Rucilesheim\", or \"the house of Rucile\", is in an inventory of royal hunting rights around the year 840. R\u00fcsselsheim emerged from a settlement of the Count of [[Katzenelnbogen]].\n\n[[Image:R\u00fcsselsheim De Merian Hassiae.jpg|thumb|circ. 1655]]\n\nOver time, the name of the city evolved from Rucilesheim to the current R\u00fcsselsheim:\n*764/5 Rucile(n)sheim\n*before 1130 Ruozcelenesheim\n*1336 Ruzelnsheim\n*1275 Ruozelsheim\n*1640 Ruselsem\n*1840 R\u00fcsselsheim\n\nIn the year 1435 the high noble Count John IV of [[Katzenelnbogen]]<ref>[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.de/  Katzenelnbogen and the First Riesling of the World]</ref> was the first to cultivate [[Riesling]] in R\u00fcsselsheim. Annual reports record that his administrator bought new vines for 22 Schilling. In the following years riesling grapes were planted down the river [[Rhine]] and up the river [[Moselle|Mosel]].  In the 18th and 19th centuries, R\u00fcsselsheim made a new contribution to the history of wine when famous wine-growing estates in the [[Rheingau]] recultivated their vineyards with vines from the R\u00fcsselsheim and [[Fl\u00f6rsheim]] Area (Allendorf, Rheingauer Weinbauverband EV 1980). After the First World War viticulture disappeared in R\u00fcsselsheim. In 1980 the mayor of R\u00fcsselsheim Dr. Karl-Heinz Storsberg set up a museum-vineyard near the castle which celebrates ''550 Years of Riesling''.\n\nThe town's population reached 1,422 by 1829, then doubled between 1875 and 1914 from 3,500 to 8,000. At the beginning of the Second World War, 16,000 people lived in R\u00fcsselsheim; only 9,500 remained at the conflict's end.   The population reached a new record of 63,000 inhabitants in 1978, with rapid post-war reconstruction fed first by refugees from the former German territories in Eastern Europe (''Heimatvertriebene''), then by immigrants attracted by the Opel factories. The proportion of people born overseas was 23% on 31 June 2014.<ref name=\"Ausl\u00e4nder\">{{cite web|title=Ma\u00dfgebliche Einwohnerzahlen (Stichtag: 30.06.2014) f\u00fcr die Ausl\u00e4nderbeiratswahl am 29.&nbsp;November 2015|publisher=Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt|url=http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/wahlen/daten/einwohnerzahl-auslaenderbeiratswahl-2015/index.html|url-status=dead|accessdate=2015-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913124736/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/wahlen/daten/einwohnerzahl%2Dauslaenderbeiratswahl%2D2015/index.html|archivedate=2015-09-13|language=German}}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nThe city's coat of arms features a silver \"Doppelhaken\" (double hook) and two silver stars on a blue background.\n\nThe \"Doppelhaken\" is also called a \"[[Wolfsangel]]\" (wolf hook), once possibly used to kill wolves, or as a grappling hook. It is now forbidden in Germany to use this symbol on the grounds that it has been used in the past as a symbol of some right-wing extremist groups, now banned. Civic coats of arms which traditionally used the ''Wolfsangel'' are exempt from the ban.<ref>[[:de:Wolfsangel]]</ref>\n\nThe two stars indicate that R\u00fcsselsheim used to belong to [[Katzenelnbogen|Katzenelnbogen County]], which also bore these stars on its coat of arms.\n\n===World War II===\n{{Further|R\u00fcsselsheim massacre}}\nDuring World War II, R\u00fcsselsheim was bombed several times by the British RAF. The RAF followed a policy of \"[[Area bombardment|area bombing]]\" of cities. The day after one such bombing, August 26, 1944, an American B-24 Liberator was shot down after bombing nearby Hanover (American policy did not allow for area bombing as did the British; the American crew had been bombing an airport). The nine member American crew was captured and under guard was placed on a train to a POW camp routed thorough R\u00fcsselsheim. Due to damage done to the railyards, the captured crew and their guards were forced to alight and walk to another location to catch another train. During this walk, residents of R\u00fcsselsheim saw the crew and vented their anger on the crew, shouting insults and spitting. Assuming the crew were \"Canadians\" and that they had taken part in the bombing of their city the night before, this group grew larger. One woman shouted out \"There are the terror flyers. Tear them to pieces! Beat them to death! They have destroyed our houses!\" She threw a brick at the crew and that precipitated a riot during which the residents attacked the crew with rocks, hammers, lumber and shovels. Six of the crew were killed. A local Nazi official administered a final shot to four of the men. The bodies of the dead crew were hidden at the rear of the city cemetery.\n \nAfter the War (1946) when R\u00fcsselsheim was under occupation by the American Army, the killings came to light and the bodies located. In the first war trials of Germans prior to the Nuremberg trials, five of the residents were tried as war criminals, found guilty and hanged. Three others received sentences to hard labour and were released in the 1950s. A later trial was held for two more citizens, one of whom was hanged. In all, eleven citizens were tried for war crimes and murder stemming from this incident, six of whom were executed. \n(see Wolfsangel: A German City on Trial 1945\u201348, by August Nigro (Brassey's Inc, London, August 2000; 186pp)({{ISBN|1574882457}}))\n\n===Lord Mayors===\n*1954\u20131965 [[Dr Walter K\u00f6bel]], [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n*1966\u20131981 Karl-Heinz Storsberg, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n*1981\u20131994 Norbert Winterstein, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n*1994\u20131999 Ottilia Geschka, [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]]\n*1999\u20132011 Stefan Gieltowski, [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]\n*2011\u20132016 Patrick Burghardt, [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]\n*2016\u2013present Udo Bausch,(independent politician)\n\n===City partnerships===\n\nSince 1961 R\u00fcsselsheim participates in a programme of international community partnership. A regular exchange of culture and sports takes place between the four partner communities. Among other things, there are regular competitions between the four municipalities.\n\nThe first partnership began in 1961 with the [[France|French]] town [[\u00c9vreux]], the capital of the ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Eure]], with approximately 50,000 inhabitants. Evreux is about 100&nbsp;km from both [[Paris]] and the [[Normandy|Normandy Coast]]. In terms of history, Evreux offers historical monuments from the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] period (3rd century) and a [[cathedral]] from the 13th century. The economy of the city is based on business from the printing, electronics and pharmaceutical industries.\n\nIn 1977 [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] ([[England]]) was added as the second partner town. The city has a population of about 70,000 and is located in [[Warwickshire]] County. It became well-known because of the public school with the same name, as well as the sport \"[[Rugby football|rugby]].\" Rugby is a transportation junction between [[London]], [[Birmingham]], and the north of England and its economy is based on industry and agriculture.\n\nIn 1979 the town of [[Varkaus]], in [[Finland]], was added. A quarter of the town is water, and as a town with bridges and canals, Varkaus is a popular [[tourist destination]], both in summer (baths and boot tours) and in winter (100&nbsp;km [[cross-country skiing|cross-country ski]] runs).\n\nIn 1991 the town of [[Kecskem\u00e9t]] formed a partnership with R\u00fcsselsheim and is its most recent addition. Kecskem\u00e9t is the capital of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] komitat [[B\u00e1cs-Kiskun]], with a population of about 100,000. Kecskem\u00e9t is located in the national park Kiskuns\u00e1g between [[Danube]] and [[Tisza|Theiss]]. Well-known people from the town include the playwright J\u00f3zsef Katona, the painter J\u00e1nos Murok\u00f6zy, and the composer [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]]. Art, education, and agriculture shape the town.\n\nAn attempt to add the Turkish spa town of [[Bodrum]] as a fifth partner town failed.\n\n== Economy==\nThe car manufacturer [[Opel]] and the ideal transportation location with many motorway connections and direct train connections from [[R\u00fcsselsheim station]] to [[Mainz]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]] and [[Darmstadt]] have resulted in the establishment of many businesses and the attraction of many commuters in R\u00fcsselsheim.\n\n=== Local companies===\n;Opel:\nAbove all, R\u00fcsselsheim is known for its car manufacturer [[Opel]]. The founder, [[Adam Opel]], began as a trainee mechanic and founded a sewing machine factory.

In Oakland the Red Sox bats went cold, scoring only 6 runs in 3 games, and losing the remaining 2 games which led to a season series split of 3\u20133. Boston headed with a 58\u201339 record to the [[2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star break]], leading the AL with 1 game ahead of the Athletics (56\u201339) and with most wins in the majors, just ahead of the [[2013 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] with 57\u201336, who entered the break with the best record.\n\nFollowing the All-Star break the Red Sox played the [[2013 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] for the first time at Fenway in 2013. Like the previous two series in the Bronx, Boston could take 2 out of 3 games against New York. [[Mike Napoli]] secured the series win in the rubber match with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th. With 1.5 games behind Boston, [[2013 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay]] visited the Fens for their third and final time. The Rays took game one and shrunk the lead to just .5 games, the smallest margin since Boston took over the lead in the AL East on May 27. In game 2 the Red Sox put themselves back to a 1.5 game lead, including [[Shane Victorino]]'s steal of home in a delayed double steal with [[Dustin Pedroia]], who agreed to a seven-year contract extension through the 2021 season a day later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130723&content_id=54470418&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|title=Pedroia agrees to extension through 2021|author =Ian Browne|publisher=MLB.com|date=July 24, 2013|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}</ref> Tampa Bay threatened the AL East lead again by taking game 3 but game 4 was rain delayed and later postponed to the scheduled off day on July 29, after Boston's 3 game road trip to [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards|Camden Yards]] and Rays' trip to the Bronx. In game one against [[2013 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]], the only team in the AL East Boston had a losing record against at that time, the Red Sox were shut out for the fourth time in July (with four shutouts in all of April, May and June combined) and lost the AL East top spot for the first time since May 27. Boston battled back and took game 2 with [[Stephen Drew]] going yard twice for the second time in his career in a single game. Game 2 also saw the ejection of [[David Ortiz]] in the top of the 7th, following an argument over balls and strikes with homeplate umpire [[Tim Timmons (umpire)|Tim Timmons]] and the destruction of a dugout phone with his bat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/28/david-ortiz-ejected-tantrum-du_n_3665482.html|title=David Ortiz Ejected: Big Papi Smashes Dugout Phone After Strikeout vs. Orioles|author =Chris Greenberg|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=July 28, 2013|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}</ref> In the rubber match, Big Papi homered for the 20th time that season, his 12th consecutive season with 20+ home runs and his 11th with Boston, joining [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] and [[Jim Rice]] but still behind [[Ted Williams]], who accomplished this feat in 16 seasons with the Red Sox. [[Jon Lester]] earned his 10th individual win, the first Red Sox pitcher to reach that mark in 2013, and Boston were able to shut out the Orioles and reclaimed the AL East lead just to give it back the next day to the Rays in the makeup match of the 4 game series in which the Red Sox fell victim to a controversial call at home plate.

Both games saw the first major league wins for [[Brandon Workman]], in his third start, and [[Drake Britton]] respectively. On July 30, Boston acquired starting pitcher [[Jake Peavy]] from the [[2013 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] in a three-way deal, sending infielder [[Jos\u00e9 Iglesias (baseball)|Jos\u00e9 Iglesias]] to the [[2013 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] and [[Avisail Garc\u00eda]] from Detroit to Chicago.\n\n===August===\nAugust started just like July ended, with a walk-off win against the Mariners. In the series finale, the Red Sox were trailing by five in the ninth, but scored six runs for their 11th walk-off win in 2013. This was the biggest ninth inning come from behind victory since the 2007 Mother's Day Miracle against the [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] and the biggest eighth inning comeback, trailing by 6, since July 3, 1940, against the [[1940 Philadelphia Athletics season|Athletics]], at that time still located in their origin city Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_08_01_seamlb_bosmlb_1&mode=box#gid=2013_08_01_seamlb_bosmlb_1&mode=recap&c_id=bos|title=Red Sox complete thrilling comeback in walk-off win|author =Ian Browne|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref>\nDespite winning the first two series against the [[2013 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] and the [[2013 Houston Astros season|Astros]] the Red Sox played .500 ball for the first 3 1/2 weeks of August. The interleague series against Arizona saw the first start for newly acquired starting pitcher Jake Peavy, who tied the series with a strong performance after the D-Backs took game one, with the winning run driven in by former Red Sox player [[Cody Ross]]. In a combined effort of Doubront and the bullpen, Boston shut-out the team from the NL West. With no off-day the Red Sox headed west to play the Astros for the first time in [[Minute Maid Park]] as a team of the American League. In a slugging fest, with 25 runs and 26 hits of both teams combined, Boston took game two after completely failing to score in game one and took the series in game three with a come from behind victory in the ninth. Slowly crawling their way back east the Red Sox stopped for a four-game series in Kansas City dropping 3 games before heading to Toronto, dropping two out of three against the AL East rival but still maintaining a 2-game lead over the Rays. On their second visit to Boston, the Yankees clinched their first series of the season against the fierce rival by taking two games out of three. Red Sox lost their season tying three series in a row.\n\nThe tides turned when Boston headed to the west coast for a three-game series against the 2012 World Series champion [[2013 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco]] and the, to that time, red hot [[2013 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]]. Lester with the help of Workman shut-out the Giants in game one before the Red Sox dropped game two and giving the AL East lead to the Rays but earning the lead back holding San Francisco to a single run in game three. In game one in Los Angeles Boston could not score but were able to take game two and three, inflicting the Dodgers first series loss since June 16.\n\nBack home in Boston the Red Sox took two out of three against [[2013 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]] and the two remaining games in August against the [[2013 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] for their 28th series win that season and a 4 1/2 game lead over the Rays in the AL East.\n\n===September===\nBoston swept the White Sox and extended the AL East lead to 5 1/2 games but ended a streak of 11 games allowing only three runs or less. Another streak however continued in game one of the home series against the [[2013 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]]. [[John Lackey]] received absolutely no [[run support]] for the fifth time of his last 11 starts and four or less runs in the ninth game over the same stretch. Allowing only one run and handing [[Max Scherzer]] just his second loss of the season, the Red Sox took game two and exploded in game three, scoring 20 runs, a season high amongst all Major League teams, on 19 hits including 8 long balls. On their last trip to the Bronx, Boston headed into the seventh with a five run lead but the combination of Peavy, Thornton and Tazawa could not stop the Yankees from scoring 6 runs. Down on their last strike, Boston scored against New York's closer [[Mariano Rivera]] in the ninth and took game one in extra frames. Down by five, Boston scored nine runs in two innings, including a grand slam by [[Mike Napoli]] and took game two. In search for run support the offense gave Lackey 13 runs in game three, the most in any start for him this season, to extend the winning streak to five and extending the lead in the AL East to a season high 8 1/2 games but failed to sweep the four game set when Workman gave up a walk-off wild pitch in the bottom of the ninth after Rivera suffered his second blown save in the series while trying for a two inning save. Buchholz returned to the rotation three months after his last start on June 8 and protected his undefeated season record in game one of a three-game series in St. Peterburg by allowing, with the help of the relievers, no runs. In game two [[Mike Carp]] hit a game deciding pinch-hit grand slam in the tenth but Boston failed to sweep the Rays in the series finale.\n\nBack at Fenway Park for the last regular season home stand, [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]] became the third Red Sox player within a week to hit a grand slam, breaking a tie in the seventh against the Yankees, and Koji Uehara set a new franchise record by retiring his 37th consecutive batter. Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz then secured the series sweep by back-to-back strong outings. Lester allowed only one run on three hits, while Buchholz allowed only one unearned run on two hits.  Struggling again against the Orioles, Boston dropped the first two games before [[John Lackey]] posted a two hit gem and the Red Sox clinched a spot in the postseason. With a [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay]] loss, the Red Sox cut the [[Magic number (sports)|magic number]] for winning the division down to 1. A day later the Red Sox clinched their first AL East title since [[2007 Boston Red Sox season|2007]] by beating the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] 6\u20133. In game two Buchholz suffered his first loss of the season, albeit allowing only three runs, two of them earned. Boston secured the series with a 5\u20132 win on their last regular season home game.\n\nOn their last interleague trip, the Red Sox split the two game series against the [[2013 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]], losing game one but winning game two scoring 15 runs. [[Will Middlebrooks]] posted two home runs, including the fifth grand slam in the month of September for Boston, and [[David Ortiz]] collected his 100th RBI on the season. On September 27, the Red Sox secured home field advantage for the [[American League Division Series]] by beating the Orioles 12\u20133. Ortiz hit his 30th home run of the season, making it his seventh season with 30 HR/100 RBI, tying Ted Williams for the club record. A day later, the Red Sox secured home field advantage throughout the playoffs thanks to a 7-5 loss by the [[Oakland A's]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]], making the last two games virtually pointless. Boston lost both games, giving up a 5\u20130 lead in the fifth in game three. The Red Sox headed into the postseason with the best record in the majors, tied with the [[2013 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\n==Postseason highlights==\n\n===[[2013 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] vs. [[2013 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]]===\n\n====Game 1, October 4====\n3:07&nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]) at [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=Tampa Bay|RoadAbr=TB\n|R1=0|R2=1|R3=0|R4=1|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=2|RH=4|RE=0\n|Home='''Boston'''|HomeAbr=BOS\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=5|H5=3|H6=0|H7=0|H8=4|H9=x|HR=12|HH=14|HE=0\n|WP=[[Jon Lester]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Matt Moore (baseball)|Matt Moore]] (0\u20131)\n|RoadHR=[[Sean Rodriguez]] (1), [[Ben Zobrist]] (1) |HomeHR=\n|}}\n\nThe Red Sox had a shaky opening in Game 1, with Jon Lester surrendering solo home runs to [[Sean Rodriguez]] and [[Ben Zobrist]].  However, the Red Sox' offense ignited in the bottom of the fourth inning, with several doubles combining with poor Tampa Bay fielding to stitch together a five-run frame.  Boston then tacked on three more in the bottom of the 5th and four more in the bottom of the 8th.  [[Jon Lester]] pitched 7 2/3 innings, having surrendered only 3 hits and 2 earned runs.  [[Junichi Tazawa]] and [[Ryan Dempster]] provided effective relief pitching in the eighth and ninth to seal the Game 1 victory for the Red Sox.\n\n====Game 2, October 5====\n5:37&nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]) at [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=Tampa Bay|RoadAbr=TB\n|R1=0|R2=1|R3=0|R4=0|R5=2|R6=1|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=4|RH=8|RE=2\n|Home='''Boston'''|HomeAbr=BOS\n|H1=2|H2=0|H3=2|H4=1|H5=1|H6=0|H7=0|H8=1|H9=x|HR=7|HH=11|HE=0\n|WP=[[John Lackey]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[David Price (baseball)|David Price]] (0\u20131) |SV=[[Koji Uehara]] (1)\n|RoadHR= |HomeHR=[[David Ortiz]] 2 (2)\n|}}\n[[David Ortiz]] had his first multi-home run postseason game to lead the Red Sox to victory, smashing solo blasts in the 1st and 8th innings.   Tampa Bay starter [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]] had a rough outing, being charged with all seven of Boston's runs.  The Rays attempted to catch up with the Red Sox with significant offense in the 2nd, 5th, and 6th innings, but their efforts were fruitless.  In the 7th and 8th innings, the Rays threatened with two runners on base, but in each frame no runners could score for Tampa Bay due to inning-ending 4\u20136\u20133 double plays to conserve the Sox' two-run lead, which stretched to a three-run gap with Ortiz's home run.  In the top of the ninth, closer [[Koji Uehara]] struck out the first two batters he was facing and the game ended with an unassisted ground out by [[Mike Napoli]] to secure the 2\u20130 series lead.

In the top of the 5th inning, Boston added two more runs, giving them a three-run cushion, but their lead was shattered in the bottom half of the frame with one swing, a three-run home run by [[Evan Longoria]].  Neither team scored again until the bottom 8th, when [[Delmon Young]] drove in a go-ahead RBI.

This, however, would prove to be Tampa Bay's lone run. Boston threatened early with two walks and a single, which could not score [[David Ortiz]] from second, in the top of the second. With the bases loaded the Rays pulled their struggling starter [[Jeremy Hellickson]], responsible for all three runners, and [[Jamey Wright]] successfully pitched out of the jam with a strike out and a double play. Tampa Bay sent a postseason record nine pitchers to the mound in the course of the game, emptying their bullpen, and scheduled game five starter [[David Price (baseball)|David Price]] was warming in the pen. In the top of the seventh, with two on and two outs, [[Jacoby Ellsbury]] stole second base, his fourth steal of the series, and advanced to third on a wild pitch, which scored [[Xander Bogaerts]] from third. [[Shane Victorino]] legged out the two out infield hit to score the runner from third and gave the Red Sox the lead. In the top of the ninth, a melting Rays closer [[Fernando Rodney]] walked two of the first three batters he faced and drilled Victorino on a two strike pitch. This was the fourth time Victorino was hit by a pitch in this series. With the bases loaded [[Dustin Pedroia]] delivered a sacrifice fly which scored Bogaerts to add some insurance for Boston. Closer Koji Uehara came into the game with two outs in the bottom of the eighth and successfully racked up the four-out save.

Detroit had scored the game's lone run by virtue of a [[Jhonny Peralta]] RBI in the sixth inning.  While Red Sox starter [[Jon Lester]] allowed only one run, he did give up nine hits and struck out six batters, whereas Detroit's [[An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez]] struck out twelve.

However, Red Sox starter [[Clay Buchholz]] gave up home runs to [[Miguel Cabrera]] and [[Alex Avila]] in the top of the 6th, widening the Tigers' lead to five runs.

Boston closer [[Koji Uehara]] held Detroit hitless in the top of the ninth inning.  [[Jonny Gomes]] started off the Red Sox offense in the bottom of the ninth with a single.  Gomes was then able to advance to second base on a flubbed fielding play.  Gomes then took third base on a [[Rick Porcello]] wild pitch, and easily scored the winning run on a walk-off hit from [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]], capping the stunning comeback.\n\nEarlier in the day, the [[New England Patriots]] had a stunning comeback of their own, with [[quarterback]] [[Tom Brady]] throwing a [[touchdown]] with 5 seconds left to beat the [[New Orleans Saints]] at home by a score of 30\u201327.

In the seventh, the Tigers scored on a double play, bringing them within a run.

Ortiz later put an exclamation mark on the game with a 2-run shot to right in the 7th, for his 4th HR of the postseason. Matt Holliday prevented a shutout by hitting a solo shot into the Green Monster in the top of the 9th off [[Ryan Dempster]].

However, it all went to naught for the Red Sox in the seventh inning when two fielding errors on the same play gave St. Louis the lead.  With the bases loaded with one out and [[Craig Breslow]] pitching in relief, [[Matt Carpenter (baseball)|Matt Carpenter]] hit a fly ball to left field, but the runner on third beat the throw home, tying the game.  Catcher [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]] then flubbed the ball, which was retrieved by the pitcher Breslow.  Breslow then made an errant throw to third base, allowing [[Jon Jay]] to score as well, giving St. Louis a 3\u20132 advantage.

Boston tied the game after a leadoff triple by rookie [[Xander Bogaerts]] who scored on a fielders choice at second by [[Mike Carp]] in the fifth and [[Daniel Nava]] drove in [[Shane Victorino]], who reached base on a leadoff walk in the sixth and was advanced to third by a [[David Ortiz]] base hit. [[F\u00e9lix Doubront]] pitched two scoreless innings and [[Craig Breslow]] took over in the seventh but was quickly replaced by [[Junichi Tazawa]] after giving up a hit and drilled [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]]. Both inherited runners scored on a double by [[Matt Holliday]]. The Red Sox came back again in the eighth after a leadoff single by [[Jacoby Ellsbury]] and [[Shane Victorino]] was hit by reliever [[Carlos Mart\u00ednez (pitcher, born 1991)|Carlos Mart\u00ednez]].

In the bottom of the ninth with one out, [[Koji Uehara]] took the mound and gave up a double on his first pitch to [[Allen Craig]] which advanced [[Yadier Molina]], who singled earlier in the inning, to third. On a ground ball to Pedroia, who was playing the infield grass, Molina was tagged out at home by [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]], who fired to third to try to get Craig. [[Will Middlebrooks]] was not able to field the ball cleanly and it got away from him.

[[Craig Breslow]] gave up a hit against Carpenter, scoring the sixth of seven inherited runners in this series by Boston relievers, and a walk to Beltr\u00e1n. He was immediately relieved by [[Junichi Tazawa]] who stranded both runners. In the eighth, after his third hit on three at bats that night, Ortiz was pinched run for by [[Quintin Berry]] who stole the first Red Sox base on the very first attempt in the series against the Cardinals. [[John Lackey]] took the mound in the bottom of the eighth. With one out [[Yadier Molina]] reached base and advanced to second on a throwing error by Bogaerts and even took third on a wild pitch but St. Louis could not bring him home. In the bottom of the ninth Red Sox closer [[Koji Uehara]] took over, giving up a one out long single to [[Allen Craig]]. Uehara ended the game by picking off pinch runner [[Kolten Wong]], earning his first save of the series and the sixth in this postseason.

Boston struck first on back-to-back one out doubles by [[Dustin Pedroia]] and [[David Ortiz]], who continued his monstrous tear, hitting .733 in the series. Wainwright ended up striking out the side in the first two innings before [[Jon Lester]] broke the streak with a groundout. St. Louis had back-to-back leadoff singles in the second and third by [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] and [[David Freese]], latter advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by [[Pete Kozma]] but was left in scoring position. In the fourth Ortiz tied a World Series record by [[Billy Hatcher]] on a hit, reaching base in nine consecutive plate appearances, but failed to set a new record by flying out to center field in the sixth. With one out in the bottom of the fourth, [[Matt Holliday]] hit a solo shot to center field to tie the game. Boston threatened in the fifth after a leadoff hit by [[Xander Bogaerts]] and a one out single by [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]] but Wainwright struck out Lester and Ellsbury to strand both runners. After a leadoff single by Bogaerts, [[Stephen Drew]] walked and Ross drove in one run on a ground rule double to left field. With two runners in scoring position Ellsbury's single scored Drew but Ross was tagged out at home plate on the throw by [[Shane Robinson (baseball)|Shane Robinson]]. In the bottom of the eighth Lester allowed a one out double against Freese and [[Koji Uehara]] took over the mound for a four out save after Kozma hit a fly ball to left field for the second out of the inning. Uehara struck out pinch hitter [[Matt Adams]] on three pitches for the third out. The Red Sox closer struck out [[Matt Carpenter (baseball)|Matt Carpenter]], grounded out pinch hinter [[John Jay]] and Holliday flew out to right field to earn the save in back-to-back games.

[[John Lackey]] induced two flyouts against [[Matt Adams]] and [[David Freese]], before the runners advanced on a wild pitch, but Lackey ended the threat by striking out [[Jon Jay]]. In the same inning the first two batters for the Red Sox reached base, a single by [[Jonny Gomes]] and a walk by [[Shane Victorino]], but after back-to-back popouts into foul territory by [[Xander Bogaerts]] and [[Stephen Drew]], [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]] struck out. [[Jacoby Ellsbury]] lead off the third inning with a single and Pedroia advanced him to second on a groundout. With first base open, [[Michael Wacha]] intentionally walked [[David Ortiz]], Ortiz's second walk of the game, and struck out [[Mike Napoli]] but then drilled Gomes and with the bases loaded Victorino hit a double off the [[Green Monster]], his first hit in this series, scoring all three runners. Victorino just missed his second grand slam of this postseason but Wacha's streak ended, who to this point had not allowed a hit with runners in scoring position this October. Bogaerts lined out to third base to end the inning. In the top of the fourth, the just awarded AL [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Golden Glove]] winner on second base, [[Dustin Pedroia]], committed a fielding error on a possible double play ball with one out and Craig on first. Lackey pitched out of the jam on a flyout by Adams and striking out Freese. On the first pitch in the bottom of the fourth, Drew homered into the Red Sox bullpen and Ellsbury followed him with a double. After a flyout by Pedroia which advanced Ellsbury to third, Ortiz was again intentionally walked. Cardinals manager [[Mike Matheny]] tried to stop the bleeding and replaced his rookie starter with game 4 losing pitcher [[Lance Lynn]], who quickly warmed up after Drew went yard earlier in this inning. Lynn could not make an out as Napoli drove in Ellsbury on a single, Gomes drew a walk to load the bases and Victorino collected his fourth RBI on a base hit which scored Ortiz from third. [[Seth Maness]] relieved Lynn and ended the inning by striking out Bogaerts. Michael Wacha left the game with six earned runs in 3 2/3 innings of work. Prior to this game he posted a 1.00 ERA in the postseason. The Cardinals threatened again in the fifth after a leadoff hit by John Jay, a one out single by Carpenter and a flyout to right field by [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]], which advanced Jay to third. But Lackey induced another flyout against [[Matt Holliday]]. St. Louis brought in their fourth arm of the night in the bottom of the fifth, [[Kevin Siegrist]]. After two quick outs, Ellsbury reached on a fielding error by [[Matt Carpenter (baseball)|Matt Carpenter]] and was then in a [[rundown]], after he took off too early on a steal attempt. Siegrist misplayed his position on first base, standing too far away, and Ellsbury safely returned to the bag. Lackey got two quick outs in the top of the seventh, before [[Daniel Descalso]] hit a long single into right field and Carpenter followed him with a double to left field, advancing the runner to third. Beltr\u00e1n drove in the Cardinal's first run on a left field single into the [[Infield shift|shift]] and advanced on a wild pitch. Lackey walked Holliday to load the bases before he was relieved by [[Junichi Tazawa]]. He induced a ground ball against Allen Craig to first base, Mike Napoli bobbled the ball but could recover in time and Tazawa, covering first base, got the out. With Ellsbury on first, Pedroia grounded into a fielder's choice in the bottom of the eighth, which ended his streak of reaching base safely in 20 consecutive postseason games at home. In a non-[[Save (baseball)|save]] situation, the Red Sox brought in their closer [[Koji Uehara]], in relief of [[Brandon Workman]], who worked a quiet eighth inning. John Jay flew out to Gomes, Descalso popped out to Gomes and Carpenter struck out and the Red Sox clinched their eighth World Series.\n\n[[John Lackey]] became the first pitcher in MLB history to win two World Series clinching games with two different teams. Lackey won the series clincher with the [[Los Angeles Angels]] in [[2002 World Series|2002]] as a rookie.\n\n[[David Ortiz]] was named 2013 World Series MVP for the first time in his career with 2 HRs, 6 RBIs, .688 batting average and 1.948 OPS.

He is also only the 2nd exclusive designated hitter to be awarded the World Series MVP (2009-Hideki Matsui).

Francona received a standing ovation in the first game of the four-game series.  Boston fell to Cleveland in a lopsided 12\u20133 loss on May 23, but proceeded to triumph in the following three matches on May 24, 25 and 26 to win the four-game series.  On [[Memorial Day]], May 27, the Red Sox opened a four-game home-and-home series against [[2013 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia]], the team's first interleague series of 2013.  The Phillies are considered Boston's interleague \"rival\", playing the Red Sox every season.  The first two games of the series were held at Fenway Park, with the Red Sox winning on May 27 but then losing, 3\u20131, on May 28, in a game in which former Boston closer [[Jonathan Papelbon]] was awarded a [[save (baseball)|save]].  Papelbon repeated the feat again on May 29 as the series shifted to Philadelphia.

The Sox pounded the Yankees, 11\u20131, on June 1, and prevailed, 3\u20130, in a rain-shortened six-inning game on June 2 that was eventually called due to thunderstorms.  [[Clay Buchholz]]'s record remained spotless at 8\u20130.  Coming home to Fenway Park, the Red Sox took 2 of 3 games from the [[2013 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] from June 4\u20136, including a 17\u20135 romp.  On June 8, Boston faced the [[2013 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] in a day-night doubleheader, losing the first game but winning the second as Buchholz's aforementioned perfect record improved to 9\u20130.  To close out the series, the Red Sox gave Angels starting pitcher [[Joe Blanton]] his tenth loss of the season in a 10\u20135 victory on June 9.  The condensed two-day series and day-night doubleheader were necessitated by effects from [[Tropical Storm Andrea (2013)|Tropical Storm Andrea]] which rained out the scheduled Friday, June 7 game.\n\nHeading back out on the road, the Red Sox played a 14-inning game on national television as ESPN's ''Monday Night Baseball'' covered the 10\u20138 victory over the [[2013 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] at Tropicana Field.  This was the second longest game by time in Rays history.  The Red Sox gave up a 6\u20130 lead after a first inning in which the first eight Boston batters all reached base, and then [[Andrew Bailey (baseball)|Andrew Bailey]] had a blown save in the 10th inning, giving up two Tampa Bay runs.  Eventually, well after midnight, the Red Sox scored two runs in the top of the 14th which were unanswerable by the Rays in the bottom half of the inning.  The Red Sox then split the two remaining games of the series to win 2 of its 3 games.  Boston lost 3 of 4 games in a road series against [[2013 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]] from June 13\u201316.  After losing 3 out of 4 in a tough series to the [[2013 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], the Red Sox would go to win 5 of their next 6 in June and extending that streak for 9 out of 10 into July, which included a walk off home run against the [[2013 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] by [[Jonny Gomes]].\n\n===July===\nAfter sweeping the [[2013 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]] the Red Sox headed west for a 10-game road trip and extended the winning streak to 5 games with a win against the [[2013 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels]].

Boston then lost the following 2 games against Los Angeles (splitting the season series 3\u20133 in the process) and the [[2013 Seattle Mariners season|Seattle Mariners]] before starting a 4-game winning streak, taking 3 out of 4 games against the M's and the first game of the series against the A's. The 4 game series in Seattle saw the first Major League win for Pitcher [[Steven Wright (baseball)|Steven Wright]] and the first appearance of [[Brandon Workman]] in the big leagues. Workman had his first start only 4 days later against the [[2013 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]], taking a no-hit bid to the 7th inning. In Oakland the Red Sox bats went cold, scoring only 6 runs in 3 games, and losing the remaining 2 games which led to a season series split of 3\u20133. Boston headed with a 58\u201339 record to the [[2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star break]], leading the AL with 1 game ahead of the Athletics (56\u201339) and with most wins in the majors, just ahead of the [[2013 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] with 57\u201336, who entered the break with the best record.\n\nFollowing the All-Star break the Red Sox played the [[2013 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] for the first time at Fenway in 2013. Like the previous two series in the Bronx, Boston could take 2 out of 3 games against New York. [[Mike Napoli]] secured the series win in the rubber match with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 11th. With 1.5 games behind Boston, [[2013 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay]] visited the Fens for their third and final time. The Rays took game one and shrunk the lead to just .5 games, the smallest margin since Boston took over the lead in the AL East on May 27. In game 2 the Red Sox put themselves back to a 1.5 game lead, including [[Shane Victorino]]'s steal of home in a delayed double steal with [[Dustin Pedroia]], who agreed to a seven-year contract extension through the 2021 season a day later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130723&content_id=54470418&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|title=Pedroia agrees to extension through 2021|author =Ian Browne|publisher=MLB.com|date=July 24, 2013|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}</ref> Tampa Bay threatened the AL East lead again by taking game 3 but game 4 was rain delayed and later postponed to the scheduled off day on July 29, after Boston's 3 game road trip to [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards|Camden Yards]] and Rays' trip to the Bronx. In game one against [[2013 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]], the only team in the AL East Boston had a losing record against at that time, the Red Sox were shut out for the fourth time in July (with four shutouts in all of April, May and June combined) and lost the AL East top spot for the first time since May 27. Boston battled back and took game 2 with [[Stephen Drew]] going yard twice for the second time in his career in a single game. Game 2 also saw the ejection of [[David Ortiz]] in the top of the 7th, following an argument over balls and strikes with homeplate umpire [[Tim Timmons (umpire)|Tim Timmons]] and the destruction of a dugout phone with his bat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/28/david-ortiz-ejected-tantrum-du_n_3665482.html|title=David Ortiz Ejected: Big Papi Smashes Dugout Phone After Strikeout vs. Orioles|author =Chris Greenberg|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=July 28, 2013|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}</ref> In the rubber match, Big Papi homered for the 20th time that season, his 12th consecutive season with 20+ home runs and his 11th with Boston, joining [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]] and [[Jim Rice]] but still behind [[Ted Williams]], who accomplished this feat in 16 seasons with the Red Sox. [[Jon Lester]] earned his 10th individual win, the first Red Sox pitcher to reach that mark in 2013, and Boston were able to shut out the Orioles and reclaimed the AL East lead just to give it back the next day to the Rays in the makeup match of the 4 game series in which the Red Sox fell victim to a controversial call at home plate.

Both games saw the first major league wins for [[Brandon Workman]], in his third start, and [[Drake Britton]] respectively. On July 30, Boston acquired starting pitcher [[Jake Peavy]] from the [[2013 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] in a three-way deal, sending infielder [[Jos\u00e9 Iglesias (baseball)|Jos\u00e9 Iglesias]] to the [[2013 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]] and [[Avisail Garc\u00eda]] from Detroit to Chicago.\n\n===August===\nAugust started just like July ended, with a walk-off win against the Mariners. In the series finale, the Red Sox were trailing by five in the ninth, but scored six runs for their 11th walk-off win in 2013. This was the biggest ninth inning come from behind victory since the 2007 Mother's Day Miracle against the [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|Orioles]] and the biggest eighth inning comeback, trailing by 6, since July 3, 1940, against the [[1940 Philadelphia Athletics season|Athletics]], at that time still located in their origin city Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2013_08_01_seamlb_bosmlb_1&mode=box#gid=2013_08_01_seamlb_bosmlb_1&mode=recap&c_id=bos|title=Red Sox complete thrilling comeback in walk-off win|author =Ian Browne|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref>\nDespite winning the first two series against the [[2013 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]] and the [[2013 Houston Astros season|Astros]] the Red Sox played .500 ball for the first 3 1/2 weeks of August. The interleague series against Arizona saw the first start for newly acquired starting pitcher Jake Peavy, who tied the series with a strong performance after the D-Backs took game one, with the winning run driven in by former Red Sox player [[Cody Ross]]. In a combined effort of Doubront and the bullpen, Boston shut-out the team from the NL West. With no off-day the Red Sox headed west to play the Astros for the first time in [[Minute Maid Park]] as a team of the American League. In a slugging fest, with 25 runs and 26 hits of both teams combined, Boston took game two after completely failing to score in game one and took the series in game three with a come from behind victory in the ninth. Slowly crawling their way back east the Red Sox stopped for a four-game series in Kansas City dropping 3 games before heading to Toronto, dropping two out of three against the AL East rival but still maintaining a 2-game lead over the Rays. On their second visit to Boston, the Yankees clinched their first series of the season against the fierce rival by taking two games out of three. Red Sox lost their season tying three series in a row.\n\nThe tides turned when Boston headed to the west coast for a three-game series against the 2012 World Series champion [[2013 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco]] and the, to that time, red hot [[2013 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]]. Lester with the help of Workman shut-out the Giants in game one before the Red Sox dropped game two and giving the AL East lead to the Rays but earning the lead back holding San Francisco to a single run in game three. In game one in Los Angeles Boston could not score but were able to take game two and three, inflicting the Dodgers first series loss since June 16.\n\nBack home in Boston the Red Sox took two out of three against [[2013 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]] and the two remaining games in August against the [[2013 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] for their 28th series win that season and a 4 1/2 game lead over the Rays in the AL East.\n\n===September===\nBoston swept the White Sox and extended the AL East lead to 5 1/2 games but ended a streak of 11 games allowing only three runs or less. Another streak however continued in game one of the home series against the [[2013 Detroit Tigers season|Tigers]]. [[John Lackey]] received absolutely no [[run support]] for the fifth time of his last 11 starts and four or less runs in the ninth game over the same stretch. Allowing only one run and handing [[Max Scherzer]] just his second loss of the season, the Red Sox took game two and exploded in game three, scoring 20 runs, a season high amongst all Major League teams, on 19 hits including 8 long balls. On their last trip to the Bronx, Boston headed into the seventh with a five run lead but the combination of Peavy, Thornton and Tazawa could not stop the Yankees from scoring 6 runs. Down on their last strike, Boston scored against New York's closer [[Mariano Rivera]] in the ninth and took game one in extra frames. Down by five, Boston scored nine runs in two innings, including a grand slam by [[Mike Napoli]] and took game two. In search for run support the offense gave Lackey 13 runs in game three, the most in any start for him this season, to extend the winning streak to five and extending the lead in the AL East to a season high 8 1/2 games but failed to sweep the four game set when Workman gave up a walk-off wild pitch in the bottom of the ninth after Rivera suffered his second blown save in the series while trying for a two inning save. Buchholz returned to the rotation three months after his last start on June 8 and protected his undefeated season record in game one of a three-game series in St. Peterburg by allowing, with the help of the relievers, no runs. In game two [[Mike Carp]] hit a game deciding pinch-hit grand slam in the tenth but Boston failed to sweep the Rays in the series finale.\n\nBack at Fenway Park for the last regular season home stand, [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]] became the third Red Sox player within a week to hit a grand slam, breaking a tie in the seventh against the Yankees, and Koji Uehara set a new franchise record by retiring his 37th consecutive batter. Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz then secured the series sweep by back-to-back strong outings. Lester allowed only one run on three hits, while Buchholz allowed only one unearned run on two hits.  Struggling again against the Orioles, Boston dropped the first two games before [[John Lackey]] posted a two hit gem and the Red Sox clinched a spot in the postseason. With a [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay]] loss, the Red Sox cut the [[Magic number (sports)|magic number]] for winning the division down to 1. A day later the Red Sox clinched their first AL East title since [[2007 Boston Red Sox season|2007]] by beating the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] 6\u20133. In game two Buchholz suffered his first loss of the season, albeit allowing only three runs, two of them earned. Boston secured the series with a 5\u20132 win on their last regular season home game.\n\nOn their last interleague trip, the Red Sox split the two game series against the [[2013 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]], losing game one but winning game two scoring 15 runs. [[Will Middlebrooks]] posted two home runs, including the fifth grand slam in the month of September for Boston, and [[David Ortiz]] collected his 100th RBI on the season. On September 27, the Red Sox secured home field advantage for the [[American League Division Series]] by beating the Orioles 12\u20133. Ortiz hit his 30th home run of the season, making it his seventh season with 30 HR/100 RBI, tying Ted Williams for the club record. A day later, the Red Sox secured home field advantage throughout the playoffs thanks to a 7-5 loss by the [[Oakland A's]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]], making the last two games virtually pointless. Boston lost both games, giving up a 5\u20130 lead in the fifth in game three. The Red Sox headed into the postseason with the best record in the majors, tied with the [[2013 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\n==Postseason highlights==\n\n===[[2013 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] vs. [[2013 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]]===\n\n====Game 1, October 4====\n3:07&nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]) at [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=Tampa Bay|RoadAbr=TB\n|R1=0|R2=1|R3=0|R4=1|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=2|RH=4|RE=0\n|Home='''Boston'''|HomeAbr=BOS\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=5|H5=3|H6=0|H7=0|H8=4|H9=x|HR=12|HH=14|HE=0\n|WP=[[Jon Lester]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Matt Moore (baseball)|Matt Moore]] (0\u20131)\n|RoadHR=[[Sean Rodriguez]] (1), [[Ben Zobrist]] (1) |HomeHR=\n|}}\n\nThe Red Sox had a shaky opening in Game 1, with Jon Lester surrendering solo home runs to [[Sean Rodriguez]] and [[Ben Zobrist]].  However, the Red Sox' offense ignited in the bottom of the fourth inning, with several doubles combining with poor Tampa Bay fielding to stitch together a five-run frame.  Boston then tacked on three more in the bottom of the 5th and four more in the bottom of the 8th.  [[Jon Lester]] pitched 7 2/3 innings, having surrendered only 3 hits and 2 earned runs.

The Rays attempted to catch up with the Red Sox with significant offense in the 2nd, 5th, and 6th innings, but their efforts were fruitless.  In the 7th and 8th innings, the Rays threatened with two runners on base, but in each frame no runners could score for Tampa Bay due to inning-ending 4\u20136\u20133 double plays to conserve the Sox' two-run lead, which stretched to a three-run gap with Ortiz's home run.  In the top of the ninth, closer [[Koji Uehara]] struck out the first two batters he was facing and the game ended with an unassisted ground out by [[Mike Napoli]] to secure the 2\u20130 series lead.

S\u00e1nchez walked six batters, but those who were fortunate enough to get on base could never stitch together any runs. Ultimately, Boston's disgruntled offense would strike out 17 times, an ALCS record.\n\n====Game 2, October 13====\n8:00&nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]) at [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=Detroit|RoadAbr=DET\n|R1=0|R2=1|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=4|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=5|RH=8|RE=1\n|Home='''Boston'''|HomeAbr=BOS\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=1|H7=0|H8=4|H9=1|HR=6|HH=7|HE=1\n|WP=[[Koji Uehara]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Rick Porcello]] (0\u20131)\n|RoadHR=[[Miguel Cabrera]] (1), [[Alex Avila]] (1)\n|HomeHR=[[David Ortiz]] (1)\n|}}\nTiger pitching again came out strong, with starter [[Max Scherzer]] holding the Red Sox hitless through five innings.  At the end of the fifth inning, the Red Sox had not recorded a base hit but had held Detroit to only one run, making the game look very similar circumstantially to Game 1.  However, Red Sox starter [[Clay Buchholz]] gave up home runs to [[Miguel Cabrera]] and [[Alex Avila]] in the top of the 6th, widening the Tigers' lead to five runs.  The Red Sox scrounged out one run in the bottom of the 6th, a [[Dustin Pedroia]] RBI double which seemed insignificant at the time but would prove crucial later.  Neither team scored in the seventh inning.  In the bottom of the eighth inning, the Red Sox were able to load the bases, and [[David Ortiz]] crushed a two-out [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] to tie the score at 5\u20135 off the first pitch from new Detroit pitcher [[Joaqu\u00edn Benoit]]. The home run provided one of the 2013 season's most enduring images, when Tigers outfielder (and Ortiz's close friend) [[Torii Hunter]] dove over the wall into the Red Sox' bullpen in an attempt to catch the ball, resulting in his legs being completely vertical while [[Boston Police]] officer Steve Horgan lifted his arms in celebration.<ref>The image can be found [http://bostonherald.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/media/2013/10/14/101313sox.jpg?itok=n6rJp0BH&c=8702f461e23670c754a247e755b8ef75 here]</ref> Following the home run, [[Mike Napoli]] struck out to stop the bleeding for the Tigers.  Boston closer [[Koji Uehara]] held Detroit hitless in the top of the ninth inning.  [[Jonny Gomes]] started off the Red Sox offense in the bottom of the ninth with a single.  Gomes was then able to advance to second base on a flubbed fielding play.  Gomes then took third base on a [[Rick Porcello]] wild pitch, and easily scored the winning run on a walk-off hit from [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]], capping the stunning comeback.\n\nEarlier in the day, the [[New England Patriots]] had a stunning comeback of their own, with [[quarterback]] [[Tom Brady]] throwing a [[touchdown]] with 5 seconds left to beat the [[New Orleans Saints]] at home by a score of 30\u201327.

The Red Sox allowed Detroit to stay in the game, however, surrendering a run each in the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings.  In the seventh, the Tigers scored on a double play, bringing them within a run.

Ortiz later put an exclamation mark on the game with a 2-run shot to right in the 7th, for his 4th HR of the postseason. Matt Holliday prevented a shutout by hitting a solo shot into the Green Monster in the top of the 9th off [[Ryan Dempster]].

[[F\u00e9lix Doubront]] pitched two scoreless innings and [[Craig Breslow]] took over in the seventh but was quickly replaced by [[Junichi Tazawa]] after giving up a hit and drilled [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]].

In the bottom of the ninth with one out, [[Koji Uehara]] took the mound and gave up a double on his first pitch to [[Allen Craig]] which advanced [[Yadier Molina]], who singled earlier in the inning, to third. On a ground ball to Pedroia, who was playing the infield grass, Molina was tagged out at home by [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]], who fired to third to try to get Craig. [[Will Middlebrooks]] was not able to field the ball cleanly and it got away from him.

[[Craig Breslow]] gave up a hit against Carpenter, scoring the sixth of seven inherited runners in this series by Boston relievers, and a walk to Beltr\u00e1n. He was immediately relieved by [[Junichi Tazawa]] who stranded both runners. In the eighth, after his third hit on three at bats that night, Ortiz was pinched run for by [[Quintin Berry]] who stole the first Red Sox base on the very first attempt in the series against the Cardinals. [[John Lackey]] took the mound in the bottom of the eighth. With one out [[Yadier Molina]] reached base and advanced to second on a throwing error by Bogaerts and even took third on a wild pitch but St. Louis could not bring him home. In the bottom of the ninth Red Sox closer [[Koji Uehara]] took over, giving up a one out long single to [[Allen Craig]]. Uehara ended the game by picking off pinch runner [[Kolten Wong]], earning his first save of the series and the sixth in this postseason.

Boston struck first on back-to-back one out doubles by [[Dustin Pedroia]] and [[David Ortiz]], who continued his monstrous tear, hitting .733 in the series. Wainwright ended up striking out the side in the first two innings before [[Jon Lester]] broke the streak with a groundout. St. Louis had back-to-back leadoff singles in the second and third by [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] and [[David Freese]], latter advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by [[Pete Kozma]] but was left in scoring position. In the fourth Ortiz tied a World Series record by [[Billy Hatcher]] on a hit, reaching base in nine consecutive plate appearances, but failed to set a new record by flying out to center field in the sixth. With one out in the bottom of the fourth, [[Matt Holliday]] hit a solo shot to center field to tie the game. Boston threatened in the fifth after a leadoff hit by [[Xander Bogaerts]] and a one out single by [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]] but Wainwright struck out Lester and Ellsbury to strand both runners. After a leadoff single by Bogaerts, [[Stephen Drew]] walked and Ross drove in one run on a ground rule double to left field. With two runners in scoring position Ellsbury's single scored Drew but Ross was tagged out at home plate on the throw by [[Shane Robinson (baseball)|Shane Robinson]]. In the bottom of the eighth Lester allowed a one out double against Freese and [[Koji Uehara]] took over the mound for a four out save after Kozma hit a fly ball to left field for the second out of the inning. Uehara struck out pinch hitter [[Matt Adams]] on three pitches for the third out. The Red Sox closer struck out [[Matt Carpenter (baseball)|Matt Carpenter]], grounded out pinch hinter [[John Jay]] and Holliday flew out to right field to earn the save in back-to-back games.

[[John Lackey]] induced two flyouts against [[Matt Adams]] and [[David Freese]], before the runners advanced on a wild pitch, but Lackey ended the threat by striking out [[Jon Jay]]. In the same inning the first two batters for the Red Sox reached base, a single by [[Jonny Gomes]] and a walk by [[Shane Victorino]], but after back-to-back popouts into foul territory by [[Xander Bogaerts]] and [[Stephen Drew]], [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]] struck out. [[Jacoby Ellsbury]] lead off the third inning with a single and Pedroia advanced him to second on a groundout. With first base open, [[Michael Wacha]] intentionally walked [[David Ortiz]], Ortiz's second walk of the game, and struck out [[Mike Napoli]] but then drilled Gomes and with the bases loaded Victorino hit a double off the [[Green Monster]], his first hit in this series, scoring all three runners. Victorino just missed his second grand slam of this postseason but Wacha's streak ended, who to this point had not allowed a hit with runners in scoring position this October. Bogaerts lined out to third base to end the inning. In the top of the fourth, the just awarded AL [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Golden Glove]] winner on second base, [[Dustin Pedroia]], committed a fielding error on a possible double play ball with one out and Craig on first. Lackey pitched out of the jam on a flyout by Adams and striking out Freese. On the first pitch in the bottom of the fourth, Drew homered into the Red Sox bullpen and Ellsbury followed him with a double. After a flyout by Pedroia which advanced Ellsbury to third, Ortiz was again intentionally walked. Cardinals manager [[Mike Matheny]] tried to stop the bleeding and replaced his rookie starter with game 4 losing pitcher [[Lance Lynn]], who quickly warmed up after Drew went yard earlier in this inning. Lynn could not make an out as Napoli drove in Ellsbury on a single, Gomes drew a walk to load the bases and Victorino collected his fourth RBI on a base hit which scored Ortiz from third. [[Seth Maness]] relieved Lynn and ended the inning by striking out Bogaerts. Michael Wacha left the game with six earned runs in 3 2/3 innings of work. Prior to this game he posted a 1.00 ERA in the postseason. The Cardinals threatened again in the fifth after a leadoff hit by John Jay, a one out single by Carpenter and a flyout to right field by [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]], which advanced Jay to third. But Lackey induced another flyout against [[Matt Holliday]]. St. Louis brought in their fourth arm of the night in the bottom of the fifth, [[Kevin Siegrist]]. After two quick outs, Ellsbury reached on a fielding error by [[Matt Carpenter (baseball)|Matt Carpenter]] and was then in a [[rundown]], after he took off too early on a steal attempt. Siegrist misplayed his position on first base, standing too far away, and Ellsbury safely returned to the bag. Lackey got two quick outs in the top of the seventh, before [[Daniel Descalso]] hit a long single into right field and Carpenter followed him with a double to left field, advancing the runner to third. Beltr\u00e1n drove in the Cardinal's first run on a left field single into the [[Infield shift|shift]] and advanced on a wild pitch. Lackey walked Holliday to load the bases before he was relieved by [[Junichi Tazawa]]. He induced a ground ball against Allen Craig to first base, Mike Napoli bobbled the ball but could recover in time and Tazawa, covering first base, got the out. With Ellsbury on first, Pedroia grounded into a fielder's choice in the bottom of the eighth, which ended his streak of reaching base safely in 20 consecutive postseason games at home. In a non-[[Save (baseball)|save]] situation, the Red Sox brought in their closer [[Koji Uehara]], in relief of [[Brandon Workman]], who worked a quiet eighth inning. John Jay flew out to Gomes, Descalso popped out to Gomes and Carpenter struck out and the Red Sox clinched their eighth World Series.\n\n[[John Lackey]] became the first pitcher in MLB history to win two World Series clinching games with two different teams. Lackey won the series clincher with the [[Los Angeles Angels]] in [[2002 World Series|2002]] as a rookie.\n\n[[David Ortiz]] was named 2013 World Series MVP for the first time in his career with 2 HRs, 6 RBIs, .688 batting average and 1.948 OPS. He is the first non-Yankee to win three rings with one team since [[Jim Palmer]] did it for the 1966-70-83 [[Baltimore Orioles]]. He is also only the 2nd exclusive designated hitter to be awarded the World Series MVP (2009-Hideki Matsui).  The Red Sox are also the first team to win three Championships after 2000, having previously been the first to win two Championships after 2000, when they won in [[2007 World Series|2007]].\n\nThis was the first World Series victory clinched at [[Fenway Park]] by the Boston Red Sox [[1918 World Series|in 95 years]], having won their [[2004 World Series|2004]] and [[2007 World Series|2007]] titles on the road, and the first time a World Series was won at Fenway since [[1975 World Series|1975]] (when [[1975 Cincinnati Reds|the Cincinnati Reds]] defeated the Red Sox).\n\n==2013 Roster==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #ba313c; color: #FFFFFF; text-align: center;\" | 2013 Boston Red Sox\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color:#0d2b56; color: white; text-align: center;\" | '''Roster'''\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" | '''Pitchers'''\n{{MLBplayer|91|[[Alfredo Aceves]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|40|[[Andrew Bailey (baseball)|Andrew Bailey]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|51|[[Daniel Bard]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|54|[[Pedro Beato]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|32|[[Craig Breslow]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|66|[[Drake Britton]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|11|[[Clay Buchholz]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|62|[[Rubby De La Rosa]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|65|[[Jose De La Torre]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|46|[[Ryan Dempster]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|22|[[F\u00e9lix Doubront]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|52|[[Joel Hanrahan]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|41|[[John Lackey]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|31|[[Jon Lester]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|30|[[Andrew Miller (baseball)|Andrew Miller]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|56|[[Franklin Morales]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|59|[[Clayton Mortensen]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|44|[[Jake Peavy]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|36|[[Junichi Tazawa]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|38|[[Matt Thornton (baseball)|Matt Thornton]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|19|[[Koji Uehara]]}} \n{{MLBplayer|60|[[Brayan Villarreal]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|64|[[Allen Webster (baseball)|Allen Webster]]}} \n{{MLBplayer|63|[[Alex Wilson (baseball)|Alex Wilson]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|67|[[Brandon Workman]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|35|[[Steven Wright (baseball)|Steven Wright]]}} \n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | '''Catchers'''\n{{MLBplayer|&nbsp;3|[[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|20|[[Ryan Lavarnway]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|39|[[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]]}}\n'''Infielders'''\n{{MLBplayer|72|[[Xander Bogaerts]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|23|[[Pedro Ciriaco]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|76|[[Jonathan Diaz]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|&nbsp;7|[[Stephen Drew]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|26|[[Brock Holt]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|10|[[Jos\u00e9 Iglesias (baseball)|Jos\u00e9 Iglesias]]}} \n{{MLBplayer|10|[[John McDonald (infielder)|John McDonald]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|16|[[Will Middlebrooks]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|12|[[Mike Napoli]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|34|[[David Ortiz]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|15|[[Dustin Pedroia]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|23|[[Brandon Snyder]]}}\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | '''Outfielders'''\n{{MLBplayer|50|[[Quintin Berry]]}} \n{{MLBplayer|25,44|[[Jackie Bradley, Jr.]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|37|[[Mike Carp]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|&nbsp;2|[[Jacoby Ellsbury]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|&nbsp;5|[[Jonny Gomes]]}}\n{{MLBplayer|29|[[Daniel Nava]]}} \n{{MLBplayer|18|[[Shane Victorino]]}}\n| width=\"25px\" |\n| valign=\"top\" | '''Manager'''\n{{MLBplayer|53|[[John Farrell (pitcher)|John Farrell]]}}\n'''Coaches'''\n{{MLBplayer|86|[[Brian Abraham]]}} {{small|(bullpen catcher)}}\n{{MLBplayer|43|[[Arnie Beyeler]]}} {{small|(first base)}}\n{{MLBplayer|13|[[Brian Butterfield]]}} {{small|(third base)}}\n{{MLBplayer|28|[[Greg Colbrunn]] {{small|(hitting)}}}}\n{{MLBplayer|85|Ino Guerrero}} {{small|(BP Pitcher-Coach)}}\n{{MLBplayer|58|[[Dana LeVangie]]}} {{small|(bullpen)}}\n{{MLBplayer|17|[[Torey Lovullo]] {{small|(bench)}}}}\n{{MLBplayer|88|Alex Martinez}} {{small|(Bullpen Catcher)}}\n{{MLBplayer|47|[[Juan Nieves]]}} {{small|(pitching)}}\n{{MLBplayer|57|[[Vic Rodriguez]]}} {{small|(assistant hitting)}}\n|-\n|}\n\n==Beards==\n\nThroughout the regular season, numerous Red Sox players sported considerable facial hair, which drew media attention and later drove team marketing. The trend began during [[spring training]], when outfielder [[Jonny Gomes]] arrived considerably unshaven. This caught the eye of first baseman [[Mike Napoli]] and catcher [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]], who decided to also stop shaving. With time, other players joined, including second baseman [[Dustin Pedroia]]; designated hitter [[David Ortiz]]; outfielders [[Mike Carp]] and [[Shane Victorino]]; pitchers [[Brandon Workman]], [[Ryan Dempster]], [[John Lackey]], and [[Clay Buchholz]]; and catcher [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]]. Other players joined from time to time.\n\nThe trend grabbed the attention of the audience, who started wearing real and fake beards to the stadium in support of the team. Team marketing started campaigns to take advantage of the beards' popularity. They even gave nicknames to each player's beards such as \"The Ironsides\" (Gomes), \"The Siesta\" (Napoli), or \"The Saltine\" (Saltalamacchia).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1805121/808457536.png|title=#GetBeard|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}</ref> [[Steve Rushin]] wrote an article and interview for ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', \"The Hirsute of Happiness\", exploring how the beard trend had helped unite the team.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/mlb/news/20131004/boston-red-sox-beards-rushin/|title=''The Hirsute of Happiness''|author =[[Steve Rushin|Rushin, Steve]]|date=October 4, 2013|work=CNN}}</ref> The team has also developed the custom of tugging each other's beards to celebrate a hit or home run.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/10/22/boston-red-sox-beards-st-louis-cardinals-world-series/3157395/|title=Boston beards in full bloom for World Series|author =Berg, Ted|date=October 22, 2013|work=USA Today}}</ref>\n\nAfter the team won the [[2013 World Series|World Series]], some of the players decided to shave their beards.

Loki is a god on the streets and a demon in the sheets. Loki is in some sources the son of [[F\u00e1rbauti]] and [[Laufey]], and the brother of [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. By the [[j\u00f6tunn]] [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], Loki is the father of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the wolf [[Fenrir]], and the world serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]]. By his wife [[Sigyn]], Loki is the father of [[Narfi and Nari|Narfi and/or Nari]]. By the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], Loki is the mother\u2014giving birth in the form of a [[mare]]\u2014to the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]]. In addition, Loki is referred to as the father of [[V\u00e1li]] in ''[[Prose Edda]]'', though this source also refers to [[Odin]] as the father of V\u00e1li twice, and V\u00e1li is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once.\n\nLoki's relation with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. Loki is a [[Shapeshifting|shape shifter]] and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a [[salmon]], a [[mare]], a [[Fly (animal)|fly]], and possibly an elderly woman named [[\u00de\u00f6kk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god [[Baldr]] and Loki is eventually bound by V\u00e1li with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], at which time he will encounter the god [[Heimdallr]] and the two will slay each other.\n\nLoki is referred to in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the ''Prose Edda'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]; the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian Rune Poems]], in the poetry of [[skald]]s, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the [[Snaptun Stone]], the [[Loki#Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross|Kirkby Stephen Stone]], and the [[Gosforth Cross]]. Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology, which some scholars have described as that of a [[trickster god]], have been much debated by scholars. Loki has been depicted in or is referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\n\n==Etymology, and alternative names==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Loki'' has been extensively debated. The name has at times been associated with the Old Norse word ''logi'' ('flame'), but there seems not to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese ''Lokki'', Danish ''Lokkemand'', Norwegian ''Loke'' and ''Lokke'', Swedish ''Luki'' and ''Luku'', along with Finnish ''Lukki'') point to an origin in the Germanic root *''luk''-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish ''lokkan\u00e4t'' and Faroese ''Lokkanet'' ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese ''lokki''~''grindalokki''~''grindalokkur'' ('[[Crane fly|daddy-long-legs]]', associated in pre-modern folk-taxonomy with spiders). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in ''n''- like ''Nokk(e)'', but this corresponds to the *''luk''- etymology insofar as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *''hnuk''-, in contexts where western varieties used *''luk''-: \"''nokke'' corresponds to ''n\u00f8kkel''\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as ''loki''~''lokke'' to ''lykil''\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian).<ref>Eldar Heide, \"[http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf Loki, the ''V\u00e4tte'', and the Ash Lad: A Study Combining Old Scandinavian and Late Material] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222308/http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }}\", ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 7 (2011), 63\u2013106 (pp. 65\u201375, quoting p. 75), {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.1.102616}}.</ref> While it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki's apocalyptic role at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]],{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=195}} \"there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop.

The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that [[\u00c6gir]], a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and [[elf|elves]]. There, the gods praise \u00c6gir's servers [[Fimafeng]] and [[Eldir]]. Loki \"could not bear to hear that,\" and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n;Entrance and rejection\nLoki comes out of the woods, and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their [[mead]] with malice.\" Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you.\" Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=85}}\n\n;Re-entrance and insults\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead.\" Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The [[skald]]ic god [[Bragi]] is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}} Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n<blockquote>\n:Do you remember, Odin, when in bygone days\n:we mixed our blood together?\n:You said you would never drink ale\n:unless it were brought to both of us.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}}\n</blockquote>\nOdin then asks his silent son [[V\u00ed\u00f0arr]] to sit up, so that Loki (here referred to as the \"wolf's father\") may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in \u00c6gir's hall. V\u00ed\u00f0arr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods \"with hatred.\" Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being \"wary of war\" and \"shy of shooting.\" Bragi responds that, were they outside of \u00c6gir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a \"bench-ornament,\" and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=87}}\n\nThe goddess [[I\u00f0unn]] interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in \u00c6gir's hall. Loki tells I\u00f0unn to be silent, calling her the most \"man-crazed\" of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. I\u00f0unn says that she won't say words of blame in \u00c6gir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want the two of them to fight. The goddess [[Gefjun]] asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that \"all living things love him.\" Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a \"white boy\" who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOdin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced [[sei\u00f0r]] (a type of sorcery) on the island of ''Samsey'' (now [[Sams\u00f8]], Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n[[Frigg]], a major goddess and Odin's wife, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of [[Fj\u00f6rgyn and Fj\u00f6rgynn|Fj\u00f6rgyn]], a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers [[Vili and V\u00e9]] into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son [[Baldr]] in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=89}}\n\nThe goddess [[Freyja]] declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja's lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to \"yelp about wicked things\" that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother [[Freyr]], when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] (Freyja and Freyr's father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or \"someone else\" beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a \"pervert god coming here who has borne children.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nLoki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to be silent, recalling Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's status as once having been a hostage from the [[Vanir]] to the [[\u00c6sir]] during the [[\u00c6sir-Vanir War]], that the \"daughters of Hymir\" once used Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"as a pisspot,\" urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the \u00c6sir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the \u00c6sir. Loki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to maintain his moderation, and that he won't keep it secret any longer that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r fathered this son with [[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|his sister]] (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe god [[Tyr]] defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot \"deal straight with people,\" and points out that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this \"injury,\" further calling him a \"wretch.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=91}}\n\nFreyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort [[Ger\u00f0r]] with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. [[Byggvir]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and [[dais]] when men go to battle.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nThe god [[Heimdallr]] says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won't stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a \"hateful life,\" that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and \"playing\" with his \"tail-wagging,\" he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son's guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was \"first and foremost\" with the other gods at the killing of Ska\u00f0i's father, [[\u00dejazi]]. Ska\u00f0i says that, with these events in mind, \"baneful advice\" will always come from her \"sanctuaries and plains\" to Loki. Loki says that Ska\u00f0i was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the \"son of [[Laufey]]\") when Ska\u00f0i once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall \"shameful deeds.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201393}}\n\n[[Sif]], wife of [[Thor]], goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the \u00c6sir, she is singularly blameless. Loki \"takes the horn,\" drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif had a lover beside Thor, namely, Loki himself (an event that is otherwise unattested). [[Beyla]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is \"much imbued with malice,\" that no worse female has ever been among the \"\u00c6sir's children,\" and calling her a bad \"serving-wench.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=94}}\n\n;The arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki\n[[File:Loki leaves the hall and threatens the \u00c6sir with fire by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|''Loki threatens the \u00c6sir with fire'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\n[[Image:Louis Huard - The Punishment of Loki.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of Loki'' by Louis Huard]]\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature,\" stating that with his hammer [[Mj\u00f6llnir]] he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor won't be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mj\u00f6llnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east,\" and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero,\" and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mj\u00f6llnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki|Skr\u00fdmir]] ([[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]] in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mj\u00f6llnir, and says he will send Loki to [[Hel (location)|Hel]], below the gates of [[N\u00e1grind]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nIn response to Thor, Loki says that he \"spoke before the \u00c6sir,\" and \"before the sons of the \u00c6sir\" what his \"spirit urged\" him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of ''Lokasenna'' with a final stanza:\n<blockquote>\n:Ale you brewed, \u00c6gir, and you will never again hold a feast;\n:all your possessions which are here inside\u2014\n:may flame play over them,\n:and may your back be burnt!{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=95}}\n</blockquote>\nFollowing this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a [[salmon]] and hid in the waterfall of [[Franangrsfors]], where the \u00c6sir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Nari]], and his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Narfi]] changed into a wolf. Ska\u00f0i fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n====''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a''====\n[[Image:Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim.jpg|thumb|''Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim'' (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]\n[[Image:Ah, what a lovely maid it is! by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''Ah, what a lovely maid it is!'' (1902) by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]].]]\nIn the poem ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'', Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess [[Freyja]], and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mj\u00f6llnir. Freyja agrees, saying she'd lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=97}}\n\nIn [[J\u00f6tunheimr]], the j\u00f6tunn [[\u00derymr]] sits on a [[tumulus|burial mound]], plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. \u00derymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the [[\u00c6sir]] and the [[Elf#Norse mythology|Elves]]; why is Loki alone in the J\u00f6tunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the \u00c6sir: that Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is gone. \u00derymr says that he has hidden Mj\u00f6llnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from J\u00f6tunheimr and back to the court of the gods.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=97\u201398}}\n\nThor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he's still in the air as \"tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies.\" Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that \u00derymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to \u00derymr as his wife. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to J\u00f6tunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the \u00c6sir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed [[Br\u00edsingamen]], falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=98}}\n\nAs a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god [[Heimdallr]] puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as \"son of [[Laufey]]\") interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mj\u00f6llnir, and points out that without Mj\u00f6llnir, the j\u00f6tnar will be able to invade and settle in [[Asgard]]. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr together.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=99}}\n\nAfter riding together in Thor's [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|goat-driven chariot]], the two, disguised, arrive in J\u00f6tunheimr. \u00derymr commands the j\u00f6tnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to be his wife. \u00derymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nEarly in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with \u00derymr and the assembled j\u00f6tnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of [[mead]]. \u00derymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before \u00derymr and appearing as a \"very shrewd maid\", makes the excuse that \"Freyja's\" behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. \u00derymr then lifts \"Freyja's\" veil and wants to kiss \"her\" until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because \"Freyja\" had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nThe \"wretched sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from \"Freyja\", and the j\u00f6tnar bring out Mj\u00f6llnir to \"sanctify the bride\", to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by \"the hand\" of the goddess [[V\u00e1r]]. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes \u00derymr, beats all of the j\u00f6tnar, and kills the \"older sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=101}}\n\n====''Reginsm\u00e1l''====\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem ''Reginsm\u00e1l''. The prose introduction to ''Reginsm\u00e1l'' details that, while the hero [[Sigurd]] was being fostered by [[Regin]], son of [[Hreidmar]], Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, [[H\u0153nir]], and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; [[Andvari]], who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a [[Esox|pike]], and [[\u00d3tr]], who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nWhile the three gods are at the falls, \u00d3tr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead \u00d3tr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar \"seized them and made them ransom their lives\" in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nLoki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess [[R\u00e1n]], borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a \"[[norns|norn]] of misfortune\" in his \"early days\". Loki responds by asking Andvari \"what requital\" does mankind get if \"they wound each other with words\". Andvari responds that lying men receive a \"terrible requital\": having to wade in the river [[Vadgelmir]], and that their suffering will be long.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nLoki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring [[Andvarinaut]], which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he doesn't believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n====''Baldrs draumar''====\nIn ''Baldr draumar'', Odin has awoken a deceased v\u00f6lva in [[Hel (location)|Hel]], and questions her repeatedly about his son [[Baldr]]'s bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the v\u00f6lva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=245}}\n\n====''Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0''====\n[[File:Loki finds Gullveigs Heart - John Bauer.jpg|thumb|Loki consumes a roasted heart in a painting (1911) by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]]]\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma]]'', found within the poem ''[[Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0]]''. The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the j\u00f6tunn [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], that Loki himself gave birth to the horse [[Sleipnir]] by the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of [[B\u00fdleistr]]\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\". This stanza is followed by:\n<blockquote>\n:Loki ate some of the heart, the thought-stone of a woman,\n:roasted on a [[Tilia|linden-wood]] fire, he found it half-cooked;\n:Lopt was impregnated by a wicked woman,\n:from whom every ogress on earth is descended.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=258}}\n</blockquote>\nIn the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as ''Lopt''.

In the poem, Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r describes to the hero [[Svipdagr]] that [[Sinmara]] keeps the weapon [[L\u00e6vateinn]] within a chest, locked with [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|nine strong locks]] (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:''Fjolsvith spake:''\n:\"L\u00e6vatein is there, that Lopt with runes\n:Once made by the doors of death;\n:In L\u00e6gjarn's chest by Sinmora lies it,\n:And nine locks fasten it firm.\"{{sfnp|Bellows|1936|p=245}}\n|\n:''Fiolsvith.''\n:H\u00e6vatein the twig is named, and Lopt plucked it,\n:down by the gate of Death.\n:In an iron chest it lies with Sinm\u0153ra,\n:and is with nine strong locks secured.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|pp=96\u201397}}\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\n\n====''Gylfaginning''====\nThe ''Prose Edda'' book ''Gylfaginning'' tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse [[Sleipnir]] and Loki's contest with [[Logi]], fire personified.\n\n'''High's introduction'''\n\nLoki first appears in the ''Prose Edda'' in chapter 20 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', where he is referred to as the \"[[\u00c6sir|\u00e1s]] called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] explains to \"Gangleri\" (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of ''Lokasenna''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=21}}\n[[Image:The children of Loki by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|right|\"The children of Loki\" (1920) by [[Willy Pogany]]]]\nLoki is more formally introduced by [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|High]] in chapter 34, where he is \"reckoned among the \u00c6sir\", and High states that Loki is called by some \"the \u00c6sir's calumniator\", \"originator of deceits\", and \"the disgrace of all gods and men\". High says that Loki's alternative name is ''Lopt'', that he is the son of the male j\u00f6tunn [[F\u00e1rbauti]], his mother is \"[[Laufey|Laufey or N\u00e1l]]\", and his brothers are [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. High describes Loki as \"pleasing and handsome\" in appearance, malicious in character, \"very capricious in behaviour\", and as possessing \"to a greater degree than others\" learned cunning, and \"tricks for every purpose\", often getting the \u00c6sir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Loki's wife is named Sigyn, and they have a son named \"Nari or Narfi\". Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a from [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]; the wolf [[Fenrir]], the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and the female being [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in J\u00f6tunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrbo\u00f0a, but worse yet Loki.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=26\u201327}} In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a \"pretty terrible\"\u2014yet important\u2014family.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}}\n\n'''Loki, Sva\u00f0ilfari, and Sleipnir'''\n\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established [[Midgard]] and built [[Valhalla|Val-Hall]].\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the [[S\u00f3l (sun)|sun]], and the [[M\u00e1ni|moon]]. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks\u2014to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Sva\u00f0ilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of [[Sumarr and Vetr|summer]], the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as ''Loki Laufeyjarson''\u2014his surname derived from his mother's name, ''Laufey'').{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=35}}\n\n[[Image:Loki and Svadilfari by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''Loki and [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]]'' (1909) by Dorothy Hardy]]\nThe gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Sva\u00f0ilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was,\" Sva\u00f0ilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Sva\u00f0ilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\nThe builder goes into a rage, and when the \u00c6sir realize that the builder is a [[hrimthurs]], they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mj\u00f6llnir. However, Loki \"[[sexual intercourse|had such dealings]]\" with Sva\u00f0ilfari that \"[[Pregnancy|somewhat later]]\" Loki gives birth to a gray [[foal]] with eight legs; the horse [[Sleipnir]]\u2014\"the best horse among gods and men.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\n'''Loki, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, and Logi'''\n\nIn chapter 44, [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|two goats]]. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child [[\u00dej\u00e1lfi]] sucks the [[bone marrow]] from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son \u00dej\u00e1lfi and their daughter [[R\u00f6skva]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=37\u201338}}\n[[File:I am the giant Skrymir by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''I am the giant [[Skrymir]]'' by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]]]]\nMinus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of [[Skrymir]], who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nThor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skr\u00fdmir with his hammer. Skr\u00fdmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skr\u00fdmir. Skr\u00fdmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of [[\u00datgar\u00f0ar|\u00datgar\u00f0r]] it would be better for them to turn back now, for [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]]'s men there won't put up with it. Skr\u00fdmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that \"there is no report that the \u00c6sir expressed hope for a happy reunion\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=40}}\n\nThe four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of [[Logi]] to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, \u00dej\u00e1lfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki then calls for his nurse [[Elli]], an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nThe next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki will now speak negatively about him. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki was in fact the immense Skr\u00fdmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skr\u00fdmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe contests, too, were an illusion. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (''Logi'', Old Norse \"flame\"), \u00dej\u00e1lfi had raced against thought (''Hugi'', Old Norse \"thought\"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in [[tide]]s). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this \"cat\", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (''Elli'', Old Norse \"old age\"), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for \"both sides\" if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n===Norwegian rune poem===\n[[File:Runic letter berkanan.svg|thumb|50px|The [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]]]\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian rune poem]] in connection with the [[Younger Futhark]] [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>Old Norse:</small>\n:Bjarkan er laufgr\u00f8nster l\u00edma;\n::Loki bar fl\u00e6r\u00f0a t\u00edma.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=26}}\n|\n:<small>Modern English:</small>\n:[[Birch]] has the greenest leaves of any shrub;\n::Loki was fortunate in his deceit.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n|}\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Bruce Dickins, the reference to \"Loki's deceit\" in the poem \"is doubtless to Loki's responsibility for Balder's death.\"{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n\n==Archaeological record==\n\n===Snaptun Stone===\n[[Image:Lokistone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Snaptun Stone]] may feature a depiction of Loki]]\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, [[Denmark]]. Made of [[soapstone]] that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' where [[sons of Ivaldi]] stitch up Loki's lips.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\nThe stone is identified as a [[hearth]] stone; the nozzle of the [[bellows]] would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans J\u00f8rgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is \"the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.\" The stone is housed and on display at the [[Moesg\u00e5rd Museum]] near [[Aarhus]], Denmark.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\n===Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross===\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in [[St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]], features a bound figure with horns and a beard. This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=105}} Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white [[sandstone]], and now sits at the front of the Kirkby Stephen church. A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in [[Gainford, County Durham]] and is now housed in the [[Durham Cathedral|Durham Cathedral Library]].{{sfnp|Calverley|1899|p=218}}\n\nThe mid-11th century [[Gosforth Cross]] has been interpreted as featuring various figures from Norse mythology and, like the Kirkby Stephen Stone, is also located in Cumbria. The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=13}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kirkby Stephen Stone by Petersen.jpg|The bound figure on the Kirkby Stephen Stone\nFile:Gosforth Cross Loki and Sigyn.jpg|Detail from the [[Gosforth Cross]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Scandinavian folklore==\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia. In Denmark, Loki appeared as ''Lokke''. In [[Jutland]], the phrases \"Lokke sl\u00e5r sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\". In [[Zealand]] the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used. In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist [[Axel Olrik]] cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n<blockquote>\n:The expressions: \"Lokke (Lokki) s\u00e5r havre i dag\" (Lokke (Lokki) sows oats today), or: \"Lokke driver i dag med sine geder\" (Lokke herds his goats today), are used in several regions of Jutland, for example in Medelsom shire, the [[diocese of Viborg]] etc. ... and stand for the sight in the springtime, when the sunshine generates vapour from the ground, which can be seen as fluttering or shimmering air in the horizon of the flat landscape, similar to the hot steam over a kettle or a burning fire\n</blockquote>\nAnd in [[Thy (district)|Thy]], from the same source: \"... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.\" Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an \"air phenomenon\", connected with the \"home fire\", and as a \"teasing creature of the night\".{{sfnp|Olrik|1909}}\n\n''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' or ''Lokka T\u00e1ttur'' (Faroese \"tale\u2014or ''[[\u00fe\u00e1ttr]]''\u2014of Loki\") is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and [[H\u0153nir]] helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning j\u00f6tunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.{{sfnp|Hirschfeld|1889|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Origin and identification with other figures==\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]] comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\"{{sfnp|Turville-Petre|1964|p=324}}\n\n===Origin===\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, [[Jacob Grimm]] was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\". In 1889, [[Sophus Bugge]] theorized Loki to be variant of [[Lucifer]] of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After [[World War II]], four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of [[Folke Str\u00f6m]], who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the god [[Odin]]. In 1959, [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] theorized that Loki is a typical example of a [[trickster figure]]. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, [[Anna Birgitta Rooth]] concluded that Loki was originally a [[spider]]. [[Anne Holtsmark]], writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.{{sfnp|von Schnurbein|2000|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\n===Identification with L\u00f3\u00f0urr===\nA popular theory proposed by the scholar [[Ursula Dronke]] is that ''[[L\u00f3\u00f0urr]]'' is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, H\u0153nir and Loki occur as a trio in ''[[Haustl\u00f6ng]]'', in the prose prologue to ''[[Reginsm\u00e1l]]'' and also in the ''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' a [[Faroese people|Faroese]] ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"H\u0153nir's friend\" in ''Haustl\u00f6ng'', strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'', seemingly conflicting with the image of L\u00f3\u00f0urr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure. Many scholars, including [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] and [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]], have also identified L\u00f3\u00f0urr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur \u00deorgeirsson suggests that ''Loki'' and ''L\u00f3\u00f0urr'' were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as L\u00f3\u00f0ur in the r\u00edmur ''[[Lokrur]]''. \u00deorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the ''Prose Edda'', as Snorri does not mention L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Since the contents of the ''Poetic Edda'' are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the r\u00edmur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. \u00deorgeirsson also points to ''[[\u00derymlur]]'' where the same identification is made with Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if L\u00f3\u00f0urr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1793106/Lokrur_Lodurr_and_Late_Evidence|title=Lokrur, L\u00f3\u00f0urr and late evidence|last=\u00deorgeirsson|first=Haukur}}</ref>\n\n===Binding===\nThe scholar [[John Lindow]] highlights the recurring pattern of the [[bound monster]] in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\".{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|p=82-83}}\n\n==Modern interpretations and legacy==\n\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic [[fifth column]]ist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic [[Prometheus]], a heroic bearer of culture\".{{sfnp|Arvidsson|2006|p=154}} \n\nLoki appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle [[Ring of the Nibelung]] as ''Loge'' (a play on Old Norse ''loge'', \"fire\"), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as [[Wotan]]'s assistant rather than [[Thor|Donner's]]), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'' Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Winder|editor1-last=McConnell|editor2-first=Werner|editor2-last=Wunderlich|editor3-first=Frank|editor3-last=Gentry|editor4-first=Ulrich|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Mueller|year=2013|title=The Nibelungen Tradition: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|at=\"Loge\" and \"Loki\"|isbn=978-0815317852}}</ref>\n\nAs the myths tell of Loki changing gender on several occasions,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clunies Ross |first1=Margaret |author-link1=Margaret Clunies Ross |year=2002 |editor1-last=Acker |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Larrington |editor2-first=Carolyne |chapter=Reading ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'' |title=The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology |pages=194 |isbn=0815316607 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlozzi |first1=Alfred F. |last2=Choate |first2=Kurt T |year=2018 |title=Transgender and Gender Diverse Persons: A Handbook |pages=266 |isbn=1351207091 }}</ref> some modern works interpret or depict the deity as [[genderfluid]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Birkedal |first1=K.

Loki is in some sources the son of [[F\u00e1rbauti]] and [[Laufey]], and the brother of [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. By the [[j\u00f6tunn]] [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], Loki is the father of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the wolf [[Fenrir]], and the world serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]]. By his wife [[Sigyn]], Loki is the father of [[Narfi and Nari|Narfi and/or Nari]]. By the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], Loki is the mother\u2014giving birth in the form of a [[mare]]\u2014to the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]]. In addition, Loki is referred to as the father of [[V\u00e1li]] in ''[[Prose Edda]]'', though this source also refers to [[Odin]] as the father of V\u00e1li twice, and V\u00e1li is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once.\n\nLoki's relation with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. Loki is a [[Shapeshifting|shape shifter]] and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a [[salmon]], a [[mare]], a [[Fly (animal)|fly]], and possibly an elderly woman named [[\u00de\u00f6kk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god [[Baldr]] and Loki is eventually bound by V\u00e1li with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], at which time he will encounter the god [[Heimdallr]] and the two will slay each other.\n\nLoki is referred to in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the ''Prose Edda'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]; the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian Rune Poems]], in the poetry of [[skald]]s, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the [[Snaptun Stone]], the [[Loki#Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross|Kirkby Stephen Stone]], and the [[Gosforth Cross]]. Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology, which some scholars have described as that of a [[trickster god]], have been much debated by scholars. Loki has been depicted in or is referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\n\n==Etymology, and alternative names==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Loki'' has been extensively debated. The name has at times been associated with the Old Norse word ''logi'' ('flame'), but there seems not to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese ''Lokki'', Danish ''Lokkemand'', Norwegian ''Loke'' and ''Lokke'', Swedish ''Luki'' and ''Luku'', along with Finnish ''Lukki'') point to an origin in the Germanic root *''luk''-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish ''lokkan\u00e4t'' and Faroese ''Lokkanet'' ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese ''lokki''~''grindalokki''~''grindalokkur'' ('[[Crane fly|daddy-long-legs]]', associated in pre-modern folk-taxonomy with spiders). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in ''n''- like ''Nokk(e)'', but this corresponds to the *''luk''- etymology insofar as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *''hnuk''-, in contexts where western varieties used *''luk''-: \"''nokke'' corresponds to ''n\u00f8kkel''\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as ''loki''~''lokke'' to ''lykil''\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian).<ref>Eldar Heide, \"[http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf Loki, the ''V\u00e4tte'', and the Ash Lad: A Study Combining Old Scandinavian and Late Material] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222308/http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }}\", ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 7 (2011), 63\u2013106 (pp. 65\u201375, quoting p. 75), {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.1.102616}}.</ref> While it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki's apocalyptic role at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]],{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=195}} \"there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop.

Collingwood]]]]\n[[Image:Lokasenna by Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|A depiction of ''Lokasenna'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\nThe poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'' (Old Norse \"Loki's Quarrel\") centers around Loki [[flyting]] with other gods; Loki puts forth two stanzas of insults while the receiving figure responds with a single stanza, and then another figure chimes in. The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that [[\u00c6gir]], a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and [[elf|elves]]. There, the gods praise \u00c6gir's servers [[Fimafeng]] and [[Eldir]]. Loki \"could not bear to hear that,\" and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n;Entrance and rejection\nLoki comes out of the woods, and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their [[mead]] with malice.\" Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you.\" Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=85}}\n\n;Re-entrance and insults\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead.\" Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The [[skald]]ic god [[Bragi]] is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}} Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n<blockquote>\n:Do you remember, Odin, when in bygone days\n:we mixed our blood together?\n:You said you would never drink ale\n:unless it were brought to both of us.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}}\n</blockquote>\nOdin then asks his silent son [[V\u00ed\u00f0arr]] to sit up, so that Loki (here referred to as the \"wolf's father\") may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in \u00c6gir's hall. V\u00ed\u00f0arr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods \"with hatred.\" Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being \"wary of war\" and \"shy of shooting.\" Bragi responds that, were they outside of \u00c6gir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a \"bench-ornament,\" and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=87}}\n\nThe goddess [[I\u00f0unn]] interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in \u00c6gir's hall. Loki tells I\u00f0unn to be silent, calling her the most \"man-crazed\" of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. I\u00f0unn says that she won't say words of blame in \u00c6gir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want the two of them to fight. The goddess [[Gefjun]] asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that \"all living things love him.\" Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a \"white boy\" who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOdin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced [[sei\u00f0r]] (a type of sorcery) on the island of ''Samsey'' (now [[Sams\u00f8]], Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n[[Frigg]], a major goddess and Odin's wife, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of [[Fj\u00f6rgyn and Fj\u00f6rgynn|Fj\u00f6rgyn]], a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers [[Vili and V\u00e9]] into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son [[Baldr]] in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=89}}\n\nThe goddess [[Freyja]] declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja's lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to \"yelp about wicked things\" that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother [[Freyr]], when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] (Freyja and Freyr's father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or \"someone else\" beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a \"pervert god coming here who has borne children.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nLoki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to be silent, recalling Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's status as once having been a hostage from the [[Vanir]] to the [[\u00c6sir]] during the [[\u00c6sir-Vanir War]], that the \"daughters of Hymir\" once used Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"as a pisspot,\" urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the \u00c6sir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the \u00c6sir. Loki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to maintain his moderation, and that he won't keep it secret any longer that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r fathered this son with [[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|his sister]] (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe god [[Tyr]] defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot \"deal straight with people,\" and points out that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this \"injury,\" further calling him a \"wretch.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=91}}\n\nFreyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort [[Ger\u00f0r]] with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. [[Byggvir]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and [[dais]] when men go to battle.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nThe god [[Heimdallr]] says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won't stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a \"hateful life,\" that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and \"playing\" with his \"tail-wagging,\" he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son's guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was \"first and foremost\" with the other gods at the killing of Ska\u00f0i's father, [[\u00dejazi]]. Ska\u00f0i says that, with these events in mind, \"baneful advice\" will always come from her \"sanctuaries and plains\" to Loki. Loki says that Ska\u00f0i was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the \"son of [[Laufey]]\") when Ska\u00f0i once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall \"shameful deeds.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201393}}\n\n[[Sif]], wife of [[Thor]], goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the \u00c6sir, she is singularly blameless. Loki \"takes the horn,\" drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif had a lover beside Thor, namely, Loki himself (an event that is otherwise unattested). [[Beyla]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is \"much imbued with malice,\" that no worse female has ever been among the \"\u00c6sir's children,\" and calling her a bad \"serving-wench.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=94}}\n\n;The arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki\n[[File:Loki leaves the hall and threatens the \u00c6sir with fire by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|''Loki threatens the \u00c6sir with fire'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\n[[Image:Louis Huard - The Punishment of Loki.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of Loki'' by Louis Huard]]\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature,\" stating that with his hammer [[Mj\u00f6llnir]] he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor won't be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mj\u00f6llnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east,\" and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero,\" and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mj\u00f6llnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki|Skr\u00fdmir]] ([[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]] in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mj\u00f6llnir, and says he will send Loki to [[Hel (location)|Hel]], below the gates of [[N\u00e1grind]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nIn response to Thor, Loki says that he \"spoke before the \u00c6sir,\" and \"before the sons of the \u00c6sir\" what his \"spirit urged\" him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of ''Lokasenna'' with a final stanza:\n<blockquote>\n:Ale you brewed, \u00c6gir, and you will never again hold a feast;\n:all your possessions which are here inside\u2014\n:may flame play over them,\n:and may your back be burnt!{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=95}}\n</blockquote>\nFollowing this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a [[salmon]] and hid in the waterfall of [[Franangrsfors]], where the \u00c6sir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Nari]], and his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Narfi]] changed into a wolf. Ska\u00f0i fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n====''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a''====\n[[Image:Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim.jpg|thumb|''Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim'' (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]\n[[Image:Ah, what a lovely maid it is! by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''Ah, what a lovely maid it is!'' (1902) by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]].]]\nIn the poem ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'', Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess [[Freyja]], and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mj\u00f6llnir. Freyja agrees, saying she'd lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=97}}\n\nIn [[J\u00f6tunheimr]], the j\u00f6tunn [[\u00derymr]] sits on a [[tumulus|burial mound]], plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. \u00derymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the [[\u00c6sir]] and the [[Elf#Norse mythology|Elves]]; why is Loki alone in the J\u00f6tunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the \u00c6sir: that Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is gone. \u00derymr says that he has hidden Mj\u00f6llnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from J\u00f6tunheimr and back to the court of the gods.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=97\u201398}}\n\nThor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he's still in the air as \"tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies.\" Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that \u00derymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to \u00derymr as his wife. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to J\u00f6tunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the \u00c6sir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed [[Br\u00edsingamen]], falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=98}}\n\nAs a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god [[Heimdallr]] puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as \"son of [[Laufey]]\") interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mj\u00f6llnir, and points out that without Mj\u00f6llnir, the j\u00f6tnar will be able to invade and settle in [[Asgard]]. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr together.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=99}}\n\nAfter riding together in Thor's [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|goat-driven chariot]], the two, disguised, arrive in J\u00f6tunheimr. \u00derymr commands the j\u00f6tnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to be his wife. \u00derymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nEarly in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with \u00derymr and the assembled j\u00f6tnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of [[mead]]. \u00derymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before \u00derymr and appearing as a \"very shrewd maid\", makes the excuse that \"Freyja's\" behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. \u00derymr then lifts \"Freyja's\" veil and wants to kiss \"her\" until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because \"Freyja\" had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nThe \"wretched sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from \"Freyja\", and the j\u00f6tnar bring out Mj\u00f6llnir to \"sanctify the bride\", to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by \"the hand\" of the goddess [[V\u00e1r]]. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes \u00derymr, beats all of the j\u00f6tnar, and kills the \"older sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=101}}\n\n====''Reginsm\u00e1l''====\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem ''Reginsm\u00e1l''. The prose introduction to ''Reginsm\u00e1l'' details that, while the hero [[Sigurd]] was being fostered by [[Regin]], son of [[Hreidmar]], Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, [[H\u0153nir]], and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; [[Andvari]], who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a [[Esox|pike]], and [[\u00d3tr]], who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nWhile the three gods are at the falls, \u00d3tr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead \u00d3tr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar \"seized them and made them ransom their lives\" in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nLoki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess [[R\u00e1n]], borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a \"[[norns|norn]] of misfortune\" in his \"early days\". Loki responds by asking Andvari \"what requital\" does mankind get if \"they wound each other with words\". Andvari responds that lying men receive a \"terrible requital\": having to wade in the river [[Vadgelmir]], and that their suffering will be long.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nLoki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring [[Andvarinaut]], which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he doesn't believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n====''Baldrs draumar''====\nIn ''Baldr draumar'', Odin has awoken a deceased v\u00f6lva in [[Hel (location)|Hel]], and questions her repeatedly about his son [[Baldr]]'s bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the v\u00f6lva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=245}}\n\n====''Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0''====\n[[File:Loki finds Gullveigs Heart - John Bauer.jpg|thumb|Loki consumes a roasted heart in a painting (1911) by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]]]\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma]]'', found within the poem ''[[Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0]]''. The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the j\u00f6tunn [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], that Loki himself gave birth to the horse [[Sleipnir]] by the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of [[B\u00fdleistr]]\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\". This stanza is followed by:\n<blockquote>\n:Loki ate some of the heart, the thought-stone of a woman,\n:roasted on a [[Tilia|linden-wood]] fire, he found it half-cooked;\n:Lopt was impregnated by a wicked woman,\n:from whom every ogress on earth is descended.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=258}}\n</blockquote>\nIn the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as ''Lopt''.

In the poem, Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r describes to the hero [[Svipdagr]] that [[Sinmara]] keeps the weapon [[L\u00e6vateinn]] within a chest, locked with [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|nine strong locks]] (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:''Fjolsvith spake:''\n:\"L\u00e6vatein is there, that Lopt with runes\n:Once made by the doors of death;\n:In L\u00e6gjarn's chest by Sinmora lies it,\n:And nine locks fasten it firm.\"{{sfnp|Bellows|1936|p=245}}\n|\n:''Fiolsvith.''\n:H\u00e6vatein the twig is named, and Lopt plucked it,\n:down by the gate of Death.\n:In an iron chest it lies with Sinm\u0153ra,\n:and is with nine strong locks secured.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|pp=96\u201397}}\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\n\n====''Gylfaginning''====\nThe ''Prose Edda'' book ''Gylfaginning'' tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse [[Sleipnir]] and Loki's contest with [[Logi]], fire personified.\n\n'''High's introduction'''\n\nLoki first appears in the ''Prose Edda'' in chapter 20 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', where he is referred to as the \"[[\u00c6sir|\u00e1s]] called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] explains to \"Gangleri\" (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of ''Lokasenna''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=21}}\n[[Image:The children of Loki by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|right|\"The children of Loki\" (1920) by [[Willy Pogany]]]]\nLoki is more formally introduced by [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|High]] in chapter 34, where he is \"reckoned among the \u00c6sir\", and High states that Loki is called by some \"the \u00c6sir's calumniator\", \"originator of deceits\", and \"the disgrace of all gods and men\". High says that Loki's alternative name is ''Lopt'', that he is the son of the male j\u00f6tunn [[F\u00e1rbauti]], his mother is \"[[Laufey|Laufey or N\u00e1l]]\", and his brothers are [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. High describes Loki as \"pleasing and handsome\" in appearance, malicious in character, \"very capricious in behaviour\", and as possessing \"to a greater degree than others\" learned cunning, and \"tricks for every purpose\", often getting the \u00c6sir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Loki's wife is named Sigyn, and they have a son named \"Nari or Narfi\". Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a from [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]; the wolf [[Fenrir]], the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and the female being [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in J\u00f6tunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrbo\u00f0a, but worse yet Loki.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=26\u201327}} In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a \"pretty terrible\"\u2014yet important\u2014family.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}}\n\n'''Loki, Sva\u00f0ilfari, and Sleipnir'''\n\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established [[Midgard]] and built [[Valhalla|Val-Hall]].\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the [[S\u00f3l (sun)|sun]], and the [[M\u00e1ni|moon]]. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks\u2014to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Sva\u00f0ilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of [[Sumarr and Vetr|summer]], the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as ''Loki Laufeyjarson''\u2014his surname derived from his mother's name, ''Laufey'').{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=35}}\n\n[[Image:Loki and Svadilfari by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''Loki and [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]]'' (1909) by Dorothy Hardy]]\nThe gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Sva\u00f0ilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was,\" Sva\u00f0ilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Sva\u00f0ilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\nThe builder goes into a rage, and when the \u00c6sir realize that the builder is a [[hrimthurs]], they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mj\u00f6llnir. However, Loki \"[[sexual intercourse|had such dealings]]\" with Sva\u00f0ilfari that \"[[Pregnancy|somewhat later]]\" Loki gives birth to a gray [[foal]] with eight legs; the horse [[Sleipnir]]\u2014\"the best horse among gods and men.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\n'''Loki, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, and Logi'''\n\nIn chapter 44, [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|two goats]]. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child [[\u00dej\u00e1lfi]] sucks the [[bone marrow]] from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son \u00dej\u00e1lfi and their daughter [[R\u00f6skva]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=37\u201338}}\n[[File:I am the giant Skrymir by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''I am the giant [[Skrymir]]'' by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]]]]\nMinus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of [[Skrymir]], who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nThor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skr\u00fdmir with his hammer. Skr\u00fdmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skr\u00fdmir. Skr\u00fdmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of [[\u00datgar\u00f0ar|\u00datgar\u00f0r]] it would be better for them to turn back now, for [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]]'s men there won't put up with it. Skr\u00fdmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that \"there is no report that the \u00c6sir expressed hope for a happy reunion\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=40}}\n\nThe four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of [[Logi]] to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, \u00dej\u00e1lfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki then calls for his nurse [[Elli]], an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nThe next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki will now speak negatively about him. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki was in fact the immense Skr\u00fdmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skr\u00fdmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe contests, too, were an illusion. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (''Logi'', Old Norse \"flame\"), \u00dej\u00e1lfi had raced against thought (''Hugi'', Old Norse \"thought\"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in [[tide]]s). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this \"cat\", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (''Elli'', Old Norse \"old age\"), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for \"both sides\" if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n===Norwegian rune poem===\n[[File:Runic letter berkanan.svg|thumb|50px|The [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]]]\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian rune poem]] in connection with the [[Younger Futhark]] [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>Old Norse:</small>\n:Bjarkan er laufgr\u00f8nster l\u00edma;\n::Loki bar fl\u00e6r\u00f0a t\u00edma.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=26}}\n|\n:<small>Modern English:</small>\n:[[Birch]] has the greenest leaves of any shrub;\n::Loki was fortunate in his deceit.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n|}\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Bruce Dickins, the reference to \"Loki's deceit\" in the poem \"is doubtless to Loki's responsibility for Balder's death.\"{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n\n==Archaeological record==\n\n===Snaptun Stone===\n[[Image:Lokistone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Snaptun Stone]] may feature a depiction of Loki]]\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, [[Denmark]]. Made of [[soapstone]] that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' where [[sons of Ivaldi]] stitch up Loki's lips.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\nThe stone is identified as a [[hearth]] stone; the nozzle of the [[bellows]] would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans J\u00f8rgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is \"the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.\" The stone is housed and on display at the [[Moesg\u00e5rd Museum]] near [[Aarhus]], Denmark.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\n===Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross===\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in [[St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]], features a bound figure with horns and a beard. This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=105}} Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white [[sandstone]], and now sits at the front of the Kirkby Stephen church. A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in [[Gainford, County Durham]] and is now housed in the [[Durham Cathedral|Durham Cathedral Library]].{{sfnp|Calverley|1899|p=218}}\n\nThe mid-11th century [[Gosforth Cross]] has been interpreted as featuring various figures from Norse mythology and, like the Kirkby Stephen Stone, is also located in Cumbria. The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=13}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kirkby Stephen Stone by Petersen.jpg|The bound figure on the Kirkby Stephen Stone\nFile:Gosforth Cross Loki and Sigyn.jpg|Detail from the [[Gosforth Cross]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Scandinavian folklore==\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia. In Denmark, Loki appeared as ''Lokke''. In [[Jutland]], the phrases \"Lokke sl\u00e5r sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\". In [[Zealand]] the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used. In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist [[Axel Olrik]] cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n<blockquote>\n:The expressions: \"Lokke (Lokki) s\u00e5r havre i dag\" (Lokke (Lokki) sows oats today), or: \"Lokke driver i dag med sine geder\" (Lokke herds his goats today), are used in several regions of Jutland, for example in Medelsom shire, the [[diocese of Viborg]] etc. ... and stand for the sight in the springtime, when the sunshine generates vapour from the ground, which can be seen as fluttering or shimmering air in the horizon of the flat landscape, similar to the hot steam over a kettle or a burning fire\n</blockquote>\nAnd in [[Thy (district)|Thy]], from the same source: \"... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.\" Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an \"air phenomenon\", connected with the \"home fire\", and as a \"teasing creature of the night\".{{sfnp|Olrik|1909}}\n\n''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' or ''Lokka T\u00e1ttur'' (Faroese \"tale\u2014or ''[[\u00fe\u00e1ttr]]''\u2014of Loki\") is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and [[H\u0153nir]] helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning j\u00f6tunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.{{sfnp|Hirschfeld|1889|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Origin and identification with other figures==\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]] comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\"{{sfnp|Turville-Petre|1964|p=324}}\n\n===Origin===\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, [[Jacob Grimm]] was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\". In 1889, [[Sophus Bugge]] theorized Loki to be variant of [[Lucifer]] of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After [[World War II]], four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of [[Folke Str\u00f6m]], who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the god [[Odin]]. In 1959, [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] theorized that Loki is a typical example of a [[trickster figure]]. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, [[Anna Birgitta Rooth]] concluded that Loki was originally a [[spider]]. [[Anne Holtsmark]], writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.{{sfnp|von Schnurbein|2000|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\n===Identification with L\u00f3\u00f0urr===\nA popular theory proposed by the scholar [[Ursula Dronke]] is that ''[[L\u00f3\u00f0urr]]'' is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, H\u0153nir and Loki occur as a trio in ''[[Haustl\u00f6ng]]'', in the prose prologue to ''[[Reginsm\u00e1l]]'' and also in the ''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' a [[Faroese people|Faroese]] ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"H\u0153nir's friend\" in ''Haustl\u00f6ng'', strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'', seemingly conflicting with the image of L\u00f3\u00f0urr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure. Many scholars, including [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] and [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]], have also identified L\u00f3\u00f0urr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur \u00deorgeirsson suggests that ''Loki'' and ''L\u00f3\u00f0urr'' were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as L\u00f3\u00f0ur in the r\u00edmur ''[[Lokrur]]''. \u00deorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the ''Prose Edda'', as Snorri does not mention L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Since the contents of the ''Poetic Edda'' are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the r\u00edmur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. \u00deorgeirsson also points to ''[[\u00derymlur]]'' where the same identification is made with Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if L\u00f3\u00f0urr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1793106/Lokrur_Lodurr_and_Late_Evidence|title=Lokrur, L\u00f3\u00f0urr and late evidence|last=\u00deorgeirsson|first=Haukur}}</ref>\n\n===Binding===\nThe scholar [[John Lindow]] highlights the recurring pattern of the [[bound monster]] in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\".{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|p=82-83}}\n\n==Modern interpretations and legacy==\n\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic [[fifth column]]ist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic [[Prometheus]], a heroic bearer of culture\".{{sfnp|Arvidsson|2006|p=154}} \n\nLoki appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle [[Ring of the Nibelung]] as ''Loge'' (a play on Old Norse ''loge'', \"fire\"), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as [[Wotan]]'s assistant rather than [[Thor|Donner's]]), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'' Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Winder|editor1-last=McConnell|editor2-first=Werner|editor2-last=Wunderlich|editor3-first=Frank|editor3-last=Gentry|editor4-first=Ulrich|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Mueller|year=2013|title=The Nibelungen Tradition: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|at=\"Loge\" and \"Loki\"|isbn=978-0815317852}}</ref>\n\nAs the myths tell of Loki changing gender on several occasions,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clunies Ross |first1=Margaret |author-link1=Margaret Clunies Ross |year=2002 |editor1-last=Acker |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Larrington |editor2-first=Carolyne |chapter=Reading ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'' |title=The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology |pages=194 |isbn=0815316607 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlozzi |first1=Alfred F. |last2=Choate |first2=Kurt T |year=2018 |title=Transgender and Gender Diverse Persons: A Handbook |pages=266 |isbn=1351207091 }}</ref> some modern works interpret or depict the deity as [[genderfluid]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Birkedal |first1=K.

However, occasionally member states negotiate certain [[Opt-out|opt-outs]] from legislation or treaties of the European Union, meaning they do not have to participate in certain policy areas.

The United Kingdom and Ireland received opt-outs from implementing the [[Schengen acquis|Schengen ''acquis'']] when the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] of 1997 incorporated it into the [[EU treaties]], as they were the only EU member states which had not signed the agreement.

Davies raced AAA on a false birth certificate showing him older (as did [[Troy Ruttman]] and [[Jim Rathmann]]), and was racing illegally.\n\n==Midget car career==\nIn 1960 he won the USAC Pacific Coast Midget title as well as the National Midget Championship. He repeated as National Midget champion in 1961 and 1962. He won 46 feature events in the midgets in his career.<ref name=NMARHoF /> Davies won the [[Night before the 500]] midget race three times, in 1960 and 1961 at [[Kokomo Speedway]], and next year at the [[Indianapolis Speedrome]]. Davies's midget car was stolen but was recovered a year later when a driver was killed in it at Sacramento. Davies recognized the car in the newspaper photos of the wreck.<ref name=NMARHoF />\n\nDavies also had success racing midgets (called Speedcars down under) in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] during his career. He won the 1963 [[Australian Speedcar Grand Prix]] at the [[Sydney Showground Speedway]], as well as the 1963 and 1964 [[South Australian Speedcar Championship]]s at the [[Rowley Park Speedway]] in [[Adelaide]].\n\nHe died on June 11, 1966, aged 36, from injuries suffered in a midget crash at [[Santa Fe Speedway]] in suburban [[Chicago]].\n\n==Career award==\n*Inducted into the [[National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame]] in 1984.<ref name=NMARHoF />\n\n==Complete AAA/USAC Championship Car results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n!
