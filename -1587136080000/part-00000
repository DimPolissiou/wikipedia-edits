Cetuximab is a chimeric (mouse/human) [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] given by intravenous infusion that is distributed under the trade name '''Erbitux''' in the U.S. and Canada by the drug company [[Eli Lilly and Co.]] and outside those countries by the drug company [[Merck KGaA]]. In Japan, Merck KGaA, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly have a co-distribution.\n\nIn July 2009, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved cetuximab (Erbitux) for treatment of colon cancer with wild-type [[KRAS]], since it had little or no effect in colorectal tumors harboring a KRAS mutation (this also applied to the EGFR antibody [[panitumumab]]).<ref name=\"urlCetuximab (Erbitux) and Panitumumab (Vectibix)\">{{cite web | url = https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTobacco/CDER/ucm172905.htm | title = Class Labeling Changes to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix): KRAS Mutations  | date = 2010-01-11 | website = | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}</ref> This was the first genetic test to guide treatment of cancer.<ref name=\"Messersmith_Ahnen_2008\"/> In July 2012, the FDA approved a real time [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] [[companion diagnostic]] test for KRAS, the therascreen KRAS test.<ref name=\"urltherascreen\u00ae KRAS RGQ PCR Kit - P110030\">{{cite web | url = https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm312055.htm | title = Therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit \u2013 P110030 | date = 2012-07-06 | work = Device Approvals and Clearances | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}</ref>\n\nCetuximab is approved for [[K-RAS]] wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer in the US & Canada ([[Eli Lilly]]).

Approximately 75% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have an EGFR-expressing tumor and are therefore considered eligible for treatment with cetuximab or [[panitumumab]], according to FDA guidelines. Unfortunately, there is evidence that immunohistochemical EGFR receptor testing does not predict response to either cetuximab or panitumumab, so that this has been called a \"misleading biomarker\" that has nevertheless caused insurers and even health systems to deny payment for EGFR antibody treatment for patients who lack a positive tumor EGFR histochemical test.<ref name=\"Messersmith_Ahnen_2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Messersmith WA, Ahnen DJ | title = Targeting EGFR in colorectal cancer | journal = N.

Accordingly, genetic testing to confirm the absence of KRAS mutations (and so the presence of the KRAS wild-type gene), is now clinically routine before the start of treatment with EGFR inhibitors. mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS tumors have been shown to benefit from a response rate of over 60% and a decreased risk for progression of over 40% when treated with Erbitux as 1st-line therapy.{{mcn|date=February 2016}}  Around 65% of mCRC patients have the KRAS wild-type gene.{{mcn|date=February 2016}}\n\n==History==\n\n[[Michael Sela]], Ester Hurwitz  and co-workers published observations on EGFR inhibition in 1988.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aboud-Pirak E, Hurwitz E, Pirak ME, Bellot F, Schlessinger J, Sela M | title = Efficacy of antibodies to epidermal growth factor receptor against KB carcinoma in vitro and in nude mice | journal = J.
