The railway was primarily built to provide faster transport of raw materials, finished goods and passengers between the [[Port of Liverpool]] and the [[cotton mill]]s and factories of Manchester and surrounding towns.\n\nDesigned and built by [[George Stephenson]], the line was financially successful, and influenced the development of railways across Britain in the 1830s. In 1845 the railway was absorbed by its principal business partner, the [[Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR), which in turn amalgamated the following year with the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] and the [[Manchester and Birmingham Railway]] to form the [[London and North Western Railway]].{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=107}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:First passenger railway 1830.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the railway in 1830]]\n\nDuring the [[Industrial revolution]] huge tonnages of raw material were imported through Liverpool and carried to the textile mills near the [[Pennines]] where water, and later steam power, enabled the production of the finished cloth, much of which was then transported back to Liverpool for export.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=11}}{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=11}} The existing means of water transport, the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]], the [[Bridgewater Canal]] and the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]], dated from the 18th century, and were felt to be making excessive profits from the cotton trade and throttling the growth of Manchester and other towns.{{sfn|Dendy Marshall|1930|pp=1\u20133}}{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=12}} Goods were transported between Liverpool and the factories around Manchester either by the canals or by poor-quality roads; the [[Toll road|Turnpike]] between Liverpool and Manchester was described as \"crooked and rough\" with an \"infamous\" surface.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=12}} Road accidents were frequent, including waggons and coaches overturning, which made goods traffic problematic.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=13}}\n\nThe proposed railway was intended to achieve cheap transport of raw materials, finished goods and passengers between the Port of Liverpool and east [[Lancashire]], in the port's [[hinterland]]. There was support for the railway from both Liverpool and London but Manchester was largely indifferent and opposition came from the canal operators and the two local landowners, the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and the [[William Molyneux, 2nd Earl of Sefton|Earl of Sefton]], over whose land the railway would cross.{{sfn|Dendy Marshall|1930|pp=1\u20133}}{{sfn|Taylor|1988|p=158}}\n\nThe proposed Liverpool and Manchester Railway was to be one of the earliest land-based public transport systems not using animal traction power.

He advocated a national network of railways, based on what he had seen of the development of colliery lines and locomotive technology in the north of England.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nThe Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company was founded on 20 May 1824.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=18}} It was established by [[Henry Booth]], who became its secretary and treasurer, along with merchants from [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]]. [[Charles Lawrence (Liverpool merchant)|Charles Lawrence]] was the Chairman, Lister Ellis, Robert Gladstone, John Moss and Joseph Sandars were the Deputy Chairmen.{{sfn|Booth|1830|p=9}}\n\nA bill was drafted in 1825 to Parliament, which included a 1-inch to the mile map of the railway's route.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=22}} The first bill was rejected but the second passed in May the following year.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|pp=26\u201330}} In Liverpool 172 people bought 1,979 shares, in London 96 took 844, Manchester 15 with 124, 24 others with 286.

The viaduct is in use to this day.]]\nThe first survey for the line was carried out by James in 1822. The route was roughly the same as what was built, but the committee were unaware of exactly what land had been surveyed. James subsequently declared bankruptcy and was imprisoned that November. The committee lost confidence in his ability to plan and build the line{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=17}} and, in June 1824, [[George Stephenson]] was appointed principal engineer.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|pp=18\u201319}}  As well as objections to the proposed route by Lords Sefton and Derby, [[Robert Haldane Bradshaw]], a trustee of the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater]]'s estate at [[Worsley]], refused any access to land owned by the [[Bridgewater Canal#Bridgewater Trustees|Bridgewater Trustees]] and Stephenson had difficulty producing a satisfactory survey of the proposed route and accepted James' original plans with spot checks.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=23}}{{sfn|Thomas|1980|pp=18\u201319}}\n \nThe survey was presented to Parliament on 8 February 1825,{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=19}} but was shown to be inaccurate. [[Francis Giles]] suggested that putting the railway through [[Chat Moss]] was a serious error and the total cost of the line would be around \u00a3200,000 instead of the \u00a340,000 quoted by Stephenson.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=26}} Stephenson was cross examined by the opposing council led by [[Edward Alderson (judge)|Edward Hall Alderson]] and his lack of suitable figures and understanding of the work came to light. When asked, he was unable to specify the levels of the track and how he calculated the cost of major structures such as the Irwell Viaduct. The bill was thrown out on 31 May.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=20}}{{sfn|Jarvis|2007|p=22}}\n\nIn place of George Stephenson, the railway promoters appointed [[George Rennie (engineer)|George]] and [[John Rennie (railway engineer)|John Rennie]] as engineers, who chose [[Charles Blacker Vignoles]] as their surveyor.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=27}} They set out to placate the canal interests and had the good fortune to approach the Marquess{{clarify|date=June 2019}} directly through their counsel, W. G.

From [[Huyton]] the route ran directly east through [[Parr Moss]], [[Newton, Greater Manchester|Newton]], Chat Moss and [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]]. In Liverpool, the route included a {{convert|1.25|miles|adj=on}} tunnel from [[Edge Hill, Liverpool|Edge Hill]] to the docks, avoiding crossing any streets at ground level.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=28}} It was intended to place the Manchester terminus on the [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] side of the River Irwell, but the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]] withdrew their opposition to a crossing of the river at the last moment in return for access for their carts over the intended railway bridge. The Manchester station was therefore fixed at Liverpool Road in [[Castlefield]].{{sfn|Thomas|1980|pp=28\u201329,50}}\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:View of the Railway across Chat Moss, from Bury's Liverpool and Manchester Railway, 1831 - artfinder 267570 full 1024x836.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A very early steam locomotive pulling four open carriages under a cloudy blue sky along a track slightly built up from the surrounding flat countryside.

The experience on the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] was well-publicised, and a section of the [[Hetton colliery railway]] had been converted to cable haulage. The success of the cable haulage was indisputable but the steam locomotive was still untried. The L&MR had sought to de-emphasise the use of steam locomotives during the passage of the bill, the public were alarmed at the idea of monstrous machines which, if they did not explode, would fill the countryside with noxious fumes.\n\nAttention was turning towards steam road carriages, such as those of [[Goldsworthy Gurney#Gurney's steam carriage|Goldsworthy Gurney's]] and there was a division in the L&MR board between those who supported Stephenson's \"loco-motive\" and those who favoured cable haulage, the latter supported by the opinion of the engineer, [[John Urpeth Rastrick|John Rastrick]]. Stephenson was not averse to cable haulage\u2014he continued to build such lines where he felt it appropriate\u2014but knew its main disadvantage, that any breakdown anywhere would paralyse the whole line.\n\nThe line's gradient was designed to concentrate the steep grades in three places, at either side of Rainhill at 1 in 96 {{cnspan|and down to the docks at Liverpool at 1 in 50|date=June 2019}}) and make the rest of the line very gently graded, no further than 1 in 880.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=33}} When the line opened, the passenger section from Edge Hill to [[Crown Street railway station]] was cable hauled, as was the section through the [[Wapping Tunnel]], as the Act of Parliament forbade the use of locomotives on this part of the line.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=37}}\n\nTo determine whether and which locomotives would be suitable, in October 1829 the directors organised a public competition, known as the [[Rainhill trials]], which involved a run along a {{convert|1|mile}} stretch of track.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=44}} Ten locomotives were entered for the trials, but on the day of the competition only five were available to compete:<ref>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution in World History |volume=3 |first=Kenneth E. |last=Hendrickson, III |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |date=25 November 2014}}</ref>  ''[[Stephenson's Rocket|Rocket]]'', designed by George Stephenson and his son, [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]], was the only one to successfully complete the journey and, consequently, [[Robert Stephenson and Company]] were awarded the locomotive contract.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|pp=48,55}}\n\n==== Double track ====\nThe line was built to {{RailGauge|ussg}} ([[standard gauge]]) and [[double track]].{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=32}} A decision had to be made about how far apart the rails of the double track should be. It was decided to make the space between the separate tracks the same as the track gauge itself, so that it would be possible to operate trains with unusually wide loads up the middle during quiet times. Stephenson was criticised for this decision;{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=32}} it was later decided that the tracks were too close together, restricting the width of the trains, so the gap between tracks ([[track centres]]) was widened. The narrowness of the gap contributed to the first fatality, that of [[William Huskisson]], and also made it dangerous to do maintenance on one track while trains were operating on the other.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n=== Opening ===\n{{Main|Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway}}\n[[File:Planet replica.jpg|thumb|A replica of the ''[[Planet (locomotive)|Planet]]'']]\nThe line opened on 15 September 1830 with termini at [[Manchester Liverpool Road railway station|Manchester, Liverpool Road]] (now part of the [[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]]) and Liverpool [[Crown Street railway station|Crown Street]].

Huskisson decided to alight and stroll alongside the train, and on spotting the Duke decided to start a conversation. The ''Rocket'' was spotted heading in the opposite direction as people shouted at Huskisson to get back on the train.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=86}}{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=75}}\n\n[[File:Huskisson memorial 1833.jpg|thumb|left|The Huskisson Memorial in 1913]]\nThe Austrian ambassador was pulled back into the carriage, but Huskisson panicked.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=87}} He tried to climb into the carriage, but grabbed the open door, which swung back, causing him to lose his grip.

The somewhat subdued party proceeded to Manchester, where, the Duke being deeply unpopular with the [[weaver (occupation)|weavers]] and mill workers, they were given a lively reception, and returned to Liverpool without alighting.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|pp=77\u201378}} A grand reception and banquet had been prepared for their arrival.\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:2004-10-09 Bridge over A49.jpg|thumb|Stephenson's bridge over the Warrington&nbsp;\u2013 Wigan [[turnpike trust|Turnpike Road]] (now A49) at Newton-le-Willows]]\nThe L&MR was successful and popular, and reduced journey times between Liverpool and Manchester to two hours.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|pp=91,93}} Most stage coach companies operating between the two towns closed shortly after the railway opened as it was impossible to compete.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=186}} Within a few weeks of the line opening, it ran its first excursion trains and carried the world's first railway mail carriages;{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=86}} by the summer of 1831 it was carrying special trains to the races.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=195}} The railway was a financial success, paying investors an average annual [[dividend]] of 9.5% over the 15 years of its independent existence: a level of profitability that would never again be attained by a British railway company.{{sfn|Wolmar|2007|p=55}}\n\nThe railway was purposefully designed for the benefit of the public, carrying passengers as well as freight. Shares in the company were limited to ten per person and profits from these were limited.{{sfn|Jackman|2014|p=526}} Although the intention had been to carry goods, the canal companies reduced their prices, leading to a price war between them and the railway.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=207}} The line did not start carrying goods until December, when the first of some more powerful engines, [[Planet (locomotive)|''Planet'']], was delivered.\n\nThe line's success in carrying passengers was universally acclaimed.{{sfn|Jackman|2014|p=526}} The experience at Rainhill had shown that unprecedented speed could be achieved and travelling by rail was cheaper and more comfortable than travel by road. The company concentrated on passenger travel, a decision that had repercussions across the country and triggered the \"[[railway mania]] of the 1840s\".{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=138}} [[John B.

If the policeman was not present, or was standing at ease, this indicated that there was an obstruction on the line ahead.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=216}} Gradually a system of hand-held flags was developed, with a red flag being used to stop a train, green indicating that a train should proceed at caution, blue indicating to drivers of baggage trains that there were new wagons for them to take on and a black flag being used by platelayers to indicate works on the track.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=216}} Any flag waved violently, or at night a lamp waved up and down, indicated that a train should stop.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=217}} Until 1844 handbells were used as emergency signals in foggy weather, though in that year small [[detonator (railway)|explosive boxes]] placed on the line began to be used instead.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=219}}\n\nTrains were controlled on a time interval basis: policemen signalled for a train to stop if less than ten minutes had elapsed since a previous train had passed; the signal to proceed at caution was given if more than ten minutes but less than seventeen minutes had passed; otherwise the all clear signal was given.{{sfn|Wolmar|2007|p=49}} If a train broke down on the line, the policeman had to run a mile down the track to stop oncoming traffic.{{sfn|Wolmar|2007|p=49-50}}\n\nAfter the opening of the [[Warrington and Newton Railway]] four policemen were placed constantly on duty at [[Earlestown railway station|Newton Junction]], at the potentially dangerous [[Railroad switch|points]] where the two lines met.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=217}} Initially a gilt arrow was used to point towards Warrington to indicate that the points were set in that direction, with a green lamp visible from the L&MR line being used to indicate this at night.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=217}} Later a fixed signal was used, with red and white chequered boards on 12 foot high posts being turned to face trains from one direction if another train was ahead.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=217}}\n\nIn 1837 the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] conducted trials using a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]] to direct signalling{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=219}} and in 1841 held a conference to propose a uniform national system of coloured signals to control trains,{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=220}} but despite these advances elsewhere the Liverpool and Manchester Railway continued to be controlled by policemen and flags until its merger with the [[Grand Junction Railway]] in 1845.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=221}}\n\n== Influence ==\n[[File:Liverpool_and_Manchester_Railway_1831_billboard.jpg|thumb|right|1831 Billboard giving train details and conditions of carriage]]\nBeing one of the first railways, many lessons had to be learnt from experience, but not many passengers were killed except by their own negligence.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe L&MR was also responsible for the [[Standard gauge|gauge]] of {{RailGauge|ussg}}, which came to be used as a ''de facto'' standard.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=32}} The L&MR used left hand running on double track, following practice on British roads.  The form of couplings using buffers, hooks and chains, and their dimensions, set the pattern for European practice and practice in many other places.\n\nEven before the LMR opened, connecting and other lines were planned, authorised or under construction, such as the [[Bolton and Leigh Railway]].\n\n== Modern line ==\n{{Main|Liverpool to Manchester Lines}}\nThe original Liverpool and Manchester line still operates as a secondary line between the two cities\u2014the southern route, the former [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] route via [[Warrington Central railway station|Warrington Central]] is for the moment the busier route. This however has already started to change (from the May 2014 timetable) with  new [[Transpennine Express]] services between Newcastle/Manchester Victoria and Liverpool and between Manchester (Airport) and Scotland (via Chat Moss, Lowton and Wigan). From December 2014, with completion of electrification (see below) the two routes between Manchester and Liverpool will have much the same frequency of service.\n\nOn the original route, a new (May 2014) hourly Transpennine Express non-stop  service runs between Manchester Victoria and Liverpool (from/to) Newcastle), an hourly fast service is operated by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]], from Liverpool to Manchester, usually calling at [[Wavertree Technology Park railway station|Wavertree Technology Park]], [[St Helens Junction railway station|St Helens Junction]], [[Newton-le-Willows railway station|Newton-le-Willows]] and [[Manchester Oxford Road railway station|Manchester Oxford Road]], and continuing via [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]] to [[Manchester Airport railway station|Manchester Airport]]. Northern also operates an hourly service calling at all stations from Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Victoria. This is supplemented by an additional all-stations service between Liverpool and Earlestown, which continues to [[Warrington Bank Quay railway station|Warrington Bank Quay]].\n\nBetween Warrington Bank Quay, Earlestown and Manchester Piccadilly, there are additional services (at least one per hour) operated by [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], which originate from [[Chester railway station|Chester]] and the [[North Wales Coast Line]].\n\n=== Electrification ===\nIn 2009, electrification at [[25 kV AC]] was announced. The section between Manchester and Newton, including the Chat Moss section, was completed in 2013; the line onwards to Liverpool opened on 5 March 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/News-Releases/Better-rail-services-become-a-reality-between-Liverpool-Lime-Street-and-Manchester-Airport-station-22b0.aspx |title=Better rail services become a reality between Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Airport station |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=5 March 2015 |website=Network Rail Media Centre |publisher=Network Rail |access-date=5 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150309092746/http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/News-Releases/Better-rail-services-become-a-reality-between-Liverpool-Lime-Street-and-Manchester-Airport-station-22b0.aspx |archivedate=9 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Ordsall Chord===\nThe historic passenger railway station of Manchester Liverpool Road is a Grade I [[Listed building]], and was threatened by the [[Northern Hub]] plan.

[[Cable railway|Cable haulage]] of freight trains was down the steeply-graded {{convert|1.26|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Wapping Tunnel]] to Liverpool Docks from Edge Hill junction.  The railway was primarily built to provide faster transport of raw materials, finished goods and passengers between the [[Port of Liverpool]] and the [[cotton mill]]s and factories of Manchester and surrounding towns.\n\nDesigned and built by [[George Stephenson]], the line was financially successful, and influenced the development of railways across Britain in the 1830s. In 1845 the railway was absorbed by its principal business partner, the [[Grand Junction Railway]] (GJR), which in turn amalgamated the following year with the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] and the [[Manchester and Birmingham Railway]] to form the [[London and North Western Railway]].{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=107}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:First passenger railway 1830.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the railway in 1830]]\n\nDuring the [[Industrial revolution]] huge tonnages of raw material were imported through Liverpool and carried to the textile mills near the [[Pennines]] where water, and later steam power, enabled the production of the finished cloth, much of which was then transported back to Liverpool for export.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=11}}{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=11}} The existing means of water transport, the [[Mersey and Irwell Navigation]], the [[Bridgewater Canal]] and the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]], dated from the 18th century, and were felt to be making excessive profits from the cotton trade and throttling the growth of Manchester and other towns.{{sfn|Dendy Marshall|1930|pp=1\u20133}}{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=12}} Goods were transported between Liverpool and the factories around Manchester either by the canals or by poor-quality roads; the [[Toll road|Turnpike]] between Liverpool and Manchester was described as \"crooked and rough\" with an \"infamous\" surface.{{sfn|Thomas|1980|p=12}} Road accidents were frequent, including waggons and coaches overturning, which made goods traffic problematic.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=13}}\n\nThe proposed railway was intended to achieve cheap transport of raw materials, finished goods and passengers between the Port of Liverpool and east [[Lancashire]], in the port's [[hinterland]]. There was support for the railway from both Liverpool and London but Manchester was largely indifferent and opposition came from the canal operators and the two local landowners, the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and the [[William Molyneux, 2nd Earl of Sefton|Earl of Sefton]], over whose land the railway would cross.{{sfn|Dendy Marshall|1930|pp=1\u20133}}{{sfn|Taylor|1988|p=158}}\n\nThe proposed Liverpool and Manchester Railway was to be one of the earliest land-based public transport systems not using animal traction power.

The experience on the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] was well-publicised, and a section of the [[Hetton colliery railway]] had been converted to cable haulage. The success of the cable haulage was indisputable but the steam locomotive was still untried. The L&MR had sought to de-emphasise the use of steam locomotives during the passage of the bill, the public were alarmed at the idea of monstrous machines which, if they did not explode, would fill the countryside with noxious fumes.\n\nAttention was turning towards steam road carriages, such as those of [[Goldsworthy Gurney#Gurney's steam carriage|Goldsworthy Gurney's]] and there was a division in the L&MR board between those who supported Stephenson's \"loco-motive\" and those who favoured cable haulage, the latter supported by the opinion of the engineer, [[John Urpeth Rastrick|John Rastrick]]. Stephenson was not averse to cable haulage\u2014he continued to build such lines where he felt it appropriate\u2014but knew its main disadvantage, that any breakdown anywhere would paralyse the whole line.\n\nThe line's gradient was designed to concentrate the steep grades in three places, at either side of Rainhill at 1 in 96 {{cnspan|and down to the docks at Liverpool at 1 in 50|date=June 2019}}) and make the rest of the line very gently graded, no further than 1 in 880.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=33}} When the line opened, the passenger section from Edge Hill to [[Crown Street railway station]] was cable hauled, as was the section through the [[Wapping Tunnel]], as the Act of Parliament forbade the use of locomotives on this part of the line.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=37}}\n\nTo determine whether and which locomotives would be suitable, in October 1829 the directors organised a public competition, known as the [[Rainhill trials]], which involved a run along a {{convert|1|mile}} stretch of track.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=44}} Ten locomotives were entered for the trials, but on the day of the competition only five were available to compete:<ref>{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution in World History |volume=3 |first=Kenneth E. |last=Hendrickson, III |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |date=25 November 2014}}</ref>  ''[[Stephenson's Rocket|Rocket]]'', designed by George Stephenson and his son, [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]], was the only one to successfully complete the journey and, consequently, [[Robert Stephenson and Company]] were awarded the locomotive contract.{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|pp=48,55}}\n\n==== Double track ====\nThe line was built to {{RailGauge|ussg}} ([[standard gauge]]) and [[double track]].{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=32}} A decision had to be made about how far apart the rails of the double track should be.

Stephenson was criticised for this decision;{{sfn|Ferneyhough|1980|p=32}} it was later decided that the tracks were too close together, restricting the width of the trains, so the gap between tracks ([[track centres]]) was widened.

From December 2014, with completion of electrification (see below) the two routes between Manchester and Liverpool will have much the same frequency of service.\n\nOn the original route, a new (May 2014) hourly Transpennine Express non-stop  service runs between Manchester Victoria and Liverpool (from/to) Newcastle), an hourly fast service is operated by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]], from Liverpool to Manchester, usually calling at [[Wavertree Technology Park railway station|Wavertree Technology Park]], [[St Helens Junction railway station|St Helens Junction]], [[Newton-le-Willows railway station|Newton-le-Willows]] and [[Manchester Oxford Road railway station|Manchester Oxford Road]], and continuing via [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]] to [[Manchester Airport railway station|Manchester Airport]]. Northern also operates an hourly service calling at all stations from Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Victoria. This is supplemented by an additional all-stations service between Liverpool and Earlestown, which continues to [[Warrington Bank Quay railway station|Warrington Bank Quay]].\n\nBetween Warrington Bank Quay, Earlestown and Manchester Piccadilly, there are additional services (at least one per hour) operated by [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], which originate from [[Chester railway station|Chester]] and the [[North Wales Coast Line]].\n\n=== Electrification ===\nIn 2009, electrification at [[25 kV AC]] was announced. The section between Manchester and Newton, including the Chat Moss section, was completed in 2013; the line onwards to Liverpool opened on 5 March 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/News-Releases/Better-rail-services-become-a-reality-between-Liverpool-Lime-Street-and-Manchester-Airport-station-22b0.aspx |title=Better rail services become a reality between Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Airport station |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=5 March 2015 |website=Network Rail Media Centre |publisher=Network Rail |access-date=5 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150309092746/http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/News-Releases/Better-rail-services-become-a-reality-between-Liverpool-Lime-Street-and-Manchester-Airport-station-22b0.aspx |archivedate=9 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Ordsall Chord===\nThe historic passenger railway station of Manchester Liverpool Road is a Grade I [[Listed building]], and was threatened by the [[Northern Hub]] plan. This included the construction of the [[Ordsall Chord]] to provide direct access between Victoria and Piccadilly, in turn cutting off access from Liverpool Road. The [[Manchester Museum of Science and Industry]], who are based at the former station premises, had initially objected to the scheme and an inquiry was set up in 2014 to investigate the potential damage to the historic structure.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/oldest-railway-station-in-the-world-threatened-by-network-rail-plans-9352934.html |newspaper=[[The Independent on Sunday]] |title= 'Oldest railway station in the world' threatened by Network Rail plans |first=Jay |last=Merrick |date=11 May 2014 |accessdate=12 May 2014 }}</ref> The chord opened in November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.citymetric.com/transport/network-rail-let-me-have-play-manchester-s-new-rail-bridge-here-s-what-i-learned-3487|title=Network Rail let me have a play on Manchester\u2019s new rail bridge.

She is best remembered for her roles in the films ''[[The Roaring Twenties]]'' (1939) co-starring with [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]; ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942), an  [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film in which she plays the heroine, and ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944), in which she portrays [[Cary Grant]]'s fianc\u00e9e and bride.<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite web|last=Shipman |first=David |title=Obituary: Priscilla Lane |work=The Independent |date=April 10, 1995 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-priscilla-lane-1615023.html |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nPriscilla Mullican was born on June 12, 1915, in [[Indianola, Iowa]],<ref name=\"allmovie\">{{cite web|last=Erickson |first=Hal |title=priscilla Lane |work=AllMovie |url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/priscilla-lane-p40378 |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}</ref> a small college town south of [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]. She was the youngest of five daughters of Dr. Lorenzo Mullican, DDS, and his wife, Cora Bell Hicks. Dr. Mullican had a dental practice in Indianola. The family owned a large house with 22 rooms, some of which they rented out to students attending nearby [[Simpson College]].\n\nPriscilla and one of her sisters, Rosemary, traveled to Des Moines every weekend to study dancing with Rose Lorenz, renown dance teacher<ref name=\"Betty Hill Dance\">{{ cite web|access-date=1 April 2020 |url=https://www.bettyhilldance.com/erabetty.htm |title=The Era of Miss Betty: 1955 to 1975}}</ref> at the time.  The girls made their first professional appearance September 30, 1930, at Des Moines' Paramount Theater. Priscilla, then 15, performed on stage as part of the entertainment accompanying the release of her sister Lola's Hollywood movie ''[[Good News (1930 film)|Good News]]'' (1930).\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Priscilla was permitted to travel to New York to visit a third sister, Leota, who was then appearing in a musical revue in Manhattan. Priscilla enrolled at the nearby Fagen School of Dramatics, and Leota paid the fee. At this time, talent agent Al Altman saw Priscilla performing in one of Fagen's school plays and invited her to [[screentest]] for [[MGM]]. She was 16 years old. Priscilla wrote to a friend in Indianola, \"Leota accompanied me to a sort of theater in a New York skyscraper. Others were there being made up. One was a strange looking girl with her hair slicked back in a sort of a bun. Her name is said to be [[Katharine Hepburn|Catherine Hepburn]] [sic]. Not very pretty, I thought, but Mr. Altman said she has something. [[Margaret Sullavan]], the Broadway actress, was there too!\" A follow-up letter said that her test had proven unsuitable. Neither Hepburn nor Sullavan were approved, and neither received a contract from MGM at the time.\n\nIn 1932, Cora and Rosemary arrived in New York. Cora immediately went to work pushing her two young daughters into attending auditions for various prospective Broadway productions, without success. During a tryout at a music publishing office, orchestra leader and radio personality [[Fred Waring]] heard them harmonizing. He found them attractive and talented and soon signed them to a radio contract. Priscilla, who at this time adopted the surname Lane, quickly became known as the comedienne of the group. Rosemary sang the ballads, while Priscilla performed the swing numbers and wisecracked with Waring and various guests.  Back in Iowa, Dr. Mullican instituted divorce proceedings against his wife on the grounds of desertion, and the divorce was granted in 1933.\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:Priscilla Lane Cowboy from Brooklyn trailer.jpg|thumb|Priscilla Lane in ''[[Cowboy from Brooklyn]]'', 1938]]\nRosemary and Priscilla remained with Fred Waring for almost five years. In 1937, Waring was engaged by [[Warner Bros.]] in Hollywood to appear with his entire band in ''[[Varsity Show (film)|Varsity Show]]'', a musical starring [[Dick Powell]]. Both Rosemary and Priscilla were tested and awarded feature roles in the film. Rosemary shared the romantic passages with Powell, while Priscilla played a high-spirited college girl.\n\nWarner Bros. purchased Priscilla and Rosemary's contract from Fred Waring and signed them to seven-year pacts.<ref name=\"independent\"/> Priscilla's first film after ''Varsity Show'' was ''[[Men Are Such Fools]]'' (1938), in which she starred with [[Wayne Morris (American actor)|Wayne Morris]]. This was followed by ''Love Honor and Behave'' (also 1938), another light romantic comedy with Morris, who, playing her husband, [[spanked]] her 47 times in a scene for which she declined a double, and ''[[Cowboy from Brooklyn]]'', again teaming with Dick Powell. The publicity department at the studio suggested that Priscilla and Morris be seen together around town. They liked each other and did date for a period; however, Priscilla later said it was never serious on either side.\n\nPriscilla was next assigned the lead in ''[[Brother Rat]]'', which had been a very successful Broadway play. Again she played opposite Wayne Morris, and among the cast were newcomers [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Jane Wyman]], [[Jane Bryan]], and [[Eddie Albert]]. The film, when released in October 1938, was a big success for all the young players. At this time of professional success, the sisters were informed that Dr. Mullican had died in Iowa.\n\nAfter winning her raise, Priscilla returned to work, but the films assigned to her were no better than those she had turned down. ''[[Brother Rat and a Baby]]'' (aka, ''Baby Be Good'', 1940) was an inferior sequel and ''[[Three Cheers for the Irish]]'' (also 1940) gave her little to do.\n\nThe British ''[[Picturegoer]]'' magazine, always a supporter of the Lane Sisters, stated that all was not right with Priscilla Lane. In its June 15, 1940 issue, they wondered why \"Priscilla was still knocking at the door of major stardom\". They felt Warner Bros. was casting her as stooge to such actors as [[John Garfield]] and [[James Cagney]]. They went on to say Priscilla had great charm and while not a really great dramatic actress, deserved much larger and more important roles than she was getting. The same magazine, two years later on August 22, 1942, referred to their 1940 article and once again expressed disappointment at Warners' treatment of the star. They were unaware that she had already left the studio.\n\nOn April 28, 1941, she was heard on ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' with [[George Brent]] and [[Gail Patrick]] in ''Wife, Husband and Friend''. At Warner Bros. she appeared opposite [[Ronald Reagan]] in a lighthearted comedy, ''[[Million Dollar Baby (1941 film)|Million Dollar Baby]]'' (1941) and as a night club singer in ''[[Blues in the Night]]'' (also 1941).\n\n[[Frank Capra]] requested her for the lead opposite [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]''. The comedy film was completed in early 1942, but was not released until 1944; it was held up by contractual agreement not to distribute the film until the play's long Broadway run was over. It was Priscilla's last Warner film. Her contract was terminated by mutual agreement after five years with the studio.\n\nShe freelanced next, signing a one-picture deal with [[Universal Studios]] where she starred with [[Robert Cummings]] in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942). The director did not want either Cummings or Lane for their roles. Hitchcock felt Lane was too much the girl next door. Universal insisted that they play the leads, and when the film was released, her acting was praised while some criticism was focused on Hitchcock for reworking so much from his earlier films into this wartime spy drama.\n\nShe had commitments for two more films. The first was ''Silver Queen'' (1942) for producer [[Harry Sherman]] in which she co-starred with [[George Brent]]. She played the owner of a gambling house in 1870s San Francisco. The other film was a [[Jack Benny]] comedy, ''The Meanest Man in the World'', released in January 1943. Lane then retired from films. For the duration of the war, she followed her husband across America as he moved from one military base to another. She was generous with her talents and often performed at camp shows.\n\nWhile living in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]], she was offered and accepted the leading role in ''Fun on a Weekend'' (1947) for producer\u2013director [[Andrew L. Stone|Andrew Stone]], co-starring [[Eddie Bracken]]. When the film was released, ''Variety'' opined, \"Miss Lane, who's been absent from films for some time, gives a good enough performance which should ensure her work in more pictures.\" However, Lane returned to domestic life. Once again she and her husband moved, this time to [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City]].\n\nLane accepted the offer of the lead role opposite [[Lawrence Tierney]] in a [[film noir]], ''[[Bodyguard (1948 film)|Bodyguard]]'' (1948), starring as Doris Brewster. During an interview with a Hollywood correspondent, she stated, \"I didn't realize how much I miss filming until I came back. I love this work, and I hope to make many, many more pictures.\" ''Bodyguard'' would be her last picture. An expected contract with [[RKO Studios]] did not come to pass.\n\nIn January 1951, Cora Mullican died at the [[San Fernando Valley]] home her daughters had bought for her years earlier. Priscilla returned to show business briefly in 1958 with her own show on a local television station broadcasting from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Titled ''The Priscilla Lane Show'', she chatted and interviewed celebrities visiting the area. She enjoyed the television experience, but family demands proved too much, and she gave up after a year.<ref name=\"allmovie\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{onesource|section|date=January 2019}}\nLane dated assistant director and screenwriter [[Oren W. Haglund]], later the production manager of eleven [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] [[television series]] of the 1950s and 1960s. Impulsively she eloped with Haglund to [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], [[Arizona]], on January 14, 1939, but left him the following day. The marriage was soon annulled. In November 1941, Lane became engaged to publisher John Barry, whom she had first met in 1939. She wrote in the November issue of ''[[Photoplay]]'' about how she looked forward to their marriage and would continue her career.\n\nIn early 1942, the engagement to Barry ended after she met Joseph Howard, a young  Army Air Corps lieutenant, at a [[dude ranch]] in the [[Mojave Desert]]. A native of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], [[Massachusetts]], he had joined the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] straight from college in 1939. He was scouting the area for likely sites for air bases and had taken a short vacation. The couple were married on May 22, 1942, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], at the home of the executive officer of an Army Air Force gunnery school.\n\nAt the war's end in 1945, Lane and Howard were living in [[New Mexico]] and she was pregnant with their first child. Their son, Joseph Lawrence, was born on December 31, 1945. In 1946, after Howard's discharge from the service, the couple moved back to California, where they resided in [[Victorville, California|Victorville]]. Howard, who had a degree in engineering, became a building contractor. The family moved to [[Van Nuys, California|Van Nuys]] in December 1945. Afterwards Howard and Lane moved to [[Studio City]]. Priscilla became pregnant again in 1949. On April 17, 1950, her daughter Hannah was born. By June 1951, the boom in the construction industry in [[New England]] had Lane and her family moving back to Howard's native Massachusetts. Howard left the final decision to end her career to Lane, who later declared she never regretted her choice. She fell in love with New England, and the couple settled with their children in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], Massachusetts. Lane was busy with her family. She gave birth to a second daughter, Judith, on August 22, 1953. The Howards' fourth and youngest child James was born December 4, 1955. During the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election]], she, along with her sisters, all of whom were registered as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]s, supported the campaign of [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]<ref>'''Motion Picture and Television Magazine'', November 1952, page 33, Ideal Publishers</ref>\n\nOutside her family, Priscilla remained busy. She was devoutly religious, having converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], as had her elder sister Lola.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MoeBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=Lola+and+Priscilla+Lane+converted+to+Catholicism&source=bl&ots=6CERRnTTOx&sig=CyOUYCEh5ee6z72KWdrwiBEOUm0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjV7LfNy9rfAhWEct8KHRMbAK4Q6AEwC3oECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=Lola+and+Priscilla+Lane+converted+to+Catholicism&f=false|title=Hal Wallis: Producer to the Stars|page=209|first=Bernard F.|last=Dick|date=13 January 2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|accessdate=7 January 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> The family attended church regularly, and she was involved with Catholic charities. She enjoyed tending her garden, and growing flowers and vegetables. She ran a Girl Scout troop and volunteered at local hospitals. In July 1972, Joe Howard retired from business, and he and Lane moved to their summer home at 7 Howards Grove in [[Derry, New Hampshire]]. Howard died suddenly on May 18, 1976, aged 60. He was still in the Air Force Reserve, which he had joined after his discharge from active duty in 1946. Heartbroken, Priscilla remained in Derry. She said, more than a year later in 1977, \"I'm still trying to pull myself together after Joe's death.\" She busied herself with volunteer work and her garden.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Death==\nLane was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1994. She moved to a nursing home, Wingate, in Andover near her son Joe and his family. She died there at 7:30&nbsp;a.m. on April 4, 1995, from lung cancer and chronic heart failure, aged 79.<ref name=\"allmovie\"/> A funeral mass was celebrated at St. Matthew's Church in [[Windham, New Hampshire]], and burial followed at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

She is best remembered for her roles in the films ''[[The Roaring Twenties]]'' (1939) co-starring with [[James Cagney]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]; ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942), an  [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film in which she plays the heroine, and ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944), in which she portrays [[Cary Grant]]'s fianc\u00e9e and bride.<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite web|last=Shipman |first=David |title=Obituary: Priscilla Lane |work=The Independent |date=April 10, 1995 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-priscilla-lane-1615023.html |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nPriscilla Mullican was born on June 12, 1915, in [[Indianola, Iowa]],<ref name=\"allmovie\">{{cite web|last=Erickson |first=Hal |title=priscilla Lane |work=AllMovie |url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/priscilla-lane-p40378 |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}</ref> a small college town south of [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]. She was the youngest of five daughters of Dr. Lorenzo Mullican, DDS, and his wife, Cora Bell Hicks. Dr. Mullican had a dental practice in Indianola. The family owned a large house with 22 rooms, some of which they rented out to students attending nearby [[Simpson College]].\n\nPriscilla and one of her sisters, Rosemary, traveled to Des Moines every weekend to study dancing with Rose Lorenz, renown dance teacher<ref name=\"Betty Hill Dance\">{{ cite web|access date=01 April 2020 url=https://www.bettyhilldance.com/erabetty.htm>}}</ref> at the time.  The girls made their first professional appearance September 30, 1930, at Des Moines' Paramount Theater. Priscilla, then 15, performed on stage as part of the entertainment accompanying the release of her sister Lola's Hollywood movie ''[[Good News (1930 film)|Good News]]'' (1930).\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Priscilla was permitted to travel to New York to visit a third sister, Leota, who was then appearing in a musical revue in Manhattan. Priscilla enrolled at the nearby Fagen School of Dramatics, and Leota paid the fee. At this time, talent agent Al Altman saw Priscilla performing in one of Fagen's school plays and invited her to [[screentest]] for [[MGM]]. She was 16 years old. Priscilla wrote to a friend in Indianola, \"Leota accompanied me to a sort of theater in a New York skyscraper. Others were there being made up. One was a strange looking girl with her hair slicked back in a sort of a bun. Her name is said to be [[Katharine Hepburn|Catherine Hepburn]] [sic]. Not very pretty, I thought, but Mr. Altman said she has something. [[Margaret Sullavan]], the Broadway actress, was there too!\" A follow-up letter said that her test had proven unsuitable. Neither Hepburn nor Sullavan were approved, and neither received a contract from MGM at the time.\n\nIn 1932, Cora and Rosemary arrived in New York. Cora immediately went to work pushing her two young daughters into attending auditions for various prospective Broadway productions, without success. During a tryout at a music publishing office, orchestra leader and radio personality [[Fred Waring]] heard them harmonizing. He found them attractive and talented and soon signed them to a radio contract. Priscilla, who at this time adopted the surname Lane, quickly became known as the comedienne of the group. Rosemary sang the ballads, while Priscilla performed the swing numbers and wisecracked with Waring and various guests.  Back in Iowa, Dr. Mullican instituted divorce proceedings against his wife on the grounds of desertion, and the divorce was granted in 1933.\n\n==Film career==\n[[File:Priscilla Lane Cowboy from Brooklyn trailer.jpg|thumb|Priscilla Lane in ''[[Cowboy from Brooklyn]]'', 1938]]\nRosemary and Priscilla remained with Fred Waring for almost five years. In 1937, Waring was engaged by [[Warner Bros.]] in Hollywood to appear with his entire band in ''[[Varsity Show (film)|Varsity Show]]'', a musical starring [[Dick Powell]]. Both Rosemary and Priscilla were tested and awarded feature roles in the film. Rosemary shared the romantic passages with Powell, while Priscilla played a high-spirited college girl.\n\nWarner Bros. purchased Priscilla and Rosemary's contract from Fred Waring and signed them to seven-year pacts.<ref name=\"independent\"/> Priscilla's first film after ''Varsity Show'' was ''[[Men Are Such Fools]]'' (1938), in which she starred with [[Wayne Morris (American actor)|Wayne Morris]]. This was followed by ''Love Honor and Behave'' (also 1938), another light romantic comedy with Morris, who, playing her husband, [[spanked]] her 47 times in a scene for which she declined a double, and ''[[Cowboy from Brooklyn]]'', again teaming with Dick Powell. The publicity department at the studio suggested that Priscilla and Morris be seen together around town. They liked each other and did date for a period; however, Priscilla later said it was never serious on either side.\n\nPriscilla was next assigned the lead in ''[[Brother Rat]]'', which had been a very successful Broadway play. Again she played opposite Wayne Morris, and among the cast were newcomers [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Jane Wyman]], [[Jane Bryan]], and [[Eddie Albert]]. The film, when released in October 1938, was a big success for all the young players. At this time of professional success, the sisters were informed that Dr. Mullican had died in Iowa.\n\nAfter winning her raise, Priscilla returned to work, but the films assigned to her were no better than those she had turned down. ''[[Brother Rat and a Baby]]'' (aka, ''Baby Be Good'', 1940) was an inferior sequel and ''[[Three Cheers for the Irish]]'' (also 1940) gave her little to do.\n\nThe British ''[[Picturegoer]]'' magazine, always a supporter of the Lane Sisters, stated that all was not right with Priscilla Lane. In its June 15, 1940 issue, they wondered why \"Priscilla was still knocking at the door of major stardom\". They felt Warner Bros. was casting her as stooge to such actors as [[John Garfield]] and [[James Cagney]]. They went on to say Priscilla had great charm and while not a really great dramatic actress, deserved much larger and more important roles than she was getting. The same magazine, two years later on August 22, 1942, referred to their 1940 article and once again expressed disappointment at Warners' treatment of the star. They were unaware that she had already left the studio.\n\nOn April 28, 1941, she was heard on ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' with [[George Brent]] and [[Gail Patrick]] in ''Wife, Husband and Friend''. At Warner Bros. she appeared opposite [[Ronald Reagan]] in a lighthearted comedy, ''[[Million Dollar Baby (1941 film)|Million Dollar Baby]]'' (1941) and as a night club singer in ''[[Blues in the Night]]'' (also 1941).\n\n[[Frank Capra]] requested her for the lead opposite [[Cary Grant]] in ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]''. The comedy film was completed in early 1942, but was not released until 1944; it was held up by contractual agreement not to distribute the film until the play's long Broadway run was over. It was Priscilla's last Warner film. Her contract was terminated by mutual agreement after five years with the studio.\n\nShe freelanced next, signing a one-picture deal with [[Universal Studios]] where she starred with [[Robert Cummings]] in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942). The director did not want either Cummings or Lane for their roles. Hitchcock felt Lane was too much the girl next door. Universal insisted that they play the leads, and when the film was released, her acting was praised while some criticism was focused on Hitchcock for reworking so much from his earlier films into this wartime spy drama.\n\nShe had commitments for two more films. The first was ''Silver Queen'' (1942) for producer [[Harry Sherman]] in which she co-starred with [[George Brent]]. She played the owner of a gambling house in 1870s San Francisco. The other film was a [[Jack Benny]] comedy, ''The Meanest Man in the World'', released in January 1943. Lane then retired from films. For the duration of the war, she followed her husband across America as he moved from one military base to another. She was generous with her talents and often performed at camp shows.\n\nWhile living in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles|Van Nuys]], she was offered and accepted the leading role in ''Fun on a Weekend'' (1947) for producer\u2013director [[Andrew L. Stone|Andrew Stone]], co-starring [[Eddie Bracken]]. When the film was released, ''Variety'' opined, \"Miss Lane, who's been absent from films for some time, gives a good enough performance which should ensure her work in more pictures.\" However, Lane returned to domestic life. Once again she and her husband moved, this time to [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City]].\n\nLane accepted the offer of the lead role opposite [[Lawrence Tierney]] in a [[film noir]], ''[[Bodyguard (1948 film)|Bodyguard]]'' (1948), starring as Doris Brewster. During an interview with a Hollywood correspondent, she stated, \"I didn't realize how much I miss filming until I came back. I love this work, and I hope to make many, many more pictures.\" ''Bodyguard'' would be her last picture. An expected contract with [[RKO Studios]] did not come to pass.\n\nIn January 1951, Cora Mullican died at the [[San Fernando Valley]] home her daughters had bought for her years earlier. Priscilla returned to show business briefly in 1958 with her own show on a local television station broadcasting from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Titled ''The Priscilla Lane Show'', she chatted and interviewed celebrities visiting the area. She enjoyed the television experience, but family demands proved too much, and she gave up after a year.<ref name=\"allmovie\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{onesource|section|date=January 2019}}\nLane dated assistant director and screenwriter [[Oren W. Haglund]], later the production manager of eleven [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Brothers]] [[television series]] of the 1950s and 1960s. Impulsively she eloped with Haglund to [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], [[Arizona]], on January 14, 1939, but left him the following day. The marriage was soon annulled. In November 1941, Lane became engaged to publisher John Barry, whom she had first met in 1939. She wrote in the November issue of ''[[Photoplay]]'' about how she looked forward to their marriage and would continue her career.\n\nIn early 1942, the engagement to Barry ended after she met Joseph Howard, a young  Army Air Corps lieutenant, at a [[dude ranch]] in the [[Mojave Desert]]. A native of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], [[Massachusetts]], he had joined the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] straight from college in 1939. He was scouting the area for likely sites for air bases and had taken a short vacation. The couple were married on May 22, 1942, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], at the home of the executive officer of an Army Air Force gunnery school.\n\nAt the war's end in 1945, Lane and Howard were living in [[New Mexico]] and she was pregnant with their first child. Their son, Joseph Lawrence, was born on December 31, 1945. In 1946, after Howard's discharge from the service, the couple moved back to California, where they resided in [[Victorville, California|Victorville]]. Howard, who had a degree in engineering, became a building contractor. The family moved to [[Van Nuys, California|Van Nuys]] in December 1945. Afterwards Howard and Lane moved to [[Studio City]]. Priscilla became pregnant again in 1949. On April 17, 1950, her daughter Hannah was born. By June 1951, the boom in the construction industry in [[New England]] had Lane and her family moving back to Howard's native Massachusetts. Howard left the final decision to end her career to Lane, who later declared she never regretted her choice. She fell in love with New England, and the couple settled with their children in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], Massachusetts. Lane was busy with her family. She gave birth to a second daughter, Judith, on August 22, 1953. The Howards' fourth and youngest child James was born December 4, 1955. During the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election]], she, along with her sisters, all of whom were registered as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]s, supported the campaign of [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]<ref>'''Motion Picture and Television Magazine'', November 1952, page 33, Ideal Publishers</ref>\n\nOutside her family, Priscilla remained busy. She was devoutly religious, having converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], as had her elder sister Lola.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8MoeBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA209&lpg=PA209&dq=Lola+and+Priscilla+Lane+converted+to+Catholicism&source=bl&ots=6CERRnTTOx&sig=CyOUYCEh5ee6z72KWdrwiBEOUm0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjV7LfNy9rfAhWEct8KHRMbAK4Q6AEwC3oECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=Lola+and+Priscilla+Lane+converted+to+Catholicism&f=false|title=Hal Wallis: Producer to the Stars|page=209|first=Bernard F.|last=Dick|date=13 January 2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|accessdate=7 January 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> The family attended church regularly, and she was involved with Catholic charities. She enjoyed tending her garden, and growing flowers and vegetables. She ran a Girl Scout troop and volunteered at local hospitals. In July 1972, Joe Howard retired from business, and he and Lane moved to their summer home at 7 Howards Grove in [[Derry, New Hampshire]]. Howard died suddenly on May 18, 1976, aged 60. He was still in the Air Force Reserve, which he had joined after his discharge from active duty in 1946. Heartbroken, Priscilla remained in Derry. She said, more than a year later in 1977, \"I'm still trying to pull myself together after Joe's death.\" She busied herself with volunteer work and her garden.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Death==\nLane was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] in 1994. She moved to a nursing home, Wingate, in Andover near her son Joe and his family. She died there at 7:30&nbsp;a.m. on April 4, 1995, from lung cancer and chronic heart failure, aged 79.<ref name=\"allmovie\"/> A funeral mass was celebrated at St. Matthew's Church in [[Windham, New Hampshire]], and burial followed at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

One less restrictive means is Section 504 of the Act, which requires a cable operator, upon request of a subscriber to fully scramble or otherwise block a channel that the subscriber does not wish to receive.\n\nThe United States appealed directly to the Supreme Court, seeking to have the judgment reversed.\n\nA group of sexologists filed an [[amicus brief]] on behalf of Playboy arguing that there was no state interest in shielding minors from sexually explicit signal bleed. The brief's authors included [[Elizabeth Rice Allgeier]], [[Vern L. Bullough]], [[Milton Diamond]], [[Harold I. Lief]], [[John Money]], and [[Ira L. Reiss]].<ref>[http://ncac.org/update/amici-curiae-in-usa-vs-playboy-entertainment-group-inc/ Amici Curiae Brief]</ref>\n\n== Opinion of the Court ==\nAffirming the District Court, the Supreme Court held, in an opinion authored by Justice [[Anthony M. Kennedy]], that Section 505 was a content-based restriction because the provision singled out not only particular programming but also particular programmers.<ref name=opinion />\n\nMoreover, although the Court accepted the Government's compelling interests, it nevertheless concluded that the provision violated the First Amendment's free speech clause because the Government failed to prove that Section 505 was the least restrictive means of preventing children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal bleed. \nThe Court stated that Section 504 presented such an alternative means of regulation.\n\nThe Government argued that Section 504 was less effective than the blocking and time-channeling provision of Section 505. However, the Court held that Section 504, combined with \u201cmarket-based solutions such as programmable televisions, VCR's, and mapping systems\u201d can eliminate signal bleed without restricting a cable operator's ability to transmit its programming to those who want to receive it.<ref>''Playboy Entm't Grp., Inc.'', 529 U.S. at 821.</ref>\n\nThe Court concluded that because of the existence of such alternatives, which could be equally effective at furthering the Government's interest, the overly restrictive Section 505 violated the First Amendment.\n\nJustices [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], [[David Souter|Souter]], [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]], and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] joined with Kennedy in the majority.\n\n=== Concurrences ===\nStevens and Thomas filed concurring opinions. Stevens's concurrence specifically addressed Scalia's criticisms of the majority opinion. Stevens argued that Scalia defined obscenity too broadly and could include practices that were merely deceptive.\n\nThomas noted in his concurrence that he would have decided the case differently if the broadcasts were of obscene material. He posited that the government had merely argued that the broadcasts were indecent. First Amendment protections have more sway over merely indecent material than outright obscene material. Thus, the balancing of interests weighed in favor of upholding First Amendment protection.\n\n=== Dissents ===\nJustice [[Stephen G. Breyer]] authored a [[dissent]], arguing that the majority of the court had not made a \"realistic assessment of the alternatives.\"<ref>''Playboy Entm't Grp., Inc.'', 529 U.S. at 846 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</ref> Breyer was joined in his dissent by Justices [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]], and [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]].\n\nJustice Scalia also authored his own dissent arguing that Section 505 is constitutional because it regulates the business of obscenity.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Freedom of speech}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{caselaw source\n | case = ''United States v.

Playboy Entm't Grp., Inc.'', {{ussc|volume=529|page=803|pin=|year=2000}}. {{usgovpd}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nIn order to shield children from hearing or seeing images resulting from [[signal bleed]], the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] enacted Section 505 of the  Telecommunications Act of 1996 on the basis of a handful of complaints. No [[congressional hearing]] was held.<ref>[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/playboy-signal-bleed-case-never-should-have-been-a-case First Amendment Center, The Playboy Signal Bleed Case Should Never Have Been A Case]</ref>\n\nSection 505 required cable television operators providing channels \u201cprimarily dedicated to sexually-oriented programs\u201d either to completely scramble or otherwise block those channels, or to limit their transmission hours to when children were unlikely to view. Administrative regulations defined children as unlikely to view programming between 10 pm to 6 am.<ref>{{USCSub|47|561|a}}.</ref><ref name=\"FCC\">{{Citation | last = Federal Communications Commission | title = Obscenity, Indecency, and Profanity | ref = FCC | url = http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity| date = 2015-12-11}}</ref>\n\n[[Playboy Entertainment|Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.]] challenged Section 505\u2019s constitutionality, claiming that the provision violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].\n\n===Procedural history===\nA three-judge panel of the [[United States District Court for the District of Delaware]] held that Section 505 was a [[Freedom of speech in the United States#Content-based restrictions|content-based restriction]] on speech that was subject to [[strict scrutiny]].<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Playboy Entm't Grp., Inc. v. United States |vol=30 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=702 |pinpoint= |court=D.

One less restrictive means is Section 504 of the Act, which requires a cable operator, upon request of a subscriber to fully scramble or otherwise block a channel that the subscriber does not wish to receive.\n\nThe United States appealed directly to the Supreme Court, seeking to have the judgment reversed.\n\nA group of sexologists filed an [[amicus brief]] on behalf of Playboy arguing that there was no state interest in shielding minors from sexually explicit signal bleed. The brief's authors included [[Elizabeth Rice Allgeier]], [[Vern L. Bullough]], [[Milton Diamond]], [[Harold I. Lief]], [[John Money]], and [[Ira L. Reiss]].<ref>[http://ncac.org/update/amici-curiae-in-usa-vs-playboy-entertainment-group-inc/ Amici Curiae Brief]</ref>\n\n== Opinion of the Court ==\nAffirming the District Court, the Supreme Court held, in an opinion authored by Justice [[Anthony M. Kennedy]], that Section 505 was a content-based restriction because the provision singled out not only particular programming but also particular programmers.<ref name=opinion />\n\nMoreover, although the Court accepted the Government\u2019s compelling interests, it nevertheless concluded that the provision violated the First Amendment's free speech clause because the Government failed to prove that Section 505 was the least restrictive means of preventing children from hearing or seeing images resulting from signal bleed. \nThe Court stated that Section 504 presented such an alternative means of regulation.\n\nThe Government argued that Section 504 was less effective than the blocking and time-channeling provision of Section 505. However, the Court held that Section 504, combined with \u201cmarket-based solutions such as programmable televisions, VCR's, and mapping systems\u201d can eliminate signal bleed without restricting a cable operator's ability to transmit its programming to those who want to receive it.<ref>''Playboy Entm't Grp., Inc.'', 529 U.S. at 821.</ref>\n\nThe Court concluded that because of the existence of such alternatives, which could be equally effective at furthering the Government's interest, the overly restrictive Section 505 violated the First Amendment.\n\nJustices [[John Paul Stevens|Stevens]], [[David Souter|Souter]], [[Clarence Thomas|Thomas]], and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg|Ginsburg]] joined with Kennedy in the majority.\n\n=== Concurrences ===\nStevens and Thomas filed concurring opinions. Stevens's concurrence specifically addressed Scalia's criticisms of the majority opinion. Stevens argued that Scalia defined obscenity too broadly and could include practices that were merely deceptive.\n\nThomas noted in his concurrence that he would have decided the case differently if the broadcasts were of obscene material. He posited that the government had merely argued that the broadcasts were indecent. First Amendment protections have more sway over merely indecent material than outright obscene material. Thus, the balancing of interests weighed in favor of upholding First Amendment protection.\n\n=== Dissents ===\nJustice [[Stephen G. Breyer]] authored a [[dissent]], arguing that the majority of the court had not made a \"realistic assessment of the alternatives.\"<ref>''Playboy Entm't Grp., Inc.'', 529 U.S. at 846 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</ref> Breyer was joined in his dissent by Justices [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor|O'Connor]], and [[Antonin Scalia|Scalia]].\n\nJustice Scalia also authored his own dissent arguing that Section 505 is constitutional because it regulates the business of obscenity.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Freedom of speech}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{caselaw source\n | case = ''United States v.
