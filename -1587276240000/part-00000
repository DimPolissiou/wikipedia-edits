The ''Dominion Express,'' for both north and south directions had coach, cafe coach and sleeper equipment.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pennsylvania Railroad, Table 155|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=74 |issue=1 |date=June 1941}}</ref> Even in the 1950s period of origin from Philadelphia to New York, the southbound ''Dominion Express'' ended in Philadelphia, not New York.<ref>Pennsylvania Railroad timetable, January 18, 1954, Table 31 http://streamlinermemories.info/PRR/PRR54-1TT.pdf</ref> In February 1958 the ''Dominion Express'' ended, and the overnight service was picked up by the Washington, D.C. -- Erie, Pennsylvania ''Northern Express,'' #575 (''Southern Express,'' #574, when heading south-bound). The Erie and Buffalo originating branches of that train would converge at Emporium, Pennsylvania, and continue south to Washington. A supplemental set of through sleepers operated from Buffalo to New York and back. By this time, the train's [[sleeping car|sleeper]] equipment eliminated open-sections and consisted only of [roomettte]]s and other private rooms.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Pennsylvania Railroad, Tables 82, 83|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=91 |issue=3 |date=August 1958}}</ref>\n\n==Demise==\nFrom 1958 to 1968 the southbound version of the train, #570, was called the ''Baltimore Day Express.''

The Penn Central ran the train as a multi-segment overnight train. The train ran as #575, departing at 11:35 pm from Harrisburg to Buffalo. It picked up passengers from #3 (the ''[[Penn Texas]]'') from New York to Harrisburg. There was no Washington-originating train synchronized to meet the train in the Penn Central years.Table 42. <ref>{{cite journal |title=Penn Central, Table 42|journal=Official Guide of the Railways |publisher=National Railway Publication Company |volume=101 |issue=1 |date=June 1968}}</ref>\n\nAmtrak dropped the line altogether, when it began on May 1, 1971, thus ending decades of service north of Harrisburg to Buffalo, leaving medium-sized cities such as Williamsport outside of the national passenger train network.<ref>Trains magazine, 'Passenger trains operating on the eve of Amtrak' https://ctr.trains.com/~/media/import/files/pdf/f/7/7/passenger_trains_operating_on_the_eve_of_amtrak.pdf</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Named passenger trains of the United States]]\n[[Category:Passenger rail transportation in Maryland]]\n[[Category:Passenger rail transportation in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Passenger rail transportation in Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Passenger trains of the Pennsylvania Railroad]]\n", "name_user": "Dogru144", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNighttime counterpart:lin k fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Day_Express"}

[[John Alden Shoudy]] came to the [[Kittitas Valley]] in 1871, and purchased a small trading post from Andrew Jackson \"A.J.\" Splawn, called \"Robber's Roost.\"   Robber's Roost was the first business in the valley, other than the early trading that occurred among Native Americans, cattle drivers, trappers, and miners. Robber's Roost was located on the present-day 3rd Avenue, just west of Main Street near the alley.  There is a placard on the wall commemorating the location, as well as a small stone monument against the wall on the sidewalk.  Shoudy named the town after his wife, Mary Ellen Shoudy; thus officially began the city of Ellensburgh around 1872. Shoudy was not the first settler in the [[Kittitas Valley]], nor was he the first businessperson, but he was responsible for platting the city of Ellensburgh in the 1870s, and he was the person who named the streets in the downtown district.\n\nThe city was originally named '''Ellensburgh''', until the final -''h'' was dropped under standardization pressure from the [[United States Postal Service]] and [[United States Board on Geographic Names|Board of Geography Names]] in 1894.<ref>Kirk (1995:123)</ref>\n\nThere were several early newspapers in Ellensburg.  The Daily Record, however, began in 1909 and is the name of the local newspaper today.<ref name=\"Visit Ellensburg\"/>\n\nConcerns over the state of Ellensburg's historic downtown led to the formation of the Ellensburg Downtown Association to work on revitalizing the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellensburgdowntown.org|title=Shop, Dine, Visit - Ellensburg Downtown Association - Ellensburg, WA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Arts and culture==\nThe City of Ellensburg is home to a number of local art museums and galleries: \n*Kittitas County Historical Museum <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kchm.org/|title=KITTITAS COUNTY HISTORICAL MUSEUM, ELLENSBURG, WA|publisher=}}</ref>\n*The Goodey Gallery <ref>{{cite web|url=http://westernartassociation.org/|title=The National Fine Art Show & Auction \u2013 May 19, 20 & 21, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n*Clymer Museum and Gallery<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clymermuseum.com/|title=Clymer Museum and Gallery - The Spirit of America|access-date=May 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527000240/http://www.clymermuseum.com/|archive-date=May 27, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n*[[Gallery One Visual Arts Center|Gallery-One Visual Arts Center]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery-one.org/|title=Home Page|publisher=}}</ref>\n*420 Loft Art Gallery <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.420building.com/index.php|title=420 Building|publisher=}}</ref>\n*Sarah Spurgeon Gallery, Central Washington University (CWU) Department of Art <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwu.edu/art/sarah-spurgeon|title=Art - Sarah Spurgeon|publisher=}}</ref>\n*Museum of Culture & Environment, Central Washington University<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwu.edu/museum/|title=Museum|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nEvery first Friday of each month, Ellensburg hosts First Friday Art Walk from 5:00 to 7:00 pm.

There are several local [[hay]] brokering and processing operations that ship to [[Pacific Rim]] countries.\nDowntown Ellensburg has many historic buildings, many of which were constructed in the late 19th century.

[[John Alden Shoudy]] came to the [[Kittitas Valley]] in 1871, and purchased a small trading post from Andrew Jackson \"A.J.\" Splawn, called \"Robber's Roost.\"   Robber's Roost was the first business in the valley, other than the early trading that occurred among Native Americans, cattle drivers, trappers, and miners. Robber's Roost was located on the present-day 3rd Avenue, just west of Main Street near the alley.  There is a placard on the wall commemorating the location, as well as a small stone monument against the wall on the sidewalk.  Shoudy named the town after his wife, Mary Ellen Shoudy, thus officially began the city of Ellensburgh around 1872. Shoudy was not the first settler in the [[Kittitas Valley]], nor was he the first businessperson, but he was responsible for platting the city of Ellensburgh in the 1870s, and he was the person who named the streets in the downtown district.\n\nThe city was originally named '''Ellensburgh''', until the final -''h'' was dropped under standardization pressure from the [[United States Postal Service]] and [[United States Board on Geographic Names|Board of Geography Names]] in 1894.<ref>Kirk (1995:123)</ref>\n\nThere were several early newspapers in Ellensburg.  The Daily Record, however, began in 1909 and is the name of the local newspaper today.<ref name=\"Visit Ellensburg\"/>\n\nConcerns over the state of Ellensburg's historic downtown led to the formation of the Ellensburg Downtown Association to work on revitalizing the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ellensburgdowntown.org|title=Shop, Dine, Visit - Ellensburg Downtown Association - Ellensburg, WA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Arts and culture==\nThe City of Ellensburg is home to a number of local art museums and galleries: \n*Kittitas County Historical Museum <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kchm.org/|title=KITTITAS COUNTY HISTORICAL MUSEUM, ELLENSBURG, WA|publisher=}}</ref>\n*The Goodey Gallery <ref>{{cite web|url=http://westernartassociation.org/|title=The National Fine Art Show & Auction \u2013 May 19, 20 & 21, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n*Clymer Museum and Gallery<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clymermuseum.com/|title=Clymer Museum and Gallery - The Spirit of America|access-date=May 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527000240/http://www.clymermuseum.com/|archive-date=May 27, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n*[[Gallery One Visual Arts Center|Gallery-One Visual Arts Center]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery-one.org/|title=Home Page|publisher=}}</ref>\n*420 Loft Art Gallery <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.420building.com/index.php|title=420 Building|publisher=}}</ref>\n*Sarah Spurgeon Gallery, Central Washington University (CWU) Department of Art <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwu.edu/art/sarah-spurgeon|title=Art - Sarah Spurgeon|publisher=}}</ref>\n*Museum of Culture & Environment, Central Washington University<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwu.edu/museum/|title=Museum|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nEvery first Friday of each month, Ellensburg hosts First Friday Art Walk from 5:00 to 7:00 pm.

It is a continuation of the ''[[V (franchise)|V]]'' franchise about an alien invasion of Earth by a carnivorous race of [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilians]] known as \"[[Visitors (V franchise)|Visitors]]\", which was originally conceived by American writer, producer, and director [[Kenneth Johnson (producer)|Kenneth Johnson]]. Johnson, however, was not involved in the production of the weekly series.<!--not referenced before million sentence--> At a cost of one million dollars per episode, ''V'' was the most expensive series to be produced for television at that time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Terrace|first=Vincent|title=Encyclopedia of Television: Series, Pilots, and Specials, Volume 2 1974\u20131985|year=1985|publisher=VNR AG|pages=500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AKlgjBCPPnsC&pg=PA432&dq=v+1984+diana&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KjOYUKIP7LbQAYH7gMAM&ved=0CEMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=v%201984%20diana&f=false}}</ref> \n\n==Plot==\n\nFollowing directly on from the events of the mini-series ''[[V (The Final Battle)]]'', the alien Diana escapes from her captured mothership in a shuttle, but is pursued by resistance member Mike Donovan. After a short fight, Donovan captures her.\n\nOne year after the day the Red Dust was deployed, now the international holiday called \"Liberation Day\", the former members of the [[Resistance (V)|Resistance]] and their [[Fifth Column (V TV series)|Fifth Column]] allies have gone their separate ways and are each looking forward to prosperous careers and bright futures. As Diana is about to be put on trial for the atrocities she committed during the First Invasion, the company responsible for mass production of the Red Dust, Science Frontiers, has her abducted and taken to a secret cabin in the woods outside Los Angeles, where the company's CEO, Nathan Bates, offers Diana better accommodations in exchange for providing him with access to alien technology.\n\nDonovan and Martin, meanwhile, pursue Nathan's agents in a stolen helicopter. After reaching the cabin, Donovan is knocked unconscious by Martin, who wants Diana dead. Before Martin can kill her, Diana is able to overpower him, stealing his pistol. She forces him to surrender his last antidote pill so she can temporarily survive on Earth and then shoots him, enabling her escape to the Southwest Tracking Station.\n\nMartin tells Donovan about Diana's plan to contact the Visitor Fleet moments before his death, and Donovan sets off after her on foot. Donovan meets Ham Tyler, on Bates' payroll, and the two agree to pursue Diana together. Their attempts to stop her fail, and Diana escapes to a shuttle sent by a Visitor fleet hidden behind the Moon. Diana takes command and launches a full-scale invasion of Earth. She learns that the Red Dust bacterium needs freezing temperatures to regenerate, meaning that Visitor troops can safely attack Los Angeles and other cities in warmer climates.\n\nThe [[Resistance (V)|Resistance]] assembles once more, now fighting the Visitors nationwide and also contending with the power-hungry Bates, who has used the power vacuum left behind by the collapse of the government to become governor of Los Angeles, declared an [[open city]] to both sides. The Resistance fights however it can, often joined by other rebel groups. Although 50% of the Earth is still protected from The Visitors by the Red Dust, the Resistance cannot use any more of it due to the toxic long-term effects it will have on the environment. Meanwhile, [[Resistance (V)#The Maxwells|Elizabeth]], who has transformed yet again and now looks like a young adult, becomes increasingly important in the cause for Earth's freedom, eventually controlling the destiny of both races and deciding the outcome of the conflict.\n\n==Cast and characters==\nMany of the cast and characters reprised their roles from [[V (1983 miniseries)|the original miniseries]] and ''[[V The Final Battle|V: The Final Battle]]''. The only character to be played by different actor was Sean Donovan (Nicky Katt replaced Eric Johnston in the role).\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Jane Badler]] as Diana \u2013 Supreme Commander of the Visitors\n* [[Marc Singer]] as Mike Donovan \u2013 Co-Leader of the Resistance (former TV cameraman)\n* [[Faye Grant]] as Juliet Parrish \u2013 Founder of the Resistance (former medical student) \n* [[Robert Englund]] as Willie \u2013 Visitor Resistance member\n* [[June Chadwick]] as Lydia (episodes 2\u201319) \u2013 Fleet security officer sent by the Leader to Earth to commence the second invasion, she resents Diana's disobedience of command.\n* [[Michael Wright (actor)|Michael Wright]] as Elias Taylor (episodes 1\u201311) \u2013 A now semi-retired Resistance member, Elias runs the Club Creole restaurant, which becomes the informal headquarters of the Resistance.

He soon defects back to the Resistance, but is captured and undergoes conversion by Charles to assassinate Mike.  The assassination attempt is unsuccessful, and Ham later departs for Chicago with Chris and Robin.

After seeing her naked in a ceremonial bath prior to the wedding, however, he changes his mind and arranges for her to stay. Charles dies after Diana, who correctly suspected that Lydia would try to assassinate her by poisoning the wine in her ceremonial chalice, switches her cup with his; Charles drinks the wine and realizes too late that it has been poisoned.\n* [[Peter Elbling]] as Oswald (episodes 15; 17\u201318) \u2013 Visitor underling of Diana, he is a mortician and an interior decorator. Diana had him \"procure\" several sexual partners for her pleasure, a job he enjoyed immensely.

Smith]] as himself (episodes 3\u201313) \u2013 Smith appeared briefly at beginning of several episodes playing a newscaster (his former real-life profession) describing recent (off-camera) actions by the Visitors and the Fifth Column, sometimes providing expositional background for events in that night's episode.  He did not interact with any of the other characters.\n\n==Intro==\nThe title sequence for Episodes 1\u201313 featured theme music derived from incidental music previously used in ''The Final Battle'' over the main cast credits.\n\nWith Episode 14, a new intro was introduced with Michael Ironside, Lane Smith, Blair Tefkin and Michael Wright removed from the credits along with different theme music and a new monologue describing the premise of the show:\n\n''They arrived in 50 motherships offering their friendship and advanced technology to Earth.  Skeptical of the Visitors, Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish infiltrated their ranks and soon discovered some startling secrets.''\n<blockquote>'''Juliet Parrish:''' They're shipping food!</blockquote>\n''The Resistance is all that stands between us and the Visitors.''<ref>{{cite web |title=The Classic TV Archive \u201cV\u201d |url=http://ctva.biz/US/SciFi/V.htm |website=CTVA |accessdate=4 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227094226/http://ctva.biz:80/US/SciFi/V.htm |archivedate=2017-12-27}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#275B8F |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Liberation Day\n |DirectedBy = [[Paul Krasny]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Paul Monash]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1984|10|26}}\n |ShortSummary = The first anniversary of the day the aliens were defeated could lead to Earth's last day: alien commander [[Visitors (V TV series)#Commanders|Diana]] escapes and reunites with her fleet.

Unable to prevent the wedding, Diana is officially wedded to Charles. Lydia in a final desperate attempt to be with Charles, poison's Diana's chalice. In their private quarters Charles and Diana drink together in celebration, with Diana suggesting that Charles \"takes her cup\" just as he \"takes her\". They each drink from the other's cup and Charles is poisoned and dies. Lydia enters and is horrified to discover what has happened and Diana orders Lydia's immediate arrest for wanton murder.  \n |LineColor = 275B8F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 14\n |Title = The Champion\n |DirectedBy = [[Cliff Bole]]\n |WrittenBy = Paul F.

At the last minute, Inspector General Philip (who happens to be Martin's twin brother) arrives, and commutes Lydia's sentence due to lack of evidence that she had intended to kill Charles, especially with the possibility that it may have been Diana who was responsible for the commander's death (she had handed him the poisoned cup after all). Since Lydia's intended target was actually Diana, making Diana the only accuser of the crime, Diana and Lydia put on body armor and pick up laser weapons in preparation for a ritual battle to the death. Lydia is victorious in the battle, but before she can perform the death blow, Philip abruptly halts the proceedings. Mike and Kyle befriend a local resistance force headed by Kathy Courtney. Mike promises Kathy's daughter, Jesse, that he will return to visit them when the war is over. Meanwhile, Philip mentions that another set of fingerprints was found on the bottle of poison and so until the case is fully investigated, Lydia and Diana must look after one another. Should any grievous harm occur to one of them, the other will be automatically accused of the murder of Charles.\n\nNote: New opening credits were introduced in this episode.\n\n |LineColor = 275B8F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 15\n |Title = The Wildcats\n |DirectedBy = John Florea\n |WrittenBy = David Braff\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1985|2|15}}\n |ShortSummary = Rivals become scheming allies when Diana and Lydia learn that if the commander's murderer isn't found, Visitor law requires that '''all''' suspects be buried with him.

The Resistance discovers that the Visitors have made a worldwide ceasefire and that a majority are retreating from Earth. Via Elizabeth, it is discovered the Leader is coming to Earth to negotiate peace, and he has asked Elizabeth and the Resistance to come to the Mothership.\n\nDiana and James decide to extend the war by arming the energy swords of Phillip and Donovan during a supposedly non-lethal duel. When this attempt fails, Diana blackmails James into attempting to assassinate the Leader by having his troops blowing up the Leader's shuttle. When the destroyed shuttle is revealed as a decoy, Diana stages a coup and attempts to self-destruct the fusion reactors of the Mothership in order to kill everyone aboard and destroying Earth. It is only the Leader, working through Elizabeth telepathically, who is able to stop the self-destruct.\n\nThe Leader arrives, Diana and James are captured, and Elizabeth boards the Leader's shuttle to return to the Visitor home world to guarantee peace.

Kyle is transported by Elizabeth to an alternate dimension where he sees both her and The Leader, a massive four armed Visitor. Elizabeth explains that in the distant past that the rulers of \"Saurus\" feared that one of their group would become too strong and thus broke \"The Anyx\", which was the source of their power. Part of the Anyx had been hidden on Earth.\n\nDonovan and Julie make contact with Ham Tyler with the intent of renewing his search for Sean. Meanwhile Diana escapes and the Leader's shuttle is destroyed, but is revealed to have been a decoy. Julie is killed as the Resistance, while Elizabeth refuses to rule at The Leader's side and rejoins her friends. They return to Earth and are reunited with Ham Tyler, who meets them in an armored off-road vehicle. The remaining Resistance fighters hit the road, with Season 2's focus to be the search for the missing piece of the Anyx.\n\nProduction of this episode ceased when the series was cancelled.<ref>http://www.thiel-a-vision.com/visitor/visitorunfilmed.htm#attack</ref>\n |LineColor = 275B8F\n}}\n}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nAlthough the show had been cancelled in March 1985, the sets from the production remained in storage for some time as discussions transpired over rendering a conclusion to the V saga. Among the options explored were a stand-alone TV movie or a final miniseries. Several scenarios were discussed:\n\n* The Resistance goes to the Visitor homeworld and attempt to stop Diana from assassinating the Leader\n* An exploration of the aftermath of the peace treaty in \"The Return\". A hardline US government would impose harsh conditions on the Visitors who choose to remain behind after their race departed, leaving the Resistance to ally with them <ref>http://www.thiel-a-vision.com/visitor/visitordatabase.htm</ref>\n\nIn 1989 there was a proposed sequel series by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] entitled \"V: The Next Chapter\" that would have followed up five years after the conclusion of the original show. Ham Tyler would have been the only character to have returned and would have taken place in Chicago. The rest of the remaining cast had been temporarily or permanently written off, with Mike Donovan captured, Willie executed, Lydia assassinated,  Julie living in exile in Australia, Diana reassigned, and Elizabeth having died.<ref>http://www.sirianlegion.fr/media/reb_a4.pdf</ref>\n\nWarner Brothers ultimately passed on the project, and Straczynski instead turned to [[Alien Nation]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] wrote: \"...&nbsp;a TV series with so much promise \u2013 based on two successful, highly rated science fiction miniseries on NBC in the early 1980s \u2013 produced such a silly, loathsome mess&nbsp;... NBC tried to make a weekly series out of [the mini-series that unraveled] the show so terribly it must surely rank as one of the worst TV sci-fi experiments ever. The cast becomes dangerously unstable. Ironside quits in the middle of the show's run with no apparent reason. Others are killed without meaning. The special effects are cheapened and the use of stock footage \u2013 previously filmed scenes used again and again \u2013 is maddening. (At one point, they actually used stock footage from the previous week's episode.)&nbsp;...\nWhat was once a pretty decent science fiction saga with good drama, humor and suspense ends up becoming \"Dynasty\" with lizard makeup and laser guns. There's even an episode in which Diana marries her alien boss named (what else?) Charles.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finney|first=Daniel P.|title=\"V\" is no victory for fans of '80s sci-fi shows|journal=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=July 27, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn Nielsen ratings V finished outside of the Top 30 in the 1984\u20131985 season,<ref>http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1984.htm</ref> ending the season ranked 57th with a 12.5 rating/18 share.<ref>http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=330683</ref><ref>http://www.tvratingsguide.com/2017/06/1984-85-season-nielsens-nbc-breaks-its.html</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\n<!-- Split section off from \"Influences\", which from this point on is not about influences at all. -->\n* Despite the high budget, producers had only half the resources given to the production of ''[[V The Final Battle|V: The Final Battle]]''. Executive Story Consultant [[David Ambromowitz]] stated, \u201cThe budget for the mini-series was about double what we had per hour, so that's what was really difficult. It's impossible to retain the quality of the show with half the money, half the time to shoot things, half the special effects, half the sets, half the characters and half of everything.\u201d <ref name=\"starlogged\">{{cite web |title=V The Series Review - EP1: Liberation Day Beware the Visitors! |url=https://starlogged.blogspot.com/2012/05/v-series-review-ep1-liberation-day.html |website=Starlogged |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref>\n* Liberation Day's shot of the alien fleet hiding behind the moon was achieved using models (the 30-inch Saucer in the foreground, newly built smaller ships behind and a 36-inch model of the moon's surface) as the budget was insufficient for optical compositing. <ref name=\"starlogged\"/>\n* The TV series' single season was released on LaserDisc in Japan in April 1989 (bilingual English/Japanese with subtitles) as a massive 10-disc box set, which included a \"Diana Special\" (in Japanese only) on side 20.  It was later issued on Region 1 DVD in 2004, and Region 2 in 2008.\n* The weekly series reused a lot of action footage from the mini-series. This was especially evident in the Visitor skyfighter chase scene in the pilot episode, where nearly all external shots were lifted from the climax scene of the original mini-series.\n* In the original mini-series and ''The Final Battle'', the Visitors' voices were given, among other post-processing, a [[Pitch shifter (audio processor)|pitch shift]] effect.

It is a continuation of the ''[[V (franchise)|V]]'' franchise about an alien invasion of Earth by a carnivorous race of [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilians]] known as \"[[Visitors (V franchise)|Visitors]]\", which was originally conceived by American writer, producer, and director [[Kenneth Johnson (producer)|Kenneth Johnson]]. Johnson, however, was not involved in the production of the weekly series.<!--not referenced before million sentence--> At a cost of one million dollars per episode, ''V'' was the most expensive series to be produced for television at that time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Terrace|first=Vincent|title=Encyclopedia of Television: Series, Pilots, and Specials, Volume 2 1974\u20131985|year=1985|publisher=VNR AG|pages=500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AKlgjBCPPnsC&pg=PA432&dq=v+1984+diana&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KjOYUKIP7LbQAYH7gMAM&ved=0CEMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=v%201984%20diana&f=false}}</ref> \n\n==Plot==\n\nFollowing directly on from the events of the mini-series ''[[V (The Final Battle)]]'', the alien Diana escapes from her captured mothership in a shuttle, but is pursued by resistance member Mike Donovan. After a short fight, Donovan captures her.\n\nOne year after the day the Red Dust was deployed, now the international holiday called \"Liberation Day\", the former members of the [[Resistance (V)|Resistance]] and their [[Fifth Column (V TV series)|Fifth Column]] allies have gone their separate ways and are each looking forward to prosperous careers and bright futures. As Diana is about to be put on trial for the atrocities she committed during the First Invasion, the company responsible for mass production of the Red Dust, Science Frontiers, has her abducted and taken to a secret cabin in the woods outside Los Angeles, where the company's CEO, Nathan Bates, offers Diana better accommodations in exchange for providing him with access to alien technology.\n\nDonovan and Martin, meanwhile, pursue Nathan's agents in a stolen helicopter. After reaching the cabin, Donovan is knocked unconscious by Martin, who wants Diana dead. Before Martin can kill her, Diana is able to overpower him, stealing his pistol. She forces him to surrender his last antidote pill so she can temporarily survive on Earth and then shoots him, enabling her escape to the Southwest Tracking Station.\n\nMartin tells Donovan about Diana's plan to contact the Visitor Fleet moments before his death, and Donovan sets off after her on foot. Donovan meets Ham Tyler, on Bates' payroll, and the two agree to pursue Diana together. Their attempts to stop her fail, and Diana escapes to a shuttle sent by a Visitor fleet hidden behind the Moon. Diana takes command and launches a full-scale invasion of Earth. She learns that the Red Dust bacterium needs freezing temperatures to regenerate, meaning that Visitor troops can safely attack Los Angeles and other cities in warmer climates.\n\nThe [[Resistance (V)|Resistance]] assembles once more, now fighting the Visitors nationwide and also contending with the power-hungry Bates, who has used the power vacuum left behind by the collapse of the government to become governor of Los Angeles, declared an [[open city]] to both sides. The Resistance fights however it can, often joined by other rebel groups. Although 50% of the Earth is still protected from The Visitors by the Red Dust, the Resistance cannot use any more of it due to the toxic long-term effects it will have on the environment. Meanwhile, [[Resistance (V)#The Maxwells|Elizabeth]], who has transformed yet again and now looks like a young adult, becomes increasingly important in the cause for Earth's freedom, eventually controlling the destiny of both races and deciding the outcome of the conflict.\n\n==Cast and characters==\nMany of the cast and characters reprised their roles from [[V (1983 miniseries)|the original miniseries]] and ''[[V The Final Battle|V: The Final Battle]]''.

Annoyed at Diana's defiance of him, he uses his power of [[betrothal]] to order her to marry him within 12 hours, so that she will be forced to return to the Homeworld to bear his offspring.  After seeing her naked in a ceremonial bath prior to the wedding, however, he changes his mind and arranges for her to stay. Charles dies after Diana, who correctly suspected that Lydia would try to assassinate her by poisoning the wine in her ceremonial chalice, switches her cup with his; Charles drinks the wine and realizes too late that it has been poisoned.\n* [[Peter Elbling]] as Oswald (episodes 15; 17\u201318) \u2013 Visitor underling of Diana, he is a mortician and an interior decorator. Diana had him \"procure\" several sexual partners for her pleasure, a job he enjoyed immensely.

Smith]] as himself (episodes 3\u201313) \u2013 Smith appeared briefly at beginning of several episodes playing a newscaster (his former real-life profession) describing recent (off-camera) actions by the Visitors and the Fifth Column, sometimes providing expositional background for events in that night's episode.  He did not interact with any of the other characters.\n\n==Intro==\nThe title sequence for Episodes 1\u201313 featured theme music derived from incidental music previously used in ''The Final Battle'' over the main cast credits.\n\nWith Episode 14, a new intro was introduced with Michael Ironside, Lane Smith, Blair Tefkin and Michael Wright removed from the credits along with different theme music and a new monologue describing the premise of the show:\n\n''They arrived in 50 motherships offering their friendship and advanced technology to Earth.  Skeptical of the Visitors, Mike Donovan and Juliet Parrish infiltrated their ranks and soon discovered some startling secrets.''\n<blockquote>'''Juliet Parrish:''' They're shipping food!</blockquote>\n''The Resistance is all that stands between us and the Visitors.''<ref>{{cite web |title=The Classic TV Archive \u201cV\u201d |url=http://ctva.biz/US/SciFi/V.htm |website=CTVA |accessdate=4 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227094226/http://ctva.biz:80/US/SciFi/V.htm |archivedate=2017-12-27}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#275B8F |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Liberation Day\n |DirectedBy = [[Paul Krasny]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Paul Monash]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1984|10|26}}\n |ShortSummary = The first anniversary of the day the aliens were defeated could lead to Earth's last day: alien commander [[Visitors (V TV series)#Commanders|Diana]] escapes and reunites with her fleet.

Since Lydia's intended target was actually Diana, making Diana the only accuser of the crime, Diana and Lydia put on body armor and pick up laser weapons in preparation for a ritual battle to the death. Lydia is victorious in the battle, but before she can perform the death blow, Philip abruptly halts the proceedings. Mike and Kyle befriend a local resistance force headed by Kathy Courtney. Mike promises Kathy's daughter, Jesse, that he will return to visit them when the war is over.

When this attempt fails, Diana blackmails James into attempting to assassinate the Leader by having his troops blowing up the Leader's shuttle. When the destroyed shuttle is revealed as a decoy, Diana stages a coup and attempts to self-destruct the fusion reactors of the Mothership in order to kill everyone aboard and destroying Earth. It is only the Leader, working through Elizabeth telepathically, who is able to stop the self-destruct.\n\nThe Leader arrives, Diana and James are captured, and Elizabeth boards the Leader's shuttle to return to the Visitor home world to guarantee peace.

Part of the Anyx had been hidden on Earth.\n\nDonovan and Julie make contact with Ham Tyler with the intent of renewing his search for Sean. Meanwhile Diana escapes and the Leader's shuttle is destroyed, but is revealed to have been a decoy. Julie is killed as the Resistance, while Elizabeth refuses to rule at The Leader's side and rejoins her friends. They return to Earth and are reunited with Ham Tyler, who meets them in an armored off-road vehicle. The remaining Resistance fighters hit the road, with Season 2's focus to be the search for the missing piece of the Anyx.\n\nProduction of this episode ceased when the series was cancelled.<ref>http://www.thiel-a-vision.com/visitor/visitorunfilmed.htm#attack</ref>\n |LineColor = 275B8F\n}}\n}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nAlthough the show had been cancelled in March 1985, the sets from the production remained in storage for some time as discussions transpired over rendering a conclusion to the V saga. Among the options explored were a stand-alone TV movie or a final miniseries. Several scenarios were discussed:\n\n* The Resistance goes to the Visitor homeworld and attempt to stop Diana from assassinating the Leader\n* An exploration of the aftermath of the peace treaty in \"The Return\". A hardline US government would impose harsh conditions on the Visitors who choose to remain behind after their race departed, leaving the Resistance to ally with them <ref>http://www.thiel-a-vision.com/visitor/visitordatabase.htm</ref>\n\nIn 1989 there was a proposed sequel series by [[J. Michael Straczynski]] entitled \"V: The Next Chapter\" that would have followed up five years after the conclusion of the original show. Ham Tyler would have been the only character to have returned and would have taken place in Chicago. The rest of the remaining cast had been temporarily or permanently written off, with Mike Donovan captured, Willie executed, Lydia assassinated,  Julie living in exile in Australia, Diana reassigned, and Elizabeth having died.<ref>http://www.sirianlegion.fr/media/reb_a4.pdf</ref>\n\nWarner Brothers ultimately passed on the project, and Straczynski instead turned to [[Alien Nation]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] wrote: \"...&nbsp;a TV series with so much promise \u2013 based on two successful, highly rated science fiction miniseries on NBC in the early 1980s \u2013 produced such a silly, loathsome mess&nbsp;... NBC tried to make a weekly series out of [the mini-series that unraveled] the show so terribly it must surely rank as one of the worst TV sci-fi experiments ever. The cast becomes dangerously unstable. Ironside quits in the middle of the show's run with no apparent reason. Others are killed without meaning. The special effects are cheapened and the use of stock footage \u2013 previously filmed scenes used again and again \u2013 is maddening. (At one point, they actually used stock footage from the previous week's episode.)&nbsp;...\nWhat was once a pretty decent science fiction saga with good drama, humor and suspense ends up becoming \"Dynasty\" with lizard makeup and laser guns. There's even an episode in which Diana marries her alien boss named (what else?) Charles.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Finney|first=Daniel P.|title=\"V\" is no victory for fans of '80s sci-fi shows|journal=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=July 27, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn Nielsen ratings V finished outside of the Top 30 in the 1984\u20131985 season,<ref>http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1984.htm</ref> ending the season ranked 57th with a 12.5 rating/18 share.<ref>http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/showthread.php?t=330683</ref><ref>http://www.tvratingsguide.com/2017/06/1984-85-season-nielsens-nbc-breaks-its.html</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\n<!-- Split section off from \"Influences\", which from this point on is not about influences at all. -->\n* Despite the high budget, producers had only half the resources given to the production of ''[[V The Final Battle|V: The Final Battle]]''. Executive Story Consultant [[David Ambromowitz]] stated, \u201cThe budget for the mini-series was about double what we had per hour, so that's what was really difficult. It's impossible to retain the quality of the show with half the money, half the time to shoot things, half the special effects, half the sets, half the characters and half of everything.\u201d <ref name=\"starlogged\">{{cite web |title=V The Series Review - EP1: Liberation Day Beware the Visitors! |url=https://starlogged.blogspot.com/2012/05/v-series-review-ep1-liberation-day.html |website=Starlogged |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref>\n* Liberation Day's shot of the alien fleet hiding behind the moon was achieved using models (the 30-inch Saucer in the foreground, newly built smaller ships behind and a 36-inch model of the moon's surface) as the budget was insufficient for optical compositing. <ref name=\"starlogged\"/>\n* The TV series' single season was released on LaserDisc in Japan in April 1989 (bilingual English/Japanese with subtitles) as a massive 10-disc box set, which included a \"Diana Special\" (in Japanese only) on side 20.  It was later issued on Region 1 DVD in 2004, and Region 2 in 2008.\n* The weekly series reused a lot of action footage from the mini-series. This was especially evident in the Visitor skyfighter chase scene in the pilot episode, where nearly all external shots were lifted from the climax scene of the original mini-series.\n* In the original mini-series and ''The Final Battle'', the Visitors' voices were given, among other post-processing, a [[Pitch shifter (audio processor)|pitch shift]] effect. This was dropped from the weekly series.\n\n==Comic book==\n[[DC Comics]] published 18 issues of a \"V\" comic book concurrently with the TV series.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Toys and Collectibles==\nA 1985 LJN toy line dedicated to the V series was to have been produced, however a March 24, 1985 UPI article on the risks of toy franchising cited that the V line was \u201cnot presently in production\u201d. <ref>https://www.tvobscurities.com/2010/03/bookshelf-v-novels-and-comic-books/</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] and turns east.

The route continues through a hilly terrain with several steep grades, and comes to an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 Alternate (Tennessee)|US 31 Alternate]] and [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee \u2013 Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41 Alternate]] about {{convert|11|mi|km}} later near the community of [[Triune, Tennessee|Triune]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later I-840 crosses [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]] at the top of a large hill, and begins a steep downgrade, with the westbound lanes utilizing a [[truck climbing lane]] over a short distance and crossing into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with I-24 northwest of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]. This interchange is almost a complete [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]], containing three loop ramps and one [[overpass|flyover]]. The route then turns northeast, passing through a relatively flat region, and interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]] and [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]] in a cloverstack interchange about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses into [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]] about {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond this point.

ordered TDOT to discontinue further studies and planning of that highway because of state budget problems. An entire circular loop would possibly be about {{convert|178|mi|km}} long, ranging from {{convert|86|to|116|mi|km}}. Other important objections against additional extensions of the I-840 highway include the hilly nature of the terrain north of Nashville (the [[Highland Rim]]), which would require huge and costly amounts of excavation, soil relocation, and bridge construction. In October 2003, TDOT placed the northern loop plan on indefinite hold, citing a lack of documented transportation needs and lack of participation from local politicians.<ref name=\"840hold\">{{cite press release |author = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] |date = October 31, 2003 |url = http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |title = TDOT Announces Decision on State Route 840 North |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |format = PDF |access-date = July 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127233215/http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |archive-date = November 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Redesignation===\n[[File:Interstate 840.jpg|thumb|right|Same section of I-40 in 2017, showing signage for I-840.]]\nIn 2015, TDOT submitted a request to [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHTO]] to redesignate SR&nbsp;840 as I-840.

On August 12, 2016, TDOT announced that it would begin re-signing the route on August 14 and that work would be complete later in the year.\n\n==Route description==\nI-840 begins at an interchange in [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]] near Dickson. It initially runs southeast through a predominantly hilly terrain, and crosses briefly into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later. The route remains in Hickman County for less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, before crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], and reaching an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 100|State Route 100]] (SR 100) about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. I-840 continues through a predominantly rural area, characterized by rolling hills with moderate grades, and reaches [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]] at an interchange near the community of [[Leiper's Fork, Tennessee|Leiper's Fork]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] and turns east. I-840 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 31]] (US 31) about {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|2|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|US 431]] Less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]] south of Franklin in an interchange that resembles a [[cloverstack interchange]], containing two loop ramps and two underpass ramps that cross I-840 combined together. The route continues through a hilly terrain with several steep grades, and comes to an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 Alternate (Tennessee)|US 31 Alternate]] and [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee \u2013 Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41 Alternate]] about {{convert|11|mi|km}} later near the community of [[Triune, Tennessee|Triune]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later I-840 crosses [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]] at the top of a large hill, and begins a steep downgrade, with the westbound lanes utilizing a [[truck climbing lane]] over a short distance and crossing into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with I-24 northwest of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]. This interchange is almost a complete [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]], containing three loop ramps and one [[overpass|flyover]]. The route then turns northeast, passing through a relatively flat region, and interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]] and [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]] in a cloverstack interchange about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses into [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]] about {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond this point. The route then turns slightly northeast, and about {{convert|3.8|mi|km}} later reaches its eastern terminus with I-40 west of Lebanon.<ref name=google>{{google maps |url = https://www.google.com/maps/place/I-840,+Tennessee/@36.0861572,-86.596612,66351m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88647b9afed8536b:0x963e9004ea8fed0f!8m2!3d36.0895955!4d-86.427016 |title = I-840 |access-date = December 18, 2017 |link = no }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Infobox road small\n|state=TN\n|type=SR\n|route=840\n|location=[[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]\u2013[[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]\n|formed=1991\n|deleted=2016\n|length_mi=77.28\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"840hold\"/>\n}}\n\nIn 1975 the Tennessee Highway System Plan issued by TDOT for the next four years first identified the need for an outer beltway around Nashville within the next 20 years.<ref name=FWHA>{{cite book |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation |year = 1995 |volume = Vol. 2 |title = Proposed Route 840 North from Interstate 65 to Interstate 40 West of Nashville in Robertson, Cheatham, Dickson, and Montgomery Counties, Tennessee |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qrM1AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |location = Nashville |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |page =  |id = FHWA-TN-ESI-9501-D |access-date = December 18, 2017 |via = Google Books }}</ref> The SR&nbsp;840 project was initiated in 1986 with the passage of the Better Roads Program in the [[Tennessee General Assembly]].

for a northern loop of I-840 north of Nashville and past Dickson, [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]], [[Springfield, Tennessee|Springfield]], and [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]] by the state legislature in 1993.<ref name=\"840hold\"/> Environmental studies began in 1994 and a [[draft environmental impact statement|draft]] [[environmental impact statement]] (DEIS) was released in 1995.<ref name=FWHA/> Many residents in the predominantly rural and agricultural areas where the route was to pass were initially opposed.<ref name=FWHA/> Plans were later abandoned and the General Assembly ordered TDOT to discontinue further studies and planning of that highway because of state budget problems. An entire circular loop would possibly be about {{convert|178|mi|km}} long, ranging from {{convert|86|to|116|mi|km}}. Other important objections against additional extensions of the I-840 highway include the hilly nature of the terrain north of Nashville (the [[Highland Rim]]), which would require huge and costly amounts of excavation, soil relocation, and bridge construction. In October 2003, TDOT placed the northern loop plan on indefinite hold, citing a lack of documented transportation needs and lack of participation from local politicians.<ref name=\"840hold\">{{cite press release |author = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] |date = October 31, 2003 |url = http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |title = TDOT Announces Decision on State Route 840 North |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |format = PDF |access-date = July 17, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127233215/http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/news/2003/ut_projects/10-31-2003sr840n.pdf |archive-date = November 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Redesignation===\n[[File:Interstate 840.jpg|thumb|right|Same section of I-40 in 2017, showing signage for I-840.]]\nIn 2015, TDOT submitted a request to [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHTO]] to redesignate SR&nbsp;840 as I-840.

{"title_page": "Product life-cycle management (marketing)", "text_new": "{{About|1=the commercial term to describe the life of a product in the market|2= the engineering term|3=Product lifecycle}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2012}}\n'''Product life-cycle management''' ('''PLM''') is the succession of strategies by business management as a product goes through its [[Product lifecycle management|life-cycle]]. The conditions in which a product is sold (advertising, saturation) changes over time and must be managed as it moves through its succession of stage.\n\n==Goals==\nThe goals of product life cycle management (PLM) are to reduce time to market, improve product quality, reduce prototyping costs, identify potential sales opportunities and revenue contributions, maintain and sustain operational serviceability, and reduce environmental impacts at end-of-life. To create successful new products the company must understand its customers, markets and competitors. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) integrates people, data, processes and business systems. It provides product information for companies and their extended supply chain enterprise. PLM solutions help organizations overcome the increased complexity and engineering challenges of developing new products for the global competitive markets.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Product life cycle==\nThe concept of product life cycle (PLC) concerns the life of a product in the market with respect to business/commercial costs and sales measures. The product life cycle proceeds through multiple phases, involves many professional disciplines, and requires many skills, tools and processes. PLC management makes the following three assumptions:{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n* Products have a limited life and thus every product has a life cycle.\n* Product sales pass through distinct stages, each posing different challenges, opportunities, and problems to the seller.\n* Products require different marketing, financing, manufacturing, purchasing, and human resource strategies in each life cycle stage.\nOnce the product is designed and put into the market, the offering should be managed efficiently for the buyers to get value from it. Before entering into any market complete analysis is carried out by the industry for both external and internal factors including the laws and regulations, environment, economics, cultural values and market needs. From the business perspective, as a good business, the product needs to be sold before it finishes its life. In terms of profitability, expiry may jolt the overall profitability of the business therefore there are few strategies, which are practiced to ensure that the product is sold within the defined period of maturity.\n\n=== Extending the product life cycle===\n\nExtending the product life cycle by improving sales, this can be done through\n\n* Advertising: Its purpose is to get additional audience and potential customers.\n* Exploring and expanding to new markets: By conducting market research and offering the product (or some adapted form of it) to new markets, it is possible to get more customers.\n* Price reduction: Many customers are attracted by price cuts and discount tags.\n* Adding new features: Adding value to the product to enhance its usability or to attract the attention of a wider customer base.\n* Packaging: New, attractive, useful or eco-friendly packaging influence the target customers.\n* Changing customer consumption habits: Promoting new trends of consumption can increase the number of customers.\n* Special promotions: Raising interest by offering Jackpot and other offers.\n* Heightening interest: Many of the following things attract many customers who match certain profiles: Eco-friendly production processes, good work conditions, funding the efforts of non-profit organizations (cancer cure, anti-war efforts, refugees, GLTBI, environment and animal protection, etc.) and the like.\n\nSomething important to notice is that all these techniques rely on advertising to become known.

Stage !! Characteristics\n|-\n| 1. '''Market introduction stage'''\n||This is the stage in which the product has been introduced first time in the market and the sales of the product starts to grow slowly and gradually and the profit received from the product is nominal and non-attained. The market for the product is not competitive initially and also the company spends initially on the advertisement and uses various other tools for promotion in order to motivate and produce awareness among the consumers, therefore generating discerning demands for particular brand. The products start to gain distribution as the product is initially new in the market and in this stage the quality of the product is not assured and the price of the product will also be determined as low or high.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson & Zeithaml|first=Carl R. & Carl P.|date=Mar 1984|title=Stage of the Product Life Cycle, Business Strategy, and Business Performance|url=|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=27| issue = 1|pages=5\u201324|doi=10.2307/255954|jstor=255954}}</ref>\n# costs are very high\n# slow sales volumes to start\n# little or no competition\n# demand has to be created\n# customers have to be prompted to try the product\n# makes little money at this stage\n|-\n| 2. '''Growth stage'''\n||In the growth stage, the product is visibly present in the market, the product has habitual consumers, and there is quick growth in product sales. More new customers are becoming aware of the product and trying it. The customers are becoming satisfied with the product and are buying it again and again. The ratio of the product repetition for the trial procurement has risen. Competitors have started to overflow the market with more appealing and attractive inventions. This helps in creating increased competition in the market and also results in decreasing the product price.\n# costs reduced due to economies of scale\n# sales volume increases significantly\n# profitability begins to rise\n# public awareness increases\n# competition begins to increase with a few new players in establishing market\n# increased competition leads to price decreases\n|-\n| 3. '''Maturity stage'''\n||In maturity stage, the cost of the product has been decreased because of the increased volume of the product and the product started to experience the curve effects. Also, more and more competitors have seen to be leaving the market. In this way very few buyers have been left for the product and this results in less sales of the product. The decline of the product and cost of attaining new buyers in this level is more as compare to the resulted profit. The brand or the product differentiation via rebating and discounts in price supports in recalling the outlet distribution. Also, there is a decline in the entire cost of marketing through enhancing the distribution and promotional efficiency with switching brand and segmentation.\n# costs are decreased as a result of production volumes increasing and experience curve effects\n# sales volume peaks and market saturation is reached\n# increase in competitors entering the market\n# prices tend to drop due to the proliferation of competing products\n# brand differentiation and feature diversification is emphasized to maintain or increase market share\n# industrial profits go down\n|-\n| 4. '''Saturation and decline stage'''\n||In this stage, the profit as well as the sales of the product has started to decline because of the deletion of the product from the market. The market for the product in this stage started to show negative rate of growth and corroding cash flows. The product at this stage may be kept but there should be fewer adverts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steffens|first=Paul|date=August 2002|title=The Product Life Cycle Concept: Buried or Resurrected by the Diffusion Literature?|url=|journal=Academy of Management Conference|volume=1 | issue = 5 |pages=1\u201330}}</ref>\n# costs become counter-optimal\n# sales volume decline\n# prices, profitability diminish\n# profit becomes more a challenge of production/distribution efficiency than increased sales\nNote: Product termination is usually not the end of the business cycle, only the end of a single entrant within the larger scope of an ongoing business program.\n|}\n\n===Identifying PLC stages===\nIdentifying the stage of a product is an art more than a science, but it's possible to find patterns in some of the general product features at each stage. Identifying product stages when the product is in transition is very difficult.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} More recently, it has been shown that user-generated contents ([[User-generated content|UGC]]) (e.g., in the form of online product reviews) has the potential to reveal buyer personality characteristics that can in turn be used to identify product life cycle stage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Safi|first=Roozmehr|last2=Yu|first2=Yang|date=July 2017|title=Online product review as an indicator of users' degree of innovativeness and product adoption time: a longitudinal analysis of text reviews|journal=European Journal of Information Systems|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=414\u2013431|doi=10.1057/s41303-017-0045-2|issn=0960-085X}}</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align: bottom;text-align: center;\"| '''Identifying<br />features'''\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | '''Stages'''\n|-\n! Introduction !! Growth !! Maturity !! Decline\n|-\n| Sales     || Low || High || High || Low\n|-\n| Investment cost || Very high || High (lower than intro stage) || Low || Low\n|-\n| Competition || Low or no competition || High || Very high || Very High\n|-| Low\n|-\n| Profit || Low || High || High || Low\n|}\n\n===Relationship between BCG Matrix and PLC Curve===\n\nThe BCG Matrix and PLC Curve are two important tools that relate two different aspects of a products performance. The BCG looks at market share and market growth and how they impact on cash usage and generation , while the PLC looks at sale or revenues over time and levels of profitability. Introduction phase of the PLC Curve aligns with the the Question Mark of the BCG matrix, where the product is on the birth stage and there is little relative market share and huge market potential. Moving towards the second phase of PLC, the Growth stage, Product could belong to Star of BCG where the relative market share and the market growth is high. Third phase of the PLC curve is Maturity stage which coincides with the Cash cows of BCG matrix. In this stage the profitability is mainly by economies of scale , where the firm tries to sell off their product in large scale. Here there is no scope for further market growth as the market attains saturation. On to the last stage of PLC Curve, the decline. This indicates the Dogs of BCG Matrix, where there is no point of investing further in the product development. The best alternative solution available is to divest.\n\n\n==See also==\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n\n* [[Application lifecycle management]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[DMSMS|Diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages (DMSMS)]]\n* [[Material selection]]\n* [[New product development]]\n* [[Obsolescence]]\n* [[Planned obsolescence (business)|Planned obsolescence]]\n* [[Product lifecycle management]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product teardown]]\n* [[Software product management]]\n* [[Technology life cycle]]\n* [[Toolkits for user innovation]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Box, Jonathan Mbosia,  ''Extending product lifetime: Prospects and opportunities'', ''Tanzanian Journal of Marketing'' September, 1983\n* Day, G. \"The product life cycle: Analysis and applications issues\", ''Journal of Marketing'', vol 45, Autumn 1981, pp 60\u201367.\n* Levitt, T., \"Exploit the product life cycle\", ''Harvard Business Review'', vol 43, November\u2013December 1965, pp 81\u201394.\n* Dhalla, N.K., Yuspeh, S., \"Forget the product life cycle concept\", ''Harvard Business Review'', Jan\u2013Feb 1976\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Rey | first1 = F.J. | last2 = Mart\u00edn-Gil | first2 = J. | last3 = Velasco | first3 = E. |display-authors=etal  | year = 2004 | title = Life Cycle Assessment and external environmental cost analysis of heat pumps | url = | journal = Environmental Engineering Science | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 591\u2013604 | doi=10.1089/ees.2004.21.591}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Westk\u00e4mper | first1 = E | year = 2000 | title = Live Cycle Management and Assessment: Approaches and Visions Towards Sustainable Manufacturing | url = | journal = CIRP Annals | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 501\u2013522 | doi=10.1016/s0007-8506(07)63453-2}}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = K.C. | last2 = Mills | first2 = T.M. | year = 2015| title = Modeling competition over product life cycles | url = | journal = Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research | volume =  32| issue = 4| page =  1550021| doi = 10.1142/S0217595915500219 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = C. | last2 = Zeithaml | first2 = C. | year = 1984 | title = Stage of the Product Life Cycle, Business Strategy, and Business Performance | url = | journal = Academy of Management | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 5\u201324 | doi=10.2307/255954| jstor = 255954 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Griffin | first1 = A | year = 1997 | title = The Effect of Project and Process Characteristics on Product Development Cycle Time | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing Research | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 24\u201335 | doi=10.2307/3152062| jstor = 3152062 }}\n* Levitt, T., 1965.

Bhadani and Khera (Bhadana) are two villages adjacent to each other and Kheri Asra, Surkhpur, Jhajjar, Shekhupur and [[Kablana]], [[Chudani]] are nearby villages. It is located 10&nbsp;km towards East from District head quarters [[Jhajjar]]. 10&nbsp;km from [[Jhajjar]]. 269&nbsp;km from State capital [[Chandigarh]]. Its Pin code is 124104 and postal head office is Nehru College Jhajjar.\n\n'''History of Bhadani'''\n\n'''Antiquity'''. The history of Bhadani, a large village in Jhajjar district of Haryana dates back to 1545 -75, when two separate settlements named Rai Bhadani  of  Phalaswals and Chhoti Bhadani of Sehrawats came up. Two generations latter, that is, in 1620 -30, Bhadani Usman was settled by Deswals. In 1877  the village was inhabited by the twelfth generation  since its establishment. Considering the fact that life-span of one generation is taken as 30 years   the village would have been established in second half of Sixteenth century between 1545 \u20131575. These facts are recorded in the Shajra \u2013 Malikan  Mouza Bhadani, Tehsil Jhajjar, District Rohtak written on 19 April 1877.\n\n'''Name of the Village'''. There is no authentic record as to why name Bhadani was chosen.\n\n'''Ruling Deity'''. Ruling deity of Bhadani is Shiva in form of Ardhnariswar. \n\n'''Sequence of settlement of the village'''.  The village was settled in three sequential waves. Before we attempt to establish the sequence of settlement, it is important to understand meaning of words Rai and Usman. \n\u2022\t'''Rai'''. In the Hindu lexicon Rai stands for a sovereign king.  During pre-Sultanate period, Rai  was placed higher than Raja. However during the Mughal period, Rai stood for administrator of Imperial land (Khalisa).  \n\u2022\t'''Usman'''. In Islamic lexicon Usman was the third Caliph. However in so far as we are concerned, it is more pertinent to note that during early seventeenth century Usman was a name widely used by Afghans and during the period 1620 \u2013 1718 Kalals, of Afghan origin, were Shiqdars of Jhajjar.\n\nSince we know that entire area of present day Haryana was Khalisa (Imperial Land) during the Mughal period, it would be reasonable to conclude that Rai Bhadani came up when the then Rai (Administrator of Khalisa) allotted Khalisa land to farmers of Phalaswal Gotra. Chhoti Bhadani as the name suggests came up next to extant Badi (elder) Bhadani, that is, Rai Bhadani.  \n\nWe also know from Shajra Malikan -e - Maouza, that, the Deswals came two generations after the Phalaswals and Sehrawats and till 1877 their nine generations had lived in the village. And, one generation period is taken as 30 years. Hence Deswals would have come around 1620 - 1630. This was the period when the Afghans of Kalal Clkan were the Shiqdars of Jhajjar, and Usman is a popular name among Afghans. Hence it is quite likely that one of the Shiqdars named Usman allotted Khalisa land to Deswals sometime in 1620 \u2013 1630 and named their settlement Bhadani Usman. \n\n'''Consolidation of the village'''. The period of 1712 \u2013 1803 was marked by the Great Anarchy which engulfed the nation following demise of Mughal Empire. By 1750 the conditions had become so dangerous and unbearable that many families migrated to safer areas and those who stayed behind left their respective smaller Bhadanis and consolidated at the present location. Apparently this process of re-location would have taken place over a period of  time, hence it is not possible to fix a date for establishment of larger Bhadani. However it is likely to have taken place sometime between 1740 \u2013 1775.  Original Khedas were located as follows:\n(a)\tPhalaswal. Present location of Bhadana.\n(b)\tSehrawat: Somewhere towards Jhajjar on periphery of Bir Sunarwala. \n(c)\tDeswal: Somewhere towards Kablana.\n\n'''History of Pannas'''. Bhadani village has three main Pannas of Jats, namely Sehrawat, Phalaswal and Deswal and some families of Rahar besides usual mix of Brahman, Bania, Sunar, Khati, Lohar, Kumhar, Chamar and Chura families living in harmony.\n\n\u2022\t'''Phalaswal'''. Sometime in 1545 \u2013 1575 a family of Phalaswals headed by Makhha migrated from unknown place to establish Rai Bhadani. He had three sons named Puran, Issar and Kanhiya (Nanha). To commemorate the memory of Makhha, the Phalaswal Panna was also known as Makhha Panna. In the year 1754 Hemkaran of Puran branch and Raja Ram of Issar branch migrated from Bhadani. Raja Ram shifted to Pahari Dheeraj and his family has stayed there ever since. Their land was tilled by Nanha  branch for next three generations. However in the year 1807, the Nawab allotted around 1120 Bighas of Phalaswal estate to some Brahmin families whom he had brought from Patli village, District Gurgaon and settled them in a newly created village named Bhadana on the Kheda of Phalaswals. Hence when in 1810 \u2013 12 the third generation of Hemkaran returned to reclaim their lands they found that their own share had already been given away by the Nawab to Brahmins of Bhadana. With mutual agreement the balance land was redistributed into four equal parts between Lasvid and  Arjan of Puran (Hemkaran) branch and Sewga and Laxman from Kanhiya branch. Their successors are living here ever since. \n\n\u2022\t'''Sahrawats'''. The Saharawat family had migrated from Mahrauli Village of Delhi district to establish Chhoti Bhadani almost simultaneously with the Phalaswals. During the period of Great Anarchy many Sharawat families migrated to other places. Family of Munia went to Bhorgarh, District Delhi.  Kishan Lal son of Ram Dayal came back from  Bhorgarh on 21 December 1867 to reclaim his property.  Moti, went away but came back in his own life time.  Sukha from Heera Thola went away to Daryapur in Delhi and his successor Hansram came back in the year 1867 to reclaim his property. Another family had shifted to Jharoda and came back once the British rule was established. In the year 1877, Saharawats had three tholas,{{which lang|date=December 2019}} namely Deepraj, Jadon and Heera and their successors have been living here ever since.\n\n\u2022\t'''Deswal'''.  The Deswal family had come here from village Aldyoka, District  Gurugram  and their nine generations had lived in Bhadani till 1877.  Many of their families migrated from here to safer places during the Great Anarchy but most of these families returned when the law and order was re-established by the British. Their successors have been living here ever since.  Deswal Pana was also known as Sarguroh  pana. Surguroh in Persian means of one family.\n\n'''Revenue during pre \u2013 1947 period'''. The revenue was charged as follows:\n\u2022\t'''Nawab'''. The village was purchased by one Imam Khan, Tehsildar of Jhajjar on Istamrari. He used to collect one quarter of the crop as revenue on behalf of Nawab and take another 10 percent for himself as collection charge. In addition the farmer had to contribute his proportionate share in the five rupee paid collectively to the Numberdar as Pichotra and towards the pay of Patwari. Thus effective revenue taken from a farmer was 40 percent of the produce.\n\u2022\t'''British'''. The British introduced system of direct revenue collection, wherein one quarter of the produce was taken either in cash or kind.

Badhani and Badhana are two villages adjacent to each other and Kheri Asra, Surkhpur, Jhajjar, Shekhupur and [[Kablana]], [[Chudani]] are nearby villages. It is located 10&nbsp;km towards East from District head quarters [[Jhajjar]]. 10&nbsp;km from [[Jhajjar]]. 269&nbsp;km from State capital [[Chandigarh]]. Its Pin code is 124104 and postal head office is Nehru College Jhajjar.\n\n'''History of Bhadani'''\n\n'''Antiquity'''. The history of Bhadani, a large village in Jhajjar district of Haryana dates back to 1545 -75, when two separate settlements named Rai Bhadani  of  Phalaswals and Chhoti Bhadani of Sehrawats came up. Two generations latter, that is, in 1620 -30, Bhadani Usman was settled by Deswals. In 1877  the village was inhabited by the twelfth generation  since its establishment. Considering the fact that life-span of one generation is taken as 30 years   the village would have been established in second half of Sixteenth century between 1545 \u20131575. These facts are recorded in the Shajra \u2013 Malikan  Mouza Bhadani, Tehsil Jhajjar, District Rohtak written on 19 April 1877.\n\n'''Name of the Village'''. There is no authentic record as to why name Bhadani was chosen.\n\n'''Ruling Deity'''. Ruling deity of Bhadani is Shiva in form of Ardhnariswar. \n\n'''Sequence of settlement of the village'''.  The village was settled in three sequential waves. Before we attempt to establish the sequence of settlement, it is important to understand meaning of words Rai and Usman. \n\u2022\t'''Rai'''. In the Hindu lexicon Rai stands for a sovereign king.  During pre-Sultanate period, Rai  was placed higher than Raja. However during the Mughal period, Rai stood for administrator of Imperial land (Khalisa).  \n\u2022\t'''Usman'''. In Islamic lexicon Usman was the third Caliph. However in so far as we are concerned, it is more pertinent to note that during early seventeenth century Usman was a name widely used by Afghans and during the period 1620 \u2013 1718 Kalals, of Afghan origin, were Shiqdars of Jhajjar.\n\nSince we know that entire area of present day Haryana was Khalisa (Imperial Land) during the Mughal period, it would be reasonable to conclude that Rai Bhadani came up when the then Rai (Administrator of Khalisa) allotted Khalisa land to farmers of Phalaswal Gotra. Chhoti Bhadani as the name suggests came up next to extant Badi (elder) Bhadani, that is, Rai Bhadani.  \n\nWe also know from Shajra Malikan -e - Maouza, that, the Deswals came two generations after the Phalaswals and Sehrawats and till 1877 their nine generations had lived in the village. And, one generation period is taken as 30 years. Hence Deswals would have come around 1620 - 1630. This was the period when the Afghans of Kalal Clkan were the Shiqdars of Jhajjar, and Usman is a popular name among Afghans. Hence it is quite likely that one of the Shiqdars named Usman allotted Khalisa land to Deswals sometime in 1620 \u2013 1630 and named their settlement Bhadani Usman. \n\n'''Consolidation of the village'''. The period of 1712 \u2013 1803 was marked by the Great Anarchy which engulfed the nation following demise of Mughal Empire. By 1750 the conditions had become so dangerous and unbearable that many families migrated to safer areas and those who stayed behind left their respective smaller Bhadanis and consolidated at the present location. Apparently this process of re-location would have taken place over a period of  time, hence it is not possible to fix a date for establishment of larger Bhadani. However it is likely to have taken place sometime between 1740 \u2013 1775.  Original Khedas were located as follows:\n(a)\tPhalaswal. Present location of Bhadana.\n(b)\tSehrawat: Somewhere towards Jhajjar on periphery of Bir Sunarwala. \n(c)\tDeswal: Somewhere towards Kablana.\n\n'''History of Pannas'''. Bhadani village has three main Pannas of Jats, namely Sehrawat, Phalaswal and Deswal and some families of Rahar besides usual mix of Brahman, Bania, Sunar, Khati, Lohar, Kumhar, Chamar and Chura families living in harmony.\n\n\u2022\t'''Phalaswal'''. Sometime in 1545 \u2013 1575 a family of Phalaswals headed by Makhha migrated from unknown place to establish Rai Bhadani. He had three sons named Puran, Issar and Kanhiya (Nanha). To commemorate the memory of Makhha, the Phalaswal Panna was also known as Makhha Panna. In the year 1754 Hemkaran of Puran branch and Raja Ram of Issar branch migrated from Bhadani. Raja Ram shifted to Pahari Dheeraj and his family has stayed there ever since. Their land was tilled by Nanha  branch for next three generations. However in the year 1807, the Nawab allotted around 1120 Bighas of Phalaswal estate to some Brahmin families whom he had brought from Patli village, District Gurgaon and settled them in a newly created village named Bhadana on the Kheda of Phalaswals. Hence when in 1810 \u2013 12 the third generation of Hemkaran returned to reclaim their lands they found that their own share had already been given away by the Nawab to Brahmins of Bhadana. With mutual agreement the balance land was redistributed into four equal parts between Lasvid and  Arjan of Puran (Hemkaran) branch and Sewga and Laxman from Kanhiya branch. Their successors are living here ever since. \n\n\u2022\t'''Sahrawats'''. The Saharawat family had migrated from Mahrauli Village of Delhi district to establish Chhoti Bhadani almost simultaneously with the Phalaswals. During the period of Great Anarchy many Sharawat families migrated to other places. Family of Munia went to Bhorgarh, District Delhi.  Kishan Lal son of Ram Dayal came back from  Bhorgarh on 21 December 1867 to reclaim his property.  Moti, went away but came back in his own life time.  Sukha from Heera Thola went away to Daryapur in Delhi and his successor Hansram came back in the year 1867 to reclaim his property. Another family had shifted to Jharoda and came back once the British rule was established. In the year 1877, Saharawats had three tholas,{{which lang|date=December 2019}} namely Deepraj, Jadon and Heera and their successors have been living here ever since.\n\n\u2022\t'''Deswal'''.  The Deswal family had come here from village Aldyoka, District  Gurugram  and their nine generations had lived in Bhadani till 1877.  Many of their families migrated from here to safer places during the Great Anarchy but most of these families returned when the law and order was re-established by the British. Their successors have been living here ever since.  Deswal Pana was also known as Sarguroh  pana. Surguroh in Persian means of one family.\n\n'''Revenue during pre \u2013 1947 period'''. The revenue was charged as follows:\n\u2022\t'''Nawab'''. The village was purchased by one Imam Khan, Tehsildar of Jhajjar on Istamrari. He used to collect one quarter of the crop as revenue on behalf of Nawab and take another 10 percent for himself as collection charge. In addition the farmer had to contribute his proportionate share in the five rupee paid collectively to the Numberdar as Pichotra and towards the pay of Patwari. Thus effective revenue taken from a farmer was 40 percent of the produce.\n\u2022\t'''British'''. The British introduced system of direct revenue collection, wherein one quarter of the produce was taken either in cash or kind. All other taxes were removed and the Numberdars and Patwaris became government employees. Thus effective  revenue taken from the farmer during the British period  reduced by nearly half as compared to the Nawab\u2019s rule.\n\nSome Brahmin families who live in Bhadani are descendants of Kanwa dynasty that ruled Magadh empire from 76 BC to 26 BC. Prominent personalities of Kanwa family in Bhadani include Pandit Singh Ram Pehalwan.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n[[Category:Villages in Jhajjar district]]\n\n{{haryana-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ashwani sahrawat", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badhani"}

It was produced by Gilmour, [[Martin Glover|Youth]], [[Andrew Jackson (recording engineer)|Andy Jackson]] and [[Phil Manzanera]]. Only one track, \"[[Louder than Words (Pink Floyd song)|Louder than Words]]\", has lead vocals.

It was the third Pink Floyd album recorded under the leadership of guitarist [[David Gilmour]] after the departure of bassist [[Roger Waters]] in 1985, and the first following the death in 2008 of keyboardist [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]], who appears posthumously.\n\n''The Endless River'' comprises [[instrumental music|instrumental]] and [[ambient music]] based on material recorded during sessions for the band's previous album, ''[[The Division Bell]]'' (1994). Additional material was recorded in 2013 and 2014 on Gilmour's ''[[Astoria (recording studio)|Astoria]]'' boat studio and in Medina Studios in [[Hove]], England. It was produced by Gilmour, [[Martin Glover|Youth]], [[Andrew Jackson (recording engineer)|Andy Jackson]] and [[Phil Manzanera]]. Only one track, \"[[Louder than Words (Pink Floyd song)|Louder than Words]]\", has lead vocals. After the death of longtime Pink Floyd artist [[Storm Thorgerson]] in 2013, the cover was created by artist [[Ahmed Emad Eldin]], design company [[Stylorouge]], and [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]], co-founder of Thorgerson's design company [[Hipgnosis]].\n\n''The Endless River'' was promoted with the \"Louder than Words\" single and artwork installations in cities around the world.
