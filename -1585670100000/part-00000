Nobile was a developer and promoter of [[semi-rigid airship]]s [[Aviation between the World Wars|between the two World Wars]].  He is primarily remembered for designing and piloting the [[airship]] [[Norge (airship)|''Norge'']], which may have been the first aircraft to reach the [[North Pole]], and which was indisputably the first to fly across the polar ice cap from Europe to America.  Nobile also designed and flew the ''[[Airship Italia|Italia]],'' a second polar airship; this second expedition ended in a deadly crash and provoked an international rescue effort.\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Umberto Nobile 1926.jpg|thumb|Umberto Nobile and his dog Titina in 1926]]\nBorn in  [[Lauro]], in the southern Italian [[province of Avellino]], Nobile graduated from the [[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]] with degrees in both electrical and industrial engineering. In 1906 he began working for the Italian state railways, where he worked on electrification of the rail system. In 1911 his interests turned to the field of aeronautical engineering, and he enrolled in a one-year course offered by the Italian Army.  Nobile had always been fascinated by the work of airship pioneers such as [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]]. When Italy entered [[World War I]] in 1915, the then 29-year-old attempted three times to enlist, but was rejected as physically unfit for service.\n\nCommissioned in the Italian air force, Nobile spent the war overseeing airship construction and developing new designs.  The Italian military had already used airships as early as 1912, during the [[Italo-Turkish War]], for bombing and reconnaissance.  Italy built about 20 M-class [[semi-rigid airship]]s with a [[bomb]] load of 1000&nbsp;kg which it used for bombing and anti-shipping missions. The Italians also used other, smaller airships, some of them British-built.  None of Nobile's designs flew until after the war.\n\nIn July 1918, Nobile formed a partnership with the engineers [[Giuseppe Valle]], Benedetto Croce and [[Celestino Usuelli]], which they called the Aeronautical Construction Factory. During this period he also lectured at the University of Naples, obtained his test pilot's license and wrote the textbook ''Elementi di Aerodinamica'' (''Elements of Aerodynamics''). He became convinced that medium-sized, [[semi-rigid airship]]s were superior to [[non-rigid airship|non-rigid]] and [[rigid airship|rigid]] designs. The company's first project was the [[Roma (airship)|Airship T-34]], which was designed for a trans-Atlantic crossing. When the British [[R34 (airship)|R34]] crossed the Atlantic in 1919, Nobile and his partners sold the T-34 to the Italian military.  Later the U.S. Army acquired the ship, and commissioned it as the [[Roma (airship)|''Roma'']]. The ''Roma'' ultimately crashed in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] in 1922 after hitting high tension power lines, killing 34.\n\nThat same year, in the face of political instability and threats to nationalize his company, Nobile traveled to the U.S. to work as a consultant for [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] in [[Akron, Ohio]].  He returned to Italy in 1923 and began construction of a new airship, the N-1.  According to his biography and numerous articles, he was also caught up in a web of political and professional intrigue with competitors and detractors.  His principal antagonists seem to have been General [[Gaetano Arturo Crocco]], a competing airship manufacturer, and General [[Italo Balbo]], chief of the air force general staff, who sought to develop Italy's air fleet with heavier-than-air craft rather than the airships Nobile designed.\n\n==Polar expeditions==\n[[File:Umberto Nobile 1.jpg|thumb|Umberto Nobile, designer of the \"[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]\" watching her departure from the base at Spitsbergen, from forward control car]]\n\n===''Norge''===\n{{further information|Norge (airship)}}\nIn late 1925 Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] sought out Nobile to collaborate on a flight to the North Pole \u2013 still at that time an unreached goal for aviators \u2013 using an airship. Amundsen had previously in early 1925 flown to within 150 [[nautical mile]]s (280&nbsp;km) of the North Pole, in a pair of Italian-built ''[[Dornier Do J|Dornier Wal]]'' flying boats<ref>{{cite web |title=Roald Amundsen and the 1925 North Pole Expedition |url=http://www.historynet.com/roald-amundsen-and-the-1925-north-pole-expedition.htm |accessdate=11 March 2009|date=12 June 2006 }}</ref> along with the American millionaire-adventurer [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] and the pilot [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]], but their planes were forced to land near 88 degrees North and the six men were trapped on the ice for 30 days.\n\nThe Italian State Airship Factory, which had built Nobile's N-1, made it available for the expedition 29 March 1926. Amundsen insisted in the contract that Nobile should be the pilot and that five of the crew should be Italian;<ref name=\"WJM\">{{cite book |author=William James Mills |title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia |pages=19\u201320,116 |isbn=1-57607-422-6 |year=2003 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |quote=page 19: Amundsen now approached the Italian government, which was prepared to negotiate favorable terms on certain conditions: Nobile must participate as commander of the airship, and five of the crew had to be Italian.}} (and {{ISBN|978-1-57607-422-0}})</ref> Amundsen named the airship [[Norge (airship)|''Norge'']] (''Norway''). On 14 April the airship left Italy for [[Leningrad]] in Russia with stops at [[RNAS Pulham|Pulham]] (England) and Oslo. On its way towards its Arctic jumping-off point, [[Ny-\u00c5lesund]] (Kings Bay) at Vestspitsbergen, Svalbard (belonging to Norway) it also made a stop at the airship mast at [[Vads\u00f8]] (Northern Norway).\n\nOn 29 April Amundsen was dismayed at the arrival of [[Richard E. Byrd]]'s American expedition which also aimed to reach the Pole.<ref name=\"WJM\"/> On 9 May, after Byrd<ref name=\"WJM\"/> and [[Floyd Bennett]] departed in their [[Fokker F-VII]] and returned less than 16 hours later claiming to have overflown the Pole, Amundsen was one of the first to congratulate them.<ref name=\"WJM\"/> The ''Norge'' crew pressed ahead with their flight.<ref name=\"WJM\"/>\n\nOn 11 May 1926, the ''Norge'' expedition left Svalbard. Fifteen and a half hours later the ship flew over the Pole and landed two days later in [[Teller, Alaska]];<ref name=\"WJM\"/> strong winds had made the planned landing at Nome, Alaska impossible. In retrospect, the ''Norge'' crew actually achieved their aim of being the first to overfly the Pole: Byrd's 9 May flight, acclaimed for decades as the prestigious first Polar flyover, has since been subjected to several credible challenges,<ref name=\"WJM\"/> including the discovery of Byrd's flight diary which showed that navigational data in his official report was fraudulent. Byrd's co-pilot Bennett is said later to have admitted that they faked their flight to the Pole.\n\nThe ''Norge'' \"Rome to Nome\" flight was acclaimed as another great milestone in flight, but disagreement soon erupted between Nobile (designer and pilot), and Amundsen (expedition leader, observer and passenger) on the flight, as to who deserved greater credit for the expedition.<ref name=\"WJM\"/> The controversy was exacerbated by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] government, which trumpeted the genius of Italian engineering and ordered Nobile on a speaking tour of the U.S., further alienating Amundsen and the Norwegians.\n\n===''Italia''===\n{{further information|Airship Italia}}\nDespite the controversy, Nobile continued to maintain good relations with other polar scientists, and he started planning a new expedition, this time fully under Italian control. Nobile's company managed to sell the N-3 airship to [[Japan]]; however, relations between Nobile and his competitors in the fascist government were hostile, and he and his staff were subjected to threats and intimidation. Nobile's popularity with the public meant he was, for the moment, safe from direct attack. When the plans for his next expedition were announced, [[Italo Balbo]] is said to have commented, \"Let him go, for he cannot possibly come back to bother us anymore.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\">[[Wilbur Cross (author)|Wilbur Cross]], Disaster at the Pole, 2002 {{ISBN|1-58574-496-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Airship Italia|''Italia'']], nearly identical to the ''Norge'', was slowly completed and equipped for Polar flight during 1927\u201328. Part of the difficulty was in raising private funding to cover the costs of the expedition, which finally was financed by the city of Milan; the Italian government limited its direct participation to providing the airship and sending the aging steamer ''Citt\u00e0 di Milano'' as a support vessel to [[Svalbard]], under the command of [[Giuseppe Romagna]].\n[[File:\"N3,\" Japan LOC 26775146275.jpg|thumb|\"N3,\" Japan at Kasumigaura, Japan on 24 May 1927|alt=]]\nThis time the airship used a German hangar at [[S\u0142upsk|Stolp]] en route to Svalbard and the mast at [[Vads\u00f8]] (Northern Norway). On 23 May 1928, after an outstanding 69-hour-long flight to the Siberian group of Arctic islands, the ''Italia'' commenced its flight to the North Pole with Nobile as both pilot and expedition leader. On 24 May, the ship reached the Pole and had already turned back toward Svalbard when it ran into a storm. On 25 May, the ''Italia'' crashed onto the pack ice less than 30 kilometres north of Nordaustlandet (Eastern part of Svalbard). Of the 16 men in the crew, ten were thrown onto the ice as the gondola was smashed; the remaining six crewmen were trapped in the buoyant superstructure as it ascended skyward due to loss of the gondola; the fate of the six men was never resolved.  One of the ten men on the ice, Pomella, died from the impact; Nobile suffered a broken arm, broken leg, broken rib and head injury; Cecioni suffered two badly broken legs; Malmgren suffered a severe shoulder injury and suspected injury to a kidney; and Zappi had several broken ribs.<ref>Wilbur Cross, Disaster at the Pole, Lyons Press 2002</ref>\n\nThe crew managed to salvage several items from the crashed airship gondola, including a radio transceiver, a tent which they later painted red for maximum visibility, and, critically, boxes of food and survival equipment which quick-witted engineer Ettore Arduino had managed to throw onto the ice before he and his five companions were carried off to their deaths by the wrecked but still airborne airship envelope and keel. As the days passed, the drifting sea ice took the survivors towards [[Foyn\u00f8ya|Foyn]] and Broch islands.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\"/>\n\nA few days after the crash the Swedish meteorologist [[Finn Malmgren]] and Nobile's second and third in command Mariano and Zappi decided to leave the immobile group and march towards land. Malmgren, who was injured, weakened and reportedly still depressed over his meteorological advice that he felt contributed to the crash, asked his two Italian companions to continue without him. These two were picked up several weeks later by the Soviet icebreaker [[Krasin (1916 icebreaker)|\"Krasin\"]]. However, there were persistent rumors that Malmgren was killed and cannibalized by Zappi and Mariano.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\"/>\n\nA \"highly imaginative, fictionalized version\" of these events was made into the 1969 film ''[[The Red Tent (film)|The Red Tent]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Barbara Rhodes |url=http://90north.tripod.com/nobilenorthpole.htm |title=Umberto Nobile \u2013 The North Pole Flights |accessdate=11 March 2009}}</ref> The film was an Italian/Soviet co-production and featured [[Peter Finch]] as Nobile, [[Sean Connery]] as Amundsen and [[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]] as Lundborg.\n\n===Controversial search and rescue===\nIn the wake of the crash, a collection of nations, including Soviet Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Italy, launched the first polar air and sea rescue effort. Privately owned ships which had been chartered by polar scientists and explorers also participated. Even Roald Amundsen  put aside his past differences with Nobile and boarded a French [[Latham 47|seaplane]] and headed for the rescue headquarters; this plane disappeared between [[Troms\u00f8]] and [[Svalbard]], and though a pontoon from the craft was later found, the bodies of Amundsen, the pilot [[Ren\u00e9 Guilbaud]] and the four others on board were not.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://searchforamundsen.com/Home.html |title=Search for Amundsen expedition webpage |access-date=13 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802142537/http://www.searchforamundsen.com/Home.html |archive-date=2 August 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter a month of privation for the ''Italia'' survivors, the first rescue plane, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] airforce [[Fokker]] [[ski plane]], piloted by Lieutenant [[Einar Lundborg]] and with Lieutenant Schyberg as observer landed near the crash site. Nobile had prepared a detailed evacuation plan, with the most seriously wounded man (the heavy built mechanic Cecioni) at the top of the list and himself as number 4, with the navigator (Viglieri) and the radio operator (Biagi) as respectively no. 5 and 6. However Lundborg refused to take anyone but Nobile. He argued that the plane could only take one survivor and the other seriously injured man was so heavy Lundborg was unsure he could take off.<ref>{{cite book |author=Vilhjalmur Stefansson |title= A Defence of Nobile |publisher=[[Reader's Digest]] |date=June 1929|author-link= Vilhjalmur Stefansson }}</ref> Nobile was airlifted to [[Ryss Island]], base camp of Swedish and Finnish air rescue efforts. When Lundborg returned alone to pick up a second survivor he crashed his plane on landing, and was trapped with the other five.\n\nEventually, Nobile reached the ''Citt\u00e0 di Milano'' where, he later said, he was dismayed at the incompetence he found. His attempts to help co-ordinate the international rescue effort were blocked, and when he threatened to leave he was placed under virtual arrest by Captain Romagna. His telegrams to the survivors still on the ice, as well as to various people involved in the rescue, were heavily censored. It was wrongly reported in Fascist Italian newspapers that his own evacuation was an obvious sign of cowardice. After 48 days on the ice floe, the last five men of his crew were rescued by the Soviet [[icebreaker]] [[Krasin (1916 icebreaker)|''Krasin'']]. Nobile insisted that he wanted to continue the search for the six crew who were swept away by the airship when it disintegrated, but he was ordered back to Rome with the others.\n\n<!--\n'''List of the aircraft (23 in number), ships (20) and dog-sled teams participating in the rescue effort at Svalbard in the summer of 1928'''\n\n'''Denmark''':\n*State-owned Arctic schooner ''Gustav Holm'' from Kgl.

This show of popularity was unexpected by Nobile's detractors, who had been seeding the foreign and domestic press with accusations against him. An aggrieved Nobile was not shy about his complaints; in an interview with [[Benito Mussolini]], he offended the dictator by detailing his grievances at length. The official inquiry and the embarrassment over the crash gave Nobile's enemies the chance they were looking for: blame for the disaster was placed on his shoulders, and he was accused of abandoning his men on the ice \u2013 charges he would spend the rest of his life trying to dispel. In protest of the findings, General Nobile resigned from the air force in March 1929. He faced a further trial with the death of his wife Carlotta in July 1934.\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1931, Nobile left Italy to work for the next four years in the [[Soviet Union]], where he helped with the Soviet semi-rigid airship programme. Details of the [[Soviet and Russian airships|Soviet Airship Program]] are sparse, but there is an obvious Nobile influence in the design of the airships USSR-V5, and [[SSSR-V6 OSOAVIAKhIM]]. He was allowed to return to Italy to teach in December 1936, before going to the [[United States]] in 1939 to teach aeronautics at [[Lewis University]] in [[Romeoville, Illinois|Romeoville]], [[Illinois]].  When Italy went to war with the United States, he was permitted to remain in the US, but declined the offer of US citizenship and instead returned to Italy in May 1942. After a brief stay in Rome, he moved to Spain where he remained until Italy surrendered to the Allied forces in September 1943.  At that time, he returned to Rome to see to the safety of his only child Maria (born ca. 1921).\n\nIn 1945, the Italian air force cleared Nobile of all charges related to the ''Italia'' crash, and not only reinstated him at his former rank as major general, but promoted him to lieutenant general and awarded him back-pay dating to 1928. The following year he was elected to the [[Italian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] as independent candidate in the lists of the [[Italian Communist Party]].\nHe returned to his beloved University of Naples where he taught, and wrote of his adventures, until his retirement. He also married again, and this time to Gertrude Stolp, a German woman he had met in Spain, who later became chief librarian at the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] in Rome.\n\nNobile died in Rome on 30 July 1978 aged 93 after having celebrated the 50th anniversary of his two polar expeditions. The [[Italian Air Force Museum|Italian Air Force Museum at Vigna di Valle]] (just outside Rome) has a large permanent exhibition on his achievements. Museum ''Museo Civico \"U. Nobile\"'' in Nobile's hometown [[Lauro]] collects his documents and memorabilia.<ref>[http://www.museionline.info/musei/museo-civico-u-nobile Museo Civico \"U.

Nobile was a developer and promoter of [[semi-rigid airship]]s [[Aviation between the World Wars|between the two World Wars]].  He is primarily remembered for designing and piloting the [[airship]] [[Norge (airship)|''Norge'']], which may have been the first aircraft to reach the [[North Pole]], and which was indisputably the first to fly across the polar ice cap from Europe to America.  Nobile also designed and flew the ''[[Airship Italia|Italia]],'' a second polar airship; this second expedition ended in a deadly crash and provoked an international rescue effort.\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Umberto Nobile 1926.jpg|thumb|Umberto Nobile and his dog Titina in 1926]]\nBorn in  [[Lauro]], in the southern Italian [[province of Avellino]], Nobile graduated from the [[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]] with degrees in both electrical and industrial engineering. In 1906 he began working for the Italian state railways, where he worked on electrification of the rail system. In 1911 his interests turned to the field of aeronautical engineering, and he enrolled in a one-year course offered by the Italian Army.  Nobile had always been fascinated by the work of airship pioneers such as [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]]. When Italy entered [[World War I]] in 1915, the then 29-year-old attempted three times to enlist, but was rejected as physically unfit for service.\n\nCommissioned in the Italian air force, Nobile spent the war overseeing airship construction and developing new designs.  The Italian military had already used airships as early as 1912, during the [[Italo-Turkish War]], for bombing and reconnaissance.  Italy built about 20 M-class [[semi-rigid airship]]s with a [[bomb]] load of 1000&nbsp;kg which it used for bombing and anti-shipping missions. The Italians also used other, smaller airships, some of them British-built.  None of Nobile's designs flew until after the war.\n\nIn July 1918, Nobile formed a partnership with the engineers [[Giuseppe Valle]], Benedetto Croce and [[Celestino Usuelli]], which they called the Aeronautical Construction Factory. During this period he also lectured at the University of Naples, obtained his test pilot's license and wrote the textbook ''Elementi di Aerodinamica'' (''Elements of Aerodynamics''). He became convinced that medium-sized, [[semi-rigid airship]]s were superior to [[non-rigid airship|non-rigid]] and [[rigid airship|rigid]] designs. The company's first project was the [[Roma (airship)|Airship T-34]], which was designed for a trans-Atlantic crossing. When the British [[R34 (airship)|R34]] crossed the Atlantic in 1919, Nobile and his partners sold the T-34 to the Italian military.  Later the U.S. Army acquired the ship, and commissioned it as the [[Roma (airship)|''Roma'']]. The ''Roma'' ultimately crashed in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] in 1922 after hitting high tension power lines, killing 34.\n\nThat same year, in the face of political instability and threats to nationalize his company, Nobile traveled to the U.S. to work as a consultant for [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] in [[Akron, Ohio]].  He returned to Italy in 1923 and began construction of a new airship, the N-1.  According to his biography and numerous articles, he was also caught up in a web of political and professional intrigue with competitors and detractors.  His principal antagonists seem to have been General [[Gaetano Arturo Crocco]], a competing airship manufacturer, and General [[Italo Balbo]], chief of the air force general staff, who sought to develop Italy's air fleet with heavier-than-air craft rather than the airships Nobile designed.\n\n==Polar expeditions==\n[[File:Umberto Nobile 1.jpg|thumb|Umberto Nobile, designer of the \"[[Norge (airship)|Norge]]\" watching her departure from the base at Spitsbergen, from forward control car]]\n\n===''Norge''===\n{{further information|Norge (airship)}}\nIn late 1925 Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] sought out Nobile to collaborate on a flight to the North Pole \u2013 still at that time an unreached goal for aviators \u2013 using an airship. Amundsen had previously in early 1925 flown to within 150 [[nautical mile]]s (280&nbsp;km) of the North Pole, in a pair of Italian-built ''[[Dornier Do J|Dornier Wal]]'' flying boats<ref>{{cite web |title=Roald Amundsen and the 1925 North Pole Expedition |url=http://www.historynet.com/roald-amundsen-and-the-1925-north-pole-expedition.htm |accessdate=11 March 2009|date=12 June 2006 }}</ref> along with the American millionaire-adventurer [[Lincoln Ellsworth]] and the pilot [[Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen]], but their planes were forced to land near 88 degrees North and the six men were trapped on the ice for 30 days.\n\nThe Italian State Airship Factory, which had built Nobile's N-1, made it available for the expedition 29 March 1926. Amundsen insisted in the contract that Nobile should be the pilot and that five of the crew should be Italian;<ref name=\"WJM\">{{cite book |author=William James Mills |title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia |pages=19\u201320,116 |isbn=1-57607-422-6 |year=2003 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |quote=page 19: Amundsen now approached the Italian government, which was prepared to negotiate favorable terms on certain conditions: Nobile must participate as commander of the airship, and five of the crew had to be Italian.}} (and {{ISBN|978-1-57607-422-0}})</ref> Amundsen named the airship [[Norge (airship)|''Norge'']] (''Norway''). On 14 April the airship left Italy for [[Leningrad]] in Russia with stops at [[RNAS Pulham|Pulham]] (England) and Oslo. On its way towards its Arctic jumping-off point, [[Ny-\u00c5lesund]] (Kings Bay) at Vestspitsbergen, Svalbard (belonging to Norway) it also made a stop at the airship mast at [[Vads\u00f8]] (Northern Norway).\n\nOn 29 April Amundsen was dismayed at the arrival of [[Richard E. Byrd]]'s American expedition which also aimed to reach the Pole.<ref name=\"WJM\"/> On 9 May, after Byrd<ref name=\"WJM\"/> and [[Floyd Bennett]] departed in their [[Fokker F-VII]] and returned less than 16 hours later claiming to have overflown the Pole, Amundsen was one of the first to congratulate them.<ref name=\"WJM\"/> The ''Norge'' crew pressed ahead with their flight.<ref name=\"WJM\"/>\n\nOn 11 May 1926, the ''Norge'' expedition left Svalbard. Fifteen and a half hours later the ship flew over the Pole and landed two days later in [[Teller, Alaska]];<ref name=\"WJM\"/> strong winds had made the planned landing at Nome, Alaska impossible. In retrospect, the ''Norge'' crew actually achieved their aim of being the first to overfly the Pole: Byrd's 9 May flight, acclaimed for decades as the prestigious first Polar flyover, has since been subjected to several credible challenges,<ref name=\"WJM\"/> including the discovery of Byrd's flight diary which showed that navigational data in his official report was fraudulent. Byrd's co-pilot Bennett is said later to have admitted that they faked their flight to the Pole.\n\nThe ''Norge'' \"Rome to Nome\" flight was acclaimed as another great milestone in flight, but disagreement soon erupted between Nobile (designer and pilot), and Amundsen (expedition leader, observer and passenger) on the flight, as to who deserved greater credit for the expedition.<ref name=\"WJM\"/> The controversy was exacerbated by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] government, which trumpeted the genius of Italian engineering and ordered Nobile on a speaking tour of the U.S., further alienating Amundsen and the Norwegians.\n\n===''Italia''===\n{{further information|Airship Italia}}\nDespite the controversy, Nobile continued to maintain good relations with other polar scientists, and he started planning a new expedition, this time fully under Italian control. Nobile's company managed to sell the N-3 airship to [[Japan]]; however, relations between Nobile and his competitors in the fascist government were hostile, and he and his staff were subjected to threats and intimidation. Nobile's popularity with the public meant he was, for the moment, safe from direct attack. When the plans for his next expedition were announced, [[Italo Balbo]] is said to have commented, \"Let him go, for he cannot possibly come back to bother us anymore.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\">[[Wilbur Cross (author)|Wilbur Cross]], Disaster at the Pole, 2002 {{ISBN|1-58574-496-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Airship Italia|''Italia'']], nearly identical to the ''Norge'', was slowly completed and equipped for Polar flight during 1927\u201328. Part of the difficulty was in raising private funding to cover the costs of the expedition, which finally was financed by the city of Milan; the Italian government limited its direct participation to providing the airship and sending the aging steamer ''Citt\u00e0 di Milano'' as a support vessel to [[Svalbard]], under the command of [[Giuseppe Romagna]].\n[[File:\"N3,\" Japan LOC 26775146275.jpg|thumb|\"N3,\" Japan at Kasumigaura, Japan on 24 May 1927|alt=]]\nThis time the airship used a German hangar at [[S\u0142upsk|Stolp]] en route to Svalbard and the mast at [[Vads\u00f8]] (Northern Norway). On 23 May 1928, after an outstanding 69-hour-long flight to the Siberian group of Arctic islands, the ''Italia'' commenced its flight to the North Pole with Nobile as both pilot and expedition leader. On 24 May, the ship reached the Pole and had already turned back toward Svalbard when it ran into a storm. On 25 May, the ''Italia'' crashed onto the pack ice less than 30 kilometres north of Nordaustlandet (Eastern part of Svalbard). Of the 16 men in the crew, ten were thrown onto the ice as the gondola was smashed; the remaining six crewmen were trapped in the buoyant superstructure as it ascended skyward due to loss of the gondola; the fate of the six men was never resolved.  One of the ten men on the ice, Pomella, died from the impact; Nobile suffered a broken arm, broken leg, broken rib and head injury; Cecioni suffered two badly broken legs; Malmgren suffered a severe shoulder injury and suspected injury to a kidney; and Zappi had several broken ribs.<ref>Wilbur Cross, Disaster at the Pole, Lyons Press 2002</ref>\n\nThe crew managed to salvage several items from the crashed airship gondola, including a radio transceiver, a tent which they later painted red for maximum visibility, and, critically, boxes of food and survival equipment which quick-witted engineer Ettore Arduino had managed to throw onto the ice before he and his five companions were carried off to their deaths by the wrecked but still airborne airship envelope and keel. As the days passed, the drifting sea ice took the survivors towards [[Foyn\u00f8ya|Foyn]] and Broch islands.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\"/>\n\nA few days after the crash the Swedish meteorologist [[Finn Malmgren]] and Nobile's second and third in command Mariano and Zappi decided to leave the immobile group and march towards land. Malmgren, who was injured, weakened and reportedly still depressed over his meteorological advice that he felt contributed to the crash, asked his two Italian companions to continue without him. These two were picked up several weeks later by the Soviet icebreaker [[Krasin (1916 icebreaker)|\"Krasin\"]]. However, there were persistent rumors that Malmgren was killed and cannibalized by Zappi and Mariano.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\"/>\n\nA \"highly imaginative, fictionalized version\" of these events was made into the 1969 film ''[[The Red Tent (film)|The Red Tent]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Barbara Rhodes |url=http://90north.tripod.com/nobilenorthpole.htm |title=Umberto Nobile \u2013 The North Pole Flights |accessdate=11 March 2009}}</ref> The film was an Italian/Soviet co-production and featured [[Peter Finch]] as Nobile, [[Sean Connery]] as Amundsen and [[Hardy Kr\u00fcger]] as Lundborg.\n\n===Controversial search and rescue===\nIn the wake of the crash, a collection of nations, including Soviet Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Italy, launched the first polar air and sea rescue effort. Privately owned ships which had been chartered by polar scientists and explorers also participated. Even Roald Amundsen  put aside his past differences with Nobile and boarded a French [[Latham 47|seaplane]] and headed for the rescue headquarters; this plane disappeared between [[Troms\u00f8]] and [[Svalbard]], and though a pontoon from the craft was later found, the bodies of Amundsen, the pilot [[Ren\u00e9 Guilbaud]] and the four others on board were not.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://searchforamundsen.com/Home.html |title=Search for Amundsen expedition webpage |access-date=13 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802142537/http://www.searchforamundsen.com/Home.html |archive-date=2 August 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter a month of privation for the ''Italia'' survivors, the first rescue plane, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] airforce [[Fokker]] [[ski plane]], piloted by Lieutenant [[Einar Lundborg]] and with Lieutenant Schyberg as observer landed near the crash site. Nobile had prepared a detailed evacuation plan, with the most seriously wounded man (the heavy built mechanic Cecioni) at the top of the list and himself as number 4, with the navigator (Viglieri) and the radio operator (Biagi) as respectively no. 5 and 6. However Lundborg refused to take anyone but Nobile. He argued that the plane could only take one survivor and the other seriously injured man was so heavy Lundborg was unsure he could take off.<ref>{{cite book |author=Vilhjalmur Stefansson |title= A Defence of Nobile |publisher=[[Reader's Digest]] |date=June 1929|author-link= Vilhjalmur Stefansson }}</ref> Nobile was airlifted to [[Ryss Island]], base camp of Swedish and Finnish air rescue efforts. When Lundborg returned alone to pick up a second survivor he crashed his plane on landing, and was trapped with the other five.\n\nEventually, Nobile reached the ''Citt\u00e0 di Milano'' where, he later said, he was dismayed at the incompetence he found. His attempts to help co-ordinate the international rescue effort were blocked, and when he threatened to leave he was placed under virtual arrest by Captain Romagna. His telegrams to the survivors still on the ice, as well as to various people involved in the rescue, were heavily censored. It was wrongly reported in Fascist Italian newspapers that his own evacuation was an obvious sign of cowardice. After 48 days on the ice floe, the last five men of his crew were rescued by the Soviet [[icebreaker]] [[Krasin (1916 icebreaker)|''Krasin'']]. Nobile insisted that he wanted to continue the search for the six crew who were swept away by the airship when it disintegrated, but he was ordered back to Rome with the others.\n\n<!--\n'''List of the aircraft (23 in number), ships (20) and dog-sled teams participating in the rescue effort at Svalbard in the summer of 1928'''\n\n'''Denmark''':\n*State-owned Arctic schooner ''Gustav Holm'' from Kgl.

This show of popularity was unexpected by Nobile's detractors, who had been seeding the foreign and domestic press with accusations against him. An aggrieved Nobile was not shy about his complaints; in an interview with [[Benito Mussolini]], he offended the dictator by detailing his grievances at length. The official inquiry and the embarrassment over the crash gave Nobile's enemies the chance they were looking for: blame for the disaster was placed on his shoulders, and he was accused of abandoning his men on the ice \u2013 charges he would spend the rest of his life trying to dispel. In protest of the findings, General Nobile resigned from the air force in March 1929. He faced a further trial with the death of his wife Carlotta in July 1934.\n\n==Later career==\nIn 1931, Nobile left Italy to work for the next four years in the [[Soviet Union]], where he helped with the Soviet semi-rigid airship programme. Details of the [[Soviet and Russian airships|Soviet Airship Program]] are sparse, but there is an obvious Nobile influence in the design of the airships USSR-V5, and [[SSSR-V6 OSOAVIAKhIM]]. He was allowed to return to Italy to teach in December 1936, before going to the [[United States]] in 1939 to teach aeronautics at [[Lewis University]] in [[Romeoville, Illinois|Romeoville]], [[Illinois]].  When Italy went to war with the United States, he was permitted to remain in the US, but declined the offer of US citizenship and instead returned to Italy in May 1942. After a brief stay in Rome, he moved to Spain where he remained until Italy surrendered to the Allied forces in September 1943.  At that time, he returned to Rome to see to the safety of his only child Maria (born ca. 1921).\n\nIn 1945, the Italian air force cleared Nobile of all charges related to the ''Italia'' crash, and not only reinstated him at his former rank as major general, but promoted him to lieutenant general and awarded him back-pay dating to 1928. The following year he was elected to the [[Italian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] as independent candidate in the lists of the [[Italian Communist Party]].\nHe returned to his beloved University of Naples where he taught, and wrote of his adventures, until his retirement. He also married again, and this time to Gertrude Stolp, a German woman he had met in Spain, who later became chief librarian at the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] in Rome.\n\nNobile died in Rome on 30 July 1978 aged 93 after having celebrated the 50th anniversary of his two polar expeditions. The [[Italian Air Force Museum|Italian Air Force Museum at Vigna di Valle]] (just outside Rome) has a large permanent exhibition on his achievements. Museum ''Museo Civico \"U. Nobile\"'' in Nobile's hometown [[Lauro]] collects his documents and memorabilia.<ref>[http://www.museionline.info/musei/museo-civico-u-nobile Museo Civico \"U.

At the age of eighteen Mubarik began to break away from religion due to contradictions between the teachings of the [[Quran|Qu'ran]] and the way people practice the religion. At first he attempted to practice [[Quranism|Qu'ranism]], but eventually he began to pursue more scientific thought and is no longer religious. However, Mubarik states that Islam still influences him and his music to an extent.<ref name=\":55\" />\n\nMubarik grew up in a \"very working class background, which has obviously shaped a lot of [his] political leanings\". He has repeatedly expressed anti-capitalist sentiment on various interviews and is a self-described [[Marxist-Leninist-Maoist|Marxist-Lenninist-Maoist]]. His political leanings have heavily influenced his musical content, which can be seen most clearly on ''Ilah''.\n\nMubarik's political views have influenced his nationality, which he expressed on his podcast by saying that, \"I was born and live in a place that most people call Canada, which is a [[Settler colonialism|settler-colonial]] state. But I prefer to call it [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. I usually never call myself Canadian, but just consider myself to be [[African Americans|African]]\"\n\nMubarik moved to Edmonton in the spring of 2019.\n\n== Politics and Podcast ==\n\n=== Political Activism and Organizing ===\nIn October of 2016 Mubarik was walking in downtown [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] when he witnessed an altercation between a white woman and a black taxi driver. The woman was attempting to physically harm the taxi driver while yelling obscenities at him, including the [[N-word]] and the phrase \"go back to Africa\". Mubarik videotaped the incident and posted it on [[Facebook]] where he commented on the event saying, \"Racism is 100 per cent intertwined with [[capitalism]] and overall inequality\". The woman has since been investigated by the [[Hamilton Police Service|Hamilton Police]] Hate Crime Unit and has been charged with assault.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Carter|first=Adam|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|title=Woman calls cab driver n\u2014ger during altercation caught on tape|date=October 4, 2016|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=February 16, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008130145/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|archive-date=October 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|title=Emay \u2013 Bakkah: The History of Humankind|last=Njegovan|first=Biljana|date=October 28, 2016|website=Cut From Steel|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225205419/http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first community organizing that Mubarik was involved with was done through the organization called the Young Communist League a democratic socialist group in Canada. While organizing with the YCL, Mubarik met some members of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|PCR-RCP]], which would lead to Mubarik supporting the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|PCR-RCP]] and adhering to a [[Revolutionary|revolutionary ideology]]. Mubarik has also been involved with the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]-based [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Lenninist]] organization entitled [[Serve the People]].\n\n=== On Mass ===\n\nIn January of 2018 Mubarik released the first episode of his podcast entitled ''On Mass''. In the episode, Mubarik explains that his \"goal with this podcast is to basically interpret global and local events through a revolutionary communist perspective or lens and emphasize the importance of revolution for workers and basically oppressed people all over the world if you want to see actual fundamental change.\" When describing his own political leanings on the episode Mubarik stated that \"politically speaking I refer to myself as a [[Maoism|Maoist]] and I'm a supporter of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada]] known as the [[PCR-RCP]] more particularly I adhere to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] ideologically\"\n\nIn the sixth episode, released June 8, 2019, Mubarik mentions that he \"started a new website entitled 'leftistaudiobooks.com' and this is basically just me trying to spread more revolutionary ideas and things like that and making it more accessible because I know a lot of people listen to audiobooks and I listen to audiobooks a lot while I'm working and things like that so that's why I wanted to start this project.\" The website currently only has a single book available entitled [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] by [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of On Mass Episodes\n!Episode No.\n!Title\n!Guests\n!Original Air Date\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|Marxism-Leninism-Maoism with J.

At the age of eighteen Mubarik began to break away from religion due to contradictions between the teachings of the [[Quran|Qu'ran]] and the way people practice the religion. At first he attempted to practice [[Quranism|Qu'ranism]], but eventually he began to pursue more scientific thought and is no longer religious. However, Mubarik states that Islam still influences him and his music to an extent.<ref name=\":55\" />\n\nMubarik grew up in a \"very working class background, which has obviously shaped a lot of [his] political leanings\". He has repeatedly expressed anti-capitalist sentiment on various interviews and is a self-described [[Marxist-Leninist-Maoist|Marxist-Lenninist-Maoist]]. His political leanings have heavily influenced his musical content, which can be seen most clearly on ''Ilah''.\n\nMubarik's political views have influenced his nationality, which he expressed on his podcast by saying that, \"I was born and live in a place that most people call Canada, which is a [[Settler colonialism|settler-colonial]] state.

Mubarik videotaped the incident and posted it on Facebook where he commented on the event saying, \"Racism is 100 per cent intertwined with [[capitalism]] and overall inequality\".

Mubarik has also been involved with the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]-based [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Lenninist]] organization called [[Serve the People]].\n\n=== On Mass ===\n\nOn January 16, 2018 Mubarik released the first episode of his podcast entitled ''On Mass''. In the episode, Mubarik explains that his \"goal with this podcast is to basically interpret global and local events through a revolutionary communist perspective or lens and emphasize the importance of revolution for workers and basically oppressed people all over the world if you want to see actual fundamental change.\" When describing his political leanings on the episode Mubarik stated that \"politically speaking I refer to myself as a [[Maoism|Maoist]] and I'm a supporter of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada]] known as the [[PCR-RCP]] more particularly I adhere to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] ideologically\"\n\nIn the sixth episode, released June 8, 2019, Mubarik mentions that he \"started a new website entitled 'leftistaudiobooks.com' and this is basically just me trying to spread more revolutionary ideas and things like that and making it more accessible because I know a lot of people listen to audiobooks and I listen to audiobooks a lot while I'm working and things like that so that's why I wanted to start this project.\" The website currently only has a single book available entitled [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] by [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of On Mass Episodes\n!Episode No.\n!Title\n!Guests\n!Original Air Date\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|Marxism-Leninism-Maoism with J.

The episode was entitled \"On Mass: Maoism, Hip Hop, & Black Panther\". The episode cites Maoist Rebel News\u2014a small news site and blog run by Jason Unruhe\u2014as a bad representation of [[Maoism]]. The episode features songs from Emay's album ''Ilah'' including \"Lilac (feat. Kamilah and L-SPEX)\" and \"Israfil 'angels trumpet'\" as well as an unreleased song entitled \"Volunteer\". Mubarik states that the biggest misconceptions concerning [[Maoism]] is the conflation of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] with [[Mao-Zedong-Thought|Mao Zedong Thought]], the dogmatic view that everything [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] said is correct and representative of [[Maoism]], and that a [[Cultural Revolution]] is not necessary. Mubarik cites the [[Black Power movement]], The Revolutionary Internationalist Movement, and [[Shining Path|The Shining Path]] as some of the first and imperfect examples of attempting to implement Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism and cites the book entitled The Unknown Cultural Revolution written by Dongping Han as a good source for understanding the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The episode spends some time discussing the [[Black Panther Party]] and its attempt at implementing [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism|Marxism-Leninnism-Maoism]] in the 1960s and how the [[Black Panther (film)|Black Pather Movie]] was not representative of the party or the ideology.

It is home to the [[86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]]. The school is located in Vermont's [[Green Mountains]].\n\n==Purpose==\nThe school teaches a number of courses to train soldiers of the army (including Active Duty, the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], [[United States Army National Guard|Army National Guard]], and [[ROTC|ROTC cadets]]) in military operations in mountainous areas. Graduates of the Basic Military Mountaineer Course (BMMC) receive the special qualification identifier (SQI) of \"E,\" Military Mountaineer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/amws/Mission.html|title=The United States Army {{!}} Fort Benning {{!}} Army Mountain Warfare School {{!}} Home|website=www.benning.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe school runs 'summer' sessions focusing on rock climbing and high-angle tactical combat, and 'winter' courses that also include winter travel, camping, and survival skills.  The basic and advanced courses of instruction trains individual soldiers, not [[Military unit|units]]. These soldiers then return to their units to provide at least some training and experience in mountain warfare throughout the U.S. Army.  Unit training, both at the AMWS and at the requesting unit's location, can also be provided.\n\n==Overview==\nThe school was established in April 1983 to train members of the [[172nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|3rd Battalion, 172nd Infantry Regiment (Mountain)]] then consisting of company-sized units from several New England states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/amws/content/pdf/The%20History%20of%20the%20AMWS.pdf|title=The History of the Army Mountain Warfare School|website=Army Mountain Warfare School|format=PDF|orig-year=2011|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref> Enrollment was opened over the years to include members of all branches of the armed services, Federal law enforcement and foreign armies. The curriculum design broadens the soldier's knowledge and unit\u2019s capabilities. The curriculum is designed to enable the soldier to operate in mountains and cold and to enable him to assist in planning operations. The school uses a small group participatory learning process.\n\nThe school conducts three primary courses of instruction (Basic Military Mountaineer, Advanced Military Mountaineer (Summer) and Advanced Military Mountaineer (Winter). Each level is to prepare soldiers to operate in mountains year-round and in cold, snowy, and/or icy environments. The Army Mountain Warfare School is the only institution that awards the Skill Qualification Identifier (SQI) \"E,\" Military Mountaineer (Note: This identifier is also awarded to graduates of the [[Northern Warfare Training Center]]'s BMMC\u2014conducted by [[U.S. Army Alaska]] in Black Rapids, [[Alaska]]\u2014and the Special Forces Advanced Mountain Operations School\u2014conducted by the [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School]] in [[Estes Park, Colorado]].).\n\nThe school is the executive agent for military mountaineering for the [[United States Army Infantry School]]. The school is responsible for the content of Field Manual 3\u201397.61, Military Mountaineering. The school is the only non-European permanent member of the International Association of Military Mountain Schools (IAMMS).\n\nThe curriculum is broken down into a two-week course, with three general type of mountain-specific skills taught in each: individual, small unit, and medical. The Basic Military Mountaineer Course is a prerequisite to attend the Advanced Military Mountaineer Course. The training focus is on providing the force structure with soldiers capable of assisting their units in mountainous  environments. Courses for the Basic and Advanced Mountaineering Courses run monthly from May through October and January through March.\n\nIt is very common for [[Army ROTC]] cadets to attend AMWS as a specialty school during ROTC. Cadets take the course during the summer as they are in school, and training during the school season. Other ROTC summer schools include: [[Airborne School]], [[Air Assault School]], Combat Diver Qualification Course, Drill Cadet Leadership Training, and Northern Warfare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/armyrotc/summer_training_opportunities.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516003606/http://www.memphis.edu/armyrotc/summer_training_opportunities.htm |archivedate=16 May 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThis school is not to be confused with the Mountain phase of [[Ranger School]].\n\n==Courses==\n''Basic Military Mountaineer Course:'' Combined both the summer and winter courses of instruction into one combined course that will cover components of each phase depending on the time of year. The purpose of the BMMC is to train soldiers in the skills required to conduct mountain combat operations during any climatic conditions and to award the SQI \"E\" upon graduation. The following are general subject areas taught during this course of instruction: mountain navigation skills, individual mountain skills, small unit mountain skills, mountain medical skills, and summer specific practical exercises.<ref name=\"AMWS Courses\">[https://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/amws/Courses.html Army Mountain Warfare School (AMWS), Basic Military Mountaineer Courses (BMMC)], U.S. Army Fort Benning and The Maneuver Center of Excellence official website, last updated 25 May 2018, last accessed 17 March 2019</ref>\n\n''Advanced Military Mountaineer Course (Summer):'' The purpose of the Advanced Military Mountaineer Course (Summer) is to train soldiers in the knowledge/skills required to lead small units/teams over technically difficult, hazardous or exposed (class 4 and 5) mountainous terrain during summer months.

Students are subjected to effects of altitude/cold/terrain on: personnel, equipment, movement, patrolling, reconnaissance, fire control, [[casualty evacuation]] (CASEVAC), offensive/defensive operations, required/available equipment and its use, resupply considerations, and water procurement.  Practical exercises cover CASEVAC, patrolling, patrol base operations, rappelling, rope management, and route planning.<ref name=\"AMWS Courses\"/>\n\n''Mountain Rifleman Course:'' The purpose of the Mountain Rifleman Course is to train [[snipers]] and squad [[designated marksman]] a combination of mountain specific skills and angle marksmanship fundamentals.  The goal is improving mobility and lethality in mountainous terrain.  Soldiers are provided with extensive shooting opportunities at both flat and angle ranges.  Soldiers are taught basic mountain mobility and navigation skills.  The skills are then combined in practical exercises that test a student's ability to plan and execute missions in mountainous terrain.  The tasks taught are: mountain travel techniques, cold weather clothing, environmental injuries, soldier load management, characteristics of mountain terrain, basic mountaineering equipment, long range marksmanship in mountainous terrain, map reading in mountainous terrain, terrain exploitation, and land navigation.<ref name=\"AMWS Courses\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of mountain warfare forces]]\n*[[Mountain Warfare Training Center]] ([[United States Marine Corps]])\n*[[Northern Warfare Training Center]] ([[United States Army]])\n*[[Mountain Warfare Training Camp Michael Monsoor]] ([[United States Navy]])\n*[[Russian Hatsavita Mountain Warfare Training]] ([[Russian Army|Russia]])\n*[[Mountain Leader Training Cadre]] ([[British Army|UK]])\n*[[High Mountain Military School]] ([[French Army|France]])\n*[[High Altitude Warfare School]]  ([[Indian Army|India]])\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official|http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/amws}}\n*[http://vt.public.ng.mil/ Vermont National Guard]\n\n{{TRADOC}}\n\n{{coord|44.4796321|-72.9508469|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Jericho, Vermont]]\n[[Category:Education in Chittenden County, Vermont]]\n[[Category:Mountain warfare training installations]]\n[[Category:United States Army National Guard]]\n[[Category:United States Army schools]]\n[[Category:Military installations in Vermont]]\n", "text_old": "{{use mdy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}\n{{short description|United States Army school}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name = U.S. Army Mountain Warfare School\n| image = AMWS Seal.png\n| caption = U.S. Army Mountain Warfare School seal\n| dates = 1983\u2013present\n| country= {{flagdeco|United States}} [[United States|United States of America]]\n| branch= {{army|United States}}\n| type= [[Military education and training|Military training]]\n| role= Special skills training\n| command_structure = Army National Guard Regional Training Institute (managed by the [[Vermont National Guard|Vermont Army National Guard]])\n| garrison = Camp Ethan Allen Training Site\n| garrison_label =\n| website = [https://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/amws/ AMWS's official website]\n| current_commander =\n| commander1 =\n| commander1_label =\n| notable_commanders =\n| identification_symbol = [[File:MTN-TAB.png|150px|center]][[File:US Army National Guard Regional Training Institute Shoulder Sleeve Insignia.png|135px|center]]\n| identification_symbol_label = Army National Guard Regional Training Institute [[shoulder sleeve insignia]] with [[Tabs of the United States Army|Mountain Tab]], worn by AMWS [[Cadre (military)|cadre]]\n| identification_symbol_2 = [[File:Ramshead Device(2).jpg|130px|center]]\n| identification_symbol_2_label = [[Ram's Head Device]], awarded upon graduation<ref name=\"History of Ram's Head\">[http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/amws/content/pdf/The%20History%20of%20the%20Rams%20Head%20Device.pdf The History of the Ram's Read Device], U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence, Army Mountain Warfare School website, dated 5 September 2013, last accessed 18 March 2019</ref> (an Army National Guard skill badge)\n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| perrow   = 2\n| width1   = 228\n| image1   = US Army Mountain Warfare School-Assent training.jpg\n| caption1 = A [[U.S. Air Force]] [[United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party|TACP]] learns ascent techniques during summer BMMC\n| width2   = 201\n| image2   = AMWS high-angle CASEVAC training.png\n| caption2 = A soldier conducts high-angle CASEVAC training during BMMC\n| width3   = 209\n| image3   = US Army Mountain Warfare School-Ethan Allen Firing Range.jpg\n| caption3 = Soldiers practice adverse angle shooting as part of AMWS training\n| width4   = 220\n| image4   = US Army Mountain Warfare School-Mountain Walk.jpg\n| caption4 = Soldiers conduct the \"Mountain Walk,\" a culminating event for AMWS courses\n}}\n\nThe '''Army Mountain Warfare School''' ('''AMWS''') is a [[United States Army]] school located at the [[Camp Ethan Allen Training Site]], [[Jericho, Vermont]] to train soldiers in [[mountain warfare]], the specialized skills required for operating in mountainous terrain. It is home to the [[86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team]]. The school is located in Vermont's [[Green Mountains]].\n\n==Purpose==\nThe school teaches a number of courses to train soldiers of the army (including Active Duty, the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], [[United States Army National Guard|Army National Guard]], and [[ROTC|ROTC cadets]]) in military operations in mountainous areas. Graduates of the Basic Military Mountaineer Course (BMMC) receive the special qualification identifier (SQI) of \"E,\" Military Mountaineer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/amws/Mission.html|title=The United States Army {{!}} Fort Benning {{!}} Army Mountain Warfare School {{!}} Home|website=www.benning.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe school runs 'summer' sessions focusing on rock climbing and high-angle tactical combat, and 'winter' courses that also include winter travel, camping, and survival skills.  The basic and advanced courses of instruction trains individual soldiers, not [[Military unit|units]]. These soldiers then return to their units to provide at least some training and experience in mountain warfare throughout the U.S. Army.  Unit training, both at the AMWS and at the requesting unit's location, can also be provided.\n\n==Overview==\nThe school was established in April 1983 to train members of the [[172nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|3rd Battalion, 172nd Infantry Regiment (Mountain)]] then consisting of company-sized units from several New England states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/amws/content/pdf/The%20History%20of%20the%20AMWS.pdf|title=The History of the Army Mountain Warfare School|website=Army Mountain Warfare School|format=PDF|orig-year=2011|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref> Enrollment was opened over the years to include members of all branches of the armed services, Federal law enforcement and foreign armies. The curriculum design broadens the soldier's knowledge and unit\u2019s capabilities. The curriculum is designed to enable the soldier to operate in mountains and cold and to enable him to assist in planning operations. The school uses a small group participatory learning process.\n\nThe school conducts three primary courses of instruction (Basic Military Mountaineer, Advanced Military Mountaineer (Summer) and Advanced Military Mountaineer (Winter). Each level is to prepare soldiers to operate in mountains year-round and in cold, snowy, and/or icy environments. The Army Mountain Warfare School is the only institution that awards the Skill Qualification Identifier (SQI) \u201cE,\u201d Military Mountaineer (Note: This identifier is also awarded to graduates of the [[Northern Warfare Training Center]]'s BMMC\u2014conducted by [[U.S. Army Alaska]] in Black Rapids, [[Alaska]]\u2014and the Special Forces Advanced Mountain Operations School\u2014conducted by the [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School]] in [[Estes Park, Colorado]].).\n\nThe school is the executive agent for military mountaineering for the [[United States Army Infantry School]]. The school is responsible for the content of Field Manual 3\u201397.61, Military Mountaineering. The school is the only non-European permanent member of the International Association of Military Mountain Schools (IAMMS).\n\nThe curriculum is broken down into a two-week course, with three general type of mountain-specific skills taught in each: individual, small unit, and medical. The Basic Military Mountaineer Course is a prerequisite to attend the Advanced Military Mountaineer Course. The training focus is on providing the force structure with soldiers capable of assisting their units in mountainous  environments. Courses for the Basic and Advanced Mountaineering Courses run monthly from May through October and January through March.\n\nIt is very common for [[Army ROTC]] cadets to attend AMWS as a specialty school during ROTC. Cadets take the course during the summer as they are in school, and training during the school season. Other ROTC summer schools include: [[Airborne School]], [[Air Assault School]], Combat Diver Qualification Course, Drill Cadet Leadership Training, and Northern Warfare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/armyrotc/summer_training_opportunities.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516003606/http://www.memphis.edu/armyrotc/summer_training_opportunities.htm |archivedate=16 May 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThis school is not to be confused with the Mountain phase of [[Ranger School]].\n\n==Courses==\n''Basic Military Mountaineer Course:'' Combined both the summer and winter courses of instruction into one combined course that will cover components of each phase depending on the time of year. The purpose of the BMMC is to train soldiers in the skills required to conduct mountain combat operations during any climatic conditions and to award the SQI \"E\" upon graduation. The following are general subject areas taught during this course of instruction: mountain navigation skills, individual mountain skills, small unit mountain skills, mountain medical skills, and summer specific practical exercises.<ref name=\"AMWS Courses\">[https://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/amws/Courses.html Army Mountain Warfare School (AMWS), Basic Military Mountaineer Courses (BMMC)], U.S. Army Fort Benning and The Maneuver Center of Excellence official website, last updated 25 May 2018, last accessed 17 March 2019</ref>\n\n''Advanced Military Mountaineer Course (Summer):'' The purpose of the Advanced Military Mountaineer Course (Summer) is to train soldiers in the knowledge/skills required to lead small units/teams over technically difficult, hazardous or exposed (class 4 and 5) mountainous terrain during summer months.
