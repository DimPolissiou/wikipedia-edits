In his trial that took place after this delay, the [[jury]] found Wolfe not guilty; however, upon acquittal, the county sheriff drove him to the city of [[Angels Camp]] in nearby [[Calaveras County]], \"unceremoniously dumped\" him there, and told him to never again set foot in Tuolumne County.<ref name=\"Enterprise legend\" />\n\nAccording to historian Eric Jung, this series of events made Wolfe \"finally decide &lsquo;I've had enough of people&rsquo;,\" and for the rest of his life he would live off the land deep inside the rugged Sierras.<ref name=\"Enterprise legend\" /> Wolfe built himself two log cabins.

The electorate was first formed for the {{NZ election link|1866}} and has been abolished three times during its history. It was last re-established for the {{NZ election link|2008}} and has since been held by [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]] for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].\n\n==Region and population centres==\nThe electorate is mainly rural, stretching from the [[Southern Alps]] to the [[Banks Peninsula]], its borders broadly defined by the [[Rakaia River]] in the south and the [[Waimakariri River]] in the north. Major towns include [[Rolleston, New Zealand|Rolleston]], [[Lincoln, New Zealand|Lincoln]], [[Prebbleton]], and [[Darfield, New Zealand|Darfield]], with smaller towns such as [[Tai Tapu]], [[Leeston]] and [[Dunsandel]].

This followed a review of electoral boundaries conducted after the 2006 Census, because of a general northwards population movement in the South Island. Even though the number of South Island electorates is fixed, the  decline in the population of electorates from Rakaia south has resulted in the boundaries of electorates from [[Invercargill (New Zealand electorate)|Invercargill]] north to Rakaia shifting further northwards.\n\nDue to the rapid growth of Selwyn relative to Christchurch (which lost population after the earthquakes), the 2013 redistribution had Selwyn losing [[Halswell]] and [[Westmorland, New Zealand|Westmorland]] to [[Port Hills (New Zealand electorate)|Port Hills]] and Harewood to [[Waimakariri (New Zealand electorate)|Waimakariri]] while regaining the towns of [[Rakaia]] and [[Chertsey, New Zealand|Chertsey]] back from [[Rangitata (New Zealand electorate)|Rangitata]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Report of the Representation Commission 2014 |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/report_of_the_representation_commission_2014.pdf |isbn=978-0-477-10414-2 |publisher=Representation Commission |accessdate=26 September 2014 |page=10 |format=PDF |date=4 April 2014}}</ref> Data from the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]] showed Selywn's population had continued to grow \u2013 it had the largest discrepancy of any electorate \u2013 and so the electorate would need to lose further area for the 2020 boundaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/116008966/census-new-zealand-to-gain-one-new-seat-in-2020-election|title=Census 2018: New Zealand to gain one new seat in 2020 election|last=Cooke|first=Henry|date=23 September 2019|website=Stuff|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref> It shed an area around Hornby South to {{NZ electorate link|Wigram}}, the Banks Peninsula to the recreated {{NZ electorate link|Banks Peninsula}}, the area west of the [[Rakaia]] to {{NZ electorate link|Rangitata}}, and an area around [[Christchurch Airport]] to {{NZ electorate link|Ilam}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Voting history ===\nThe dominant topic for the [[1875\u20131876 New Zealand general election|1875 election]]<!-- election held on 30 December 1875 --> was the abolition of the [[Provinces of New Zealand|Provinces]].

The electorate was first formed for the {{NZ election link|1866}} and has been abolished three times during its history. It was last re-established for the {{NZ election link|2008}} and has since been held by [[Amy Adams (politician)|Amy Adams]] for the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].\n\n==Region and population centres==\nThe electorate is mainly rural, stretching from the [[Southern Alps]] to the [[Banks Peninsula]], its borders broadly defined by the [[Rakaia River]] in the south and the [[Waimakariri River]] in the north. Major towns include [[Rolleston, New Zealand|Rolleston]], [[Lincoln, New Zealand|Lincoln]], [[Prebbleton]], and [[Darfield, New Zealand|Darfield]], with smaller towns such as [[Tai Tapu]], [[Leeston]] and [[Dunsandel]]. The electorate also includes parts of [[Christchurch]] city's territorial authority.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Existence and changes to area ===\nAn electorate called Selwyn existed between [[1866 New Zealand general election|1866]] and [[1919 New Zealand general election|1919]]. A Selwyn electorate also existed between [[1946 New Zealand general election|1946]] and [[1972 New Zealand general election|1972]] and again from [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978]] until it was absorbed by [[Rakaia (New Zealand electorate)|Rakaia]] for the first [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] election in [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996]].{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=91\u201396}} The latest version of the Selwyn electorate was created for the 2008 election. This followed a review of electoral boundaries conducted after the 2006 Census, because of a general northwards population movement in the South Island. Even though the number of South Island electorates is fixed, the  decline in the population of electorates from Rakaia south has resulted in the boundaries of electorates from [[Invercargill (New Zealand electorate)|Invercargill]] north to Rakaia shifting further northwards.\n\nDue to the rapid growth of Selwyn relative to Christchurch (which lost population after the earthquakes), the 2013 redistribution had Selwyn losing [[Halswell]] and [[Westmorland, New Zealand|Westmorland]] to [[Port Hills (New Zealand electorate)|Port Hills]] and Harewood to [[Waimakariri (New Zealand electorate)|Waimakariri]] while regaining the towns of [[Rakaia]] and [[Chertsey, New Zealand|Chertsey]] back from [[Rangitata (New Zealand electorate)|Rangitata]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Report of the Representation Commission 2014 |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/bulk-upload/documents/report_of_the_representation_commission_2014.pdf |isbn=978-0-477-10414-2 |publisher=Representation Commission |accessdate=26 September 2014 |page=10 |format=PDF |date=4 April 2014}}</ref> Data from the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]] showed Selywn's population had continued to grow \u2013 it had the largest discrepancy of any electorate \u2013 and so the electorate would need to lose further area for the 2020 boundaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/116008966/census-new-zealand-to-gain-one-new-seat-in-2020-election|title=Census 2018: New Zealand to gain one new seat in 2020 election|last=Cooke|first=Henry|date=23 September 2019|website=Stuff|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref> It shed an area around Hornby South to {{NZ electorate link|Wigram}}, the Banks Peninsula to the recreated {{NZ electorate link|Banks Peninsula}}, the area west of the [[Rakaia]] to {{NZ electorate link|Rangitata}}, and an area around [[Christchurch Airport]] to {{NZ electorate link|Ilam}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vote.nz/assets/Boundary-Review/REPORT-OF-THE-REPRESENTATION-COMMISSION-2020.pdf |title=Report of the Representation Commission 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Voting history ===\nThe dominant topic for the [[1875\u20131876 New Zealand general election|1875 election]]<!-- election held on 30 December 1875 --> was the abolition of the [[Provinces of New Zealand|Provinces]].
