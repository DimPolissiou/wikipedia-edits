The road was one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome and became one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Up until the 1850s it was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility and it was enriched with feasts and games. After a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI.

Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]] and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.  The Pope intended for it to reach Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of Ripa Grande]].<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main goal behind these plans was to superimpose a regular road network with the focus given to the Tiber by medieval Rome's disorderly buildings; together with the new [[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]] that Alexander VI opened in the Borgo, the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the Lungara and Via Giulia created a quadrilateral network of modern roads in the city's maze of alleys.<ref name=\"po19\"/> In the original project Via Giulia was supposed to reach the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] via the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]''.<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> The center of the city shifted towards the Vatican and [[Trastevere]] and away from the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], which was the symbol of the Roman nobility's power;<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> the plan was intended to separate the papacy from the city's powerful noble families, particularly the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] families.<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\n\nThese projects had a secondary, celebrative goal to promote the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families and conquered [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]],<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> as testified in an inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi''.<ref>IVLIO.II.PONT:OPT:MAX:QVOD FINIB:DITIONIS.S.R.E.PROLATIS ITALIAQ:LIBERATA VRBEM ROMAM OCCVPATE SIMILIOREM QVAM DIVISE PATEFACTIS DIMENSIS Q: VIIS PRO MAIESTATE IMPERII ORNAVIT (''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

In 1586, the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' (lit. \"Beggar's Hospice\") was built by the architect [[Domenico Fontana]] on the orders of [[Pope Sixtus V]] (r. 1585-1590) and marked the end of the ''Via Giulia''.<ref name=pie7976/> It was built to solve the begging problem in the city and was given a yearly endowment of 150,000 ''[[roman scudo|scudi]]'' which could employ 2,000 people.<ref name=cas415>Castagnoli (1988), p. 415</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century it had become fashionable for the various nations and city-states to have their own churches built in Rome known as the ''chiese nazionali''.<ref name=cas392/> The ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], along the [[procession]]al and pilgrim roads, were the preferred locations. The Florentines,  the Sienese, and the Neapolitans had their churches built in Via Giulia (the [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini|San Giovanni]], the [[Santa Caterina da Siena a Via Giulia|Santa Caterina]], and the [[Santo Spirito dei Napoletani|Santo Spirito]] respectively),<ref name=del473/><ref name=pie16/> while the Bolognese ([[Santi Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio|San Giovanni e Petronio]]), Spanish ([[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli|Santa Maria in Monserrato]]), English ([[San Tommaso di Canterbury]]) and Swedish ([[Santa Brigida, Rome|Santa Brigida]]) churches were built in the Regola ''rione''.<ref name=cas392>Castagnoli (1958), p. 392</ref>\n\nIn order to supply the quarter with sufficient drinking water, [[Pope Paul V]] (r. 1605-1621) had the [[Aqua Paola]] extend over the Tiber. In 1613, the ''Fontanone di Ponte Sisto'' (lit. \"The Big Fountain of the Sistine Bridge\") was built on the [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the beggars' hospice on Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7978/> It was demolished in 1879 and rebuilt in 1898 on the opposite side of the [[Ponte Sisto]] in what is now ''Piazza Trilussa''.[[:File:Fontana di Ponte Sisto.jpg|(Fig.)]].<ref name=pie7978/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\n 1645 Antonio Tempesta Via Giulia marked.svg|Via Giulia; Particular from ''Almae urbis Romae prospectus'' by [[Antonio Tempesta]] (1645)\n</gallery>\nAt the end of the 16th century Via Giulia's path was fixed; it ended by the Florentine quarter to the north and the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' to the south.

The road was one of the first important urban planning projects in papal Rome and became one of the main centers of the [[Roman Renaissance|Renaissance]]. Up until the 1850s it was one of the favorite streets of the Roman nobility and it was enriched with feasts and games. After a two-century decline, from the 1950s onwards the road's fame was renewed to be one of the city's most prestigious locations.\n\n==Location==\nVia Giulia runs along the left (east) bank of the [[Tiber]] from ''Piazza San Vincenzo Pallotti'', near [[Ponte Sisto]], to ''Piazza dell'Oro''. It is about 1 kilometre long and connects the [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]] [[rioni of Rome|Rioni]].\n\n==Denominations==\nThe road was named after its patron, [[Pope Julius II]] [[della Rovere]] (r. 1503-1513), who ordered its construction in 1508.<ref name=bramanteDbi/><ref name=del472>Delli (1988), p. 472</ref> It had been also called {{Lang|la|Via Magistralis}} (lit. \"master road\") because of its importance,<ref name=del472/> and {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\") because of its layout.<ref name=del473/>\n\n==History==\nThe area of the ancient {{Lang|la|[[Campus Martius]]}} developed into one of the most densely populated districts (''abitato'') of Rome since the early [[Middle Ages]]. The maze of narrow alleys was criss-crossed by three narrow thoroughfares: the {{Lang|la|Via Papalis}} (lit. \"papal road\"),<ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi'' - ''via del Governo Vecchio'' - ''piazza di Pasquino'' - ''piazza di S.Pantaleo''  - ''piazza d'Aracoeli'' - ''Campidoglio'' - ''Stradone di S.Giovanni''</ref> the {{Lang|la|Via Peregrinorum}} (lit. \"pilgrims' road\") <ref>Today's ''Via dei Banchi Vecchi'' - ''Via del Pellegrino'' - ''via dei Giubbonari''</ref> and the {{Lang|la|Via Recta}} (lit. \"straight road\").<ref>Today's ''[[via dei Coronari]]''</ref><ref name=tem57>Temple(2011), p. 57</ref> [[Procession]]s travelled through these streets almost daily during the [[Middle Ages]] to the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo|Angels' Bridge]]. As [[Dante Alighieri]] described in the [[Divine Comedy]], in 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] (r. 1294-1303) ordered a two-way traffic system to be set up to avoid traffic jams or panic as a response to the dense crowds on Angels' Bridge.<ref>Dante Aligheri: Inferno, canto XVIII, vv. 28\u20133\u20133</ref> After [[Pope Martin V]] (r. 1417-1431) [[Western_Schism#Resolution|returned]] to Rome in 1420, the influx of pilgrims increased significantly again, especially in the [[Jubilee]] years. On 29 December 1450, the last day of the Holy Year, a [[stampede]] broke out on the bridge that killed more than 300 people.<ref name=gi9038>Gigli (1990) p. 38</ref><ref name=gi9040>Gigli (1990) p. 40</ref>\nAs a result of the catastrophe, [[Pope Nicholas V]] (r. 1447-1455) ordered the Angels' Bridge to be cleared of stalls and shops and the first urban planning measures in the area were initiated. In 1475, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484) ordered the [[Ponte Sisto]], named after him, to be built across the [[Tiber]] [[:File:Ponte Sisto Bauinschrift 1475.jpg|(inscription)]] in order to relieve the pilgrimage route across the Angels' Bridge and to connect the ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Trastevere]].<ref name=pie7982>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 82</ref> At the same time he ordered the restoration of ''Via Pelegrinorum'' and the area around the ''[[Campo de' Fiori]]'' [[:File:Via Florea Stadterneuerung.jpg|(inscription)]]. According to the chronicler [[Stefano Infessura]], however, strategic reasons aside from reducing traffic were also important for these projects.<ref>Stefano Infessura: ''Diario Rerum Romanorum''; Roma 1890 p. 79 f.: February 1475</ref> In 1497 [[Pope Alexander VI]] (r. 1492-1503) ordered the widening of ''Via Peregrinorum'' <ref>Inscription at the entrance to the Via del Pellegrino: ALEX VI PONT MAX POST INSTAURATAM ADRIANI MOLEM ANGUSTAS VRBIS VIAS AMMPLIARI IVSSIT MCCCCLXXXXVII (''Alexander VI. Pont. Max. ordered to widen the narrow streets of the town after the restoration of the Castel Sant'Angelo'')</ref> [[:File:Via del Pellegrino Inschrift Alexander VI.jpg|(Fig.)]] and the restoration of ''[[Via della Lungara]]'' on the right bank of the [[Tiber]] from [[Ponte Sisto]] to [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]].\n\n===The project of Pope Julius II===\n[[File:Inschrift Julius II. Via Curato-Banchi.jpg|thumb|Inscription by Julius II, 1512]]\nIn addition to reconstructing [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Julius II implemented multiple projects in the framework of Rome's [[urban renewal]] (''Renovatio Romae'') in the [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], [[Parione]], [[Sant'Eustachio (rione of Rome)|Sant'Eustachio]] and [[Colonna (rione of Rome)|Colonna]] ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'', a task which was started forty years before by his uncle, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] (r. 1471-1484).<ref name=cast378>Castagnoli (1958), pp.378</ref> One of the most important projects was the creation of two new straight streets on the left and right banks of the Tiber: the Via Giulia on the left bank, a new grand avenue through the most densely populated quarter of Rome, from the [[Ponte Sisto]] to the Florentine merchant quarter on the [[Tiber]] bend,<ref name=pie798>Pietrangeli(1979) p. 8</ref> and a straight road along the right bank of the Tiber from the [[Porta Settimiana]] in [[Trastevere]] to the [[Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia|Hospital of Santo Spirito]] in the [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]], the ''Via della Lungara''.<ref name=cast38081>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380-381</ref>\nBoth roads flanked the Tiber and were closely connected to it.<ref name=\"po19\"/> The Lungara had the dual aim to relieve the pilgrimage route to Saint Peter<ref name=cast38081/> and transport goods coming from the [[Via Aurelia]] and the [[Via Portuensis|via Portuense]] roads towards the centre of the city.  The Pope intended for it to reach Piazza di [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and the [[Port of Ripa Grande and Papal Arsenal|port of Ripa Grande]].<ref name=\"po19\"/>\n\nThe main goal behind these plans was to superimpose a regular road network with the focus given to the Tiber by medieval Rome's disorderly buildings; together with the new [[Borgo Nuovo (Rome)|Via Alessandrina]] that Alexander VI opened in the Borgo, the ''Via dei Pettinari'' that connected the [[Trastevere]] on one side and the [[Campidoglio]] on the other, the Lungara and Via Giulia created a quadrilateral network of modern roads in the city's maze of alleys.<ref name=\"po19\"/> In the original project Via Giulia was supposed to reach the Hospital of Santo Spirito in [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] via the rebuilt ''[[Pons Neronianus]]''.<ref name=del472/><ref name=cast380>Castagnoli (1958), pp.380</ref> The center of the city shifted towards the Vatican and [[Trastevere]] and away from the [[Palazzo Senatorio]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], which was the symbol of the Roman nobility's power;<ref name=tem124/><ref name=\"po19\"/> the plan was intended to separate the papacy from the city's powerful noble families, particularly the [[Orsini family|Orsini]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] families.<ref name=tem124>Temple (2011), pp. 124</ref>\n\nThese projects had a secondary, celebrative goal to promote the [[Pontiff]] as the unifier of Italy and the renewer of Rome; in 1506, after the end of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the Pope overthrew the powerful [[Baglioni (family)|Baglioni]] and [[Bentivoglio family|Bentivoglio]] families and conquered [[Perugia]] and [[Bologna]],<ref name=\"po19\">Portoghesi, p. 19</ref> as testified in an inscription along the ''Via dei Banchi Nuovi''.<ref>IVLIO.II.PONT:OPT:MAX:QVOD FINIB:DITIONIS.S.R.E.PROLATIS ITALIAQ:LIBERATA VRBEM ROMAM OCCVPATE SIMILIOREM QVAM DIVISE PATEFACTIS DIMENSIS Q: VIIS PRO MAIESTATE IMPERII ORNAVIT (''Julius II p.o.m. who extended the power of the Holy Roman Church and freed Italy.

In 1586, the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' (lit. \"Beggar's Hospice\") was built by the architect [[Domenico Fontana]] on the orders of [[Pope Sixtus V]] (r. 1585-1590) and marked the end of the ''Via Giulia''.<ref name=pie7976/> It was built to solve the begging problem in the city and was given a yearly endowment of 150,000 ''[[roman scudo|scudi]]'' which could employ 2,000 people.<ref name=cas415>Castagnoli (1988), p. 415</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century it had become fashionable for the various nations and city-states to have their own churches built in Rome known as the ''chiese nazionali''.<ref name=cas392/> The ''rioni'' of [[Regola]] and [[Ponte (rione of Rome)|Ponte]], along the [[procession]]al and pilgrim roads, were the preferred locations. The Florentines,  the Sienese, and the Neapolitans had their churches built in Via Giulia (the [[San Giovanni dei Fiorentini|San Giovanni]], the [[Santa Caterina da Siena a Via Giulia|Santa Caterina]], and the [[Santo Spirito dei Napoletani|Santo Spirito]] respectively),<ref name=del473/><ref name=pie16/> while the Bolognese ([[Santi Giovanni Evangelista e Petronio|San Giovanni e Petronio]]), Spanish ([[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli|Santa Maria in Monserrato]]), English ([[San Tommaso di Canterbury]]) and Swedish ([[Santa Brigida, Rome|Santa Brigida]]) churches were built in the Regola ''rione''.<ref name=cas392>Castagnoli (1958), p. 392</ref>\n\nIn order to supply the quarter with sufficient drinking water, [[Pope Paul V]] (r. 1605-1621) had the [[Aqua Paola]] extend over the Tiber. In 1613, the ''Fontanone di Ponte Sisto'' (lit. \"The Big Fountain of the Sistine Bridge\") was built on the [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the beggars' hospice on Via Giulia.<ref name=pie7978/> It was demolished in 1879 and rebuilt in 1898 on the opposite side of the [[Ponte Sisto]] in what is now ''Piazza Trilussa''.[[:File:Fontana di Ponte Sisto.jpg|(Fig.)]].<ref name=pie7978/>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"300\" heights=\"300\">\n 1645 Antonio Tempesta Via Giulia marked.svg|Via Giulia; Particular from ''Almae urbis Romae prospectus'' by [[Antonio Tempesta]] (1645)\n</gallery>\nAt the end of the 16th century Via Giulia's path was fixed; it ended by the Florentine quarter to the north and the ''Ospizio dei Mendicanti'' to the south.

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

It was however, his son Henry who takes credit for the foundation of the company as the company was registered in his name during the first year of his birth.[see Redditch Museum Family tree] \nFrom the first half of the 18th century, the name of Henry Milward and Sons became well known as the makers of good quality needles.\n\nAt one point they were the largest [[manufacturer]] of its type in the world, producing [[knitting needles]], [[surgical needle]]s, and [[fishing tackle]], from a number of [[factories]] both in the UK and globally, such as [[Murcia]], Spain.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Knitting and surgical needles==\nThe manufacture of needles was originally a [[cottage industry]]. During the [[Industrial Revolution]] the industry prospered and became [[mechanised]].  By the late 1800s the company was the largest manufacturer in the whole district.\n\nRedditch became the hub of the needle industry in the UK, with [[trade directory|trade directories]] showing that in the Redditch area in 1868/9 there were 117 firms listed as manufacturers in various aspects of needle and fish tackle trades. Small needle businesses [[Amalgamation (business)|amalgamated]], often through inter-marriage between the leading needle makers of Redditch. Henry Milward and sons amalgamated with John James, [[W. Avery & Son]], Wm. Bartleet, and thus the \"Milward empire\" grew.\n\nWilliam Hall of Studley amalgamated with Thos. Harper, Samuel Thomas, H. Wilkes and William Vale among others and formed a group of needle makers known as '''Amalgamated Needles & Fish Hooks'''. This resulted in Milwards and the aforementioned group being the 2 largest needle makers in the district.\n\nIn 1912 John James and Sons merged into Henry Milward and sons and a new board was announced.  Members of the board consisted of C.B James as chairman and C.F Milward as deputy chairman, H.T Milward, A.D Bartleet and C.E James.\n\nIn 1930 two of the great needlemaker giants Milward's of Redditch and Hall's of Studley joined forces under a single holding company, Amalgamated Needles and Fish Hooks Limited, who formed in 1932 a separate manufacturing organisation called The English Needle and Fishing Tackle Co. Ltd (ENTACO).\n\nHowever Milward's needles continued in Redditch until the 1950s, there were [[satellite]] factories setup during [[World War II]] in [[Evesham]], [[Bewdley]], [[Kidderminster]] and [[Moreton-in-Marsh]]. The basic needle plant was dispersed between Studley and Redditch during the war and in 1952 Arrow Works was officially opened and were still producing some brands of Milward's needles as were first made and marketed under the name of Henry Milward & Sons.\n\nThe years of greatest growth both in factory growth and world sales were at the end of the 19th century when the [[fortunes]] of the company were in the hands of Charles Frederick and Henry Tomson.\n\n==Fishing tackle==\n[[Colonel]] Henry Milward was a fervent [[Angling|fly angler]] who decided to mix business with pleasure when he created '''Milward\u2019s Fishing Tackle Company''' as part of his [[centuries]]-old needle-factory. A dozen [[workers]] left needle- and [[syringe]]-making to become experts in hooks, flies, devons, spoons and [[split-cane rod]]s. This remarkable adventure lasted until 1965, when Milward died.\n\nMilward, alongside Allcock, Partridge, Wilkins, Lee, Martinez & Bird and J.W. Young was just one of many [[fishing tackle]] manufacturers located in Redditch, just south of Birmingham\n\n==Colonel C.F. Milward Esq==\nColonel C.F. Milward, [[Deputy Lieutenant]], was born in the United States and returned to England at the age of 5 and in due course he entered the family business, he was responsible for the companies amalgamations prior to 1930, he became the major [[chairman of the board]] of the [[holding company]] A.N. & F.H. Limited. His father was a [[justice of the peace]].\n\nHe was elected to the Mastership of the [[Livery Company]], The Worshipful Company of Needle Makers, and was [[High Sheriff]] of [[Worcestershire]]. He was known as the Colonel.\n\n==H.T Milward, J.P Esq==\nH.T Milward, [[justice of the peace]], was known as Mr Harry, and was the Colonel's cousin. Harry's father was Colonel [[Victor Milward]], a [[Member of Parliament]]. Harry's main interest in the family business was sales and included [[Russia]] in his sales trips.\n\nIn 1930, the [[board of directors]] were: Charles F Milward ([[Chairman]] of the company), Henry T Milward J.P, G.H. Corbet-Milward, C. Ernest James, Gerald Bartleet, Arthur D. Bartleet, and L. Sidney Milward.\n\nWhen these 2 great figures died, others took over the running of the company, now renamed '''Needle Industries Limited''', but still the name Milward was the major trading company.\n\nThe next Joint [[Managing Director]]s were Basil King [[OBE]] and Alderman L. Haines of [[William Hall and Company]], whilst Colonel G.V. Milward [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] of [[Worcestershire]], was a director of the company. Colonel Milward became the [[Managing Director]] of Milwards Fishing Tackle. He was also responsible for [[Surgical needle]]s and braided [[Surgical suture|suture]] manufacture after he returned to the company after he saw [[active service]] between 1939-1945.\n\nDuring the term of G.B King's Managing Directorship that Arrow Works in Studley was built, thus creating the business as we knew it to this present day. During this phase, the last of the [[Milward family]] was in the business: [[Ian Newton]], grandson of Mr Harry briefly was [[Sales management|Sales Manager]] (Needles) until 1968.\n\nSince 1952 the fortunes of the Milward business were in the hands of L.H.Beare and in the 1980s J.A Mackrael was the managing director. The trend of taking over companies continued, taking over Abel Morrall's [[Aero Needles]] (1989). Although Milwards owned many companies, each retained their own trade mark and name!\n\n==Purchase and subsequent sale by Coats==\nIn 1973 the entire [[share capital]] was purchased by Coats Patons Ltd, now known as [[Coats PLC]]. [[Needle Industries]] continued until the 1990s when Coats sold it to its management. Coats retained the Milwards brand name for its own use.\n\nFollowing the [[management buyout]] of Needle Industries, led by Victor Barley, a new company was registered in 1991 called ENTACO,<ref name =\"Entaco\">{{cite web|url=https://www.entacolimited.com/History.html|title=Entaco - History|website=entacolimited.com}}</ref> (an acronym of English Needle & Tackle Company) in the old Victoria Works, adjacent to  Needle Industries.

PKK/KADEK established a new ruling council in April, its membership virtually identical to the PKK's Presidential Council. The PKK/KADEK did not conduct an armed attack in 2002; however, the group periodically issued veiled threats that it will resume violence if the conditions of its imprisoned leader are not improved and its forces are attacked by Turkish military, and it continued its military training like before.\n\nIn November 2003, another congress was held which lead to renaming itself as the ''People's Congress of Kurdistan'' or ''Kongra-Gel (KGK)''.

Johnson has been [[British jump racing Champion Jockey|Champion Jockey]] on four occasions and was runner-up in the Championship on 16 occasions to McCoy.\n\n==Background and early career==\nJohnson comes from a racing family with his father being an amateur jockey and his mother, [[Sue Johnson (trainer)|Sue Johnson]], a successful trainer. Johnson left school at 16 to work for \"The Duke\" \u2013 [[David Nicholson (horse racing)|David Nicholson]] who was a major influence on Johnson\u2019s racing career and supported him in his bid to become a professional jockey. Johnson's first winner under rules was on Rusty Bridge at [[Hereford Racecourse|Hereford]] in April 1994. \n\nJohnson became Champion [[conditional jockey]] in the 1995/96 season, at the age of 18.\n\n==Jockey career==\n\n===First 1000 Winners (1994 to 2003)===\n\nJohnson's first winner was his only winner in the 1993-1994 season. In the following season he rode 12 winners and the year after in the 1995-96 season he rode 56 winners. Johnson rode 100 winners in a season for the first time in 1996-97, with 102 wins. From the 1996-97 season onwards Johnson has ridden over 100 winners each season.<ref name=\"auto\"/> \n\nIn 1996 Johnson won his first Grade 1 race, the [[Punchestown Gold Cup|Heineken Gold Cup]] aboard Billygoat Gruff, trained by David Nicholson. His second Grade 1 winner came in 1998 on Zafarabad in the [[Champion Four Year Old Hurdle|I.A.W.S. Champion Four Year Old Hurdle]], again trained by Nicholson. In this period Johnson also won his first [[Welsh Grand National]] (not a Grade 1) in 1999. Johnson's first [[Irish Gold Cup]] victory came in 2001 [[Florida Pearl]], trained by Willie Mullins. [[Looks Like Trouble]] won the 2000 Tingle Creek Chase and would become one of the most fruitful horses in Johnson's career.\n\nJohnson has had great success at the [[Cheltenham Festival]]. His first win at Cheltenham was on [[Anzum]] in the 1999 [[Stayers' Hurdle]]. He won the 2000 [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]] with Looks Like Trouble and the 2002 [[Queen Mother Champion Chase]] with [[Flagship Uberalles]].

Johnson was also victorious in the 2003 [[Champion Hurdle]] with the [[Philip Hobbs]]-trained [[Rooster Booster (horse)|Rooster Booster]] on which he would also come second in 2004. The 2003 festival also delivered the [[RSA Chase]] on One Knight. Looks Like Trouble delivered a further victory in the James Nicholson Wine Merchant Champion Chase (now the [[Ladbrokes Champion Chase]]).\n\nIn April 2003, Johnson became the eighth National Hunt jockey to ride 1,000 winners in Britain on [[Quedex (horse)|Quedex]] at [[Stratford-on-Avon Racecourse|Stratford]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/2946743.stm Johnson rides 1,000th winner] BBC Sport</ref>\n\n===Continued success and 2000 winners (2003 to 2009)===\n\n2004 brought a second victory in the Irish Gold Cup, again aboard [[Florida Pearl]].\n\nJohnson won the 2006 [[Bet365 Gold Cup|Betfred Gold Cup]] on Lacdoudal and scored a second win in the race on Monkerhostin in 2008 under its current sponsor-based title, the Bet365 Gold Cup. Both winners were trained by [[Philip Hobbs]].\n\nIn December 2009 Johnson became only the second rider after AP McCoy to ride 2000 winners, riding Fighting Chance to victory in the Wheels Up in the Powersolve Electronics Greatwood Charity Handicap Chase at [[Newbury Racecourse|Newbury]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/6828169/Richard-Johnson-rides-2000-winner-Horse-Racing.html|title=Richard Johnson becomes second National Hunt jockey to ride 2,000 winners|first=HOTSPUR (J A.|last=McGrath)|date=16 December 2009|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===First Championship and 3000 winners (2009 to 2016)===\n  \n[[File:Before and after (7200194572).jpg|thumb|Johnson in 2012]]\n\nIn this period Johnson saw further success, riding 100 winners each season but continued to finished second to [[Tony McCoy]] in the [[British jump racing Champion Jockey|Jockeys Championship]].

Johnson has been [[British jump racing Champion Jockey|Champion Jockey]] on four occasions and was runner-up in the Championship on 16 occasions to McCoy.\n\n==Background and early career==\nJohnson comes from a racing family with his father being an amateur jockey and his mother, [[Sue Johnson (trainer)|Sue Johnson]], a successful trainer. Johnson left school at 16 to work for \"The Duke\" \u2013 [[David Nicholson (horse racing)|David Nicholson]] who was a major influence on Johnson\u2019s racing career and supported him in his bid to become a professional jockey. Johnson's first winner under rules was on Rusty Bridge at [[Hereford Racecourse|Hereford]] in April 1994. \n\nJohnson became Champion [[conditional jockey]] in the 1995/96 season, at the age of 18.\n\n==Jockey career==\n\n===First 1000 Winners (1994 to 2003)===\n\nJohnson's first winner was his only winner in the 1993-1994 season.

In this period Johnson also won his first [[Welsh Grand National]] (not a Grade 1) in 1999. Johnson's first [[Irish Gold Cup]] victory came in 2001 [[Florida Pearl]], trained by Willie Mullins. [[Looks Like Trouble]] won the 2000 Tingle Creek Chase and would become one of the most fruitful horses in Johnson's career.\n\nJohnson has had great success at the [[Cheltenham Festival]]. His first win at Cheltenham was on [[Anzum]] in the 1999 [[Stayers' Hurdle]]. He won the 2000 [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]] with Looks Like Trouble and the 2002 [[Queen Mother Champion Chase]] with [[Flagship Uberalles]]. Johnson was top jockey at the 2002 Cheltenham Festival with 2 wins. Johnson was also victorious in the 2003 [[Champion Hurdle]] with the [[Philip Hobbs]]-trained [[Rooster Booster (horse)|Rooster Booster]] on which he would also come second in 2004. The 2003 festival also delivered the [[RSA Chase]] on One Knight. Looks Like Trouble delivered a further victory in the James Nicholson Wine Merchant Champion Chase (now the [[Ladbrokes Champion Chase]]).\n\nIn April 2003, Johnson became the eighth National Hunt jockey to ride 1,000 winners in Britain on [[Quedex (horse)|Quedex]] at [[Stratford-on-Avon Racecourse|Stratford]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/2946743.stm Johnson rides 1,000th winner] BBC Sport</ref>\n\n===Continued success and 2000 winners (2003 to 2009)===\n\n2004 brought a second victory in the Irish Gold Cup, again aboard [[Florida Pearl]].\n\nJohnson won the 2006 [[Bet365 Gold Cup|Betfred Gold Cup]] on Lacdoudal and scored a second win in the race on Monkerhostin in 2008 under its current sponsor-based title, the Bet365 Gold Cup.

She grew up in Berlin, Germany and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to social expectations for women at the time discouraging the publication of her compositions, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married painter [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had a single child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. New details about her life and works have been identified since the 1990s.

She grew up in Berlin, Germany and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to social expectations for women at the time discouraging the publication of her compositions, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married painter [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had a single child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. New details about her life and works have been identified since the 1990s. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  \n\nThe [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on May 29, 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n==Life==\n=== Early life and education ===\nMendelssohn was born in [[Hamburg]], the [[Mendelssohn family|oldest of four children]], including the composer Felix Mendelssohn.<ref name=Grove>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> She was descended on both sides from distinguished [[Jewish]] families; her parents were [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] (who was the son of philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, n\u00e9e Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur [[Daniel Itzig]].<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 3-5</ref> Her uncle was the banker [[Joseph Mendelssohn]].

In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled.

Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref>\n\nFelix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168\u201371</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection,<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at Buckingham Palace, expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, \"Italien\" (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]\n\nThere was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two.

Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref name=\"auto6\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was in a deep [[economic recession]]. The First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[Mail|post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R.

Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived.

The First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities, food shortages intensified and censorship was placed on all media and [[Mail|post]]. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n==Prelude==\n{{main|History of Poland (1945\u20131989)}}\n===Reforms of Edward Gierek (1970-1975)===\n[[File:Photograph of President Gerald R.

I address you concerning extraordinarily important questions. Our homeland is at the edge of an abyss. The achievements of many generations and the Polish home that has been built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived. And we have to stand those in order to prove that we are worthy of Poland.<br>Before all the Polish people and the whole world I would like to repeat the immortal words: <br>\n::'''''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Poland has not yet perished, so long as we still live]]!'''''</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cold War]]\n* [[Able Archer 83]]\n* [[Fighting Solidarity]]\n* [[Pacification of Wujek]]\n* [[Telephone tapping in the Eastern Bloc]]\n* [[Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Leopold Labedz, ''Poland Under Jaruzelski: A Comprehensive Sourcebook on Poland During and After Martial Law''\n* George Sanford, ''Military Rule in Poland: The Rebuilding of Communist Power, 1981\u20131983''\n{{Portal|Poland|History|Communism|War|1980s}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Martial law in Poland}}\n* [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB211/index.htm Solidarity and Martial Law in Poland: 25 Years Later], [[National Security Archive]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110112170636/http://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr80/fpoland1981.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981-1983]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080105033603/http://www.tenetour.com/history9.php Martial Law in Poland]\n* [http://www.videofact.com/english/stanwoj2.htm Martial Law in Poland 1981]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKhITm9-5TU Video of Jaruzelski declaring martial law], [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]]/[[YouTube]]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/zyziza/martial_law_in_poland Photo Gallery by zyziza at pbase.com]\n\n{{History of the People's Republic of Poland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martial Law In Poland}}\n[[Category:1980s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts]]\n[[Category:1981 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1981 in politics]]\n[[Category:1982 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1982 in politics]]\n[[Category:1983 in Poland]]\n[[Category:1983 in politics]]\n[[Category:Anti-communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Communism in Poland]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1982]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1983]]\n[[Category:Emergency laws]]\n[[Category:Martial law|Poland]]\n[[Category:Military coups in Poland]]\n[[Category:Military dictatorships|Poland]]\n[[Category:Poland\u2013Soviet Union relations]]\n[[Category:Solidarity (Polish trade union)]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:squadron\u2192squadron (aviation),truncheons\u2192baton (law enforcement)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_Poland"}
