Manufactured by [[Gerstlauer]], it opened in 2013 as the world's first Gerstlauer Infinity Coaster. With 14 [[Roller coaster inversion|inversions]], The Smiler holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster.<ref name=\"Record-AmusementToday\" /> However, it has experienced a series of incidents. A malfunction at a press preview event delayed the official opening date by two weeks, and in 2015, a major collision left five riders seriously injured. An investigation by the UK government's [[Health and Safety Executive]] was initiated, and the ride eventually reopened the following season with revamped safety standards.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-35851291|title=Alton Towers' Smiler ride reopens nine months after horror crash|website=BBC News|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPlans to build The Smiler were submitted to the local authority in December 2011.

Ride engineers decided to add a fifth train to the circuit to increase capacity, due to it being a busy day. The trains ahead, now cleared of riders, were dispatched in turn until this fifth train could enter the station to be dispatched for a routine test run. However, one of these empty trains failed to engage properly with the second lift, causing the control system to automatically shut down the ride. The ride engineers attended the train to resolve the issue, allowing the ride to restart.<ref name=\"HSE Incident Report\"></ref>\n\nThe fifth train was then sent for its test run.

Manufactured by [[Gerstlauer]], it opened in 2013 as the world's first Gerstlauer Infinity Coaster. With 14 [[Roller coaster inversion|inversions]], The Smiler holds the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster.<ref name=\"Record-AmusementToday\" /> However, it has experienced a series of incidents. A malfunction at a press preview event delayed the official opening date by two weeks, and in 2015, a major collision left five riders seriously injured. An investigation by the UK government's [[Health and Safety Executive]] was initiated, and the ride eventually reopened the following season with revamped safety standards.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-35851291|title=Alton Towers' Smiler ride reopens nine months after horror crash|website=BBC News|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nPlans to build The Smiler were submitted to the local authority in December 2011.

The trains ahead, now cleared of riders, were dispatched in turn until this fifth train could enter the station to be dispatched for a routine test run.

It is disorderly, it stands out from the scalp, and cannot be combed flat. It can be controlled by braiding methods. The underlying structural anomaly is longitudinal grooving of the hair shaft, which appears triangular in cross section.  This is caused by mutations in one of three possible genes, ''[[PADI3]]'', ''[[Transglutaminase|TGM]]'', or ''[[TCHH]]3''. The characteristic hair shaft anomaly can be demonstrated in asymptomatic family members by scanning electron microscopy. To be noticeable, 50% of hairs must be affected by the structural abnormality. Improvement often occurs in later childhood.<ref name=ORPHA>{{cite web| title=Uncombable hair syndrome |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&Expert=1410 |publisher=Orphanet|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tr\u00fceb |first=Ralph |title=Uncombable hair syndrome |url=http://www.orpha.net/data/patho/GB/uk-uncombable.pdf |date=September 2003 |publisher=Orphanet Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> An [[autosomal dominant]] mode of inheritance has been suggested though an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern with varying degrees of [[penetrance]] has also been noted.<ref name=NCBI /><ref name=ORPHA /> The stiffness of the uncombable hair has been reasoned to be due to the triangular form of the hair shaft in cross section.

It is disorderly, it stands out from the scalp, and cannot be combed flat. It can be controlled by braiding methods. The underlying structural anomaly is longitudinal grooving of the hair shaft, which appears triangular in cross section.  This is caused by mutations in one of three possible genes, ''[[PADI3]]'', ''[[Transglutaminase|TGM]]'', or ''[[TCHH]]3''. The characteristic hair shaft anomaly can be demonstrated in asymptomatic family members by scanning electron microscopy. To be noticeable, 50% of hairs must be affected by the structural abnormality. Improvement often occurs in later childhood.<ref name=ORPHA>{{cite web| title=Uncombable hair syndrome |url=http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&Expert=1410 |publisher=Orphanet|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tr\u00fceb |first=Ralph |title=Uncombable hair syndrome |url=http://www.orpha.net/data/patho/GB/uk-uncombable.pdf |date=September 2003 |publisher=Orphanet Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> An [[autosomal dominant]] mode of inheritance has been suggested though an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern with varying degrees of [[penetrance]] has also been noted.<ref name=NCBI /><ref name=ORPHA /> The stiffness of the uncombable hair has been reasoned to be due to the triangular form of the hair shaft in cross section.
