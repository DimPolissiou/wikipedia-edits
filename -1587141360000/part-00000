Standing at {{height|m=1.94}}, he plays both [[point guard]] and [[shooting guard]] positions. He was drafted as the 30th pick by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the [[2007 NBA draft]], and his NBA rights are currently held by the [[Dallas Mavericks]].\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Tapiolan Honka (2004\u20132008)===\nHis first club was Malmi Super-Koris (\"Malmi super-basketball\"), from where he joined one of Finland's top clubs, [[Tapiolan Honka|Espoo Honka]] in 2004\u201305 season. Under the guidance of coach Mihailo Pavi\u0107evi\u0107 he quickly developed into a key component of Honka's 2006\u201307 [[Korisliiga|Finnish League]] championship-winning side. During the 2006\u201307 campaign Koponen averaged 12.4 points, 2.4 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game. The number of assists may sound small, but in Finland assists are harder to come by than in the NBA because of the difference in [[FIBA]] rules,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/blazers/news/International_Trail_Blazers-252219-1218.html PortlandTrailBlazers.com official site of NBA team Portland Trail Blazers explaining the difference between FIBA assists and NBA assists.]</ref> and the league leader had an average of only 5 assists.\n\nKoponen played in the World All-Star team at the [[Nike Hoop Summit]] in 2007. He recorded 7 points and 6 assists with only one turnover, playing against future [[NBA]] super star, MVP [[Derrick Rose]].\n\nKoponen began his mandatory military service in the Lahti Military Academy in October 2007, participating in a special military service built for professional athletes such as Finnish tennis player [[Jarkko Nieminen]]. The [[2007-08 Korisliiga season|Finnish League 2007\u201308 season]] began slowly, with Koponen trying to adapt to the military recruit training. Koponen struggled a lot in the opening month of the season, but found his rhythm in November, recording 21.4 points, 4.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds and 2.1 steals a game while draining 55.6% of his 2-point attempts, 45.8% of his 3-point attempts and 81.0% of his free throws. In the first game of December, Koponen played through a [[concussion]] and led the Honka Playboys to an overtime victory over Team Componenta, scoring 32 points, grabbing six rebounds and dishing out five assists. After the game, the concussion forced Koponen to be sidelined for a week.\n\nOn 14 July 2008, in the [[NBA Summer League]] game against the [[Washington Wizards]], Koponen scored 19 points, shooting 4-for-6 on three-point attempts.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/blazers/news/Bayless_Koponen_lead_Blazers_-277796-1218.html Bayless, Koponen lead Blazers to Summer League win]</ref>\n\n===Virtus Bologna (2008\u20132012)===\nIn August 2008 he signed a four-year deal with the Italian team [[Virtus Bologna]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/5256/petteri-koponen-signs-with-virtus-bologna Petteri Koponen Signs with Virtus Bologna]</ref>\n\n===Khimki (2012\u20132016)===\nOn 31 May 2012, he signed a three-year contract with the Russian team [[BC Khimki|Khimki]].<ref>[http://en.bckhimki.ru/news/clubnews/2012/may/867/ Petteri Koponen is a new BC Khimki player]</ref> On 27 March 2015, he re-signed with Khimki for two more years.<ref>[http://www.sportando.com/en/europe/russia/156655/petteri-koponen-extends-with-khimki-for-two-more-years.html Petteri Koponen extends with Khimki for two more years]</ref> With Khimki he won the [[2014\u201315 Eurocup Basketball|2014\u201315 EuroCup]] season, and was also named to the [[EuroCup Basketball All-EuroCup Team|All-EuroCup First Team]].<ref>[http://www.eurocupbasketball.com/eurocup/games/results/showgame?gamecode=306&seasoncode=U2014#!report Khimki Moscow Region pockets second Eurocup crown!]</ref><ref>[http://www.eurocupbasketball.com/eurocup/news/i/5w4x8nukoug5cxca/2014-15-all-eurocup-first-second-teams-announced 2014-15 All-Eurocup first, second teams announced]</ref>\n\n===Barcelona (2016\u20132018)===\nOn 16 August 2016, Koponen signed a three-year contract with Spanish powerhouse [[FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet|Barcelona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/featured/300215/petteri-koponen-signed-with-barcelona|publisher=EuroHoops|date=16 August 2016|accessdate=19 September 2016|title=Petteri Koponen signed with Barcelona}}</ref> One month later, he would suffer a traffic accident that caused him a head injury.<ref>{{cite web|title=Petteri Koponen under observation following traffic accident|publisher=FC Barcelona|date=19 September 2016|accessdate=19 September 2016|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/sections/basketball/first-team/news/2016-2017/petteri-koponen-under-observation-following-traffic-accident}}</ref> On June 29, 2018, [[FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet|Barcelona]] part ways with him.<ref>{{cite news |title=Agreement for the release of Vezenkov, Diagn\u00e9 and Koponen {{!}} FC Barcelona |url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/sections/basketball/first-team/news/2018-2019/agreement-release-vezenkov-diagne-koponen-fc-barcelona-lassa |accessdate=30 June 2018 |work=FC Barcelona |date=29 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Bayern Munich (2018\u2013present)===\nOn 24 July 2018, Koponen signed a three-year contract with [[FC Bayern Munich (basketball)|Bayern Munich]] of the German [[Basketball Bundesliga]] (BBL).<ref>{{cite web |title=Bayern signs 3-point specialist Petteri Koponen |url=https://fcb-basketball.de/en/news/2018-2019/07/koponen-until-2021 |website=FCB Basketball |accessdate=25 July 2018 |date=24 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===NBA draft rights===\nOn 28 June 2007, Koponen was taken 30th overall in the [[2007 NBA draft]] by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. He was the final first-round pick in the draft. Philadelphia then traded Koponen to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in exchange for their number 42 pick, [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt University]] [[swingman]] [[Derrick Byars]], and cash considerations. On 23 June 2011, Koponen's rights were traded to the Dallas Mavericks for the Mavericks' second round pick in the 2011 draft (57).\n\n==National team career==\nThe summer of 2006 was Koponen's coming-out party. First, he played very well in the [[FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship]] B-level competition, leading the Finnish team to third place by losing just one game. After that he was promoted to the senior men's [[Finland national basketball team|Finnish national team]]. He showed no fear as he played like a veteran and got to play quite a lot. His best game was against the small country [[Luxembourg national basketball team]]; he scored 19 points and handed out 7 assists.\n\nKoponen was a main contributor in the Finnish men's national team in the summer of 2007. Finland earned a spot in European Division A after crushing the [[Romania national basketball team|Romanian national basketball team]] in a deciding game by a score of 111\u201361. Koponen averaged 10.6 points, 2.7 assists, 1.7 rebounds and 1.3 steals in 21.3 minutes a game with the national team. Just days before the national team campaign tipped off, Koponen announced he would return to the [[Tapiolan Honka|Honka Playboys]] for one more season.\n\n==Career statistics==\n{{Euroleague player

He recorded 7 points and 6 assists with only one turnover, playing against future [[NBA]] super star, MVP [[Derrick Rose]].\n\nKoponen began his mandatory military service in the Lahti Military Academy in October 2007, participating in a special military service built for professional athletes such as Finnish tennis player [[Jarkko Nieminen]]. The [[2007-08 Korisliiga season|Finnish League 2007\u201308 season]] began slowly, with Koponen trying to adapt to the military recruit training. Koponen struggled a lot in the opening month of the season, but found his rhythm in November, recording 21.4 points, 4.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds and 2.1 steals a game while draining 55.6% of his 2-point attempts, 45.8% of his 3-point attempts and 81.0% of his free throws. In the first game of December, Koponen played through a [[concussion]] and led the Honka Playboys to an overtime victory over Team Componenta, scoring 32 points, grabbing six rebounds and dishing out five assists. After the game, the concussion forced Koponen to be sidelined for a week.\n\nOn 14 July 2008, in the [[NBA Summer League]] game against the [[Washington Wizards]], Koponen scored 19 points, shooting 4-for-6 on three-point attempts.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/blazers/news/Bayless_Koponen_lead_Blazers_-277796-1218.html Bayless, Koponen lead Blazers to Summer League win]</ref>\n\n===Virtus Bologna (2008\u20132012)===\nIn August 2008 he signed a four-year deal with the Italian team [[Virtus Bologna]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/5256/petteri-koponen-signs-with-virtus-bologna Petteri Koponen Signs with Virtus Bologna]</ref>\n\n===Khimki (2012\u20132016)===\nOn 31 May 2012, he signed a three-year contract with the Russian team [[BC Khimki|Khimki]].<ref>[http://en.bckhimki.ru/news/clubnews/2012/may/867/ Petteri Koponen is a new BC Khimki player]</ref> On 27 March 2015, he re-signed with Khimki for two more years.<ref>[http://www.sportando.com/en/europe/russia/156655/petteri-koponen-extends-with-khimki-for-two-more-years.html Petteri Koponen extends with Khimki for two more years]</ref> With Khimki he won the [[2014\u201315 Eurocup Basketball|2014\u201315 EuroCup]] season, and was also named to the [[EuroCup Basketball All-EuroCup Team|All-EuroCup First Team]].<ref>[http://www.eurocupbasketball.com/eurocup/games/results/showgame?gamecode=306&seasoncode=U2014#!report Khimki Moscow Region pockets second Eurocup crown!]</ref><ref>[http://www.eurocupbasketball.com/eurocup/news/i/5w4x8nukoug5cxca/2014-15-all-eurocup-first-second-teams-announced 2014-15 All-Eurocup first, second teams announced]</ref>\n\n===Barcelona (2016\u20132018)===\nOn 16 August 2016, Koponen signed a three-year contract with Spanish powerhouse [[FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet|Barcelona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurohoops.net/featured/300215/petteri-koponen-signed-with-barcelona|publisher=EuroHoops|date=16 August 2016|accessdate=19 September 2016|title=Petteri Koponen signed with Barcelona}}</ref> One month later, he would suffer a traffic accident that caused him a head injury.<ref>{{cite web|title=Petteri Koponen under observation following traffic accident|publisher=FC Barcelona|date=19 September 2016|accessdate=19 September 2016|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/sections/basketball/first-team/news/2016-2017/petteri-koponen-under-observation-following-traffic-accident}}</ref> On June 29, 2018, [[FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet|Barcelona]] part ways with him.<ref>{{cite news |title=Agreement for the release of Vezenkov, Diagn\u00e9 and Koponen {{!}} FC Barcelona |url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/sections/basketball/first-team/news/2018-2019/agreement-release-vezenkov-diagne-koponen-fc-barcelona-lassa |accessdate=30 June 2018 |work=FC Barcelona |date=29 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Bayern Munich (2018\u2013present)===\nOn 24 July 2018, Koponen signed a three-year contract with [[FC Bayern Munich (basketball)|Bayern Munich]] of the German [[Basketball Bundesliga]] (BBL).<ref>{{cite web |title=Bayern signs 3-point specialist Petteri Koponen |url=https://fcb-basketball.de/en/news/2018-2019/07/koponen-until-2021 |website=FCB Basketball |accessdate=25 July 2018 |date=24 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===NBA draft rights===\nOn 28 June 2007, Koponen was taken 30th overall in the [[2007 NBA draft]] by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]. He was the final first-round pick in the draft. Philadelphia then traded Koponen to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in exchange for their number 42 pick, [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball|Vanderbilt University]] [[swingman]] [[Derrick Byars]], and cash considerations. On 23 June 2011, Koponen's rights were traded to the Dallas Mavericks for the Mavericks' second round pick in the 2011 draft (57).\n\n==National team career==\nThe summer of 2006 was Koponen's coming-out party. First, he played very well in the [[FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship]] B-level competition, leading the Finnish team to third place by losing just one game. After that he was promoted to the senior men's [[Finland national basketball team|Finnish national team]]. He showed no fear as he played like a veteran and got to play quite a lot. His best game was against the small country [[Luxembourg national basketball team]]; he scored 19 points and handed out 7 assists.\n\nKoponen was a main contributor in the Finnish men's national team in the summer of 2007. Finland earned a spot in European Division A after crushing the [[Romania national basketball team|Romanian national basketball team]] in a deciding game by a score of 111-61. Koponen averaged 10.6 points, 2.7 assists, 1.7 rebounds and 1.3 steals in 21.3 minutes a game with the national team. Just days before the national team campaign tipped off, Koponen announced he would return to the [[Tapiolan Honka|Honka Playboys]] for one more season.\n\n==Career statistics==\n{{Euroleague player statistics legend}}\n\n===EuroLeague===\n{{Euroleague player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2012\u201313 Euroleague|2012\u201313]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=2|[[BC Khimki|Khimki]]\n| 21 || 5 || 16.2 || .465 || .429 || '''.957''' || 1.0 || 2.1 || .1 || '''.1''' || 6.5 || 6.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2015\u201316 Euroleague|2015\u201316]]\n| 24 || 7 || 19.5 || .426 || .381 || .879 || 1.6 || '''2.3''' || .5 || .0 || 8.5 || 7.8\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2016\u201317 EuroLeague|2016\u201317]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=2|[[FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet|Barcelona]]\n| 27 || 3 || '''22.6''' || .429 || .462 || .915 || '''1.7''' || 1.9 || '''.7''' || .0 || '''10.1''' || '''8.9'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2017\u201318 EuroLeague|2017\u201318]]\n| 29 || '''9''' || 20.2 || .491 || '''.511''' || .938 || 1.6 || 1.5 || .5 || .0 || 7.9 || 7.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[2018\u201319 EuroLeague|2018\u201319]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[FC Bayern Munich (basketball)|Bayern]]\n| '''30''' || 3 || 18.3 || '''.516''' || .468 || .923 || 1.6 || 1.9 || .3 || .0 || 9.0 || 8.8\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Career\n| 131 || 27 || 19.5 || .465 || .455 || .917 || 1.5 || 1.9 || .4 || .0 || 7.6 || 8.2\n{{s-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Petteri Koponen}}\n* [http://www.acb.com/jugador.php?id=517 Peterri Koponen] at acb.com {{in lang|es}}\n* [http://www.euroleague.net/competition/players/showplayer?pcode=004178 Petteri Koponen] at euroleague.net\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070717235544/http://www.draftexpress.com/viewprofile.php?p=1273 Petteri Koponen] at draftexpress.com\n* [http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/gamecent/p/pid/6031383/playerview.html Petteri Koponen] at fiba.com\n* [http://web.legabasket.it/player/?id=KOP-PET-88 Petteri Koponen] at legabasket.it {{in lang|it}}\n* {{twitter|koponenpetteri}}\n\n{{FC Bayern Munich Basketball current roster}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{2007 NBA Draft}}\n{{Virtus Bologna 2008\u201309 EuroChallenge champions}}\n{{BC Khimki 2014\u201315 Eurocup champions}}\n{{VTB United League Sixth Man of the Year}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Koponen, Petteri}}\n[[Category:1988 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup players]]\n[[Category:BC Khimki players]]\n[[Category:Espoon Honka players]]\n[[Category:FC Bayern Munich basketball players]]\n[[Category:Finnish expatriate basketball people in Germany]]\n[[Category:Finnish expatriate basketball people in Italy]]\n[[Category:Finnish expatriate basketball people in Russia]]\n[[Category:Finnish expatriate basketball people in Spain]]\n[[Category:Finnish expatriate basketball people in the United States]]\n[[Category:Finnish men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Lega Basket Serie A players]]\n[[Category:Liga ACB players]]\n[[Category:Philadelphia 76ers draft picks]]\n[[Category:Point guards]]\n[[Category:Shooting guards]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Helsinki]]\n[[Category:Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna players]]\n", "name_user": "Majavah", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNational team career:clean up,typo(s) fixed: 111-61 \u2192 111\u201361", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petteri_Koponen"}

[[Morgan le Fay]] is accidentally transformed into a mouse named Peanut by [[Merlin]] (echoing the plot from books 5-8), and Jack and Annie have to find four magic medallions to rescue her.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife.

After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses.

These Chinese voyages visited numbers of ports in Asia as far as [[Africa]], including Majapahit ports. It was said that Zheng He has paid a visit to the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nThese massive Chinese voyages were not merely a naval exploration, but also a show of power and a display of geopolitical reach. The Chinese Ming dynasty had recently overthrown the Mongols Yuan dynasty, and were eager to establish their hegemony in the world, which changed the geopolitical balance in Asia.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\">{{cite news | title = History of Indian Ocean shows how old rivalries can trigger rise of new forces | work = Times of India | date = 6 August 2016 | author = Sanjeev Sanyal | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/History-of-Indian-Ocean-shows-how-old-rivalries-can-trigger-rise-of-new-forces/articleshow/53577849.cms}}</ref> Chinese intervened in the politics of the southern seas by supporting Thais against the declining Khmer Empire, support and installing allied factions in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and other places in [[Indian Ocean]] coasts. However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" /> \n\nPreviously, Majapahit has succeeded to assert its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time. Read <ref name=\"notes on the malay archipelago\" />}} bordering [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] on the west and independent Muslim kingdoms on the north.\n\nThis Ming dynasty voyages is extremely important for Majapahit historiography, since Zheng He's translator [[Ma Huan]] wrote ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'', a detailed description of Majapahit,<ref name=\"yingyai\" /> which provides a valuable insight on the culture, customs, also various social and economic aspects of Java during Majapahit period.<ref name=\"Chao-Wa\" />\n\nThe Chinese provided systematic support to Malacca, and its sultan made at least one trip to personally pay obeisance to the Ming emperor. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java. Malacca prospered under Chinese Ming protection, while the Majapahit were steadily pushed back.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\n====Queen Suhita====\n[[File:Suhita.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The mortuary deified portrait statue of Queen [[Suhita]] (reign 1429-1447), discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java, [[National Museum of Indonesia]].]]\nWikramawardhana ruled until 1426 and was succeeded by his daughter [[Suhita]],<ref name=\"Coedes\" />{{rp|242}} who ruled from 1426 to 1447. She was the second child of Wikramawardhana by a concubine who was the daughter of Wirabhumi. The reign of Suhita was the second time Majapahit was reigned by a queen regnant after her great grandmother Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi. Her reign is immortalized in Javanese legend of [[Damarwulan]], as it involves a maiden queen named Prabu Kenya in the story, and during Suhita's reign there was a war with [[Blambangan]] as stated in the legend.<ref>Claire Holt.

After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities. Hindu-Buddhist followers' grievances later paved the way for Ranawijaya to defeat Kertabumi.\n\n[[Image:Muzium Negara KL38.JPG|thumb|right|The model of a Majapahit ship display in [[Muzium Negara]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].

This event led to the war between the [[Sultanate of Demak]] and [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Daha]], since Demak rulers were descendants of Kertabhumi.\n\nDuring this period of Majapahit's retreat to the inland [[Kediri|Daha]] and war in Java, [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], being the dominant ruler of the Javanese coastal lands and Java as a whole, seized the region of Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra from Majapahit.<ref name=\":3\" />{{rp|154\u2013155}}\n\n====Demak invasion and the fall of Majapahit====\n[[File:Masjid Agung Demak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] was the earliest Islamic polity in Java that replaced Majapahit.]]\nIn 1498, there was a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying [[Raden Patah]], Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father had done before, while others said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's youngest daughter.\n\nMeanwhile in the west, [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|Malacca was captured by Portuguese in 1511]].

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades.

In his book: \"Travels of Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]]\", he visited several places in today's Indonesia: [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], and [[Banjarmasin]] in Borneo, between 1318\u20131330. He was sent by the Pope to launch a mission into the Asian interiors. In 1318 he departed from [[Padua]], crossed the [[Black Sea]] into [[Persia]], all the way across [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]], and [[Sri Lanka]]. He then headed to [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] island all the way to Sumatra, before visiting Java and Banjarmasin. He returned to Italy by land through [[Vietnam]], [[China]], all the way through the [[silkroad]] to Europe in 1330.\n\nIn his book he mentioned that he visited Java without explaining the exact place he had visited.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture. The [[Majapahit Terracotta]] art also flourished in this period. Significant numbers of [[terracotta]] artefacts were discovered in [[Trowulan]]. The artefacts ranges from human and animal figurines, jars, vessels, water containers, [[piggy bank]]s, bas reliefs, architectural ornaments, roof pinnacles, floor tiles, to pipes and roof tiles. One of the most interesting findings is Majapahit piggy bank. Several boar-shaped piggy banks has been discovered in Trowulan. It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins. Another important terracotta artefact is the head figurine of a man popularly thought to be the depiction of Gajah Mada, although it is not certain about who was depicted in these figurines.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Candi Jabung B.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jabung]] temple near Paiton, Probolinggo, East Java, dated from Majapahit period.]]\n\nIn his book ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan also describes the Majapahit cities: most of them do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king's residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three ''[[zhang (unit)|chang]]'' high (about {{convert|30.5|ft|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}), with length of more than 200 paces ({{convert|340|yd|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 ''chang'' high ({{convert|9\u201314.5|m|abbr=off|disp=or}}). It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people sat cross-legged. The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:''sirap'') laid as tiles.<ref name=yingyai />\n\nThe houses of commoners had thatched roofs ([[nipa palm]] leaves). Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.\n\n[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]\n\nAlthough [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\n==Economy==\nAlso in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market.

Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008.

This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history.<ref name=\"SNI451\">Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), hal. 451\u2013456.</ref> The king is the paramount ruler, as the [[chakravartin]] he is considered as the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their own interest. During its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often consider itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. \n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by a number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projected its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342\u20131343) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\n[[File:Bhairava Adityavarman.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adityawarman]], a senior minister of Majapahit depicted as Bhairava. He established the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] in Central Sumatra.]]\nMajapahit overlordship upon Malay states of Sumatra was demonstrated by the rule of [[Adityawarman]] of Malayupura. Adityawarman, the cousin of King Jayanegara, was raised within Majapahit palace and rose to become a senior minister in Majapahit court. He was sent to led Majapahit military expansion to conquer east coast region in Sumatra. Adityawarman then founded the royal dynasty of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] in [[Pagarruyung]] and presided over the central Sumatra region to take control of the gold trade between 1347 and 1375.\n\nWithin Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the center of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara. Outside of Maritime Southeast Asia, Majapahit devices Mitreka Satata, or partner in common order, in which it saw several states as ally. They are [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Songkla]], [[Mottama]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam|Annam]].\n\nIn Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nIn later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. The rise of Malacca in 15th century in particular is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice however, the two kingdoms actually had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with port of Melaka must be thriving.\n\n[[File:Cast Chinese coins (330 B.C. - 1912 A.D.).jpg|thumb|right|On center bottom row (no. 8) is a Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 T\u014dng-B\u01ceo (\u6c38\u6a02\u901a\u5bf6) cash coin cast under the [[Yongle Emperor|Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 Emperor]] (\u6c38\u6a02\u5e1d) of Ming dynasty.

After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weaken by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable [[Ming treasure voyages]] led by [[Zheng He]] upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestigue and power to the side. Ming on the other hand, actively support the rise of Malacca. This Ming protection has made Majapahit unwilling and unable to push Malacca anymore.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\nMajapahit ultimate nemesis however, was located very close at home; the [[Demak Sultanate]] on northern coast of Central Java. Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thrive and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java.

The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]].

The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand.

One of his distasteful acts was his desire to take his own half sisters, Gitarja and Rajadewi, as wives. Since Javanese tradition abhorred the practice of half siblings marrying, the council of royal elders spoke strongly against the king's wishes. It was not clear what motivated Jayanegara's wish \u2013 it might have been his way to ensure his claim to the throne by preventing rivals from being his half sisters' suitors, although in the later period of the Majapahit court the custom of marriage among cousins was quite common. In the ''[[Pararaton]]'', he was known as ''Kala Gemet'', or \"weak villain\". About the time of Jayanegara's reign, the Italian Friar [[Odoric of Pordenone]] visited the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nIn 1328, Jayanegara was murdered by his physician, Tanca, during a surgical operation. In complete mayhem and rage, Gajah Mada immediately killed Tanca. The motive behind this [[regicide]] was never clear. According to the ''Pararaton'', it was Tanca's revenge for the king sexually abusing his wife.

After the conquest of Bali, Majapahit distributed the governing authority of Bali among Arya Damar's younger brothers, Arya Kenceng, Arya Kutawandira, Arya Sentong, and Arya Belog. Arya Kenceng led his brothers to govern Bali under Majapahit suzerainty, and he would become the progenitor of the Balinese kings of the Tabanan and Badung royal houses.

These Chinese voyages visited numbers of ports in Asia as far as [[Africa]], including Majapahit ports. It was said that Zheng He has paid a visit to the Majapahit court in Java.\n\nThese massive Chinese voyages were not merely a naval exploration, but also a show of power and a display of geopolitical reach.

However, perhaps the most significant Chinese intervention was its support for the newly established [[Sultanate of Malacca]], as a rival and counter-weight to the Majapahit influence of Java.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" /> \n\nPreviously, Majapahit has succeeded to assert its influence in Malacca strait by containing the aspiration of Malay polities in Sumatra and Malay Peninsula to ever reach the geopolitical might like those of Srivijaya. The Hindu Majapahit were the most powerful maritime power in Southeast Asian seas that time and were opposed to Chinese expansion into their sphere of influence. The Ming's support for Malacca, and the spread of Islam propagated by both Malacca and Zheng He's treasure fleet has weakened Majapahit maritime influence in Sumatra, which caused the northern part of the island to increasingly converting to Islam and gained independence from Majapahit, leaving [[Indragiri]], [[Jambi]] and [[Palembang]], remnants of the old [[Srivijaya]], the only suzerainty under Majapahit in Sumatra,{{efn | group=lower-roman | According to the History of Ming, only these areas in Sumatra were still mentioned as under Javanese / Majapahit supremacy at the time.

Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to [[Islam]] in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in coastal northern Java, thus created a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as [[Semarang]], [[Demak, Indonesia|Demak]], [[Tuban]], and [[Surabaya|Ampel]]; thus Islam began to gain a foothold on the northern coast of Java.

After Kertawijaya died, [[Bhre Pamotan]] became a king with formal name Rajasawardhana. He died in 1453. A three-year kingless period was possibly the result of a succession crisis. [[Girisawardhana]], son of Kertawijaya, came to power in 1456. He died in 1466 and was succeeded by Singhawikramawardhana.\n\n====The divide====\nIn 1468 Prince Kertabhumi rebelled against Singhawikramawardhana, promoting himself as the king of Majapahit. Deposed Singhawikramawardhana retreated upstream of Brantas River, moved the kingdom's capital further inland to [[Kediri (city)|Daha]] (the former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri kingdom]]), effectively splitting Majapahit, under Bhre Kertabumi in Trowulan and Singhawikramawardhana in Daha. Singhawikramawardhana continued his rule until he was succeeded by his son [[Girindrawardhana]] (Ranawijaya) in 1474.\n\nAnd in between this period of the dividing court of Majapahit, the kingdom found itself unable to control its western part of the already crumbling empire. The rising power of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] began to gain effective control of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]] in the mid-15th century and expanding its influence to Sumatra. And amidst these events, Indragiri and Siantan, according to [[Malay Annals]] were given to Malacca as a dowry for the marriage of a Majapahit princess and the [[Mansur Shah of Malacca|sultan of Malacca]].<ref name=\"Leyden\">Leyden, John (1821)[https://books.google.co.id/books?id=J9JAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false Malay Annals (translated from the Malay language)], Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown.</ref>, further weakening Majapahit's influence on the western part of the archipelago. Kertabhumi managed to stabilized this situation by allying with Muslim merchants, giving them trading rights on the north coast of Java, with [[Demak Regency|Demak]] as its centre and in return asked for their loyalty to Majapahit. This policy boosted the Majapahit treasury and power, but weakened Hindu-Buddhism as its main religion because [[Dawah|Islamic proselytizing]] spread faster, especially in Javanese coastal principalities.

The refugees fled to the east to avoid Demak retribution for their support for Ranawijaya against Kertabhumi. \n\nDemak came under the leadership of Raden (later crowned as Sultan) Patah (Arabic name: Fatah, lit. \"liberator\", \"conqueror\"), who was acknowledged as the legitimate successor of Majapahit. According to Babad Tanah Jawi and Demak tradition, the source of Patah's legitimacy was because their first sultan, Raden Patah, was the son of Majapahit king Brawijaya V with a Chinese concubine. Another argument supports Demak as the successor of Majapahit; the rising Demak sultanate was easily accepted as the nominal regional ruler, as Demak was the former Majapahit vassal and located near the former Majapahit realm in Eastern Java.\n\nDemak established itself as the regional power and the first Islamic sultanate in Java. After the fall of Majapahit, the Hindu kingdoms in Java only remained in [[Blambangan]] on the eastern edge and [[Sunda Kingdom|Pajajaran]] in the western part. Gradually [[Hindu]] communities began to retreat to the mountain ranges in East Java and also to the neighbouring island of [[Bali]]. A small enclave of [[Tenggerese people|Hindu communities]] still remain in the [[Tengger caldera|Tengger]] mountain range.\n\n== Military ==\nAccording to History of Yuan, soldiers of early Majapahit era were mainly dominated by poorly equipped light [[infantry]]. During the Mongol invasion of Java, Javanese army was described as temporarily mobilized farmers and a few noble warriors. The nobility marched at the front line, with huge rear army composed of peasants. The Javanese peasant army was half-naked and covered with cotton fabric at the waist ([[sarung]]). Most of the weapons are bows and arrows, [[bamboo]] spears, and short blades. Aristocrats are deeply influenced by Indian culture, usually armed with swords and spears, dressed in white.<ref name=\":0\">Song Lian.

In this age, even to the 17th century, the Nusantaran soldiers fought on a platform called ''Balai'' and performed boarding actions.

Unlike the earlier naturalistic, relaxed and flowing figures of classical Central Java style ([[Sailendra]] art c. 8th to 10th century), this East Javanese style demonstrates a stiffer pose, stylised and rendered in [[wayang]]-like figures, such as those carved on East Javanese temple's bas-reliefs. The bas-reliefs were projected rather flat from the background. This style was later preserved in [[Balinese art]], especially in its [[Kamasan]] style classical paintings and Balinese wayang.\n\nThe statues of Hindu gods and Buddhist deities in Majapahit art were also the continuisation of its previous Singhasari art. The statues of East Javanese period tends to be stiffer and frontal-formal pose, compared to the statues of Central Javanese art (c. 9th century) that are more Indianized style, relaxed in [[tribhanga]] pose. The stiffer pose of Majapahit gods statues are probably in accordance to the statue's function as the deified portrayal self of the dead Majapahit monarch. The carving however, are richly decorated, especially with fine floral carving of lotus plants carved on the stela behind the statue. Examples of Majapahit statues are the Harihara statue from Simping temple, believed to be the deified portrayal of [[Raden Wijaya|King Kertarajasa]], the statue of Parwati believed to be the portrayal of [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Queen Tribhuwana]], and statue of queen [[Suhita]] discovered at Jebuk, Kalangbret, Tulungagung, East Java.\n\n[[File:Pair of door guardians SF Asian Art Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pair of door guardians from a temple, Eastern Java, 14th century, [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco|Museum of Asian Art, San Francisco]].]]\n\nClay pottery and brick masonry are popular feature in Majapahit art and architecture.

It is probably the origin of Javanese-Indonesian word to refer for saving or money container. The word ''celengan'' in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] means both \"savings\" and \"piggy bank\". It was derived from the word ''celeng'' which means \"wild boar\", the [[suffix]] \"-an\" was added to denote its likeness. One important specimen is stored in National Museum of Indonesia, it has been reconstructed since this large piggy bank has been found broken to pieces.\n\nTerracotta money boxes also has been found in different shapes, such as tubular or boxes, with slits to slip coins.

Every family has a storage shed made of bricks, about 3 or 4 ''[[Chi (unit)|Ch'ih]]'' ({{convert|48.9|in|cm|abbr=off|disp=or}}) above the ground, where they kept the family property, and they lived on top of this building, to sit and sleep.\n\nThe Majapahit temple architecture follows the east Javanese styles, in contrast of earlier central Javanese style. This east Javanese temple style is also dated back from Kediri period c. 11th century. The shapes of Majapahit temples are tends to be slender and tall, with roof constructed from multiple parts of stepped sections formed a combined roof structure curved upward smoothly creating the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective illussion]] that the temple is perceived taller than its actual height. The pinnacle of the temples are usually cube (mostly Hindu temples), sometimes dagoba cylindrical structures (Buddhist temples). Although some of temples dated from Majapahit period used [[andesite]] or [[sandstone]], the red [[brick]]s is also a popular construction material.\n\n[[File:Bajang Ratu Gate Trowulan.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The 16.5-metre tall Bajang Ratu [[Paduraksa]] gate, at Trowulan, echoed the grandeur of Majapahit.]]\n\nAlthough [[brick]] had been used in the ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' of Indonesia's classical age, it was Majapahit architects of the 14th and 15th centuries who mastered it.<ref name=\"Schoppert1997\">{{cite book|author=Schoppert, P., Damais, S.|title=Java Style|year=1997|publisher=Periplus Editions|editor=Didier Millet|location=Paris|pages=33\u201334|isbn=962-593-232-1}}</ref> Making use of a vine sap and [[palm sugar]] mortar, their temples had a strong geometric quality. The example of Majapahit temples are Brahu temple in Trowulan, [[Pari Temple|Pari]] in Sidoarjo, [[Jabung]] in Probolinggo, and [[Candi Surawana|Surawana temple]] near Kediri. Jabung temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Bajrajinaparamitapura, despite some parts of its roof and pinnacles are now missing, it is one of the most well-preserved Majapahit temple architecture. Another example include Gunung Gangsir temple near Pasuruan. Some of the temples are dated from earlier period but renovated and expanded during Majapahit era, such as [[Candi Penataran|Penataran]], the largest temple in East Java dated back to [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]] era. This temple was identified in Nagarakretagama as Palah temple and reported being visited by King Hayam Wuruk during his royal tour across East Java. Another notable temple of Eastern Javanese style is [[Jawi temple]] in Pandaan \u2013 also visited by King Hayam Wuruk, the temple was mentioned in Nagarakretagama as Jajawa, and was dedicated as mortuary temple for his great grandfather, King Kertanegara of Singhasari.\n\nSome of typical architectural style are believed to be developed during Majapahit era; such as tall and slender roofed red brick gate commonly called as ''kori agung'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'', and also split gate of ''[[candi bentar]]''. The large split gate of Wringin Lawang located at Jatipasar, Trowulan, Mojokerto, East Java, is one of the oldest and the largest surviving ''candi bentar'' dated from Majapahit era. The ''candi bentar'' took shape of typical Majapahit temple structure \u2013 consists of three parts; foot, body and tall roof \u2013 evenly split into two mirroring structures to make a passage in the centre for people to walk through. This type of split gate has no doors and provides no real defensive purpose but narrowing the passage. It was probably only serve the ceremonial and aesthetic purpose, to create the sense of grandeur, before entering the next compound through tall roof ''paduraksa'' gate with enclosed door. The example of ''kori agung'' or ''paduraksa'' style gate is the elegant Bajang Ratu gate richly decorated with Kala demon, cyclops and also the bas-relief telling the story of Sri Tanjung. Those typical Majapahit architectural style has deeply influenced the Javanese and [[Balinese architecture]] of later period. The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\">{{cite book | title = Majapahit Style Vol.1 | author = Made Wijaya | publisher = Wijaya Words - a division of Yayasan Beringin Berapi| year = 2014 | isbn = 9786027136700| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Majapahit_Style_Vol_1.html?id=J3GMBAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>\n\nIn later period near the fall of Majapahit, the art and architecture of Majapahit witnessed the revival of indigenous native Austronesian [[megalithic architectural elements]], such as [[Candi Sukuh|Sukuh]] and [[Candi Cetho|Cetho]] temples on western slopes of [[Mount Lawu]]. Unlike previous Majapahit temples that demonstrate typical Hindu architecture of high-rise towering structure, the shape of these temples are [[step pyramid]], quite similar to Mesoamerican [[pyramid]]s. The stepped pyramid structure called ''Punden Berundak'' (stepped mounds) is a common megalithic structure during [[Prehistoric Indonesia|Indonesian prehistoric era]] before the adoption of Hindu-Buddhist culture.\n\n==Economy==\nAlso in ''Yingya Shenglan'', Ma Huan reported the Javanese economy and market.

Previously, the 9th-century [[Wonoboyo hoard]] discovered in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40&nbsp;kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in [[Sidoarjo]] in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era.<ref>{{cite web | title = Uang Kuno Temuan Rohimin Peninggalan Majapahit | url = http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | date = November 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131031003554/http://www.kompas.com/read/xml/2008/11/24/17571290/uang.kuno.temuan.rohimin.peninggalan.majapahit. | archivedate = 31 October 2013}}</ref> The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume it was due to the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a [[currency]] system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited.<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} These ''kepeng'' Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes\u2014the imported Chinese copper coins\u2014enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a slitted earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped ''celengan'' (piggy bank).\n\nSome idea of scale of the internal economy can be gathered from scattered data in inscriptions. The Canggu inscriptions dated 1358 mentions 78 ferry crossings in the country (mandala Java).<ref name=miksic />{{rp | page=107}} Majapahit inscriptions mention a large number of occupational specialities, ranging from gold and silver smiths to drink vendors and butchers. Although many of these occupations had existed in earlier times, the proportion of the population earning an income from non-agrarian pursuits seems to have become even greater during the Majapahit era.\n\nThe great prosperity of Majapahit was probably due to two factors. Firstly, the northeast lowlands of Java were suitable for rice [[Tillage|cultivation]], and during Majapahit's prime numerous [[irrigation]] projects were undertaken, some with government assistance. Secondly, Majapahit's ports on the north coast were probably significant stations along the route to obtain the spices of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], and as the spices passed through Java they would have provided an important source of income for Majapahit.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}}\n\nThe Nagarakretagama states that the fame of the ruler of Wilwatikta (a synonym for Majapahit) attracted foreign merchants from far and wide, including Indians, Khmers, Siamese, and Chinese among others. While in later period, ''Yingya Shenglan'' mentioned that large numbers of Chinese traders and Muslim merchants from west (from Arab and India, but mostly from Muslim states in Sumatra and Malay peninsula) are settling in Majapahit port cities, such as Tuban, Gresik and Hujung Galuh ([[Surabaya]]). A special tax was levied against some foreigners, possibly those who had taken up semi-permanent residence in Java and conducted some type of enterprise other than foreign trade. The Majapahit Empire had trading links with Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], [[Vietnam|Annam]] and [[Champa]] in today Vietnam, [[Cambodia]], Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthayan]], Burmese [[Martaban]] and the south Indian [[Vijayanagara Empire]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{multiple image|align=right| direction = vertical|total_width=150|image1=Surya Majapahit.jpg|image2=Surya Majapahit 2.jpg|image3=Candi Ceto Majapahit Sun, Surakarta 1264.jpg|footer=Three designs of [[Surya Majapahit]], the sun emblem of the kingdom.}}\n\nDuring the reign of [[Hayam Wuruk]], Majapahit employed a well-organised bureaucratic structure for administrative purposes. The hierarchy and structure relatively remain intact and unchanged throughout Majapahit history.<ref name=\"SNI451\">Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (1990), hal. 451\u2013456.</ref> The king is the paramount ruler, as the [[chakravartin]] he is considered as the universal ruler and believed to be the living god on earth. The king holds the highest political authority and legitimacy.\n\n===Bureaucracy officials===\nDuring his daily administration, the king is assisted by bureaucratic state officials that also included the close relatives of the kings that hold certain esteemed titles. The royal order or edict usually transmitted from the king to the high officials well to their subordinates. The officials in Majapahit courts are:\n:* ''Rakryan Mahamantri Katrini'', usually reserved for the king's heir\n:* ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'', the board of [[Minister (government)|ministers]] that conduct the daily administration\n:* ''Dharmmadhyaksa'', the officials of laws, state laws as well as religious laws\n:* ''Dharmma-upapatti'', the officials concerning religious affairs\n\nWithin the ministers of ''Rakryan Mantri ri Pakira-kiran'' there is the most important and the highest minister titled ''Rakryan Mapatih'' or ''Patih Hamangkubhumi''. This position is analogous to [[prime minister]], and together with king, they determine the important state policies, including war or peace. Among the Dharmmadhyaksa officials there is ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasewan'' (State's highest Hindu [[Shivaist]] priest) and ''Dharmmadhyaksa ring Kasogatan'' (State's highest Buddhist priest), both are the religious laws authorities of each dharmic faiths.\n\nThere is also the board of advisors which consists of the elders within royal family called ''Bhattara Saptaprabhu''. This council consists of seven influential elders\u2014mostly directly related to the king. They are the ''Bhres'' (Duke or Duchess) acted as regional kings, the rulers of Majapahit provinces. This council congregates, offers advice, gave consideration to the king, and often formed an assembly to judge a certain important case in the court. Example of their office was, their sentence to temporarily suspend Mahamantri Gajah Mada, as a punishment since he was held responsible for the shamefully disastrous [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat incident]]. The council also sentenced the execution of Raden Gajah (Narapati) for decapitating Bhre Wirabhumi in [[Paregreg war]].<ref name=\"BP-Sejarah Nasional\">{{cite book | title = Sejarah nasional Indonesia: Zaman kuno \u2013 Volume 2 dari Sejarah nasional Indonesia | author1= Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro | author2= Soejono (R.

This region is ruled by provincial kings called ''Paduka Bhattara'' with the title ''Bhre''. This title is the highest position below the monarch and similar to duke or duchess. Usually this position reserved for the close relatives of the king. Their duty is to administer their own provinces, collect taxes, send annual tributes to the capital, and manage the defences of their borders.\n\nDuring the reign of Hayam Wuruk (1350\u20131389) there were 12 provinces of Majapahit, administered by king's close relatives:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" width=\"80%\"\n! width=\"260\" |Provinces\n! width=\"120\" |Titles\n! width=\"140\" |Rulers\n! width=\"260\" |Relation to the King\n|-\n|[[Kahuripan]] (or [[Janggala]], today [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]])\n|Bhre Kahuripan\n|Tribhuwanatunggadewi\n|queen mother\n|-\n|Daha (former capital of [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]])\n|Bhre Daha\n|Rajadewi Maharajasa\n|aunt and also mother-in-law\n|-\n|Tumapel (former capital of [[Singhasari]])\n|Bhre Tumapel\n|Kertawardhana\n|father\n|-\n|Wengker (today [[Ponorogo]])\n|Bhre Wengker\n|Wijayarajasa\n|uncle and also father-in-law\n|-\n|Matahun (today [[Bojonegoro]])\n|Bhre Matahun\n|Rajasawardhana\n|husband of the duchess of Lasem, king's cousin\n|-\n|Wirabhumi ([[Blambangan]])\n|Bhre Wirabhumi\n|Bhre Wirabhumi{{efn | group=lower-roman | 1=Bhre Wirabhumi is actually the title: the Duke of Wirabhumi (Blambangan), the real name is unknown.

The traditional or initial area of Majapahit during its formation before entering the imperial phase. This includes the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercises his government. The area in and around royal capital of [[Trowulan]], port of Canggu and sections of [[Brantas River]] valley near the capital, also mountainous areas south and southeast of capital, all the way to [[Mount Penanggungan|Pananggungan]] and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] peaks, are the core realm of the kingdom. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and [[Janggala|Hujung Galuh]] port (Surabaya) are considered as parts of ''Negara Agung''.\n* '''''Mancanegara''''', areas surrounding ''Negara Agung'' \u2014 traditionally refer to Majapahit provinces in East and Central Java. This area covered the eastern half of Java, with all its provinces ruled by the ''Bhres'' (dukes), the king's close relatives. These areas are directly influenced by Javanese Majapahit court culture, and obliged to pay annual tributes. These areas usually possess their own rulers that might be directly related, foster an alliance or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit stationed their officials and officers in these places and regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, yet they enjoyed substantial internal autonomy. This includes the rest of [[Java]] island, [[Madura]] and [[Bali]]. However, in later period, overseas provinces which has developed culture reflected or comparable to those of Java, or possess significant trading importance, are also considered as ''mancanegara''. Either the province has their own native rulers subject (vassal) to the king, or a regent appointed and sent by the king to rule the region. This realm includes [[Melayu Kingdom|Dharmasraya]], [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Pagaruyung]], [[Lampung]] and [[Palembang]] in [[Sumatra]].\n* '''''Nusantara''''', areas which do not reflect Javanese culture, but are included as colonies and they had to pay annual tribute. They had their native polity intact, enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit did not necessarily station their officials or military officers here; however, any challenges on Majapahit oversight might draw severe response. These areas such as the vassal kingdoms and colonies in [[Malay peninsula]], [[Borneo]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n[[File:Filippine, provincia di agusan, immagine hindu, statuetta in oro massiccio, xiii secolo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1.79 kilogram, 21-karat Majapahit period [[Golden Tara|gold image]] discovered in [[Esperanza, Agusan|Agusan]], [[Philippines]], copied Nganjuk bronze images of the early Majapahit period,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl/view/item/7096|title=[Bronze statues from Nganjuk] OD-3577 {{!}} Digital Collections|website=digitalcollections.universiteitleiden.nl|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> signify Majapahit cultural influence on southern Philippines.]]\n\n[[Nagarakretagama#Descriptions of the Majapahit realm|Nagarakretagama]] mentioned more than 80 places in the archipelago described as the vassal states.<ref name=\"Britannica-Majapahit\"/> In Canto 13, several lands on [[Sumatra]] are mentioned, and some possibly correspond to contemporary areas: [[Jambi]], [[Palembang]], Teba ([[Toba Samosir Regency|Toba]]), and [[Dharmasraya]].

Previously, Singhasari seeks to dominate trade route, especially Malacca strait, and also saw the outreach of Mongolian-Chinese Yuan influence into Southeast Asia as the threat to their own interest. During its formation, the returning Pamalayu expedition in 1293 has brought Malayu Kingdoms in Jambi and Dharmasraya under Javanese suzerainty. Therefore, Java often consider itself as the overlord of most of polities in the Indonesian archipelago. \n\nDuring the reign of Majapahit's first two monarch \u2013 Wijaya and Jayanegara, the kingdom struggled to consolidate its rule, plagued by a number of rebellions. However, it was not until the reign of its third monarch \u2013 Queen Tribhuwana Tunggadewi, and her son, Hayam Wuruk \u2013 that the kingdom began to projected its power overseas. Majapahit's confidence for dominance was stemmed for their economic and demographic comparative advantage; agrarian as well as maritime nation; their large rice production, immense human resources, well-organized society, also their mastery in shipbuilding, navigation and military technology; are excellent relatively compared to their neighbours. These strengths were used by Gajah Mada to expand the kingdom's influence and building a maritime empire. This rather imperialistic outlooks, has projected in the way he forcefully dealt with Majapahit's neighbours; the Pabali (conquest of Bali, 1342\u20131343) and the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] (1356). Majapahit pulled Bali into their orbit as a vassal state. While the disastrous diplomacy with Sunda kingdom has led to the enmity among them.\n\n[[File:Bhairava Adityavarman.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adityawarman]], a senior minister of Majapahit depicted as Bhairava. He established the [[Pagaruyung Kingdom]] in Central Sumatra.]]\nMajapahit overlordship upon Malay states of Sumatra was demonstrated by the rule of [[Adityawarman]] of Malayupura. Adityawarman, the cousin of King Jayanegara, was raised within Majapahit palace and rose to become a senior minister in Majapahit court. He was sent to led Majapahit military expansion to conquer east coast region in Sumatra. Adityawarman then founded the royal dynasty of [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] in [[Pagarruyung]] and presided over the central Sumatra region to take control of the gold trade between 1347 and 1375.\n\nWithin Indonesian archipelago, Majapahit saw itself as the center of a huge mandala. This notion is demonstrated by its three tier administrative hierarchy; Nagara Agung, Mancanegara, and Nusantara. Outside of Maritime Southeast Asia, Majapahit devices Mitreka Satata, or partner in common order, in which it saw several states as ally. They are [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], [[Nakhon Si Thammarat kingdom]], [[Ratchaburi]], [[Songkla]], [[Mottama]], [[Champa]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Vietnam|Annam]].\n\nIn Sumatran front, Majapahit did capture Palembang, Jambi and Dharmasraya, invade [[Samudera Pasai Sultanate|Pasai]], and it also saw the settlement of [[Temasek|Tumasik]], that later become [[Kingdom of Singapura]], as its rebellious colony, and thus deal with them accordingly.\n\nIn later years after the era of Hayam Wuruk, Majapahit has lost their grips on some of their overseas possessions. This led to the thrive and the rise of several polities previously held under Majapahit domination, such as [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]]. The rise of Malacca in 15th century in particular is important, because it represents Majapahit eventual failure to control Malacca strait. Previously Majapahit tried to contain the rise of a potential regional rival; a Malay polity in par with Srivijaya, by punishing a rebellion in Palembang and capturing Singapura. In this sense, Malacca was indeed the rival of Majapahit in the competition to dominate the archipelagic realm. Despite this perceived rivalry, in practice however, the two kingdoms actually had some close and intense economic and cultural relations. At that time, the trade link between Majapahit ports of Hujung Galuh and Tuban with port of Melaka must be thriving.\n\n[[File:Cast Chinese coins (330 B.C. - 1912 A.D.).jpg|thumb|right|On center bottom row (no. 8) is a Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 T\u014dng-B\u01ceo (\u6c38\u6a02\u901a\u5bf6) cash coin cast under the [[Yongle Emperor|Y\u01d2ng-L\u00e8 Emperor]] (\u6c38\u6a02\u5e1d) of Ming dynasty.

After the fall of Yuan, the Ming Emperor eager to project his power into Southeast Asia. On the other hand Majapahit saw this archipelagic realm as theirs and unwelcome to any perceived Chinese interference. After Majapahit was weaken by Paregreg civil war, and incessant conflicts among its nobles, the arrival of the formidable [[Ming treasure voyages]] led by [[Zheng He]] upon Majapahit shores has pushed Majapahit prestigue and power to the side. Ming on the other hand, actively support the rise of Malacca. This Ming protection has made Majapahit unwilling and unable to push Malacca anymore.<ref name=\"TOI-Sanyal\" />\n\nMajapahit ultimate nemesis however, was located very close at home; the [[Demak Sultanate]] on northern coast of Central Java. Ming support to Malacca, and Malacca active proselytizing of Islam, has led to the thrive and rise of Muslim traders community in the archipelago, including in Majapahit ports on the north coast of Java. This in turn gradually corroded the prestigue of Javanese Hindu-Buddhist kingship, and after several generations, led to the fall of once mighty Majapahit empire.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Acharya|first=Amitav|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=vqmMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT238&lpg=PT238&dq=Malacca+Majapahit+relations&source=bl&ots=9mQ3IaTV7Y&sig=ACfU3U1zFpmqhiUqu46YcP-omJ4q-UW_GQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj06d7m7e_oAhUbVH0KHVz_B6k4ChDoATACegQICRAr#v=onepage&q=Malacca%20Majapahit%20relations&f=false|title=Non-Western International Relations Theory: Perspectives On and Beyond Asia|last2=Buzan|first2=Barry|date=2009-12-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-17403-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Pura Maospahit Denpasar Bali.jpg|thumb|right|''Pura Maospahit'' (\"Majapahit Temple\") in [[Denpasar]], Bali, demonstrate the typical Majapahit red brick architecture.]]\n\nMajapahit was the largest empire ever to form in Southeast Asia.<ref name=miksic />{{rp|page=107}} Although its political power beyond the core area in east Java was diffuse, constituting mainly ceremonial recognition of suzerainty, Majapahit society developed a high degree of sophistication in both commercial and artistic activities.

Other than Javanese sources, some regional legends mentioning Majapahit kingdom or its general Gajah Mada, also can be found; from Aceh, Minangkabau, Palembang, Malay Peninsula, Sunda, Brunei, Bali to Sumbawa. Most of them mentioned about the incoming Javanese forces to their land, which was probably a local testament of the empire's expansive nature that once dominating the archipelago. The [[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai|Hikayat Raja Pasai]], a 14th-century [[Aceh]] chronicle tell a Majapahit naval invasion against [[Samudra Pasai]] in 1350. The chronicle described that the Majapahit invasion was a punishment for Sultan Ahmad Malik Az-Zahir's crime on ruining a royal marriage between Pasai Prince Tun Abdul Jalil and Raden Galuh Gemerencang, a Majapahit princess \u2013 that led to the death of the royal couple.<ref name=\"Tirto-Pasai\"/> \n[[File:Masjid Menara Kudus.jpg|thumb|left|The Majapahit style minaret of Kudus Mosque.]]\nIn West Sumatra, the [[Minangkabau (legend)|legend of Minangkabau]] mentioned an invading foreign prince \u2013 associated with Javanese Majapahit kingdom \u2013 being defeated in a buffalo fight.<ref name=\"Sindo-Minangkabau\"/> In West Java, the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] tragedy caused a myth to revolve around Indonesians, which forbids marriage between a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and a [[Javanese people|Javanese]], as it would be unsustainable and only bring misery to the couple.<ref>{{cite news | title = Tragedi Perang Bubat dan mitos orang jawa dilarang kawin dengan sunda | date = 24 April 2015 | author = Hery H Winarno | url = https://www.merdeka.com/peristiwa/tragedi-perang-bubat-mitos-orang-jawa-dilarang-kawin-dengan-sunda.html | language = Indonesian}}</ref> In Malay peninsula, the [[Malay annals]] mentioned the legend of the fall of [[Kingdom of Singapura|Singapura]] to Majapahit forces in 1398 was due to the betrayal of Sang Rajuna Tapa that opened the fortified city gate.<ref>{{harvnb|A.

The [[Panji (prince)|Panji cycles]], the tale of [[Sri Tanjung]], and the epic of [[Damarwulan]], are popular tales in Javanese and [[Balinese literature]]s. The tales of Panji was dated from older period during Kediri kingdom, while the tale of Sri Tanjung and the epic of Damarwulan took place during Majapahit period. These tales remained a popular theme in Javanese culture of later period during Mataram Sultanate, and often became the source of inspiration for [[wayang]] shadow puppet performance, [[ketoprak]] and [[topeng]] dance drama. The Panji tales in particular have spread from East Java to become a source of inspiration for literature and dance drama throughout the region, as far as Malay peninsula, Cambodia and Siam where he is known as Raden Inao or Enau ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) of Kurepan.{{Sfn|Holt|1967|p=274}}\n\nMajapahit had a momentous and lasting influence on [[Indonesian art]] and [[Indonesian architecture|architecture]]. The empire's expansion circa 14th-century, contributed to the difussion Javanese cultural influence throughout the archipelago, which can be seen as a form of [[Javanisation]]. It was probably during this period that some of Javanese cultural elements, such as [[gamelan]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> and kris, being expanded and introduced to islands outside of Java.

The Majapahit architectural style that often employs [[Majapahit Terracotta|terracotta]] and [[red brick]] heavily influenced the architecture of Java and Bali in the later period. The Majapahit style ''[[candi bentar]]'' split gate, the ''kori'' or ''[[paduraksa]]'' towering red brick gate, and also ''pendopo'' pavilion have become ubiquitous in Javanese and Balinese architectural features, as seen in [[Menara Kudus Mosque]], [[Keraton Kasepuhan]] and Sunyaragi park in [[Cirebon]], [[Mataram Sultanate]] royal cemetery in [[Kota Gede]], [[Yogyakarta]], and various palaces and temples in Bali.<ref name=\"Made Wijaya\"/>\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebfs op het Pendopo Terras Panataran tempelcomplex TMnr 20027152.jpg|thumb|right|Bas relief from [[Candi Penataran]] describes the Javanese-style [[pendopo]] pavilion, commonly found across Java and Bali.]]\n\nThe vivid, rich and festive [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]] is considered as one of Majapahit legacy. The Javanese Hindu civilisation since the era of [[Airlangga]] to the era of Majapahit kings has profoundly influenced and shaped the Balinese culture and [[History of Bali|history]].<ref>[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/bali/history Lonely Planet: History of Bali]</ref> The ancient links and Majapahit legacy is observable in many ways; architecture, literature, religious rituals, dance-drama and artforms. The aesthetics and style of bas-reliefs in Majapahit East Javanese temples were preserved and copied in Balinese temples. It is also due to the fact that after the fall of the empire, many Majapahit nobles, artisans and priests had taken refuge either in the interior mountainous region of East Java or across the narrow strait to Bali. Indeed, in some ways the [[Bali Kingdom|Kingdom of Bali]] was the successor of Majapahit. Large numbers of Majapahit manuscripts, such as [[Nagarakretagama]], [[Kakawin Sutasoma|Sutasoma]], [[Pararaton]] and [[Tantu Pagelaran]], were being well-kept in royal libraries of Bali and Lombok, and provides the glimpse and valuable historical records on Majapahit. The Majapahit Hindu-Javanese culture has shaped the culture of Bali, that led to popular expression; \"without Java there is no Bali\". Yet in return, Bali is credited as the last stronghold to safeguard and preserve the ancient Hindu Javanese civilisation.\n\n[[File:WLANL - mchangsp - Kris van Knaud.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to Majapahit period]]\n\nIn weaponry, the Majapahit expansion is believed to be responsible for the widespread use of the [[Kris|keris]] dagger in Southeast Asia; from Java, Bali, Sumatra, Malaysia, Brunei to Southern Thailand. Although it has been suggested that the keris, and native daggers similar to it, predate Majapahit, nevertheless the empire expansion contributed to its popularity and diffusion in the region around the year 1492.<ref name=\"JPostKris\">{{cite news|title=Kris, more than just a simple dagger |author=Tantri Yuliandini |date=18 April 2002 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |accessdate=30 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729203644/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/04/18/kris-more-just-a-simple-dagger.html |archivedate=29 July 2014 }}</ref> For example, [[Kris of Knaud]], one of the oldest surviving kris is dated to 1264 Saka (which correspondends to 1342).

The Indonesian Navy flag of red and white stripes also has a Majapahit origin.

The history of Majapahit continues to inspire contemporary artists.]]\nCelebrated as 'the golden era of the archipelago', the Majapahit empire has inspired many writers and artists (and continues to do so) to create their works based on this era, or to describe and mention it. The impact of the Majapahit theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:\n\n# ''Sandyakalaning Majapahit'' (1933), or Twilight/Sunset in Majapahit is an historical romance that took place during the fall of Majapahit empire, written by [[Sanusi Pane]].\n# ''Panji Koming'' (since 1979), a weekly [[comic strip]] by Dwi Koendoro published in the Sunday edition of [[Kompas]], telling the everyday life of Panji Koming, a common Majapahit citizen. Although it took place in the Majapahit era, the comic strip serves as witty [[satire]] and [[criticism]] of modern Indonesian society. From a political, social, cultural and current point of view, Indonesia is described as the '[[reincarnation]]' of the Majapahit empire. The current Indonesian president is often portrayed as a Majapahit monarch or prime minister.\n# ''Saur Sepuh'' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is based on 15th-century Java, centred around the story about a fictional hero named Brama Kumbara, the king of Madangkara, a fictional kingdom neighbour of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Pajajaran]]. In several stories the Paregreg war is described, that is to say the civil war of Majapahit between Wikramawardhana and Bhre Wirabhumi. This part has been made into a single feature film entitled 'Saur Sepuh' as well.\n# ''Tutur Tinular'', a radio drama and film by S Tidjab. Tutur Tinular is a [[martial art]] historical epic fictional story with the Majapahit era serving as the background of the story. The story also involved a romance between the hero named Arya Kamandanu and his Chinese lover Mei Shin.\n# ''Wali Songo'', the film tells the story of nine [[Muslim]] saints ('wali') who spread [[Islam]] to Java. The story took place near the end of the Majapahit era and the formation of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]]. It describes the decaying Majapahit empire where royals are fighting each other for power while the commoners suffer.\n# ''Senopati Pamungkas'' (1986, reprinted in 2003), a martial art-historical epic novel by Arswendo Atmowiloto. It takes place in the late Singhasari period and formation of Majapahit. This novel describes the sagas, royal intrigues, and romance of the formation of the kingdom as well as the adventure of the main character, a commoner named Upasara Wulung and his forbidden love affair with princess Gayatri Rajapatni, whom later becomes the consort of [[Raden Wijaya]], the first king of Majapahit.\n#  ''Imperium Majapahit'', a comic book series by Jan Mintaraga, published by Elexmedia Komputindo. This series tells the history of Majapahit from its formation until the decline.\n# ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang (film)|Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'' (2004), a [[Malaysia]]n epic film based on [[Legend of Puteri Gunung Ledang|a traditional Malay legend]]. This film recounts the love story between Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, a Majapahit princess, and [[Hang Tuah]], a [[Malaccan Sultanate|Malaccan]] admiral.\n# ''[[Gajah Mada (book)|Gajah Mada]]'', a [[pentalogy]] written by [[Langit Kresna Hariadi]] depicting a fictionalised detail of [[Gajah Mada]]'s life from the [[Gajah Mada#Rise to Mahapatih|Kuti rebellion]] up to the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].\n# ''[[Dyah Pitaloka]]'' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, fictionalising the detailed life story of Sundanese princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]] set around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]]. The novel virtually takes the same context and was inspired by the [[Kidung Sundayana]].\n# ''Jung Jawa'' (2009), an anthology of short stories written by Rendra Fatrisna Kurniawan, imagining the life of the Nusantara people, published by Babel Publishing.\n# ''[[Civilization 5: Brave New World]] (2013)'', where [[Gajah Mada]] appeared as one of the leaders of a great civilisation in the second expansion of the [[Civilization 5]] game. He is the leader of the Indonesian civilisation, with the emblem of the Indonesian empire being the [[Surya Majapahit]], although in the game the empire is known as the \"Indonesian empire\" instead.\n# Later, in [[Civilization VI|''Civilization 6 (2016),'']] ''a'' downloadable content has one of its rulers, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Dyah Gitarja]] (referred as Gitarja in-game) as the leader of the Indonesian civilization, with the emblem being a simpler version of the Surya Majapahit. The unique unit of Indonesian civilization is the ''jong''.\n# On the ''Rise of the Rajas'' expansion pack from ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', [[Gajah Mada]] appears in a campaign detailing his rise and then fall after the Pasunda Bubat tragedy.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gosari inscription]]\n* [[Kidung Sunda]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Java]]\n* [[Osing people|Osing]]\n* [[Srivijaya]]\n* [[Tenggerese people|Tenggerese]]\n* [[Hinduism in Indonesia]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist | group=lower-roman | close}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=miksic>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9813018267\n| series    = Indonesian Heritage Series\n| title     = Ancient History\n| publisher = Archipelago Press / Editions Didier Millet\n| year      = 1999\n| editor    = John Miksic\n| volume    = Vol 1\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=ricklefs>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780804721950\n| last      = Ricklefs\n| first     = Merle Calvin\n| title     = A history of modern Indonesia since c. 1300\n| year      = 1993\n| publisher = Stanford University Press / Macmillans\n| edition   = 2nd\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=yingyai>{{Cite book\n| isbn      = 9780521010320\n| author    = Ma Huan\n| title     = [[Yingya Shenglan|Ying-yai Sheng-lan]] (\u701b\u6daf\u80dc\u89c8) The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores\n| others    = translated by J.V.G Mills\n| language  = Chinese\n| origyear  = 1433\n| year      = 1970\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| series    = [[Hakluyt Society]]\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Majapahit}}\n{{div col}}\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/trowulan/history/history.html A Short History of Majapahit]\n* [http://www.eastjava.com/books/majapahit/ Memoirs of Majapahit Kingdom]\n* [http://users.skynet.be/network.indonesia/ni4001c6.htm A brief history of Majapahit]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120125090000/http://sejarahnasional.org/index.php/kerajaan-nusantara/1-terjemahan-manuskrip-nagarakertagama A Complete Transcription of Majapahit Royal Manuscript of Nagarakertagama from SejarahNasional.org an National History Website]\n{{col div end}}\n\n{{Precolonial states in Indonesia}}\n{{Asia in topic|Hinduism in}}\n{{Empires}}\n{{Coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n[[Category:1527 disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1293]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1527]]\n[[Category:Historical Hindu empires]]\n[[Category:Precolonial states of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:1293 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Malaysian history]]\n[[Category:Majapahit]]\n[[Category:Former empires in Asia]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Indonesian history]]\n[[Category:Hindu Buddhist states in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Island countries]]\n[[Category:Indianized kingdoms]]\n", "name_user": "Gunkarta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRelations with regional powers:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majapahit"}

In northern [[Eurasia]], [[peat bog]]s can also preserve textiles very well. The first known textile of South America was discovered in [[Guitarrero Cave]] in Peru.

Geographically, the Silk Road or Silk Route is an interconnected series of ancient trade routes between [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) in China, with [[Asia Minor]] and the Mediterranean extending over {{convert|8000|km|mi|abbr=on}} on land and sea. Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the great [[civilization]]s of China, Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]], the Indian subcontinent, and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and helped to lay the foundations for the modern world. The exchange of luxury textiles was predominant on the [[Silk Road]], which linked traders, merchants, [[pilgrim]]s, [[monk]]s, soldiers, [[nomad]]s and urban dwellers from China to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during various periods of time.\n\n===Ancient Near East===\nThe earliest known woven textiles of the [[Near East]] may be fabrics used to wrap the dead, excavated at a [[Neolithic]] site at [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] in [[Anatolia]], carbonized in a fire and [[radiocarbon]] dated to c. 6000 BC.<ref name=\"Cambridge 1\">Jenkins, pp. 39\u201347</ref> Evidence exists of [[flax]] cultivation from c. 8000 BC in the Near East, but the breeding of sheep with a wooly [[Wool|fleece]] rather than hair occurs much later, c. 3000 BC.<ref name=\"Cambridge 1\" />\n\nIn [[Mesopotamia]], the clothing of a regular [[Sumer|Sumerian]] was very simple, especially in summer, in the winter wearing clothes made of sheep fur.

The king wore a tunic, a coat that reached to his knees, with a belt in the middle. Over time, the development of the craft of wool weaving has led to a great variety in clothing. Thus, towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC  and later the men wore a tunic with short sleeves and even over the knees, with a belt (over which the rich wore a wool cloak).

Any cloth that might have been worn has long since disintegrated and we have not yet been able to decipher the Indus script. However, historians and archaeologists have managed to piece together some bits of information from clues found in sculptures and figurines.\n\nTerracotta figurines uncovered at Mehrgarh show a male figure wearing what is commonly interpreted to be a turban; female figurines depict women with elaborate headdress and intricate hairstyles.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=24966394|title=The Antecedents of Civilization in the Indus Valley|first1=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|last1=Jarrige|first2=Richard H.|last2=Meadow|date=8 May 1980|journal=Scientific American|volume=243|issue=2|pages=122\u2013137|bibcode=1980SciAm.243b.122J|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0880-122}}</ref> In certain cases, these headdresses have led historians to attach a religious connotation to the figurines and to the interpret the headdresses as symbols of a mother goddess.\n\nOne of the most important recovered figurines is that of the \"Priest King\" from the site of [[Mohenjo-daro]]. It is not only important because scholars have called it a representation of an assumed authority or head of state but also because of what it is wearing, however, it was recently discovered to be an interpretation of a wealthy trader. The calmly seated Priest-King is depicted wearing a shawl with floral patterns. So far, this is the only sculpture from the Indus Valley to show clothing in such explicit detail. However, it does not provide any concrete proof to legitimize the history of clothing in the Harappan times. Harappans may even have used natural colours to dye their fabric. Research shows that the cultivation of indigo plants (genus: '''''[[Indigofera]]''''') was prevalent.\n\nAnother important sculpture is of a dancing girl, also excavated from Mohenjo-daro. She is depicted with no clothing other than a number of bangles upon her arm. B. B.

He notices how contemporary women continue wearing those bangles even today. Harappans may not have left any evidence of what clothing or textiles they had at that time but they did leave remains of jewellery and beads in large amounts. For instance, the graves of Harappans have yielded various forms of jewellery such as neckpieces, bracelets, rings, and head ornaments. Multiple beads of varying shapes and sizes have also been recovered. This jewellery incorporates various materials such as gold, bronze, terracotta, faience, and shells; imported materials including turquoise and lapis lazuli were used too. This suggests that the Harappans might have engaged in long-distance trade. Long, slender [[carnelian]] beads were highly prized by the Harappans. Harappans were also experts in manufacturing microbeads, which have been found in various locations from hearths and graves. These beads were extremely hard to work with and needed extra precision to produce. A special drill has been found both at Lothal and Chanhudaro. Chanhudaro was a centre exclusively devoted to craft production.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMohenjo-daro Priesterk\u00f6nig.jpeg|Statue of \"Priest King\" wearing a robe; 2400\u20131900 BCE; low fired [[steatite]]; [[National Museum of Pakistan]] ([[Karachi]])\nDidarganj_Yakshi_statue_in_the_Bihar_Museum.jpg|The [[Didarganj Yakshi]] depicting the ''dhoti wrap''; circa 300 BC; [[Bihar Museum]] (India)\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes; circa 200 BC; [[Tokyo National Museum]] (Japan)\nGuptaDanceMusic02.jpg|Ancient form of ''[[Churidar]]'' worn during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]]; circa 300 AD; [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum]] ([[New Delhi]])\nRaja Ravi Varma - Mahabharata - Shakuntala.jpg|[[Shakuntala]], wife of [[Dushyanta]] and the mother of [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Emperor Bharata]], from [[K\u0101lid\u0101sa|Kalidasa]]'s play ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala]]'', wearing a [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]\nBritish Museum silk princess painting.jpg|Painting on wooden panel discovered by Aurel Stein in [[Dandan Oilik]], depicting the legend of the princess who hid silk worm eggs in her headdress to smuggle them out of China to the Kingdom of Khotan; 7th to 8th century; [[British Museum]] (London)\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\n{{Main|Clothing in ancient Egypt}}\nEvidence exists for production of linen cloth in [[Ancient Egypt]] in the Neolithic period, c. 5500 BC.

Tha Kae was inhabited during the end of the first millennium BC to the late first millennium AD.  Here, archaeologists discovered 90 fragments of spindle whorl dated from 3rd century BC to 3rd century AD. And the shape of these finds indicate the connections with south China and India.<ref>Cameron, J. (2011). Iron and cloth across the Bay of Bengal: new data from Tha Kae, central Thailand. Antiquity, 85(328).</ref> A spindle whorl is a disc or spherical object that fits onto the spindle to increase as well as maintain the speed of spinning.\n\n===Ancient Japan===\nThe earliest evidence of weaving in Japan is associated with the [[J\u014dmon period]]. This culture is defined by pottery decorated with cord patterns. In a shell mound in the Miyagi Prefecture, dating back about 5,500, some cloth fragments were discovered made from bark fibers.<ref>Liddell, Jill, ''The story of the Kimono'', E. P. Dutton New Zork, 1989, {{ISBN|0-525-24574-X}}</ref> Hemp fibers were also discovered in the [[Torihama shell mound]], Fukui Prefecture, dating back to the J\u014dmon period, suggesting that these plants could also have been used for clothing. Some pottery pattern imprints depict also fine mat designs, proving their weaving techniques. The patterns on the J\u014dmon pottery show people wearing short upper garments, close-fitting trousers,  funnel-sleeves, and rope-like belts. The depictions also show clothing with patterns that are embroidered or painted arched designs, though it is not apparent whether this indicates what the clothes look like or whether that simply happens to be the style of representation used. The pottery also shows no distinction between male and female garments. This may have been true because during that time period clothing was more for decoration than social distinction, but it might also just be because of the representation on the pottery rather than how people actually dressed at the time. Since bone needles were also found, it is assumed that they wore dresses that were sewn together.<ref>Zamanaka, Norio, ''The Book of Kimono'', Kodansha International, 1986, {{ISBN|0-87011-785-8}}</ref>\n\nNext was the Yayoi period, during which rice cultivation was developed. This led to a shift from hunter-gatherer communities to agrarian societies which had a large impact on clothing. According to Chinese literature from that time period, clothing more appropriate to agriculture began to be worn. For example, an unsewn length of fabric wrapped around the body, or a poncho-type garment with a head-hole cut into it. This same literature also indicates that pink or scarlet makeup was worn but also that mannerisms between people of all ages and genders were not very different. However, this is debatable as there were probably cultural prejudices in the Chinese document. There is a common Japanese belief that the Yayoi time period was quite utopian before Chinese influence began to promote the use of clothing to indicate age and gender.\n\nFrom 300 to 550 AD was the Yamato period, and here much of the clothing style can be derived from the artifacts of the time. The tomb statues (haniwa) especially tell us that the clothing style changed from the ones according to the Chinese accounts from the previous age. The statues are usually wearing a two piece outfit that has an upper piece with a front opening and close-cut sleeves with loose trousers for men and a pleated skirt for women. Silk farming had been introduced by the Chinese by this time period but due to silk's cost it would only be used by people of certain classes or ranks.\n\nThe following periods were the Asuka (550 to 646 AD) and Nara (646 to 794 AD) when Japan developed a more unified government and began to use Chinese laws and social rankings. These new laws required people to wear different styles and colors to indicate social status. Clothing became longer and wider in general and sewing methods were more advanced.<ref>Slade, T. (2009). Japanese fashion a cultural history (English ed.). Oxford: Berg.</ref>\n\n===Classical Period of the Philippines===\n[[File:Naturales 5.png|thumb|100px|The [[Boxer Codex]], showing the attire of a Classical period Filipino, made of [[silk]] and [[cotton]].]]\nThe classical Filipino clothing varied according to cost and current fashions and so indicated social standing. The basic garments were the Bahag  and the tube skirt\u2014what the Maranao call malong\u2014or a light blanket wrapped around instead. But more prestigious clothes, lihin-lihin, were added for public appearances and especially on formal occasions\u2014[[blouse]]s and [[tunics]], loose smocks with [[sleeves]], capes, or ankle-length robes. The textiles of which they were made were similarly varied. In ascending order of value, they were [[abaca]], abaca decorated with colored [[cotton]] [[thread (yarn)|thread]], [[cotton]], cotton decorated with silk thread, silk, imported printstuff, and an elegant abaca woven of selected fibers almost as thin as [[silk]]. In addition, Pigafetta mentioned both G-strings and skirts of [[Bark (botany)|bark]] cloth.\n\nUntailored clothes, however had no particular names. ''Pandong'', a lady's [[cloak]], simply meant any natural covering, like the growth on banana trunk's or a natal caul. In [[Panay]], the word ''kurong'', meaning curly hair, was applied to any short skirt or blouse; and some better ones made of imported chintz or calico were simply called by the name of the cloth itself, tabas. So, too, the wraparound skirt the Tagalogs called tapis was hardly considered a skirt at all: Visayans just called it habul (woven stuff) or halong ([[abaca]]) or even hulun ([[sash]]).\n\nThe usual male headdress was the pudong, a turban, though in Panay both men and women also wore a head cloth or bandana called ''saplung''. Commoners wore pudong of rough abaca cloth wrapped around only a few turns so that it was more of a headband than a turban and was therefore called ''pudong-pudong\u2014as'' the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]s and [[diadem]]s on Christian images were later called. A red ''pudong'' was called magalong, and was the insignia of braves who had killed an enemy. The most prestigious kind of ''pudong'', limited to the most valiant, was, like their G-strings, made of pinayusan, a gauze-thin abaca of fibers selected for their whiteness, tie-dyed a deep scarlet in patterns as fine as embroidery, and burnished to a silky sheen. Such pudong were lengthened with each additional feat of valor: real heroes therefore let one end hang loose with affected carelessness.\nWomen generally wore a kerchief, called tubatub if it was pulled tight over the whole head; but they also had a broad-brimmed hat called sayap or tarindak, woven of sago-palm leaves. Some were evidently signs of rank: when Humabon's queen went to hear mass during Magellan's visit, she was preceded by three girls carrying one of her [[hat]]s. A [[headdress]] from Cebu with a deep crown, used by both sexes for travel on foot or by boat, was called ''sarok'', which actually meant to go for water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|title=Pinoy-Culture ~ A Filipino Cultural & History Blog - Pre-Colonial Traditional Clothing (Note: Though...|accessdate=6 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106060654/http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Classical Greece===\n{{Main|Clothing in the ancient world|Clothing in ancient Greece|Clothing in ancient Rome}}\n[[File:ChitonAndHimation.png|thumb|200px|Greek chiton (left) and chiton worn under himation]]\nFabric in Ancient Greece was woven on a warp-weighted loom.

Typical garments were the [[peplos]], a loose robe worn by women; the [[chlamys]], a [[cloak]] worn by men; and the [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]], a tunic worn by both men and women. Men's chitons hung to the knees, whereas women's chitons fell to their ankles. A long cloak called a [[himation]] was worn over the peplos or chlamys.\n\nThe [[toga]] of ancient Rome was also an unsewn length of wool cloth, worn by male citizens draped around the body in various fashions, over a simple [[tunic]]. Early tunics were two simple rectangles joined at the shoulders and sides; later tunics had sewn [[sleeve]]s. Women wore the draped [[stola]] or an ankle-length tunic, with a [[shawl]]-like [[palla (garment)|palla]] as an outer garment. Wool was the preferred fabric, although linen, [[hemp]], and small amounts of expensive imported silk and cotton were also worn.\n\n===Iron Age Europe===\nThe [[Iron Age]] is broadly identified as stretching from the end of the [[Bronze Age]] around 1200 BC to 500 AD and the beginning of the [[Medieval]] period. Bodies and clothing have been found from this period, preserved by the anaerobic and acidic conditions of [[peat bogs]] in northwestern Europe.

Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, p. 39</ref>\n\nThe 13th century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear. Linen was increasingly used for clothing that was directly in contact with the skin. Unlike wool, linen could be laundered and bleached in the sun. Cotton, imported raw from Egypt and elsewhere, was used for padding and quilting, and cloths such as [[buckram]] and [[fustian]].\n\n[[Crusades|Crusaders]] returning from the [[Levant]] brought knowledge of its fine textiles, including light silks, to Western Europe.

Even though the purdah was made compulsory for the Mughal women, we see that this did not stop themselves from experimenting in style and attire. Abul Fazal mentions that there were sixteen components that adorned a woman. These not only included clothing but also other aspects like that of oiling the body and iqtar. Mughal women wore long loose jamas with full sleeves and in winters it was accompanied by a Qaba or a Kashmir shawl used as a coat. Women were very fond of their perfumes and scents. Jewellery in the Mughal tradition signified not only religious values but also style statements.\n\n===Pre-Colonial North America===\n{{main|Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\nAcross North America, native people constructed clothing using natural fibers such as cotton and agave as well as leather skins from animals such as deer or beavers. When traders and colonists came from Europe, they brought with them sheep and travelers highly valued the beaver pelts in particular for their warmth. Beaver pelt trade was one of the first commercial endeavors of colonial North America and a cause of the [[Beaver Wars]].\n\n==Enlightenment and the Colonial period==\n{{main|1700\u20131750 in fashion|1750\u20131795 in fashion}}\nDuring the 18th century, distinction was made between ''full dress'' worn at Court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress which had all but disappeared by the end of the century. Full dress followed the styles of the French court, where rich silks and elaborate embroidery reigned. Men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] for both full dress and undress; these were now sometimes made of the same fabric and trim, signalling the birth of the three-piece [[suit (clothes)|suit]].\n\nWomen's silhouettes featured small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]] in the 1730s and early 1740s, which were displaced for formal court wear by side hoops or [[pannier (clothing)|panniers]] which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the court of [[Marie Antoinette]]. Fashion reached heights of fantasy and [[Rococo|abundant ornamentation]], before new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits and a long-simmering movement toward simplicity and democratization of dress under the influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and the [[American Revolution]] led to an entirely new mode and the triumph of British woollen tailoring following the [[French Revolution]].\n\nFor women's dresses, Indian cottons, especially printed [[chintz]]es, were imported to Europe in large numbers, and towards the end of the period simple white [[muslin]] dresses were in fashion.\n\n==Industrial revolution==\n[[File:Textile machinery at Cambrian Factory, Llanwrtyd (1293828).jpg|thumb|Textile machinery at the Cambrian Factory, [[Llanwrtyd]], [[Wales]] in the 1940s.]]\n[[File:T\u00dc RKA Gaudeamusel L\u00e4tis.JPG|thumb|[[Estonia]]n national clothes are a fine example of change in clothing after the industrial revolution. They changed a lot during 18th and 19th of century with the addition of new types of colors (like [[aniline]] dyes), placement of colors (like lengthwise stripes) and with the addition of new elements (like waistcoats). By the end of the 19th century they went out of use in most of the country (except more remote places as in [[Kihnu]] island) and it was only in mid 20th century when they once again gained popularity and now as a formal clothing.

Production shifted from small cottage based production to mass production based on assembly line organisation. Clothing production, on the other hand, continued to be made by hand.\n\n[[Sewing machine]]s emerged in the 19th century<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/cs/inventorsalphabet/a/loom_4.htm Spindel, Loom, and Needle] \u2013 History of the Textile Industry</ref> streamlining clothing production.\n\nTextiles were not only made in factories. Before this, they were made in local and national markets. Dramatic change in transportation throughout the nation is one source that encouraged the use of factories. New advances such as steamboats, canals, and railroads lowered shipping costs which caused people to buy cheap goods that were produced in other places instead of more expensive goods that were produced locally. Between 1810 and 1840, the development of a national market prompted manufacturing which tripled the output's worth. This increase in production created a change in industrial methods, such as the use of factories instead of hand made woven materials that families usually made.<ref>{{cite book|author=W. J.

Women went to work in textile factories for a number of reasons. Some women left home to live on their own because of crowding at home; or to save for future marriage portions. The work enabled them to see more of the world, to earn something in anticipation of marriage, and to ease the crowding within the home. They also did it to make money for family back home. The money they sent home was to help out with the trouble some of the farmers were having. They also worked in the millhouses because they could gain a sense of independence and growth as a personal goal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Dublin|title=Transforming women's work: New England lives in the industrial revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTfTKyrIGfgC&pg=PA82|accessdate=1 January 2012|date=August 1995|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8090-4|pages=82\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==20th-century developments==\n\nThe 20th century is marked by new applications for textiles as well as inventions in synthetic fibers and computerized manufacturing control systems.\n\n===Unions and education===\n\nIn the early 20th century, workers in the clothing and textile industries became [[Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union|unionized]] in the United States.

These properties may be implemented through mechanical solutions, such as different weaving and knitting patterns, by modifications to the fibers, or by finishing (textiles) of the textiles. Since the 1960s, it has been possible to finish textiles to resist stains, flames, wrinkles, and microbial life. Advancement in dye technology allowed for coloring of previously difficult-to-dye natural fibers and synthetic fibers.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\">{{cite book | title = Textiles, 12th edition | author1 = Sara J. Kadolph | author2 = Sara B. Marcketti | publisher = Pearson |date = 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Synthetic fibers===\n\nFollowing the invention of plastics by petroleum and chemical corporations, fibers could now be made synthetically. Advancements in fiber spinning actuators and control systems allow control over fiber diameter and shape, so Synthetic fibers, may be engineered with more precision than natural fibers. Fibers invented between 1930 and 1970 include nylon, PTFE, polyester, Spandex, and Kevlar. Clothing producers soon adopted synthetic fibers, often using blends of different fibers for optimized properties.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\"/> Synthetic fibers can be knit and woven similarly to natural fibers.\n\n===Automation and numeric control===\n\nThe early 20th century continued the advances of the Industrial Revolution. In The procedural loops required for mechanized textile knitting and weaving already used logic were encoded in punch-cards and tapes. Since the machines were already computers, the invention of small-scale electronics and microcontrollers did not immediately change the possible functions of these machines. In the 1960s, existing machines became outfitted with computerized numeric control (CNC) systems, enabling more accurate and efficient actuation. In 1983, Bonas Machine Company Ltd. presented the first computer-controlled, [[Jacquard loom#Electronic Jacquard looms|electronic, Jacquard loom]].<ref>[https://www.bonas.be/en/about-us Bonas.co.uk]</ref> In 1988, the first US patent was awarded for a \"pick and place\" robot.<ref>{{cite patent | country=US | number=4872258A| pubdate=1988-09-22 | inventor=Philip A Ragard | url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4872258A/en}}</ref> Advancements such as these changed the nature of work for machine operators, introducing computer literacy as a skill alongside machine literacy.

In northern [[Eurasia]], [[peat bog]]s can also preserve textiles very well. The first known textile of South America was discovered in [[Guitarrero Cave]] in Peru.

These are the [[warp-weighted loom]] and the two-beam loom. The length of the cloth beam determined the width of the cloth woven upon it, and could be as wide as 2\u20133 meters.

The Steppe Route has always connected regions of the Asian continent with trade and transmission of culture, including clothing.\n\nAround 114 BC, the [[Han Dynasty]],<ref>Elisseeff, Vadime, ''The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and Commerce'', UNESCO Publishing / Berghahn Books, 2001, {{ISBN|978-92-3-103652-1}}</ref> initiated the [[Silk Road]] Trade Route.

Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the great [[civilization]]s of China, Egypt, [[Mesopotamia]], [[Persia]], the Indian subcontinent, and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and helped to lay the foundations for the modern world. The exchange of luxury textiles was predominant on the [[Silk Road]], which linked traders, merchants, [[pilgrim]]s, [[monk]]s, soldiers, [[nomad]]s and urban dwellers from China to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] during various periods of time.\n\n===Ancient Near East===\nThe earliest known woven textiles of the [[Near East]] may be fabrics used to wrap the dead, excavated at a [[Neolithic]] site at [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] in [[Anatolia]], carbonized in a fire and [[radiocarbon]] dated to c. 6000 BC.<ref name=\"Cambridge 1\">Jenkins, pp. 39\u201347</ref> Evidence exists of [[flax]] cultivation from c. 8000 BC in the Near East, but the breeding of sheep with a wooly [[Wool|fleece]] rather than hair occurs much later, c. 3000 BC.<ref name=\"Cambridge 1\" />\n\nIn [[Mesopotamia]], the clothing of a regular [[Sumer|Sumerian]] was very simple, especially in summer, in the winter wearing clothes made of sheep fur.

The king wore a tunic, a coat that reached to his knees, with a belt in the middle. Over time, the development of the craft of wool weaving has led to a great variety in clothing. Thus, towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC  and later the men wore a tunic with short sleeves and even over the knees, with a belt (over which the rich wore a wool cloak).

Any cloth that might have been worn has long since disintegrated and we have not yet been able to decipher the Indus script. However, historians and archaeologists have managed to piece together some bits of information from clues found in sculptures and figurines.\n\nTerracotta figurines uncovered at Mehrgarh show a male figure wearing what is commonly interpreted to be a turban; female figurines depict women with elaborate headdress and intricate hairstyles.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=24966394|title=The Antecedents of Civilization in the Indus Valley|first1=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois|last1=Jarrige|first2=Richard H.|last2=Meadow|date=8 May 1980|journal=Scientific American|volume=243|issue=2|pages=122\u2013137|bibcode=1980SciAm.243b.122J|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0880-122}}</ref> In certain cases, these headdresses have led historians to attach a religious connotation to the figurines and to the interpret the headdresses as symbols of a mother goddess.\n\nOne of the most important recovered figurines is that of the \"Priest King\" from the site of [[Mohenjo-daro]]. It is not only important because scholars have called it a representation of an assumed authority or head of state but also because of what it is wearing, however, it was recently discovered to be an interpretation of a wealthy trader. The calmly seated Priest-King is depicted wearing a shawl with floral patterns. So far, this is the only sculpture from the Indus Valley to show clothing in such explicit detail. However, it does not provide any concrete proof to legitimize the history of clothing in the Harappan times. Harappans may even have used natural colours to dye their fabric. Research shows that the cultivation of indigo plants (genus: '''''[[Indigofera]]''''') was prevalent.\n\nAnother important sculpture is of a dancing girl, also excavated from Mohenjo-daro. She is depicted with no clothing other than a number of bangles upon her arm. B. B. Lal <ref>{{cite book|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/8301806|title=How deep are the roots of Indian civilization? : archaeology answers in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508123647/https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/8301806|archivedate=8 May 2018|df=dmy-all|isbn=9788173053764|last1=Lal|first1=Braj Basi|year=2009}}</ref> has managed draw parallels between the dancing girl and women today in parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat. He notices how contemporary women continue wearing those bangles even today. Harappans may not have left any evidence of what clothing or textiles they had at that time but they did leave remains of jewellery and beads in large amounts. For instance, the graves of Harappans have yielded various forms of jewellery such as neckpieces, bracelets, rings, and head ornaments. Multiple beads of varying shapes and sizes have also been recovered. This jewellery incorporates various materials such as gold, bronze, terracotta, faience, and shells; imported materials including turquoise and lapis lazuli were used too. This suggests that the Harappans might have engaged in long-distance trade. Long, slender [[carnelian]] beads were highly prized by the Harappans. Harappans were also experts in manufacturing microbeads, which have been found in various locations from hearths and graves. These beads were extremely hard to work with and needed extra precision to produce. A special drill has been found both at Lothal and Chanhudaro. Chanhudaro was a centre exclusively devoted to craft production.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nMohenjo-daro Priesterk\u00f6nig.jpeg|Statue of \"Priest King\" wearing a robe; 2400\u20131900 BCE; low fired [[steatite]]; [[National Museum of Pakistan]] ([[Karachi]])\nDidarganj_Yakshi_statue_in_the_Bihar_Museum.jpg|The [[Didarganj Yakshi]] depicting the ''dhoti wrap''; circa 300 BC; [[Bihar Museum]] (India)\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes; circa 200 BC; [[Tokyo National Museum]] (Japan)\nGuptaDanceMusic02.jpg|Ancient form of ''[[Churidar]]'' worn during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]]; circa 300 AD; [[National Museum, New Delhi|National Museum]] ([[New Delhi]])\nRaja Ravi Varma - Mahabharata - Shakuntala.jpg|[[Shakuntala]], wife of [[Dushyanta]] and the mother of [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Emperor Bharata]], from [[K\u0101lid\u0101sa|Kalidasa]]'s play ''[[Shakuntala (play)|Abhij\u00f1\u0101na\u015b\u0101kuntala]]'', wearing a [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]\nBritish Museum silk princess painting.jpg|Painting on wooden panel discovered by Aurel Stein in [[Dandan Oilik]], depicting the legend of the princess who hid silk worm eggs in her headdress to smuggle them out of China to the Kingdom of Khotan; 7th to 8th century; [[British Museum]] (London)\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\n{{Main|Clothing in ancient Egypt}}\nEvidence exists for production of linen cloth in [[Ancient Egypt]] in the Neolithic period, c. 5500 BC.

Tha Kae was inhabited during the end of the first millennium BC to the late first millennium AD.  Here, archaeologists discovered 90 fragments of spindle whorl dated from 3rd century BC to 3rd century AD. And the shape of these finds indicate the connections with south China and India.<ref>Cameron, J. (2011). Iron and cloth across the Bay of Bengal: new data from Tha Kae, central Thailand. Antiquity, 85(328).</ref> A spindle whorl is a disc or spherical object that fits onto the spindle to increase as well as maintain the speed of spinning.\n\n===Ancient Japan===\nThe earliest evidence of weaving in Japan is associated with the [[J\u014dmon period]]. This culture is defined by pottery decorated with cord patterns. In a shell mound in the Miyagi Prefecture, dating back about 5,500, some cloth fragments were discovered made from bark fibers.<ref>Liddell, Jill, ''The story of the Kimono'', E. P. Dutton New Zork, 1989, {{ISBN|0-525-24574-X}}</ref> Hemp fibers were also discovered in the [[Torihama shell mound]], Fukui Prefecture, dating back to the J\u014dmon period, suggesting that these plants could also have been used for clothing. Some pottery pattern imprints depict also fine mat designs, proving their weaving techniques. The patterns on the J\u014dmon pottery show people wearing short upper garments, close-fitting trousers,  funnel-sleeves, and rope-like belts. The depictions also show clothing with patterns that are embroidered or painted arched designs, though it is not apparent whether this indicates what the clothes look like or whether that simply happens to be the style of representation used. The pottery also shows no distinction between male and female garments. This may have been true because during that time period clothing was more for decoration than social distinction, but it might also just be because of the representation on the pottery rather than how people actually dressed at the time. Since bone needles were also found, it is assumed that they wore dresses that were sewn together.<ref>Zamanaka, Norio, ''The Book of Kimono'', Kodansha International, 1986, {{ISBN|0-87011-785-8}}</ref>\n\nNext was the Yayoi period, during which rice cultivation was developed. This led to a shift from hunter-gatherer communities to agrarian societies which had a large impact on clothing. According to Chinese literature from that time period, clothing more appropriate to agriculture began to be worn. For example, an unsewn length of fabric wrapped around the body, or a poncho-type garment with a head-hole cut into it. This same literature also indicates that pink or scarlet makeup was worn but also that mannerisms between people of all ages and genders were not very different. However, this is debatable as there were probably cultural prejudices in the Chinese document. There is a common Japanese belief that the Yayoi time period was quite utopian before Chinese influence began to promote the use of clothing to indicate age and gender.\n\nFrom 300 to 550 AD was the Yamato period, and here much of the clothing style can be derived from the artifacts of the time. The tomb statues (haniwa) especially tell us that the clothing style changed from the ones according to the Chinese accounts from the previous age. The statues are usually wearing a two piece outfit that has an upper piece with a front opening and close-cut sleeves with loose trousers for men and a pleated skirt for women. Silk farming had been introduced by the Chinese by this time period but due to silk's cost it would only be used by people of certain classes or ranks.\n\nThe following periods were the Asuka (550 to 646 AD) and Nara (646 to 794 AD) when Japan developed a more unified government and began to use Chinese laws and social rankings. These new laws required people to wear different styles and colors to indicate social status. Clothing became longer and wider in general and sewing methods were more advanced.<ref>Slade, T. (2009). Japanese fashion a cultural history (English ed.). Oxford: Berg.</ref>\n\n===Classical Period of the Philippines===\n[[File:Naturales 5.png|thumb|100px|The [[Boxer Codex]], showing the attire of a Classical period Filipino, made of [[silk]] and [[cotton]].]]\nThe classical Filipino clothing varied according to cost and current fashions and so indicated social standing. The basic garments were the Bahag  and the tube skirt\u2014what the Maranao call malong\u2014or a light blanket wrapped around instead. But more prestigious clothes, lihin-lihin, were added for public appearances and especially on formal occasions\u2014[[blouse]]s and [[tunics]], loose smocks with [[sleeves]], capes, or ankle-length robes. The textiles of which they were made were similarly varied. In ascending order of value, they were [[abaca]], abaca decorated with colored [[cotton]] [[thread (yarn)|thread]], [[cotton]], cotton decorated with silk thread, silk, imported printstuff, and an elegant abaca woven of selected fibers almost as thin as [[silk]]. In addition, Pigafetta mentioned both G-strings and skirts of [[Bark (botany)|bark]] cloth.\n\nUntailored clothes, however had no particular names. ''Pandong'', a lady's [[cloak]], simply meant any natural covering, like the growth on banana trunk's or a natal caul. In [[Panay]], the word ''kurong'', meaning curly hair, was applied to any short skirt or blouse; and some better ones made of imported chintz or calico were simply called by the name of the cloth itself, tabas. So, too, the wraparound skirt the Tagalogs called tapis was hardly considered a skirt at all: Visayans just called it habul (woven stuff) or halong ([[abaca]]) or even hulun ([[sash]]).\n\nThe usual male headdress was the pudong, a turban, though in Panay both men and women also wore a head cloth or bandana called ''saplung''. Commoners wore pudong of rough abaca cloth wrapped around only a few turns so that it was more of a headband than a turban and was therefore called ''pudong-pudong\u2014as'' the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]s and [[diadem]]s on Christian images were later called. A red ''pudong'' was called magalong, and was the insignia of braves who had killed an enemy. The most prestigious kind of ''pudong'', limited to the most valiant, was, like their G-strings, made of pinayusan, a gauze-thin abaca of fibers selected for their whiteness, tie-dyed a deep scarlet in patterns as fine as embroidery, and burnished to a silky sheen. Such pudong were lengthened with each additional feat of valor: real heroes therefore let one end hang loose with affected carelessness.\nWomen generally wore a kerchief, called tubatub if it was pulled tight over the whole head; but they also had a broad-brimmed hat called sayap or tarindak, woven of sago-palm leaves. Some were evidently signs of rank: when Humabon's queen went to hear mass during Magellan's visit, she was preceded by three girls carrying one of her [[hat]]s. A [[headdress]] from Cebu with a deep crown, used by both sexes for travel on foot or by boat, was called ''sarok'', which actually meant to go for water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|title=Pinoy-Culture ~ A Filipino Cultural & History Blog - Pre-Colonial Traditional Clothing (Note: Though...|accessdate=6 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106060654/http://pinoy-culture.tumblr.com/post/30479656512/pre-colonial-traditional-clothing-note-though|archivedate=6 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Classical Greece===\n{{Main|Clothing in the ancient world|Clothing in ancient Greece|Clothing in ancient Rome}}\n[[File:ChitonAndHimation.png|thumb|200px|Greek chiton (left) and chiton worn under himation]]\nFabric in Ancient Greece was woven on a warp-weighted loom.

Typical garments were the [[peplos]], a loose robe worn by women; the [[chlamys]], a [[cloak]] worn by men; and the [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]], a tunic worn by both men and women. Men's chitons hung to the knees, whereas women's chitons fell to their ankles. A long cloak called a [[himation]] was worn over the peplos or chlamys.\n\nThe [[toga]] of ancient Rome was also an unsewn length of wool cloth, worn by male citizens draped around the body in various fashions, over a simple [[tunic]]. Early tunics were two simple rectangles joined at the shoulders and sides; later tunics had sewn [[sleeve]]s. Women wore the draped [[stola]] or an ankle-length tunic, with a [[shawl]]-like [[palla (garment)|palla]] as an outer garment. Wool was the preferred fabric, although linen, [[hemp]], and small amounts of expensive imported silk and cotton were also worn.\n\n===Iron Age Europe===\nThe [[Iron Age]] is broadly identified as stretching from the end of the [[Bronze Age]] around 1200 BC to 500 AD and the beginning of the [[Medieval]] period. Bodies and clothing have been found from this period, preserved by the anaerobic and acidic conditions of [[peat bogs]] in northwestern Europe. A Danish recreation of clothing found with such bodies indicates woven wool dresses, tunics and skirts.<ref>[http://www.tollundman.dk/toej.asp The Tollund Man \u2013 Clothes and Fashion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118112211/http://www.tollundman.dk/toej.asp |date=18 January 2012 }}.

People in many countries dressed differently depending on whether they identified with the old Romanised population, or the new [[migration period|invading populations]] such as [[Franks]], [[Anglo-Saxons]], and [[Visigoths]]. Men of the invading peoples generally wore short [[tunic]]s, with belts, and visible trousers, [[Hose (clothing)|hose]] or leggings. The Romanised populations, and the Church, remained faithful to the longer tunics of Roman formal costume.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nThe elite imported silk cloth from the Byzantine, and later Muslim, worlds, and also probably cotton. They also could afford bleached linen and dyed and simply patterned wool woven in Europe itself. But embroidered decoration was probably very widespread, though not usually detectable in art. Lower classes wore local or homespun wool, often undyed, trimmed with bands of decoration, variously [[embroidery]], [[tablet weaving|tablet-woven]] bands, or colorful borders woven into the fabric in the loom.<ref>[[Gale Owen-Crocker|Owen-Crocker, Gale R.]], ''Dress in Anglo-Saxon England'', revised edition, Boydell Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-84383-081-7}} pp. 309\u2013315</ref><ref name=\"Norse\">\u00d8sterg\u00e5rd, Else, ''Woven into the Earth: Textiles from Norse Greenland'', Aarhus University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|87-7288-935-7}}</ref>\n\n===High middle ages and the rise of fashion===\n{{Main|1100\u20131200 in fashion|1200\u20131300 in fashion|1300\u20131400 in fashion}}\n[[File:ItalianSilkDamask.jpg|left|150px|thumb|14th-century Italian silk damasks]]\nClothing in 12th and 13th century Europe remained very simple for both men and women, and quite uniform across the subcontinent.

Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.<ref>Piponnier & Mane, p. 39</ref>\n\nThe 13th century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear. Linen was increasingly used for clothing that was directly in contact with the skin. Unlike wool, linen could be laundered and bleached in the sun. Cotton, imported raw from Egypt and elsewhere, was used for padding and quilting, and cloths such as [[buckram]] and [[fustian]].\n\n[[Crusades|Crusaders]] returning from the [[Levant]] brought knowledge of its fine textiles, including light silks, to Western Europe.

Even though the purdah was made compulsory for the Mughal women, we see that this did not stop themselves from experimenting in style and attire. Abul Fazal mentions that there were sixteen components that adorned a woman. These not only included clothing but also other aspects like that of oiling the body and iqtar. Mughal women wore long loose jamas with full sleeves and in winters it was accompanied by a Qaba or a Kashmir shawl used as a coat. Women were very fond of their perfumes and scents. Jewellery in the Mughal tradition signified not only religious values but also style statements.\n\n===Pre-Colonial North America===\n{{main|Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\nAcross North America, native people constructed clothing using natural fibers such as cotton and agave as well as leather skins from animals such as deer or beavers. When traders and colonists came from Europe, they brought with them sheep and travelers highly valued the beaver pelts in particular for their warmth. Beaver pelt trade was one of the first commercial endeavors of colonial North America and a cause of the [[Beaver Wars]].\n\n==Enlightenment and the Colonial period==\n{{main|1700\u20131750 in fashion|1750\u20131795 in fashion}}\nDuring the 18th century, distinction was made between ''full dress'' worn at Court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress which had all but disappeared by the end of the century. Full dress followed the styles of the French court, where rich silks and elaborate embroidery reigned. Men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] for both full dress and undress; these were now sometimes made of the same fabric and trim, signalling the birth of the three-piece [[suit (clothes)|suit]].\n\nWomen's silhouettes featured small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]] in the 1730s and early 1740s, which were displaced for formal court wear by side hoops or [[pannier (clothing)|panniers]] which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the court of [[Marie Antoinette]]. Fashion reached heights of fantasy and [[Rococo|abundant ornamentation]], before new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits and a long-simmering movement toward simplicity and democratization of dress under the influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and the [[American Revolution]] led to an entirely new mode and the triumph of British woollen tailoring following the [[French Revolution]].\n\nFor women's dresses, Indian cottons, especially printed [[chintz]]es, were imported to Europe in large numbers, and towards the end of the period simple white [[muslin]] dresses were in fashion.\n\n==Industrial revolution==\n[[File:Textile machinery at Cambrian Factory, Llanwrtyd (1293828).jpg|thumb|Textile machinery at the Cambrian Factory, [[Llanwrtyd]], [[Wales]] in the 1940s.]]\n[[File:T\u00dc RKA Gaudeamusel L\u00e4tis.JPG|thumb|[[Estonia]]n national clothes are a fine example of change in clothing after the industrial revolution. They changed a lot during 18th and 19th of century with the addition of new types of colors (like [[aniline]] dyes), placement of colors (like lengthwise stripes) and with the addition of new elements (like waistcoats). By the end of the 19th century they went out of use in most of the country (except more remote places as in [[Kihnu]] island) and it was only in mid 20th century when they once again gained popularity and now as a formal clothing. Members of [[University of Tartu Folk Art Ensemble]] wearing clothes specific to Kihnu island, [[Tori Parish]] (women in red skirts) and [[T\u00f5stamaa]] area (men in brown clothing).]]\n{{Main|Textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution}}\nDuring the [[industrial revolution]], fabric production was [[mechanised]] with machines powered by [[waterwheel]]s and [[steam-engine]]s. Production shifted from small cottage based production to mass production based on assembly line organisation. Clothing production, on the other hand, continued to be made by hand.\n\n[[Sewing machine]]s emerged in the 19th century<ref>[http://inventors.about.com/cs/inventorsalphabet/a/loom_4.htm Spindel, Loom, and Needle] \u2013 History of the Textile Industry</ref> streamlining clothing production.\n\nTextiles were not only made in factories. Before this, they were made in local and national markets. Dramatic change in transportation throughout the nation is one source that encouraged the use of factories. New advances such as steamboats, canals, and railroads lowered shipping costs which caused people to buy cheap goods that were produced in other places instead of more expensive goods that were produced locally. Between 1810 and 1840, the development of a national market prompted manufacturing which tripled the output's worth. This increase in production created a change in industrial methods, such as the use of factories instead of hand made woven materials that families usually made.<ref>{{cite book|author=W. J. Rorabaugh|title=The Alcoholic Republic: An American Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AUH0vchHRIC&pg=PA129|accessdate=1 January 2012|date=17 September 1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-502990-1|pages=129\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of the people who worked in the factories were women. Women went to work in textile factories for a number of reasons. Some women left home to live on their own because of crowding at home; or to save for future marriage portions. The work enabled them to see more of the world, to earn something in anticipation of marriage, and to ease the crowding within the home. They also did it to make money for family back home. The money they sent home was to help out with the trouble some of the farmers were having. They also worked in the millhouses because they could gain a sense of independence and growth as a personal goal.<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Dublin|title=Transforming women's work: New England lives in the industrial revolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTfTKyrIGfgC&pg=PA82|accessdate=1 January 2012|date=August 1995|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8090-4|pages=82\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==20th-century developments==\n\nThe 20th century is marked by new applications for textiles as well as inventions in synthetic fibers and computerized manufacturing control systems.\n\n===Unions and education===\n\nIn the early 20th century, workers in the clothing and textile industries became [[Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union|unionized]] in the United States.

These properties may be implemented through mechanical solutions, such as different weaving and knitting patterns, by modifications to the fibers, or by finishing (textiles) of the textiles. Since the 1960s, it has been possible to finish textiles to resist stains, flames, wrinkles, and microbial life. Advancement in dye technology allowed for coloring of previously difficult-to-dye natural fibers and synthetic fibers.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\">{{cite book | title = Textiles, 12th edition | author1 = Sara J. Kadolph | author2 = Sara B. Marcketti | publisher = Pearson |date = 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Synthetic fibers===\n\nFollowing the invention of plastics by petroleum and chemical corporations, fibers could now be made synthetically. Advancements in fiber spinning actuators and control systems allow control over fiber diameter and shape, so Synthetic fibers, may be engineered with more precision than natural fibers. Fibers invented between 1930 and 1970 include nylon, PTFE, polyester, Spandex, and Kevlar. Clothing producers soon adopted synthetic fibers, often using blends of different fibers for optimized properties.<ref name=\"Kadolph2016\"/> Synthetic fibers can be knit and woven similarly to natural fibers.\n\n===Automation and numeric control===\n\nThe early 20th century continued the advances of the Industrial Revolution. In The procedural loops required for mechanized textile knitting and weaving already used logic were encoded in punch-cards and tapes. Since the machines were already computers, the invention of small-scale electronics and microcontrollers did not immediately change the possible functions of these machines. In the 1960s, existing machines became outfitted with computerized numeric control (CNC) systems, enabling more accurate and efficient actuation. In 1983, Bonas Machine Company Ltd. presented the first computer-controlled, [[Jacquard loom#Electronic Jacquard looms|electronic, Jacquard loom]].<ref>[https://www.bonas.be/en/about-us Bonas.co.uk]</ref> In 1988, the first US patent was awarded for a \"pick and place\" robot.<ref>{{cite patent | country=US | number=4872258A| pubdate=1988-09-22 | inventor=Philip A Ragard | url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US4872258A/en}}</ref> Advancements such as these changed the nature of work for machine operators, introducing computer literacy as a skill alongside machine literacy.
