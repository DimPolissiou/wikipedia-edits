However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nIn each episode, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"Influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the Influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person. Then, the day after a blocking, a video message is shown to the remaining players to reveal if they were real or fake.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nDuring the season finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and {{BRL|300000|link=yes}} ({{USD|67000}}).<ref name=\"teaser\"/>\n\n== Players ==\nA total of 14 players were selected from the \"20\u201325 individuals\" being cleared to appear on the show, with the remaining people never leaving standby status and not appearing on the show.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The players' profiles were revealed as they introduced themselves on-screen during an episode.<ref name=\"insider\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craveyoutv.com/exclusive-interview-whats-next-for-best-friend-bill-from-the-circle/|title=Exclusive Interview: What's Next for Best Friend Bill from 'The Circle'|last=Buczak|first=Lizzy|date=2020-02-25|website=CraveyouTV TV Show Recaps, TV Reviews, Spoilers, Interviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

As part of the format of the game, Ana Carla made her way to meet one of her fellow players face-to-face. She visited Dumaresq where she confronted him on calling her a catfish.\n\n*'''Game''': The next day, the players played an informal game where The Circle showed all the players an [[astrology]] chart and had the players guess what [[zodiac sign]] each of the other players were.\n\nThat night, there was a \"festa\" or party. The players all got a package at their door full of clothes they would wear to a carnival. Also in the box was ingredients and a recipe on how to make a [[caipirinha]]. Then, music was played throughout the apartments and the players started to dance. However, during the party, two twin brothers joined The Circle, playing as one player.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=House Party|url=https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062048?trackId=14277283&tctx=0%2C1%2Cb57813d8-ab51-4a8d-9ce3-7e0eace81d9a-28553664%2C%2C|series=The Circle Brazil|network=[[Netflix]]|date=11 March 2020|season=1|number=2}}</ref>\n| LineColor       = 7CA1BE\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Follow the Dance\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|11|df=yes}}\n| ShortSummary    = The twins, who were revealed to be Lucas & Marcel, played jointly as a woman named Luma. They created their profile for The Circle, and joined the party. Before viewing Lucas & Marcel's profile, the players were allowed to post their best carnival photo as a new photo on the profile. While they were posting their photos, Lucas & Marcel were able to view all the other profiles. After every player posted their carnival photo, Lucas & Marcel posted their own photo, officially revealing Lucas & Marcel to the players.\n\nWhen Lucas & Marcel's photo is shown to the players, Rob immediately comments that they are accepting of [[transgender|transgender people]] despite that neither the photos Lucas & Marcel are using, nor the description on Lucas & Marcel's profile, suggests that she would be transgender. The next day, Rob asks Lucas & Marcel if their [[birth certificate]] has male or female on it, again hinting that she is transgender. This confuses many players since they did not think she was transgender. Lucas & Marcel say she is a woman and that female is written on her birth certificate.\n*'''Game (\"Segue o Baile\", {{abbr|lit.|Literal translation in English}} \"Follow the Dance\")''': Lucas & Marcel had to perform different dance moves and the players, one at a time, had to guess which dance they were doing. The players who guessed the right dance move got coconut water and a certificate stating that they have excellent skills in recognizing dance styles.\nAfter the game, rating started. As new players, Lucas & Marcel could rate, but couldn't be rated. Lorayne and Marina were rated first and second respectively, making them Influencers.

The player who received the question could either answer the question truthfully or complete a dare produced by The Circle.\nAfter the game finished, the ratings opened. As the new player, Ray could rate the other players but could not be rated.

He began to work on ''The Circle'' after hearing that [[Channel 4]] was looking for a reality-show format centered on social media.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web |last1=Smallman |first1=Etan |title=Inside 'The Circle,' Reality TV Gets a Social Media Filter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/arts/television/the-circle-netflix.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=30 December 2019 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[The Circle (British TV series)|The British version]] of the show premiered in 2018, and was renewed for its second season a few months after the first season ended.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tutton|first1=Charlotte|title=The Circle season 2 confirmed as Channel 4 series returns with a HUGE twist|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/1541465/the-circle-season-2-channel-4-series-return-new-twists-live-episode-how-long-on-prize-money-win|website=OK!

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people. He noted how the casting contrasted from casts on show like ''[[Real Housewives]]'' or ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and how those shows are \"all one gang of quite similar characters.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> He explained how there was no set cast for the show until it was over. The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\n=== The Circle app ===\nEach apartment that the players live in is plastered with screens in every room in order for the players be able to hold conversations with other players as they go about their everyday lives. Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview 1\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, The Circle would average all the placements for each players and create an average for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe Circle Brazil was filmed in Fall 2019, after the [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version's first season]] and [[The Circle (British TV series)|the British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]].

Lucas & Marcel saved Ray and Dumaresq saved Marina.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: In Episode 9, the ratings were not published. Instead, the highest-rated player automatically became the \"superinfluencer,\" who could make the sole decision on whom to block.\n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: In Episode 10, the Influencers were not allowed to deliberate over who to block. Instead, the Influencers took turns saving other players with the player not saved being blocked from The Circle. Dumaresq, as the higher rating player, began by saving Raf, then JP saved Lucas & Marcel, and Dumaresq saved Marina. With the final selection, JP saved Ray, leaving Renan blocked from The Circle.\n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: In Episode 12, the players made their final ratings, ultimately deciding who the winner of ''The Circle Brazil'' will be.\n</small>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Netflix title|81044721}}\n* [https://www.instagram.com/thecirclebr/ @thecirclebr] on [[Instagram]]\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n{{The Circle (franchise)|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Circle Brazilian TV Series}}\n[[Category:2020 Brazilian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Brazilian reality television series]]\n[[Category:Portuguese-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Portuguese-language Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:The Circle (TV series)]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Brazilian reality television show}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name             = The Circle Brazil\n| image                 = The Circle Brazil (poster).jpeg\n| caption               = Promotional poster for the series\n| genre                 = [[Reality television|Reality competition]]\n| creative_director     = \n| presenter             = [[Giovanna Ewbank]]\n| narrated              = \n| country               = [[Brazil]]\n| theme_music_composer  = \n| opentheme             = \n| language              = Portuguese\n| num_seasons           = 1\n| num_episodes          = 12\n| executive_producer    = \n| camera                = \n| runtime               = 39\u201361 minutes\n| channel               = [[Netflix]]\n| company               = [[Studio Lambert]]\n| distributor           = \n| picture_format        = \n| audio_format          = \n| first_aired           = {{Start date|2020|3|11|df=yes}}\n| last_aired            = {{End date|2020|3|25|df=yes}}\n| related               = {{Plainlist|\n* ''[[The Circle (British TV series)|The Circle UK]]''\n* ''[[The Circle (American TV series)|The Circle US]]''\n* ''[[The Circle (French TV series)|The Circle France]]''\n}}\n| website               = https://www.thecirclecasting.com/brasil\n}}\n\n'''''The Circle Brazil''''' (also known as '''''The Circle Brasil''''' in [[Brazil]]) is a Brazilian [[Reality television|reality competition]] show, produced by [[Studio Lambert]] and Motion Content Group which will be launched on [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kogut.oglobo.globo.com/noticias-da-tv/series/noticia/2018/12/netflix-fara-versao-brasileira-do-reality-britanico-circle.html |title= Netflix far\u00e1 vers\u00e3o brasileira do reality brit\u00e2nico 'The circle' |website=[[O Globo]] |language=Portuguese |date=19 December 2018 |accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref> It premiered on 11 March 2020 and ended on 25 March as part of a three-week event.<ref name=\"teaser\">{{cite web |author1=Netflix Brasil |title=THE CIRCLE BRASIL COM GIOVANNA EWBANK \u2013 TEASER \u2013 NETFLIX BRASIL |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_59QUGpch4 |website=youtube.com |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=1 March 2020 |language=Portuguese |date=27 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> Along with ''The Circle Brazil'', Netflix also released separate versions of ''[[The Circle (franchise)|The Circle]]'' in the [[United States]] and [[France]].<ref name=\"hollywood_reporter\">{{cite web |last1=Elise Sandberg |first1=Bryn |title=Netflix to Adapt U.K. Reality Series 'The Circle' |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/netflix-adapt-uk-reality-series-circle-1150330 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=6 June 2019}}</ref> ''The Circle Brazil'' will be the first Brazilian reality TV show on Netflix.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Castro |first1=Daniel |title=Al\u00e9m de Gagliasso, Giovanna Ewbank \u00e9 contratada pela Netflix para comandar reality |url=https://noticiasdatv.uol.com.br/noticia/televisao/alem-de-gagliasso-giovanna-ewbank-e-contratada-pela-netflix-para-comandar-reality-32973 |website=noticiasdatv.uol.com.br |publisher=Not\u00edcias da TV por Daniel Castro |accessdate=1 February 2020 |language=Portuguese |date=27 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The show bills itself as a game based around social media, with the concept that \"anyone can be anyone in The Circle\".

However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nIn each episode, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"Influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the Influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person. Then, the day after a blocking, a video message is shown to the remaining players to reveal if they were real or fake.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nDuring the season finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and {{BRL|300000|link=yes}} ({{USD|67000}}).<ref name=\"teaser\"/>\n\n== Players ==\nA total of 14 players were selected from the \"20\u201325 individuals\" being cleared to appear on the show, with the remaining people never leaving standby status and not appearing on the show.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The players' profiles were revealed as they introduced themselves on-screen during an episode.<ref name=\"insider\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craveyoutv.com/exclusive-interview-whats-next-for-best-friend-bill-from-the-circle/|title=Exclusive Interview: What's Next for Best Friend Bill from 'The Circle'|last=Buczak|first=Lizzy|date=2020-02-25|website=CraveyouTV TV Show Recaps, TV Reviews, Spoilers, Interviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

As part of the format of the game, Ana Carla made her way to meet one of her fellow players face-to-face.

The players all got a package at their door full of clothes they would wear to a carnival. Also in the box was ingredients and a recipe on how to make a [[caipirinha]]. Then, music was played throughout the apartments and the players started to dance. However, during the party, two twin brothers joined The Circle, playing as one player.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=House Party|url=https://www.netflix.com/watch/81062048?trackId=14277283&tctx=0%2C1%2Cb57813d8-ab51-4a8d-9ce3-7e0eace81d9a-28553664%2C%2C|series=The Circle Brazil|network=[[Netflix]]|date=11 March 2020|season=1|number=2}}</ref>\n| LineColor       = 7CA1BE\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Follow the Dance\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|11|df=yes}}\n| ShortSummary    = The twins, who were revealed to be Lucas & Marcel, played jointly as a woman named Luma. They created their profile for The Circle, and joined the party. Before viewing Lucas & Marcel's profile, the players were allowed to post their best carnival photo as a new photo on the profile. While they were posting their photos, Lucas & Marcel were able to view all the other profiles. After every player posted their carnival photo, Lucas & Marcel posted their own photo, officially revealing Lucas & Marcel to the players.\n\nWhen Lucas & Marcel's photo is shown to the players, Rob immediately comments that they are accepting of [[transgender|transgender people]] despite that neither the photos Lucas & Marcel are using, nor the description on Lucas & Marcel's profile, suggests that she would be transgender. The next day, Rob asks Lucas & Marcel if their [[birth certificate]] has male or female on it, again hinting that she is transgender. This confuses many players since they did not think she was transgender. Lucas & Marcel say she is a woman and that female is written on her birth certificate.\n*'''Game (\"Segue o Baile\", {{abbr|lit.|Literal translation in English}} \"Follow the Dance\")''': Lucas & Marcel had to perform different dance moves and the players, one at a time, had to guess which dance they were doing. The players who guessed the right dance move got coconut water and a certificate stating that they have excellent skills in recognizing dance styles.\nAfter the game, rating started. As new players, Lucas & Marcel could rate, but couldn't be rated. Lorayne and Marina were rated first and second respectively, making them Influencers.

He was allowed to send breakfast to another female player. He chose Lorayne. After the breakfast, the newsfeed was updated with Akel's video,  in which he was revealed to be real, but admitted to lying about his age and profession. That night, there was a \"festa\" or party because Renan was the last player to enter The Circle; however, immediately after the party, the ratings opened. Renan, being the newest player, was allowed to rate the other players, but he couldn't get rated. When the ratings were supposed to be announced, The Circle revealed that the highest rated player became the Superinfluencer, so there was no need to reveal the ratings.

Harcourt wondered what a [[Reality competition|reality show]] would look like if the people never met face-to-face. He had also been considering the idea of a [[bird's-eye view]]-style documentary of an apartment building, seeing into each of their lives. He began to work on ''The Circle'' after hearing that [[Channel 4]] was looking for a reality-show format centered on social media.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web |last1=Smallman |first1=Etan |title=Inside 'The Circle,' Reality TV Gets a Social Media Filter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/arts/television/the-circle-netflix.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=30 December 2019 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[The Circle (British TV series)|The British version]] of the show premiered in 2018, and was renewed for its second season a few months after the first season ended.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tutton|first1=Charlotte|title=The Circle season 2 confirmed as Channel 4 series returns with a HUGE twist|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/1541465/the-circle-season-2-channel-4-series-return-new-twists-live-episode-how-long-on-prize-money-win|website=OK!

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people. He noted how the casting contrasted from casts on show like ''[[Real Housewives]]'' or ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and how those shows are \"all one gang of quite similar characters.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> He explained how there was no set cast for the show until it was over. The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\n=== The Circle app ===\nEach apartment that the players live in is plastered with screens in every room in order for the players be able to hold conversations with other players as they go about their everyday lives. Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview 1\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, The Circle would average all the placements for each players and create an average for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\nThe Circle Brazil was filmed in Fall 2019, after the [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version's first season]] and [[The Circle (British TV series)|the British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]].

With a traditionally poor [[power-to-weight ratio]], most diesel engines are generally unsuited for use on motorcycles which normally desire low weight, compact size, high RPMs and rapid acceleration. In the 1980s, [[NATO]] forces in Europe standardized all their vehicles to operate with diesel fuel. Some forces had fleets of motorcycles and trials were conducted with diesel engines on these. Air-cooled single-cylinder engines built by [[Lombardini S.r.l.|Lombardini]] of Italy were used and had some success.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This led to some countries re-fitting their bikes with diesel engines.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn 2005, the [[United States Marine Corps]] adopted the [[M1030M1]], an off-road motorcycle based on the [[Kawasaki KLR650]], and retrofitted it with an engine designed to run on diesel or [[JP8]] jet fuel. Since other U.S. tactical vehicles like the [[HMMWV]] utility vehicle and [[M1 Abrams]] tank  also use JP8, adopting a scout motorcycle which runs on the same fuel would ease logistics.\n\nFurther development by [[Cranfield University]] and California-based [http://www.dieselmotorcycles.com/ Hayes Diversified Technologies] led to the production of the [[Kawasaki KLR650]] based motorcycle for military use. The engine of this motorcycle is a liquid-cooled, single-cylinder four-stroke which displaces 584&nbsp;cc.\n\nIn India, motorcycles built by [[Royal Enfield Motors|Royal Enfield]] could be bought with 325&nbsp;cc single-cylinder diesel engines because [[diesel fuel]] was much cheaper than petrol (gasoline) at the time, and of more reliable quality. These engines were noisy and unrefined and not very popular because of lower performance and higher weight penalties. The engines were originally designed for use in commercial applications such as electric generators and water pumps.\n\nAs of December 2006, several companies produce diesel motorcycles.

The transmission is a [[Continuously Variable Transmission]] (CV-tech Trailbloc and Invance LV). The throttle is connected with an [[electronic throttle control]]. Dutch E.V.A. Products BV started to sell the diesel motorcycle in 2009. At the end of 2012 E.V.A. Products BV has gone into hibernation. Production has come to a halt.

However, due to pollution laws, this bike is no longer produced. Initially street mechanics were mounting this engine in used Bullets, like retro Royal Enfield Bikes, with the 350&nbsp;cc retrofit engine. On seeing the success of these bikes; Royal Enfield started manufacturing Bullets with the diesel engine and named it the Taurus.

The chassis of the Sooraj was a unique design and manufactured by Sooraj Automobiles themselves with much thicker heavier gauge than the Royal Enfield chassis. The fork angle of the Sooraj's chassis was much steeper forward than that of the Royal Enfield's, which provided comparatively better balance and turning ergonomics to the Sooraj. It used 19 inch wheels similar to the Enfield with thick wide edged mudguards along with double cam drum brakes. It was the first Motorcycle in India to come with a Self-start and Direct fuel injection Diesel engine, much before the Enfield. The Sooraj Diesel 325cc motorcycle was very strong, sturdy and reliable which gave good competition to the Royal Enfield Diesel by eating up a huge amount of Enfield's sales at the time as it was much cheaper than a Royal Enfield Diesel and more economic than an Enfield Petrol.\n\n===Hayes Diversified Technologies M1030M1===\n[[File:M1030m1.jpg|thumb|M1030M1 - Diesel Military Motorcycle]]\nAfter several years engine development at Cranfield University,<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.drive.cranfield.ac.uk/cfml/dieselmotorbike1.cfm |date=* |title=Diesel Military Motorcycle, S.

Russia|cities]] in [[Siberia]].\n\nMany distinguished Russians were sent into exile in Irkutsk for their part in the [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825, and the city became an exile-post for the rest of the century. Some of the fine wooden houses still survive, contrasting with the dominant Soviet architecture. When the railway reached Irkutsk, it had earned the nickname of \"The Paris of Siberia.\" The city saw bitter fighting in the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1918\u201320, and then became a major centre of aircraft manufacture.\n\nTrans-Siberian Highway (Federal M53 and M55 Highways) and Trans-Siberian Railway connect Irkutsk to other regions in Russia and Mongolia.\n\n==Etymology==\nIrkutsk was named after the [[Irkut River]], whose name was derived from the [[Buryat language|Buryat]] word for \"spinning\" and was used as an ethnonym among local tribes as ''Yrkhu'', ''Irkit'', ''Irgit'', and ''Irgyt''. The city was formerly known as \"Yandashsky\" after the local [[Tuvan people|Tuvan]] chief Yandasha Gorogi.<ref>Dameshek (2002), p. 16</ref>\n\nThe old spelling of the name of the city was \u00ab\u0418\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0446\u043a\u044a\u00bb. Before the revolution, the city was called \"East Paris\", \"Siberian Petersburg\", \"Siberian Athens\". Locals like to think of their city as \"middle of earth\".\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2012}}\n[[File:Irkutsk Kreml 1735.jpg|thumb|left|Irkutsk Castle in 1735]]\n\nIn 1652, Ivan Pokhabov built a ''zimovye'' (winter quarters) near the site of Irkutsk for gold trading and for the collection of [[Yasak|fur taxes]] from the [[Buryats]]. In 1661, Yakov Pokhabov built an ''[[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]'' (a small fort) nearby.<ref name=\"Lantzeff\">{{cite book|last=Lantzeff|first=George V., and Richard A.

The first road connection between [[Moscow]] and Irkutsk, the [[Siberian Route]], was built in 1760, and benefited the town economy. Many new products, often imported from [[China]] via [[Kyakhta]], became widely available in Irkutsk for the first time, including [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, [[fur]], [[wood]], [[silk]], and [[tea]]. In 1821, as part of the [[Mikhail Speransky]]'s reforms, Siberia was administratively divided at the [[Yenisei River]] and Irkutsk became the seat of the Governor-General of East Siberia.\n\n[[File:Irkutsk-club.jpg|thumb|left|Irkutsk [[Assembly of the Nobility]] in the early 1900s]]\nIn the early 19th century, many Russian artists, officers, and [[nobility|nobles]] were sent into exile in Siberia for their part in the [[Decembrist revolt]] against [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas&nbsp;I]]. Irkutsk became the major center of intellectual and social life for these exiles, and much of the city's cultural heritage comes from them; many of their wooden houses, adorned with ornate, hand-carved decorations, survive today, in stark contrast with the standard [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] apartment blocks that surround them.\n\n[[File:Irkutsk 1865.jpg|thumb|left|Epiphany Cathedral and central Irkutsk in 1865]]\nBy the end of the 19th century, there was one exiled man for every two locals. People of varying backgrounds, from members of the Decembrist uprising to [[Bolshevik]]s, had been in Irkutsk for many years and had greatly influenced the culture and development of the city. As a result, Irkutsk eventually became a prosperous cultural and educational center in [[Eastern Siberia]].\n\nIn 1879, on July&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;6, the palace of the (then) Governor General, the principal administrative and municipal offices and many of the other public buildings were destroyed by fire, and the government archives, the library and the museum of the Siberian section of the [[Russian Geographical Society]] were completely ruined.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Irkutsk (town) |display=Irkutsk|volume=14 |page=796 |inline=1}}</ref> Three-quarters of the city was destroyed, including approximately 4,000 houses.<ref name=\"Kennan\">{{cite book|last1=Kennan|first1=George|title=Siberia and the Exile System|date=1891|publisher=James R.

The first train arrived in Irkutsk on August&nbsp;16 of that year. By 1900, the city had earned the nickname of \"The [[Paris]] of Siberia.\"\n\n[[File:\u0418\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0441\u043a. \u0427\u0435\u0448\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u0418\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0435.jpg|thumb|Irkutsk in 1918]]\nDuring the [[Russian Civil War]], which broke out after the [[October Revolution]], Irkutsk became the site of many furious, bloody clashes between the \"[[White movement|Whites]]\" and the \"[[Bolsheviks|Reds]]\". In 1920, [[Aleksandr Kolchak]], the once-feared commander of the largest contingent of anti-Bolshevik forces, was executed in Irkutsk, which effectively destroyed the anti-Bolshevik resistance.\n\nIrkutsk was the administrative center of the short-lived [[East Siberian Oblast]], which existed from 1936 to 1937. The city subsequently became the administrative center of [[Irkutsk Oblast]] after East Siberian Oblast was divided into [[Chita Oblast]] and Irkutsk Oblast.\n\nDuring the communist years, the industrialization of Irkutsk and Siberia in general was heavily encouraged. The large Irkutsk Reservoir was built on the [[Angara River]] between 1950 and 1959 in order to facilitate industrial development.\n\n[[File:Church of the Epiphany (Irkutsk).jpg|thumb|left|Epiphany Cathedral (built in 1718\u20131746)]]\nThe Epiphany Cathedral, the governor's palace, a school of medicine, a museum, a military hospital and the crown factories are among the public institutions and buildings.<ref name=EB1911/> The [[Aleksandr Kolchak]] monument, designed by [[Vyacheslav Klykov]], was unveiled in 2004. On July&nbsp;27, 2004, the Irkutsk Synagogue (1881) was gutted by a conflagration.\n\nIn December 2016, 74 people in Irkutsk [[2016 Irkutsk mass methanol poisoning|died in a mass methanol poisoning]].<ref>{{cite news|title=In Russia, Dozens Dies After Drinking Alcohol Substitute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/world/europe/russia-bath-lotion-deaths.html|first=Ivan|last=Nechepurenko|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38395013 |title=Russia bath lotion poisoning: Putin orders crackdown as death toll rises |publisher=BBC |date=21 December 2016 |accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, it was reported men in Irkutsk only survive on average to 63.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46617186 |title=Putin's Russia: Icy Siberia reveals cracks in society |author=Sarah Rainsford |date=29 December 2018 |website=BBC.com |access-date=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nIrkutsk is located about {{convert|850|km|mi}} to the south-east of [[Krasnoyarsk]], and about {{convert|520|km|mi}} north of [[Ulaanbaatar]], the capital of [[Mongolia]]. The city proper lies on the [[Angara River]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], {{convert|72|km|sp=us}} below its outflow from [[Lake Baikal]] and on the bank opposite the suburb of Glaskovsk.<ref name=EB1911/> The river, {{convert|580|m|adj=on|sp=us}} wide, is crossed by the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Dam and three other bridges downstream.\n\nThe [[Irkut River]], from which the town takes its name, is a smaller river that joins the Angara directly opposite the city.<ref name=EB1911/> The main portion of the city is separated from several landmarks\u2014the monastery, the fort and the port, as well as its suburbs\u2014by another tributary, the Ida (or Ushakovka) River. The two main parts of Irkutsk are customarily referred to as the \"left bank\" and the \"right bank\", with respect to the flow of the Angara River.\n\nIrkutsk is situated in a landscape of rolling hills within the thick [[taiga]] that is typical in Eastern Siberia.\n\nThe population has been shrinking: {{ru-census|p2010=587,891|p2002=593,604|p1989=622,301}}. According to the regional plan, Irkutsk city will be combined with its neighboring industrial towns of [[Shelekhov]] and [[Angarsk]] to form a metropolitan area with a total population of over a million.\n\n===Climate===\nIrkutsk originally had a borderline [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dwc''). Since 2000, the temperatures have resembled a [[humid continental climate]] (K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Dwb''). Snow cover disappeared earlier, from late April in the 1930s to late March in the 1980s. Discontinuous permafrost depth had decreased from 200&nbsp;m to 100&nbsp;m during the same period.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIrkutsk is characterized by an extreme variation of temperatures between seasons. It can be very warm in the summer, and very cold in the winter. However, Lake Baikal has a tempering effect thanks to which temperatures in Irkutsk are not as extreme as elsewhere in Siberia. The warmest month of the year is July, when the average temperature is {{convert|+18|C}}, the highest temperature recorded being {{convert|+37.2|C}}. The coldest month of the year is January, when the average temperature is {{convert|\u221218|C}}, and record low of {{convert|\u221249.7|C}}. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] also varies widely throughout the year, with July also being the wettest month, when precipitation averages {{convert|113|mm|sp=us}}. The driest month is February, when precipitation averages only {{convert|7.6|mm|sp=us}}. Almost all precipitation during the Siberian winter falls as flurry, dry snow.\n\n{{Weather box|location=Irkutsk (normals 1981\u20132010)\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|Jan record high

arms]]\n[[File:Fountain Kirov's square 01.jpg|thumb|A fountain in Kirov Square]]\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] of Irkutsk features an old symbol of [[Transbaikal|Dauria]]: a [[Siberian tiger]] with a [[sable]] in his mouth. When the coat of arms was devised in 1690, the animal was described as a tiger (\"babr\", a bookish word of Persian derivation) with a [[sable]] in his mouth. This image had been used by the [[Yakutsk]] customs office from about 1642. It has its origin in a seal of the [[Siberia Khanate]] representing a sable and showcasing the fact that Siberia (or rather [[Yugra]]) was the main source of sable fur throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. (Actually, the English word \"sable\" is derived from the Russian \"sobol\").\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the word \"babr\" had fallen out of common usage, but it was still recorded in the [[Armorial of the Russian Empire]]. Furthermore, the tigers became extinct in this part of Siberia. In the 1870s, a high-placed French heraldist with a limited command of Russian assumed that \"babr\" was a misspelling of \"bobr\", the Russian word for \"[[beaver]]\", and changed the wording accordingly. This modification engendered a long dispute between the local authorities, who were so confused by the revised description that they started to depict the \"babr\" as a fabulous animal, half-tiger and half-beaver.\n\nThe Soviets abolished the image altogether, but it was restored following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n==Economy==\n===Energy===\nThe 662.4 MW [[Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station]] was the first cascade hydroelectric power station in the Irkutsk region.

Russia|cities]] in [[Siberia]].\n\nMany distinguished Russians were sent into exile in Irkutsk for their part in the [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825, and the city became an exile-post for the rest of the century. Some of the fine wooden houses still survive, contrasting with the dominant Soviet architecture. When the railway reached Irkutsk, it had earned the nickname of \"The Paris of Siberia.\" The city saw bitter fighting in the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1918\u201320, and then became a major centre of aircraft manufacture.\n\nTrans-Siberian Highway (Federal M53 and M55 Highways) and Trans-Siberian Railway connect Irkutsk to other regions in Russia and Mongolia.\n\n==Etymology==\nIrkutsk was named after the [[Irkut River]], whose name was derived from the [[Buryat language|Buryat]] word for \"spinning\" and was used as an ethnonym among local tribes as ''Yrkhu'', ''Irkit'', ''Irgit'', and ''Irgyt''. The city was formerly known as \"Yandashsky\" after the local [[Tuvan people|Tuvan]] chief Yandasha Gorogi.<ref>Dameshek (2002), p. 16</ref>\n\nThe old spelling of the name of the city was \u00ab\u0418\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0446\u043a\u044a\u00bb. Before the revolution, the city was called \"East Paris\", \"Siberian Petersburg\", \"Siberian Athens\". Locals like to think of their city as \"middle of earth\".\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2012}}\n[[File:Irkutsk Kreml 1735.jpg|thumb|left|Irkutsk Castle in 1735]]\n\nIn 1652, Ivan Pokhabov built a ''zimovye'' (winter quarters) near the site of Irkutsk for gold trading and for the collection of [[Yasak|fur taxes]] from the [[Buryats]]. In 1661, Yakov Pokhabov built an ''[[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]'' (a small fort) nearby.<ref name=\"Lantzeff\">{{cite book|last=Lantzeff|first=George V., and Richard A. Pierce|title=Eastward to Empire: Exploration and Conquest on the Russian Open Frontier, to 1750|publisher=McGill-Queen's U.P.|year=1973|location=Montreal}}</ref> The ''ostrog'' gained official town rights from the government in 1686. The first road connection between [[Moscow]] and Irkutsk, the [[Siberian Route]], was built in 1760, and benefited the town economy. Many new products, often imported from [[China]] via [[Kyakhta]], became widely available in Irkutsk for the first time, including [[gold]], [[diamond]]s, [[fur]], [[wood]], [[silk]], and [[tea]]. In 1821, as part of the [[Mikhail Speransky]]'s reforms, Siberia was administratively divided at the [[Yenisei River]] and Irkutsk became the seat of the Governor-General of East Siberia.\n\n[[File:Irkutsk-club.jpg|thumb|left|Irkutsk [[Assembly of the Nobility]] in the early 1900s]]\nIn the early 19th century, many Russian artists, officers, and [[nobility|nobles]] were sent into exile in Siberia for their part in the [[Decembrist revolt]] against [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas&nbsp;I]]. Irkutsk became the major center of intellectual and social life for these exiles, and much of the city's cultural heritage comes from them; many of their wooden houses, adorned with ornate, hand-carved decorations, survive today, in stark contrast with the standard [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] apartment blocks that surround them.\n\n[[File:Irkutsk 1865.jpg|thumb|left|Epiphany Cathedral and central Irkutsk in 1865]]\nBy the end of the 19th century, there was one exiled man for every two locals. People of varying backgrounds, from members of the Decembrist uprising to [[Bolshevik]]s, had been in Irkutsk for many years and had greatly influenced the culture and development of the city. As a result, Irkutsk eventually became a prosperous cultural and educational center in [[Eastern Siberia]].\n\nIn 1879, on July&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;6, the palace of the (then) Governor General, the principal administrative and municipal offices and many of the other public buildings were destroyed by fire, and the government archives, the library and the museum of the Siberian section of the [[Russian Geographical Society]] were completely ruined.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Irkutsk (town) |display=Irkutsk|volume=14 |page=796 |inline=1}}</ref> Three-quarters of the city was destroyed, including approximately 4,000 houses.<ref name=\"Kennan\">{{cite book|last1=Kennan|first1=George|title=Siberia and the Exile System|date=1891|publisher=James R.

The first train arrived in Irkutsk on August&nbsp;16 of that year. By 1900, the city had earned the nickname of \"The [[Paris]] of Siberia.\"\n\n[[File:\u0418\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0441\u043a. \u0427\u0435\u0448\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u0418\u0440\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0435.jpg|thumb|Irkutsk in 1918]]\nDuring the [[Russian Civil War]], which broke out after the [[October Revolution]], Irkutsk became the site of many furious, bloody clashes between the \"[[White movement|Whites]]\" and the \"[[Bolsheviks|Reds]]\". In 1920, [[Aleksandr Kolchak]], the once-feared commander of the largest contingent of anti-Bolshevik forces, was executed in Irkutsk, which effectively destroyed the anti-Bolshevik resistance.\n\nIrkutsk was the administrative center of the short-lived [[East Siberian Oblast]], which existed from 1936 to 1937. The city subsequently became the administrative center of [[Irkutsk Oblast]] after East Siberian Oblast was divided into [[Chita Oblast]] and Irkutsk Oblast.\n\nDuring the communist years, the industrialization of Irkutsk and Siberia in general was heavily encouraged. The large Irkutsk Reservoir was built on the [[Angara River]] between 1950 and 1959 in order to facilitate industrial development.\n\n[[File:Church of the Epiphany (Irkutsk).jpg|thumb|left|Epiphany Cathedral (built in 1718\u20131746)]]\nThe Epiphany Cathedral, the governor's palace, a school of medicine, a museum, a military hospital and the crown factories are among the public institutions and buildings.<ref name=EB1911/> The [[Aleksandr Kolchak]] monument, designed by [[Vyacheslav Klykov]], was unveiled in 2004. On July&nbsp;27, 2004, the Irkutsk Synagogue (1881) was gutted by a conflagration.\n\nIn December 2016, 74 people in Irkutsk [[2016 Irkutsk mass methanol poisoning|died in a mass methanol poisoning]].<ref>{{cite news|title=In Russia, Dozens Dies After Drinking Alcohol Substitute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/world/europe/russia-bath-lotion-deaths.html|first=Ivan|last=Nechepurenko|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 December 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38395013 |title=Russia bath lotion poisoning: Putin orders crackdown as death toll rises |publisher=BBC |date=21 December 2016 |accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, it was reported men in Irkutsk only survive on average to 63.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46617186 |title=Putin's Russia: Icy Siberia reveals cracks in society |author=Sarah Rainsford |date=29 December 2018 |website=BBC.com |access-date=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nIrkutsk is located about {{convert|850|km|mi}} to the south-east of [[Krasnoyarsk]], and about {{convert|520|km|mi}} north of [[Ulaanbaatar]], the capital of [[Mongolia]]. The city proper lies on the [[Angara River]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], {{convert|72|km|sp=us}} below its outflow from [[Lake Baikal]] and on the bank opposite the suburb of Glaskovsk.<ref name=EB1911/> The river, {{convert|580|m|adj=on|sp=us}} wide, is crossed by the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Dam and three other bridges downstream.\n\nThe [[Irkut River]], from which the town takes its name, is a smaller river that joins the Angara directly opposite the city.<ref name=EB1911/> The main portion of the city is separated from several landmarks\u2014the monastery, the fort and the port, as well as its suburbs\u2014by another tributary, the Ida (or Ushakovka) River. The two main parts of Irkutsk are customarily referred to as the \"left bank\" and the \"right bank\", with respect to the flow of the Angara River.\n\nIrkutsk is situated in a landscape of rolling hills within the thick [[taiga]] that is typical in Eastern Siberia.\n\nThe population has been shrinking: {{ru-census|p2010=587,891|p2002=593,604|p1989=622,301}}. According to the regional plan, Irkutsk city will be combined with its neighboring industrial towns of [[Shelekhov]] and [[Angarsk]] to form a metropolitan area with a total population of over a million.\n\n===Climate===\nIrkutsk originally had a borderline [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dwc''). Since 2000, the temperatures have resembled a [[humid continental climate]] (K\u00f6ppen climate classification ''Dwb''). Snow cover disappeared earlier, from late April in the 1930s to late March in the 1980s. Discontinuous permafrost depth had decreased from 200&nbsp;m to 100&nbsp;m during the same period.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIrkutsk is characterized by an extreme variation of temperatures between seasons. It can be very warm in the summer, and very cold in the winter. However, Lake Baikal has a tempering effect thanks to which temperatures in Irkutsk are not as extreme as elsewhere in Siberia. The warmest month of the year is July, when the average temperature is {{convert|+18|C}}, the highest temperature recorded being {{convert|+37.2|C}}. The coldest month of the year is January, when the average temperature is {{convert|\u221218|C}}, and record low of {{convert|\u221249.7|C}}. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] also varies widely throughout the year, with July also being the wettest month, when precipitation averages {{convert|113|mm|sp=us}}. The driest month is February, when precipitation averages only {{convert|7.6|mm|sp=us}}. Almost all precipitation during the Siberian winter falls as flurry, dry snow.\n\n{{Weather box|location=Irkutsk (normals 1981\u20132010)\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|Jan record high

arms]]\n[[File:Fountain Kirov's square 01.jpg|thumb|A fountain in Kirov Square]]\n\nThe [[coat of arms]] of Irkutsk features an old symbol of [[Transbaikal|Dauria]]: a [[Siberian tiger]] with a [[sable]] in his mouth. When the coat of arms was devised in 1690, the animal was described as a tiger (\"babr\", a bookish word of Persian derivation) with a [[sable]] in his mouth. This image had been used by the [[Yakutsk]] customs office from about 1642. It has its origin in a seal of the [[Siberia Khanate]] representing a sable and showcasing the fact that Siberia (or rather [[Yugra]]) was the main source of sable fur throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. (Actually, the English word \"sable\" is derived from the Russian \"sobol\").\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the word \"babr\" had fallen out of common usage, but it was still recorded in the [[Armorial of the Russian Empire]]. Furthermore, the tigers became extinct in this part of Siberia. In the 1870s, a high-placed French heraldist with a limited command of Russian assumed that \"babr\" was a misspelling of \"bobr\", the Russian word for \"[[beaver]]\", and changed the wording accordingly. This modification engendered a long dispute between the local authorities, who were so confused by the revised description that they started to depict the \"babr\" as a fabulous animal, half-tiger and half-beaver.\n\nThe Soviets abolished the image altogether, but it was restored following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n==Economy==\n===Energy===\nThe 662.4 MW [[Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station]] was the first cascade hydroelectric power station in the Irkutsk region.

The first European-American settler was Thomas Kirkpatrick, who came in 1805, laid out a community, and served as the Justice of the Peace. He named the community after his friend [[Ninian Edwards]],<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

It is was purchased by Champaign, Illinois-based [[Busey Bank]] in 2019.\n\nIn 1890, St. Louis industrialist N.O. Nelson chose a tract of land just south of Edwardsville to build plumbing factories. He also built a model workers' cooperative village called [[LeClaire Historic District|Leclaire]]. He offered workers fair wages with reasonable working hours and a share of the profits. He named the village in honor of the French economist [[Edme-Jean Leclaire]]. The village also provided educational and recreational opportunities and made it financially possible for anyone to own his own home. Unlike company towns such as Pullman near Chicago, the welfare and quality of life for the workers and their families was a major concern.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Reinhardt | first1 = Cindy | year = 2009 | title = The cooperative village of Leclaire, 1890-1934 | url = | journal = Illinois Heritage | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 11\u201313 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the Village of Leclaire was incorporated into the City of Edwardsville. The area has a lake and park, baseball field, and the Edwardsville Children's Museum in the former Leclaire schoolhouse. Several Nelson factory buildings were renovated and adapted for use as the historic N. O. Nelson Campus of [[Lewis and Clark Community College]]. The recognized Historic District has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nEach year on the third Sunday in October, the Friends of Leclaire host the annual Leclaire Parkfest with food, live heritage music, historic displays & tours, artisans, children's activities, a book sale, and more.\n\nIn 1983, Edwardsville's historic Saint Louis Street was also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Dating back to 1809, this Historic District has a mile-long visual landscape. More than 50 historic homes date from the middle 19th century to early 20th century. The protection and preservation of Saint Louis Street is overseen by the [[Historic Saint Louis Street Association]].\n\nFive Illinois governors came from Edwardsville: namesake Ninian Edwards, who became a territorial governor in 1809 and later served as governor from 1826\u20131830; [[Edward Coles]], elected in 1822 and a strong opponent of [[slavery]]; [[John Reynolds (Illinois politician)|John Reynolds]], governor from 1830 to 1834; [[Thomas Ford (politician)|Thomas Ford]], governor from 1842\u20131846; and [[Charles Deneen]], governor from 1909 to 1913.<ref name=test>[http://www.cityofedwardsville.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7B15BE8CDF-3B28-4D2C-8273-849C0954800F%7D Edwardsville web site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926005731/http://www.cityofedwardsville.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7B15BE8CDF-3B28-4D2C-8273-849C0954800F%7D |date=2007-09-26 }}, additional text.</ref>\n\nFormer president [[Abraham Lincoln]] was in Edwardsville twice, as an attorney in the 1814 courthouse and a speaker outside the 1857 courthouse on Sept. 11, 1858.

He named the community after his friend [[Ninian Edwards]],<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

It is was purchased by Champaign, Illinois-based [[Busey Bank]] in 2019.\n\nIn 1890, St. Louis industrialist N.O. Nelson chose a tract of land just south of Edwardsville to build plumbing factories. He also built a model workers' cooperative village called [[LeClaire Historic District|Leclaire]]. He offered workers fair wages with reasonable working hours and a share of the profits. He named the village in honor of the French economist [[Edme-Jean Leclaire]]. The village also provided educational and recreational opportunities and made it financially possible for anyone to own his own home. Unlike company towns such as Pullman near Chicago, the welfare and quality of life for the workers and their families was a major concern.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Reinhardt | first1 = Cindy | year = 2009 | title = The cooperative village of Leclaire, 1890-1934 | url = | journal = Illinois Heritage | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 11\u201313 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the Village of Leclaire was incorporated into the City of Edwardsville. The area has a lake and park, baseball field, and the Edwardsville Children's Museum in the former Leclaire schoolhouse. Several Nelson factory buildings were renovated and adapted for use as the historic N. O. Nelson Campus of [[Lewis and Clark Community College]].

The war erupted soon after Black Hawk and a group of Sauks, [[Meskwaki]]s, and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoos]], known as the \"[[British Band]]\", crossed the [[Mississippi River]], into the U.S. state of [[Illinois]], from [[Iowa|Iowa Indian Territory]] in April 1832. Black Hawk's motives were ambiguous, but he was apparently hoping to avoid bloodshed while resettling on tribal land that had been ceded to the United States in the disputed 1804 [[Treaty of St. Louis (1804)|Treaty of St. Louis]].\n\nU.S. officials, convinced that the British Band was hostile, mobilized a frontier [[Militia in the United States|militia]] and opened fire on a delegation from the Native Americans on May 14, 1832. Black Hawk responded by successfully attacking the militia at the [[Battle of Stillman's Run]]. He led his band to a secure location in what is now southern [[Wisconsin]] and was pursued by U.S. forces. Meanwhile, other Native Americans conducted raids against forts and settlements largely unprotected with the absence of U.S. troops. Some [[Ho-Chunk]] and [[Potawatomi]] warriors with grievances against [[European-Americans]] took part in these raids, although most tribe members tried to avoid the conflict. The [[Menominee]] and [[Sioux|Dakota]] tribes, already at odds with the Sauks and Meskwakis, supported the U.S.\n\nCommanded by General [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]], the U.S. troops tracked the British Band. Militia under Colonel [[Henry Dodge]] caught up with the British Band on July 21 and defeated them at the [[Battle of Wisconsin Heights]]. Black Hawk's band was weakened by hunger, death, and desertion and many native survivors retreated towards the Mississippi. On August 2, U.S. soldiers attacked the remnants of the British Band at the [[Battle of Bad Axe]], killing many and capturing most who remained alive. Black Hawk and other leaders escaped, but later surrendered and were imprisoned for a year.\n\nThe Black Hawk War gave the young captain [[Abraham Lincoln]] his [[Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War|brief military service]], although he never saw combat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://southernhistorians.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Understanding-the-WBTS-Compiled-Download-Website-Oct-2015.pdf|title=Understanding the war between the States - Chapter 24}}</ref> Other participants who later became famous included [[Winfield Scott]], [[Zachary Taylor]], and [[Jefferson Davis]]. The war gave impetus to the U.S. policy of [[Indian removal]], in which Native American tribes were pressured to sell their lands and move west of the Mississippi River and stay there.\n\n==Background==\nIn the 18th century, the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] (or Fox) [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes lived along the [[Mississippi River]] in what are now the U.S. states of [[Illinois]] and [[Iowa]]. The two tribes had become closely connected after having been displaced from the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] in conflicts with [[New France]] and other Native American tribes, particularly after the so-called [[Fox Wars]] ended in the 1730s.<ref>Hall, 21\u201326; Jung, 13\u201314; Trask, 29.</ref> By the time of the Black Hawk War, the population of the two tribes was about 6,000 people.<ref>Jung, 14; Trask, 64.</ref>\n\n===Disputed treaty===\n[[File:Stlouistreatymap1804.png|thumb|The land ceded to the United States in the 1804 [[Treaty of St. Louis (1804)|Treaty of St. Louis]] is shown here in yellow.]]\n\nAs the United States expanded westward in the early 19th century, government officials sought to buy as much Native American land as possible. In 1804, [[Indiana Territory|territorial governor]] [[William Henry Harrison]] negotiated a [[Treaty of St. Louis (1804)|treaty in St. Louis]] in which a group of Sauk and Meskwaki leaders supposedly sold their lands east of the Mississippi for more than $2,200, in goods and annual payments of $1,000 in goods. The treaty became controversial because the Native leaders had not been authorized by their tribal councils to cede lands. Historian Robert Owens argued that the chiefs probably did not intend to give up ownership of the land, and that they would not have sold so much valuable territory for such a modest price.<ref>Owens, 87\u201390.</ref> Historian Patrick Jung concluded that the Sauk and Meskwaki chiefs intended to cede a little land, but that the Americans included more territory in the treaty's language than the Natives realized.<ref>Jung, 21\u201322.</ref> According to Jung, the Sauks and Meskwakis did not learn the true extent of the cession until years later.<ref>Jung, 32.</ref>\n\nThe 1804 treaty allowed the tribes to continue using the ceded land until it was sold to American settlers by the U.S. government.<ref>Trask, 72.</ref> For the next two decades, Sauks continued to live at [[Saukenuk]], their primary village, which was located near the confluence of the Mississippi and [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock Rivers]].<ref>Trask, 28\u201329.</ref> In 1828, the U.S. government finally began to have the ceded land surveyed for white settlement. [[Indian agent]] [[Thomas Forsyth (Indian agent)|Thomas Forsyth]] informed the Sauks that they should vacate Saukenuk and their other settlements east of the Mississippi.<ref>Trask, 70; Jung, 52\u201353.</ref>\n\n===Sauks divided===\nThe Sauks were divided about whether to resist implementation of the disputed 1804 treaty.<ref>Jung, 52.</ref> Most Sauks decided to relocate west of the Mississippi rather than become involved in a confrontation with the United States. The leader of this group was [[Keokuk (Sauk leader)|Keokuk]], who had helped defend Saukenuk against the Americans during the [[War of 1812]]. Keokuk was not a chief, but as a skilled orator, he often spoke on behalf of the Sauk civil chiefs in negotiations with the Americans.<ref>Jung, 55.</ref> Keokuk regarded the 1804 treaty as a fraud, but after having seen the size of American cities on the east coast in 1824, he did not think the Sauks could successfully oppose the United States.<ref>Jung, 54\u201355; Nichols, 78.</ref>\n\nAlthough the majority of the tribe decided to follow Keokuk's lead, about 800 Sauks\u2014roughly one-sixth of the tribe\u2014chose instead to resist American expansion.<ref name=\"Jung, 56\">Jung, 56.</ref> [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], a war captain who had fought against the United States in the War of 1812 and was now in his 60s, emerged as the leader of this faction in 1829.<ref>Jung, 53.</ref> Like Keokuk, Black Hawk was not a civil chief, but he became Keokuk's primary rival for influence within the tribe. Black Hawk had actually signed a treaty in May 1816 that affirmed the disputed 1804 land cession, but he insisted that what had been written down was different from what had been spoken at the treaty conference. According to Black Hawk, the \"whites were in the habit of saying one thing to the Indians and putting another thing down on paper.\"<ref>Jung, 53; Trask, 73.</ref>\n\n[[File:Keokuk1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Native American chief in regalia|Keokuk by [[George Catlin]], c. 1830s]]\n\nBlack Hawk was determined to hold onto Saukenuk, a village at the confluence of the Rock River with the Mississippi, where he lived and had been born. When the Sauks returned to the village in 1829 after their annual winter hunt in the west, they found that it had been occupied by white squatters who were anticipating the sale of land.<ref>Hall, 90; Trask, 71.</ref> After months of clashes with the squatters, the Sauks left in September 1829 for the next winter hunt. Hoping to avoid further confrontations, Keokuk told Forsyth that he and his followers would not return to Saukenuk.<ref>Trask, 79.</ref>\n\nAgainst the advice of Keokuk and Forsyth, Black Hawk's faction returned to Saukenuk in the spring of 1830.<ref>Jung, 59.</ref> This time, they were joined by more than 200 [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoos]], a people who had often allied with the Sauks.<ref>Jung, 47, 58.</ref> Black Hawk and his followers became known as the \"[[British Band]]\" because they sometimes flew a British flag to defy claims of U.S. sovereignty, and because they hoped to gain the support of the British at [[Fort Malden]] in Canada.<ref>Hall, 90, 127; Jung, 56.</ref>\n[[File:Black Hawk 1831 newspaper.jpg|thumb|Newspaper account of the alarm caused by Sauk returning to [[Saukenuk]], ''Washington National Intelligencer'', June 13, 1831]]\nWhen the British Band once again returned to Saukenuk in 1831, Black Hawk's following had grown to about 1,500 people, and now included some [[Potawatomi]]s,<ref>Jung, 60.</ref> a people with close ties to the Sauks and Meskwakis.<ref>Edmunds, 235\u201336.</ref> American officials determined to force the British Band out of the state. General [[Edmund P. Gaines]], commander of the Western Department of the [[United States Army]], assembled troops with the hope of intimidating Black Hawk into leaving. The army had no cavalry to pursue the Sauks should they flee further into Illinois on horseback, and so on June 5 Gaines requested that the state [[Militia in the United States|militia]] provide a mounted battalion.<ref>Eby, 83\u201386.</ref> Illinois governor [[John Reynolds (Illinois politician)|John Reynolds]] had already alerted the militia; about 1,500 volunteers turned out.<ref>Eby, 88; Jung, 62.</ref> Meanwhile, Keokuk convinced many of Black Hawk's followers to leave Illinois.<ref>Jung, 62.</ref>\n\nOn June 25, 1831, Gaines sent troops to [[Vandruff Island]] across from Saukenuk. The island had been named for a farmer and trader who operated a ferry, as well as sold liquor to the natives, which had previously prompted a raid by Black Hawk to destroy the whiskey.<ref>http://www.rockislandpreservation.org/postcards-from-home/view-of-vandruff-island-from-black-hawk-tower/</ref> This time, underbrush had grown to impede the militiamen from landing, so the next day the militia tried to assault Saukenuk itself, only to find that Black Hawk and his followers had abandoned the village and recrossed the Mississippi.<ref>Eby, 88\u201389; Jung, 63; Trask, 102.</ref> On June 30, Black Hawk, [[Quashquame]], and other Sauk leaders met with Gaines and signed an agreement in which the Sauks promised to remain west of the Mississippi and to break off further contact with the British in Canada.<ref>Jung, 64; Trask, 105.</ref>\n\n==Black Hawk's return==\nBlack Hawk did not remain west of the Mississippi for long. In late 1831, [[Neapope]], a Sauk civil chief, returned from Fort Malden and told Black Hawk that the British and the other Illinois tribes were prepared to support the Sauks against the United States. Why Neapope made these claims, which would prove to be unfounded, is unclear. Historians have described Neapope's report to Black Hawk as \"wishful thinking\"<ref>Hall, 116.</ref> and the product of a \"fertile imagination\".<ref name=\"Jung, 66\">Jung, 66.</ref> Black Hawk welcomed the information, though he would later criticize Neapope for misleading him. He spent the winter in an unsuccessful attempt to recruit additional allies from other tribes and from Keokuk's followers.<ref>Jung, 69; Hall, 116.</ref>\n\nAccording to Neapope's erroneous report, [[Wabokieshiek]] (\"White Cloud\"), a shaman known to Americans as the \"Winnebago Prophet\", had claimed that other tribes were ready to support Black Hawk.<ref name=\"Jung, 66\"/> Wabokieshiek's mother was a [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago), but his father had belonged to a Sauk clan that provided the tribe's civil leaders. When Wabokieshiek joined the British Band in 1832, he would become the ranking Sauk civil chief in the group.<ref>Jung, 74.</ref> His village, [[Prophetstown, Illinois|Prophetstown]], was about thirty-five miles up the Rock River from Saukenuk.<ref>Trask, 63, 69.</ref> The village was inhabited by about 200<ref name=\"Jung, 56\"/> Ho-Chunks, Sauks, Meskwakis, Kickapoos, and Potawatomis who were dissatisfied with tribal leaders who refused to stand up to American expansion.<ref>Dowd, 193; Hall, 110.</ref> Although some Americans would later characterize Wabokieshiek as a primary instigator of the Black Hawk War, the Winnebago Prophet, according to historian John Hall, \"actually discouraged his followers from resorting to armed conflict with the whites\".<ref>Hall, 110.</ref>\n\nOn April 5, 1832, the British Band entered Illinois once again.<ref>Jung, 74; Hall, 116; Trask, 145, gives a more general date of \"probably April 6\".</ref> Numbering about 500 warriors and 600 non-combatants, they crossed near the mouth of the [[Iowa River]] over to Yellow Banks (present-day [[Oquawka, Illinois]]), and then headed north.<ref>Jung, 74\u201375; Trask, 145.</ref> Black Hawk's intentions upon reentering Illinois are not entirely clear, since reports from both white and Indian sources are conflicting. Some said that the British Band intended to reoccupy Saukenuk, while others said that the destination was Prophetstown.<ref>Trask, 149\u201350; Hall, 129\u201330.</ref> According to historian Kerry Trask, \"even Black Hawk may not have been sure where they were going and what they intended to do\".<ref>Trask, 150.</ref>\n\nAs the British Band moved into Illinois, American officials urged Wabokieshiek to advise Black Hawk to turn back. Previously, the Winnebago Prophet had encouraged Black Hawk to come to Prophetstown, arguing that the 1831 agreement made with General Gaines prohibited a return to Saukenuk, but did not  forbid the Sauks from moving to Prophetstown.<ref>Jung, 73; Trask, 146\u201347.</ref> Now, instead of telling Black Hawk to turn back, Wabokieshiek told him that, as long as the British Band remained peaceful, the Americans would have no choice but to let them settle at Prophetstown, especially if the British and the area tribes supported the band.<ref>Hall, 110; Jung, 73.</ref> Although the British Band traveled with armed guards as a security precaution, Black Hawk was probably hoping to avoid a war when he reentered Illinois. The presence of women, children, and the elderly indicated that the band was not a war party.<ref>Eby, 35; Jung, 74\u201375.</ref>\n\n==Intertribal war and American policy==\nAlthough the return of Black Hawk's band worried U.S. officials, they were at the time more concerned about the possibility of a war among the Native American tribes in the region.<ref>Jung 50, 70; Hall, 99\u2013100.</ref> Most accounts of the Black Hawk War focus on the conflict between Black Hawk and the United States, but historian John Hall argues that this overlooks the perspective of many Native American participants. According to Hall, \"the Black Hawk War also involved an intertribal conflict that had smoldered for decades\".<ref>Hall, 9.</ref> Tribes along the Upper Mississippi had long fought for control of diminishing hunting grounds, and the Black Hawk War provided an opportunity for some Natives to resume a war that had nothing to do with Black Hawk.<ref>Hall, 100.</ref>\n\nAfter having displaced the British as the dominant outside power following the War of 1812, the United States had assumed the role of mediator in intertribal disputes. Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal warfare. This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare made it more difficult for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as [[Indian removal]], which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s.<ref>Hall, 55, 95; Buckley, 165.</ref> U.S. efforts at mediation included multi-tribal treaty councils at [[Prairie du Chien]] in [[First Treaty of Prairie du Chien|1825]] and [[Fourth Treaty of Prairie du Chien|1830]], in which tribal boundaries were drawn.<ref>Buckley, 172\u201375; Hall, 77\u201378, 100\u201302.</ref> Native Americans sometimes resented American mediation, especially young men, for whom warfare was an important avenue of social advancement.<ref>Hall, 9, 24, 55, 237.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort armstrong.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fort Armstrong, Illinois|Fort Armstrong]] was located on Rock Island, which is now known as [[Rock Island Arsenal|Arsenal Island]]. The view is from the Illinois side, with Iowa in the background.]]\n\nThe situation was complicated by the American [[spoils system]]. After [[Andrew Jackson]] assumed the [[President of the United States|U.S. presidency]] in March 1829, many competent [[Indian agent]]s were replaced by unqualified Jackson loyalists, argues historian John Hall. Men like [[Thomas Forsyth (Indian agent)|Thomas Forsyth]], [[John Marsh (pioneer)|John Marsh]], and [[Thomas McKenney]] were replaced by less qualified men such as [[Felix St. Vrain]]. In the 19th century, historian [[Lyman Draper]] argued that the Black Hawk War could have been avoided had Forsyth remained as the agent to the Sauks.<ref>Hall, 103\u201304. Eby, 79, echoed the argument.</ref>\n\nIn 1830, violence threatened to undo American attempts at preventing intertribal warfare. In May, Dakotas ([[Santee Sioux]]) and [[Menominee]]s killed fifteen Meskwakis attending a treaty conference at Prairie du Chien. In retaliation, a party of Meskwakis and Sauks killed twenty-six Menominees, including women and children, at Prairie du Chien in July 1831.<ref>Jung, 49; Hall, 111.</ref> American officials discouraged the Menominees from seeking revenge, but the western bands of the tribe formed a coalition with the Dakotas to strike at the Sauks and Meskwakis.<ref>Hall, 113\u201315.</ref>\n\nHoping to prevent the outbreak of a wider war, American officials ordered the U.S. Army to arrest the Meskwakis who massacred the Menominees.<ref>Hall, 115; Jung, 49\u201350.</ref> General Gaines was ill, and so his subordinate, Brigadier General [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]], received the assignment.<ref>Hall, 115; Jung, 70.</ref> Atkinson was a middle-aged officer who had ably handled administrative and diplomatic tasks, most notably during the 1827 [[Winnebago War]], but he had never seen combat.<ref>Hall, 115; Jung, 71\u201372; Trask, 143.</ref> On April 8, he set out from [[Jefferson Barracks]] in Missouri, moving up the Mississippi River by steamboat with about 220 soldiers. By chance, Black Hawk and his British Band had just crossed into Illinois. Although Atkinson did not realize it, his boats passed Black Hawk's band.<ref>Trask, 146.</ref>\n\nWhen Atkinson arrived at [[Fort Armstrong, Illinois|Fort Armstrong]] on [[Rock Island Arsenal|Rock Island]] on April 12, he learned that the British Band was in Illinois, and that most of the Meskwakis he wanted to arrest were now with the band.<ref>Hall, 117; Jung, 75.</ref> Like other American officials, Atkinson was convinced that the British Band intended to start a war. Because he had few troops at his disposal, Atkinson hoped to get support from the Illinois state militia. He wrote to Governor Reynolds on April 13, describing\u2014and perhaps purposely exaggerating\u2014the threat that the British Band posed.<ref>Jung, 76; Trask, 158\u201359.</ref> Reynolds, who was eager for a war to drive the Indians out of the state, responded as Atkinson had hoped: he called for militia volunteers to assemble at [[Beardstown, Illinois|Beardstown]] by April 22 to begin a thirty-day enlistment. The 2,100 men who volunteered were organized into a brigade of five regiments under Brigadier General [[Samuel Whiteside]].<ref>Jung, 79\u201380; Trask, 174.</ref> Among the militiamen was [[Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War|23-year-old Abraham Lincoln]], who was elected captain of his company.<ref>Jung, 79.</ref>\n\n==Initial diplomacy==\n[[File:Shabbona (chief)1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Potawatomi]] chief [[Shabbona]] tried to keep his tribe out of the war.]]\n\nAfter Atkinson's arrival at Rock Island on April 12, 1832, he, Keokuk, and Meskwaki chief [[Wapello (chief)|Wapello]] sent emissaries to the British Band, which was now ascending the Rock River. Black Hawk rejected the messages advising him to turn back.<ref>Jung, 76\u201377; Nichols, 117\u201318.</ref> Colonel [[Zachary Taylor]], a regular army officer who served under Atkinson, later stated that Atkinson should have made an attempt to stop the British Band by force. Some historians have agreed, arguing that Atkinson could have prevented the outbreak of war with more decisive action or astute diplomacy. Cecil Eby charged that \"Atkinson was a paper general, unwilling to proceed until all risk had been eliminated\".<ref>Eby, 93.</ref> Kerry Trask, however, argued that Atkinson was correct in believing that he did not yet have enough troops to stop the British Band.<ref>Trask, 152\u201355.</ref> According to Patrick Jung, leaders on both sides had little chance of avoiding bloodshed at this point, because the militiamen and some of Black Hawk's warriors were spoiling for a fight.<ref>Jung, 86.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Black Hawk learned that the [[Ho-Chunk]] and [[Potawatomi]] tribes were less supportive than anticipated. As in other tribes, different bands of these tribes often pursued different policies.<ref>Hall, 10\u201311.</ref> The Ho-Chunks who lived along the Rock River in Illinois had family ties to the Sauks; they cautiously supported the British Band while trying not to provoke the Americans.<ref>Hall, 131.</ref> Ho-Chunks in Wisconsin were more divided. Some bands, remembering their loss to the Americans in the 1827 [[Winnebago War]], decided to stay clear of the conflict. Other Ho-Chunks with ties to the Dakotas and Menominees, most notably [[Waukon Decorah]] and his brothers, were eager to fight against the British Band.<ref>Hall, 122\u201323; Jung, 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nMost Potawatomis wanted to remain neutral in the conflict, but found it difficult to do so.<ref>Hall, 125.</ref> Many white settlers, recalling the [[Fort Dearborn massacre]] of 1812, distrusted the Potawatomis and assumed that they would join Black Hawk's uprising.<ref>Hall, 122.</ref> Potawatomi leaders worried that the tribe as a whole would be punished if any Potawatomis supported Black Hawk. At a council outside Chicago on May 1, 1832, Potawatomi leaders including [[Billy Caldwell]] \"passed a resolution declaring any Potawatomi who supported Black Hawk a traitor to his tribe\".<ref>Hall, 132.</ref> In mid May, Potawatomi chiefs [[Shabonna]] and [[Waubonsie]] told Black Hawk that neither they nor the British would come to his aid.<ref>Jung, 86\u201387; Edmunds, 236.</ref>\n\nWithout British supplies, adequate provisions, or Native allies, Black Hawk realized that his band was in serious trouble.<ref>Jung, 83\u201384; Nichols, 120; Trask, 180\u201381.</ref> By some accounts, he was ready to negotiate with Atkinson to end the crisis, but an ill-fated encounter with Illinois militiamen would end all possibility of a peaceful resolution.<ref>Hall, 133.</ref>\n\n==Stillman's Run==\n{{main|Battle of Stillman's Run}}\n[[File:Major Isaiah Stillman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Isaiah Stillman]], militia commander at the [[Battle of Stillman's Run]]]]\n\nGeneral [[Samuel Whiteside]]'s militia brigade had been mustered into federal service at Rock Island under General Atkinson in late April, and divided into a scout or spy battalion commanded by [[James D. Henry]], as well as four regiments (commanded by Colonels John DeWitt, Jacob Fry, John Thomas and Samuel M. Thompson),<ref>Harrington, George B. Past and Present of [[Bureau County, Illinois]]. Chicago, IL, USA: Pioneer Publishing (1906) p. 39 </ref> with judge William Thomas as their quartermaster. Atkinson had allowed Reynolds, Whiteside, and the militiamen to leave up the Rock River on April 27, while he brought up the rear with the regular soldiers, directing his least trained and disciplined men\u2014to \"move upon the Indians should they be within striking distance without waiting for my arrival\".<ref name=\"Jung, 84\">Jung, 84.</ref><ref>[[Thomas Ford (politician)|Thomas Ford]], A History of Illinois: from its commencement as a state in 1818 to 1847 (annotated and introduced by Rodney O Davis; University of Illinois Press 1995) pp. 76-77</ref> Governor Reynolds accompanied the expedition as a major general of militia. \n\nOn May 10 the militia marching up the Rock River in pursuit of the British Band reached Prophetstown (about 35 miles from their starting point at the confluence). Rather than wait per Atkinson's plan, they burned White Cloud's empty village before proceeding about 40 miles upriver to Dixon's Ferry, where they waited for Atkinson and his troops.<ref>Prophetstown State Park brochure, available at https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/publications/Documents/00000097.pdf</ref><ref>Ford p. 78</ref> Although Reynolds wanted to allow the 260 eager militiamen not yet federalized to continue further as scouts, the cautious Whiteside insisted on waiting for Atkinson at the settlement.<ref>Jung, 85\u201386.</ref> Dixon's Ferry had actually been established in 1826 by Ogee, of half-native ancestry, where the wagon trail connecting Peoria to the lead mines in Galena crossed the Rock River; settlers has established cabins along the Peoria/Galena trace and at the crossing, so that by 1829 its post office served settlers up the river as far as Rockford.<ref>William V. Pooley, Settlement of Illinois, 1830-1850 (Thesis submitted to the University of Wisconsin in 1905; printed at Ann Arbor, Michigan, University Microfilms in 1968) p. 147</ref>\n\nOn May 12, learning that Black Hawk's band was only twenty-five miles away, eager militiamen led by Major [[Isaiah Stillman]] left Whiteside's encampment, making another camp on a tributary of the Rock River later named  [[Stillman Valley, Illinois|Stillman Valley]] after him. Seeing a small party of natives with a red flag, Major Samuel Hackelton and some men pursued without waiting for orders, and Hackelton killed a native before returning to Whiteside's camp with the news.<ref>Ford p. 78</ref> However, Black Hawk and others were nearby, and near dusk on May 14 attacked Stillman's party in what became known as the [[Battle of Stillman's Run]]. Accounts of the battle vary.<ref>Jung, 88; Trask, 183.</ref> Black Hawk later stated that he sent three men under a white flag to parley, but the Americans imprisoned them and opened fire on a second group of emissaries who followed. Some militiamen claimed they never saw a white flag; others believed that the flag was a ruse the Indians used to set an ambush.<ref>Jung, 88\u201389; Trask, 186.</ref> All accounts agree that Black Hawk's warriors attacked the militia camp at dusk, that the much more numerous militia were routed, and stragglers reached Whiteside's camp. To Black Hawk's surprise, his forty warriors killed twelve Illinois militiamen; his British Band suffered only three fatalities.<ref>Jung, 89; Hall, 133\u201334.</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Stillman's Run proved a turning point. Before the battle, Black Hawk had not committed to war. Now he determined to avenge what he saw as the treacherous killing of his warriors under a flag of truce.<ref>Jung, 89.</ref> Whiteside too was incensed when he returned to the battle site with a burial party and viewed the mutilated corpses. <ref>\"Battle of Stillman's Run\" in William B. Kessell, Encyclopedia of Native American Wars and Warfare (2005), available online</ref>  After Stillman's defeat, American leaders like President Jackson and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Lewis Cass]] refused to consider a diplomatic solution; they wanted a resounding victory over Black Hawk to serve as an example to other Native Americans who might consider similar uprisings.<ref>Jung, 118\u201320.</ref>\n\n==Initial raids==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear:right\"\n|-\n| {{Black Hawk War Map}}\n|-\n|Map of Black Hawk War sites<br />[[File:Red Battle X.png|8px|link=]] <small>Battle (with name)</small> [[File:Red pog.svg|7px|link=]] <small>Fort / settlement</small> [[File:Green pog.svg|7px|link=]] <small>Native village</small><br /><small>Symbols are wikilinked to article</small>\n|}\n\nWith hostilities now underway, and few allies to depend upon, Black Hawk sought a place of refuge for the women, children, and elderly in his band. Accepting an offer from the Rock River Ho-Chunks, the band traveled further upriver to [[Lake Koshkonong]] in the [[Michigan Territory]] and camped in an isolated place known as the \"Island\".<ref>Jung, 93\u201394.</ref> With the non-combatants secure, members of the British Band, with a number of Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi allies, began raiding white settlers.<ref>Jung, 94, 108.</ref> Not all Native Americans in the region supported this turn of events; most notably, Potawatomi chief [[Shabonna]] rode throughout the settlements, warning whites of the impending attacks.<ref>Edmunds, 237; Trask, 200; Jung, 95.</ref>\n\nThe initial raiding parties consisted primarily of Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi warriors. The first attack came on May 19, 1832, when Ho-Chunks [[Buffalo Grove ambush|ambushed six men]] near [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois (Ogle County)|Buffalo Grove, Illinois]], killing a man named William Durley.<ref>Jung, 95; Trask, 198.</ref> Durley's [[scalping|scalped]] and mutilated body was found by Indian agent [[Felix St. Vrain]]. The Indian agent was himself [[St. Vrain massacre|killed and mutilated]], along with three other men, several days later at [[Kellogg's Grove]].<ref>Jung, 97; Trask, 198\u201399.</ref>\n\nThe Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis who took part in the war were sometimes motivated by grievances not directly related to Black Hawk's objectives.<ref name=\"Jung, 95\">Jung, 95.</ref> One such incident was the [[Indian Creek massacre]]. In the spring of 1832, Potawatomis living along Indian Creek were upset that a settler named William Davis had dammed the creek, preventing fish from reaching their village. Davis ignored the protests, and assaulted a Potawatomi man who tried to dismantle the dam.<ref>Hall, 135\u201336.</ref> The Black Hawk War provided the Indian Creek Potawatomis with an opportunity for revenge. On May 21, about fifty Potawatomis and three Sauks from the British Band attacked Davis's settlement, killing, scalping, and mutilating fifteen men, women, and children.<ref>Jung, 95; Trask, 202.</ref> Two teenage girls from the settlement were kidnapped and taken to Black Hawk's camp.<ref>Jung, 96; Trask, 215.</ref> A Ho-Chunk chief named White Crow negotiated their release two weeks later.<ref>Trask, 212\u201317.</ref> Like other Rock River Ho-Chunks, White Crow was trying to placate the Americans while clandestinely aiding the British Band.<ref>Hall, 152\u201354; 164\u201365.</ref>\n\n==American reorganization==\nNews of Stillman's defeat, the Indian Creek massacre, and other smaller attacks triggered panic among the white population. Many settlers fled to [[Chicago]], then a small town, which became overcrowded with hungry refugees.<ref>Trask, 200\u201306; Jung, 97.</ref> Many Potawatomis also fled towards Chicago, not wanting to get caught in the conflict nor be mistaken for hostiles.<ref>Edmunds, 238; Jung, 103.</ref> Throughout the region, settlers hurriedly organized militia units and built small forts.<ref>Jung, 96.</ref>\n\nAfter Stillman's defeat on May 14, the regulars and militia continued up the Rock River to search for Black Hawk. The militiamen became discouraged at not being able to find the British Band. When they heard about the Indian raids, many deserted so that they could return home to defend their families.<ref>Trask, 194\u201396.</ref> As morale plummeted, Governor Reynolds asked his militia officers to vote on whether to continue the campaign. General Whiteside, disgusted with the performance of his men, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of disbanding.<ref>Jung, 100; Trask, 196.</ref> Most of Whiteside's brigade disbanded at [[Ottawa, Illinois]], on May 28. About 300 men, including Abraham Lincoln, agreed to remain in the field for twenty more days until a new militia force could be organized.<ref>Jung, 101; Trask, 196\u201397.</ref>\n\nAs Whiteside's brigade disbanded, Atkinson organized a new force in June 1832 that he dubbed the \"Army of the Frontier\".<ref>Jung, 115.</ref> The army consisted of 629 regular army infantrymen and 3,196 mounted militia volunteers. The militia was divided into three brigades commanded by Brigadier Generals [[Alexander Posey (general)|Alexander Posey]], [[Milton Alexander]], and [[James D. Henry]]. Since many men were assigned to local patrols and guard duties, Atkinson had only 450 regulars and 2,100 militiamen available for campaigning.<ref>Jung, 114\u201315.</ref> Many more militiamen served in units that were not part of the Army of the Frontier's three brigades. Abraham Lincoln, for example, reenlisted as a private in an independent company that was taken into federal service. [[Henry Dodge]], a Michigan territorial militia colonel who would prove to be one of the best commanders in the war,<ref>Jung, 103.</ref> fielded a battalion of mounted volunteers that numbered 250 men at its strongest. The overall number of militiamen who took part in the war is not precisely known; the total from Illinois alone has been estimated at six to seven thousand.<ref>Jung, 116.</ref>\n\nIn addition to organizing a new militia army, Atkinson also began to recruit Native American allies, reversing the previous American policy of trying to prevent intertribal warfare.<ref>Hall, 143\u201345.</ref> Menominees, Dakotas, and some Ho-Chunks bands were eager to go to war against the British Band. By June 6, agent [[Joseph M. Street]] had assembled about 225 Natives at Prairie du Chien.<ref>Hall, 148.</ref> This force included about eighty Dakotas under [[Wapasha II|Wabasha]] and L'Arc, forty Menominees, and several bands of Ho Chunks.<ref>Hall, 148; Jung 104.</ref> Although the Indian warriors followed their own leaders, Atkinson placed the force under the nominal command of [[William S. Hamilton]], a militia colonel and a son of [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Hamilton would prove to be an unfortunate choice to lead the force; historian John Hall characterized him as \"pretentious and unqualified\".<ref>Hall, 145.</ref> Before long, the Indians became frustrated with marching around under Hamilton and not seeing any action. Some Menominee scouts remained, but most of the Natives eventually left Hamilton and fought the war on their own terms.<ref>Hall, 162\u201363; Jung, 105.</ref>\n\n==June raids==\nIn June 1832, after hearing that Atkinson was forming a new army, Black Hawk began sending out raiding parties. Perhaps hoping to lead the Americans away from his camp at Lake Koshkonong, he targeted areas to the west.<ref>Jung, 108.</ref> The first major attack occurred on June 14 near present-day [[South Wayne, Wisconsin]], when a band of about 30 warriors attacked a group of farmers, [[Spafford Farm massacre|killing and scalping four]].<ref>Jung, 109.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pecatonica Battleground1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting of rolling hills, a river, and trees|An 1857 painting of the battlefield at Horseshoe Bend]]\n\nResponding to this attack, militia Colonel Henry Dodge gathered a force of twenty-nine mounted volunteers and set out in pursuit of the attackers. On June 16, Dodge and his men cornered about eleven of the raiders at a bend in the [[Pecatonica River]]. In a brief battle, the Americans killed and scalped all of the Natives.<ref>Jung, 109\u201310; Trask, 233\u201334.</ref> The [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1832)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] (or Battle of Pecatonica) was the first real American victory in the war, and helped restore public confidence in the volunteer militia force.<ref>Jung, 110; Trask, 234\u201337.</ref>\n\nOn the same day of Dodge's victory, another skirmish took place at [[Kellogg's Grove]] in present-day [[Stephenson County, Illinois]]. American forces had occupied Kellogg's Grove in an effort to intercept war parties raiding to the west. In the [[First Battle of Kellogg's Grove]], militia commanded by [[Adam W. Snyder]] pursued a British Band raiding party of about thirty warriors. Three Illinois militiamen and six Native warriors died in the fighting.<ref>Jung, 111\u201312.</ref> Two days later, on June 18, militia under [[James W. Stephenson]] encountered what was probably the same war party near [[Yellow Creek (Illinois)|Yellow Creek]]. The [[Battle of Waddams Grove]] became a hard fought, hand-to-hand melee. Three militiamen and five or six Indians were killed in the action.<ref>Jung, 112; Trask, 220\u201321.</ref>\n\nBack on June 6, when a civilian miner was killed by raiders near the village of [[Blue Mounds, Wisconsin|Blue Mounds]] in the Michigan Territory, residents began to fear that the Rock River Ho-Chunks were joining the war.<ref>Trask, 220.</ref> On June 20, a Ho-Chunk raiding party estimated by one eyewitness to be as large as 100 warriors [[Attacks at Fort Blue Mounds|attacked the settler fort]] at Blue Mounds. Two militiamen were killed in the attack, one of whom was badly mutilated.<ref>Jung, 112; Trask, 220.</ref>\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Il Apple River Fort2.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A wooden stockade fronted by a wall of vertically-placed logs and a corner blockhouse|Replica of Apple River Fort in Elizabeth, Illinois]]\n\nOn June 24, 1832, Black Hawk and about 200 warriors attacked at the hastily constructed [[Apple River Fort]], near present-day [[Elizabeth, Illinois]]. Local settlers, warned of Black Hawk's approach, took refuge in the fort, which was defended by about 20<ref name=\"Trask, 222\">Trask, 222.</ref> to 35<ref>Jung, 113.</ref> militiamen. The [[Battle of Apple River Fort]] lasted about forty-five minutes. The women and girls inside the fort, under the direction of [[Elizabeth Armstrong (settler)|Elizabeth Armstrong]], loaded muskets and molded bullets.<ref name=\"Trask, 222\"/> After losing several men, Black Hawk broke off the siege, looted the nearby homes, and headed back towards his camp.<ref>Jung, 114.</ref>\n\nThe next day, June 25, Black Hawk's party encountered a militia battalion commanded by Major [[John Dement]]. In the [[Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove]], Black Hawk's warriors drove the militiamen inside their fort and commenced a two-hour siege. After losing nine warriors and killing five militiamen, Black Hawk broke off the siege and returned to his main camp at Lake Koshkonong.<ref>Jung, 121\u201323.</ref> This would prove to be Black Hawk's last military success in the war. With his band running low on food, he decided to take them back across the Mississippi.<ref>Jung, 124.</ref>\n\n==Final campaign==\nOn June 15, 1832, President [[Andrew Jackson]], displeased with Atkinson's handling of the war, appointed General [[Winfield Scott]] to take command.<ref>Jung, 118; Trask, 272.</ref> Scott gathered about 950 troops from eastern army posts just as a [[Second cholera pandemic|cholera pandemic]] had spread to eastern North America.<ref>Jung, 139.</ref> As Scott's troops traveled by steamboat from [[Buffalo, New York]], across the Great Lakes towards Chicago, his men started getting sick from cholera, with many of them dying. At each place the vessels landed, the sick were deposited and soldiers deserted. By the time the last steamboat landed in Chicago, Scott had only about 350 effective soldiers left.<ref>Jung, 140\u201341; Trask, 271\u201375.</ref> On July 29, Scott began a hurried journey west, ahead of his troops, eager to take command of what was certain to be the war's final campaign, but he would be too late to see any combat.<ref>Jung, 141; Trask, 276.</ref>\n\nGeneral Atkinson, who learned in early July that Scott would be taking command, hoped to bring the war to a successful conclusion before Scott's arrival.<ref>Jung, 130.</ref> The Americans had difficulty locating the British Band, however, thanks in part to false intelligence given to them by area Native Americans. Potawatomis and Ho-Chunks in Illinois, many of whom had sought to remain neutral in the war, decided to cooperate with the Americans. Tribal leaders knew that some of their warriors had aided the British Band, and so they hoped that a highly visible show of support for the Americans would dissuade U.S. officials from punishing the tribes after the conflict was over. Wearing white headbands to distinguish themselves from hostile Natives, Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis served as guides for Atkinson's army.<ref>Edmunds, 239; Hall, 244\u201349.</ref> Ho-Chunks sympathetic to the plight of Black Hawk's people misled Atkinson into thinking that the British Band was still at Lake Koshkonong. While Atkinson's men were trudging through the swamps and running low on provisions, the British Band had in fact relocated miles to the north.<ref>Jung, 131\u201334.</ref> Potawatomis under Billy Caldwell also managed to demonstrate support for the Americans while avoiding battle.<ref>Hall, 165\u201367.</ref>\n\nIn mid-July, Colonel Dodge learned from m\u00e9tis trader Pierre Paquette that the British Band was camped near the Rock River rapids, at present [[Hustisford, Wisconsin]].<ref>Jung, 142.</ref> Dodge and [[James D. Henry]] set out in pursuit from [[Fort Winnebago]] on July 15.<ref>Jung, 144.</ref> The British Band, reduced to fewer than 600 people due to death and desertion, headed for the Mississippi River as the militia approached.<ref>Jung, 146\u201348.</ref> The Americans pursued them, killing and scalping several Native stragglers along the way.<ref>Jung, 149\u201350.</ref>\n\n===Wisconsin Heights===\n{{Main|Battle of Wisconsin Heights}}\n\nOn July 21, 1832, the militiamen caught up with the British Band near present-day [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]]. To buy time for the noncombatants to cross the Wisconsin River, Black Hawk and Neapope confronted the Americans in a rear guard action that became known as the [[Battle of Wisconsin Heights]]. Black Hawk was desperately outnumbered, leading about 50 Sauks and 60 to 70 Kickapoos against 750 militiamen.<ref>Jung, 153\u201356.</ref> The battle was a lopsided victory for the militiamen, who lost only one man while killing as many as 68 of Black Hawk's warriors.<ref>Jung, 156; Trask, 260\u201361.</ref> Despite the high casualties, the battle allowed much of the British Band, including many women and children, to escape across the river.<ref name=\"lewis\">{{cite web|url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2c.html |title=The Black Hawk War of 1832 |last=Lewis |first=James |work=Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project |publisher=Northern Illinois University |page=2c |accessdate=2009-08-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815021319/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2c.html |archivedate=2009-08-15 }}</ref> Black Hawk had managed to hold off a much larger force while allowing most of his people to escape, a difficult military operation that impressed some U.S. Army officers when they learned of it.<ref>Jung, 157.</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Wisconsin Heights had been a victory for the militia; no regular soldiers of the U.S. Army had been present.<ref>Jung, 156.</ref> Atkinson and the regulars joined up with the volunteers several days after the battle. With a force of about 400 regulars and 900 militiamen, the Americans crossed the Wisconsin River on July 27 and resumed the pursuit of the British Band.<ref>Jung, 161; Trask, 268.</ref> The British Band was moving slow, encumbered with wounded warriors and people dying of starvation. The Americans followed the trail of dead bodies, cast off equipment, and the remains of horses the hungry Natives had eaten.<ref>Jung, 162; Trask, 270\u201371.</ref>\n\n===Bad Axe===\n{{Main|Battle of Bad Axe}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a messenger from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band was going back across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret.<ref>Nichols, 131; Trask, 266.</ref> Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, and that they had not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.<ref>Jung, 168\u201369.</ref>\n\n[[File: Battle of Bad Axe.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Native American women and children fleeing for their lives, preparing to cross the Mississippi River, during Black Hawk's defeat at the [[Battle of Bad Axe]]]]\n\nThe Americans, however, had no intentions of letting the British Band escape. The [[Warrior (steamboat)|''Warrior'']], a steamboat outfitted with an artillery piece, patrolled the Mississippi River, while American-allied Dakotas, Menominees, and Ho-Chunks watched the banks.<ref>Hall, 192\u201394.</ref> On August 1, the ''Warrior'' arrived at the mouth of the [[Bad Axe River]], where the Dakotas told the Americans that they would find Black Hawk's people.<ref>Jung, 164\u201365; Hall, 194.</ref> Black Hawk raised a white flag in an attempt to surrender, but his intentions may have been garbled in translation.<ref>Jung, 165; Nichols, 133.</ref> The Americans, in no mood to accept a surrender anyway, thought that the Indians were using the white flag to set an ambush. When they became certain that the Natives on land were the British Band, they opened fire. Twenty-three Natives were killed in the exchange of gunfire, while just one soldier on the ''Warrior'' was injured.<ref>Jung, 166; Trask, 279.</ref>\n\n[[File:1832 Battle of Bad Axe and steamboat Warrior.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The steamboat ''[[Warrior (steamboat)|Warrior]]'' firing upon escaping Native Americans trying to get across the Mississippi River to safety in Iowa]]\n\nAfter the ''Warrior'' left, Black Hawk decided to seek refuge in the north with the [[Ojibwe]]s. Only about 50 people, including Wabokieshiek, agreed to go with him; the others remained, determined to cross the Mississippi and return to Sauk territory.<ref>Jung, 166; Nichols, 133. Jung says \"about 60 people\" left with Black Hawk; Nichols, 135, estimated \"perhaps forty\".</ref> The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north when he learned that the American army had closed in on the members of the British Band who were trying to cross the Mississippi.<ref name=\"Jung, 169\">Jung, 169.</ref> He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day [[Victory, Wisconsin]], he gave up the attempt.<ref name=\"Jung, 169\"/> Sauk chief [[Weesheet]] later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for abandoning the people during the final battle of the war.<ref>Jung, 180\u201381; Trask, 282.</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Bad Axe]] began at about 9:00 am on August 2 after the Americans caught up with the remnants of the British Band a few miles downstream from the mouth of the Bad Axe River. The British Band was reduced to roughly 500 people by this time, including about 150 warriors.<ref>Jung, 170.</ref> The warriors fought with the Americans while the Native noncombatants frantically tried to cross the river. Many made it to one of the two nearby islands, but were dislodged after the steamboat ''Warrior'' returned at noon, carrying regulars and Menominees allied with the Americans.<ref>Trask, 286\u201387; Jung, 170\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe battle was another lopsided victory for the Americans, who lost just 14 men, including one Menominee who died by [[friendly fire]] and was buried with honors alongside the white soldiers.<ref>Jung, 171\u201372; Hall, 196.</ref> At least 260 members of the British Band were killed, including about 110 who drowned while trying to cross the river. Although the regular soldiers of the U.S. Army generally tried to avoid needless bloodshed, many of the militiamen intentionally killed Native noncombatants, sometimes in cold blood.<ref>Trask, 285\u201386, 293.</ref> The encounter was, in the words of historian Patrick Jung, \"less of a battle and more of a massacre\".<ref name=\"Jung, 172\"/>\n\nMenominees from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], who had mobilized a battalion of nearly 300 men, arrived too late for the battle. They were upset at having missed the chance to fight their old enemies, and so on August 10, General Scott sent 100 of them after a part of the British Band that had escaped.<ref>Hall, 197.</ref> Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not to take any scalps, but Chief Grizzly Bear insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced.<ref>Hall, 198.</ref> The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but spared the women and children.<ref>Hall, 199.</ref>\n\nThe Dakotas, who had volunteered 150 warriors to fight against the Sauks and Meskwakis, also arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Bad Axe, but they pursued the members of the British Band who made it across the Mississippi into Iowa. On about August 9, in the final engagement of the war,<ref>Hall, 202.</ref> they attacked the remnants of the British Band along the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]], killing 68 and taking 22 prisoners.<ref>Jung, 175; Hall, 201.</ref> Ho-Chunks also hunted survivors of the British Band, taking between fifty and sixty scalps.<ref>Jung, 177; Hall, 210\u201311.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Black Hawk War resulted in the deaths of 77 white settlers, militiamen, and regular soldiers.<ref name=\"Jung, 172\">Jung, 172.</ref> This figure does not include the deaths from cholera suffered by the relief force under General Winfield Scott. Estimates of how many members of the British Band died during the conflict range from about 450 to 600, or about half of the 1,100 people who entered Illinois with Black Hawk in 1832.<ref>Jung, 172, 179.</ref>\n\nA number of American men with political ambitions fought in the Black Hawk War. At least seven future [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]s took part, as did four future Illinois governors; future governors of Michigan, Nebraska, and the [[Wisconsin Territory]]; and one future U.S. president.<ref name=\"lewis2d\">{{cite web|url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2d.html|title=The Black Hawk War of 1832|last=Lewis|first=James|work=Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project|publisher=Northern Illinois University|page=2d|accessdate=2009-08-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619071514/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2d.html|archivedate=2009-06-19}}</ref> The Black Hawk War demonstrated to American officials the need for mounted troops to fight a mounted foe. During the war, the U.S. Army did not have cavalry; the only mounted soldiers were part-time volunteers. After the war, Congress created the [[US Army Rangers#Black Hawk War|Mounted Ranger Battalion]] under the command of [[Henry Dodge]], which was expanded to the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment]] in 1833.<ref>Jung 205\u201306.</ref>\n\n===Black Hawk's imprisonment and legacy===\n[[File:Black hawk statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Black Hawk, [[Black Hawk State Historic Site]]]]\n\nAfter the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, and their followers traveled northeast to seek refuge with the Ojibwes. American officials offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture.<ref>Jung, 181.</ref> While camping near present-day [[Tomah, Wisconsin]], Black Hawk's party was seen by a passing Ho-Chunk man, who alerted his village chief. The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and convinced him to surrender to the Americans. On August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street.<ref>Jung, 182; Trask, 294\u201395.</ref> Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, and sent them by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]].<ref>Jung, 183.</ref>\n\nBy war's end, Black Hawk and nineteen other leaders of the British Band were incarcerated at Jefferson Barracks. Most of the prisoners were released in the succeeding months, but in April 1833, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, Neapope, and three others were transferred to [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia, which was better equipped to hold prisoners.<ref>Jung, 190\u201391.</ref> The American public was eager to catch a glimpse of the captured Indians. Large crowds gathered in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Cincinnati]] to watch them pass.<ref>Trask, 298; Jung, 192.</ref> On April 26, the prisoners met briefly with President Jackson in [[Washington, D.C.]], before being taken to Fort Monroe.<ref>Jung, 192; Trask, 298.</ref> Even in prison they were treated as celebrities: they posed for portraits by artists such as [[Charles Bird King]] and [[John Wesley Jarvis]], and a dinner was held in their honor before they left.<ref>Nichols, 147; Trask, 298.</ref>\n\nAmerican officials decided to release the prisoners after a few weeks. First, however, the Natives were required to visit several large U.S. cities on the east coast. This was a tactic often used when Native American leaders came to the East, because it was thought that a demonstration of the size and power of the United States would discourage future resistance to U.S. expansion.<ref>Jung, 191; Nichols, 148; Trask, 300.</ref> Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were taken on a tour of [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]]. They attended dinners and plays, and were shown a battleship, various public buildings, and a military parade. Huge crowds gathered to see them. Black Hawk's handsome son Nasheweskaska (Whirling Thunder) was a particular favorite.<ref>Jung, 195\u201397; Nichols, 148\u201349; Trask, 300\u201301.</ref> Reaction in the west, however, was less welcoming. When the prisoners traveled through [[Detroit]] on their way home, one crowd burned and hanged [[effigies]] of the Indians.<ref>Trask, 301\u201302; Jung, 197.</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Kerry Trask, Black Hawk and his fellow prisoners were treated like celebrities because the Indians served as a living embodiment of the [[noble savage]] myth that had become popular in the eastern United States. Then and later, argues Trask, white Americans absolved themselves of complicity in the dispossession of Native Americans by expressing admiration or sympathy for defeated Indians like Black Hawk.<ref>Trask, 298\u2013303.</ref> The mythologizing of Black Hawk continued, argues Trask, with the many plaques and memorials that were later erected in his honor. \"Indeed,\" writes Trask, \"most of the reconstructed memory of the Black Hawk War has been designed to make white people feel good about themselves.\"<ref>Trask, 308.</ref> Black Hawk also became an admired symbol of resistance among Native Americans, even among descendants of those who had opposed him.\n\n===Treaties and removals===\nThe Black Hawk War marked the end of Native armed resistance to U.S. expansion in the [[Northwest Territory|Old Northwest]]<ref>Buckley, 210; Hall, 255; Jung, 208.</ref> The war provided an opportunity for American officials such as Andrew Jackson, Lewis Cass, and John Reynolds to compel Native American tribes to sell their lands east of the Mississippi River and move to the West, a policy known as [[Indian removal]]. Officials conducted a number of treaties after the war to purchase the remaining Native American land claims in the Old Northwest. The Dakotas and Menominees, who won approval from American officials for their role in the war, largely avoided postwar removal pressure until later decades.<ref>Hall, 207.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, American officials learned that some Ho-Chunks had aided Black Hawk more than had been previously known.<ref>Hall, 209\u201310.</ref> Eight Ho-Chunks were briefly imprisoned at Fort Winnebago for their role in the war, but charges against them were eventually dropped due to a lack of witnesses.<ref>Jung, 207.</ref> In September 1832, General Scott and Governor Reynolds conducted a treaty with the Ho-Chunks at Rock Island. The Ho-Chunks ceded all their land south of the Wisconsin River in exchange for a forty-mile strip of land in Iowa and annual payments of $10,000 for twenty-seven years.<ref>Hall, 212\u201313; Jung, 285\u201386.</ref> The land in Iowa was known as the \"Neutral Ground\" because it had been designated in 1830 as a buffer zone between the Dakotas and their enemies to the south, the Sauks and Meskwakis.<ref>Jung, 49; Buckley, 203.</ref> Scott hoped that the settlement of the Ho-Chunks in the Neutral Ground would help keep the peace.<ref name=\"Jung, 186\">Jung, 186.</ref> Ho-Chunks remaining in Wisconsin were pressured to sign a removal treaty in 1837, even though leaders such as Waukon Decorah had been U.S. allies during the Black Hawk War. General Atkinson was assigned to use the army to forcibly relocate those Ho-Chunks who refused to move to Iowa.<ref>Hall, 259\u201361.</ref>\n\nFollowing the September 1832 treaty with the Ho-Chunks, Scott and Reynolds conducted another with the Sauks and Meskwakis, with Keokuk and Wapello serving as the primary representatives of their tribes. Scott told the assembled chiefs that \"if a particular part of a nation goes out of their country, and makes war, the whole nation is responsible\".<ref name=\"Jung, 186\"/> The tribes sold about 6 million acres (24,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of [[Black Hawk Purchase|land in eastern Iowa]] to the United States for payments of $20,000 per year for thirty years, among other provisions.<ref>Trask, 304; Jung, 187.</ref> Keokuk was granted a [[Indian reservation|reservation]] within the cession and recognized by the Americans as the primary chief of the Sauks and Meskwakis.<ref>Jung, 187.</ref> The tribes sold the reservation to the United States in 1836, and additional land in Iowa the following year.<ref>Jung, 198.</ref> Their last lands in Iowa were sold in 1842, and most of the Natives moved to a reservation in Kansas.<ref>Jung, 201\u201302.</ref>\n\nThanks to the decision of Potawatomi leaders to aid the U.S. during the war, American officials did not seize tribal land as [[war reparations]]. Instead, only three individuals accused of leading the Indian Creek massacre were tried in court; they were acquitted.<ref>Edmunds, 238; Hall, 208, 215.</ref> Nevertheless, the drive to purchase Potawatomi land west of the Mississippi began in October 1832, when [[Treaty of Tippecanoe|commissioners in Indiana]] bought a large amount of Potawatomi land, even though not all Potawatomi bands were represented at the treaty.<ref>Hall, 215\u201316.</ref> The tribe was compelled to sell their remaining land west of the Mississippi in a [[Treaty of Chicago|treaty held in Chicago]] in September 1833.<ref>Edmunds, 247\u201348; Hall, 231.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Black Hawk War}}\n* [[Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War]]\n* [[Second Black Hawk War]]\n* [[American Indian Wars]]\n* [[Sixty Years' War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n===Secondary sources===\n* Buckley, Jay H.

The war erupted soon after Black Hawk and a group of Sauks, [[Meskwaki]]s, and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoos]], known as the \"[[British Band]]\", crossed the [[Mississippi River]], into the U.S. state of [[Illinois]], from [[Iowa|Iowa Indian Territory]] in April 1832. Black Hawk's motives were ambiguous, but he was apparently hoping to avoid bloodshed while resettling on tribal land that had been ceded to the United States in the disputed 1804 [[Treaty of St. Louis (1804)|Treaty of St. Louis]].\n\nU.S. officials, convinced that the British Band was hostile, mobilized a frontier [[Militia in the United States|militia]] and opened fire on a delegation from the Native Americans on May 14, 1832. Black Hawk responded by successfully attacking the militia at the [[Battle of Stillman's Run]]. He led his band to a secure location in what is now southern [[Wisconsin]] and was pursued by U.S. forces. Meanwhile, other Native Americans conducted raids against forts and settlements largely unprotected with the absence of U.S. troops. Some [[Ho-Chunk]] and [[Potawatomi]] warriors with grievances against [[European-Americans]] took part in these raids, although most tribe members tried to avoid the conflict. The [[Menominee]] and [[Sioux|Dakota]] tribes, already at odds with the Sauks and Meskwakis, supported the U.S.\n\nCommanded by General [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]], the U.S. troops tracked the British Band. Militia under Colonel [[Henry Dodge]] caught up with the British Band on July 21 and defeated them at the [[Battle of Wisconsin Heights]]. Black Hawk's band was weakened by hunger, death, and desertion and many native survivors retreated towards the Mississippi. On August 2, U.S. soldiers attacked the remnants of the British Band at the [[Battle of Bad Axe]], killing many and capturing most who remained alive. Black Hawk and other leaders escaped, but later surrendered and were imprisoned for a year.\n\nThe Black Hawk War gave the young captain [[Abraham Lincoln]] his [[Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War|brief military service]], although he never saw combat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://southernhistorians.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Understanding-the-WBTS-Compiled-Download-Website-Oct-2015.pdf|title=Understanding the war between the States - Chapter 24}}</ref> Other participants who later became famous included [[Winfield Scott]], [[Zachary Taylor]], and [[Jefferson Davis]]. The war gave impetus to the U.S. policy of [[Indian removal]], in which Native American tribes were pressured to sell their lands and move west of the Mississippi River and stay there.\n\n==Background==\nIn the 18th century, the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Meskwaki]] (or Fox) [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes lived along the [[Mississippi River]] in what are now the U.S. states of [[Illinois]] and [[Iowa]]. The two tribes had become closely connected after having been displaced from the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes region]] in conflicts with [[New France]] and other Native American tribes, particularly after the so-called [[Fox Wars]] ended in the 1730s.<ref>Hall, 21\u201326; Jung, 13\u201314; Trask, 29.</ref> By the time of the Black Hawk War, the population of the two tribes was about 6,000 people.<ref>Jung, 14; Trask, 64.</ref>\n\n===Disputed treaty===\n[[File:Stlouistreatymap1804.png|thumb|The land ceded to the United States in the 1804 [[Treaty of St. Louis (1804)|Treaty of St. Louis]] is shown here in yellow.]]\n\nAs the United States expanded westward in the early 19th century, government officials sought to buy as much Native American land as possible. In 1804, [[Indiana Territory|territorial governor]] [[William Henry Harrison]] negotiated a [[Treaty of St. Louis (1804)|treaty in St. Louis]] in which a group of Sauk and Meskwaki leaders supposedly sold their lands east of the Mississippi for more than $2,200, in goods and annual payments of $1,000 in goods. The treaty became controversial because the Native leaders had not been authorized by their tribal councils to cede lands. Historian Robert Owens argued that the chiefs probably did not intend to give up ownership of the land, and that they would not have sold so much valuable territory for such a modest price.<ref>Owens, 87\u201390.</ref> Historian Patrick Jung concluded that the Sauk and Meskwaki chiefs intended to cede a little land, but that the Americans included more territory in the treaty's language than the Natives realized.<ref>Jung, 21\u201322.</ref> According to Jung, the Sauks and Meskwakis did not learn the true extent of the cession until years later.<ref>Jung, 32.</ref>\n\nThe 1804 treaty allowed the tribes to continue using the ceded land until it was sold to American settlers by the U.S. government.<ref>Trask, 72.</ref> For the next two decades, Sauks continued to live at [[Saukenuk]], their primary village, which was located near the confluence of the Mississippi and [[Rock River (Mississippi River)|Rock Rivers]].<ref>Trask, 28\u201329.</ref> In 1828, the U.S. government finally began to have the ceded land surveyed for white settlement. [[Indian agent]] [[Thomas Forsyth (Indian agent)|Thomas Forsyth]] informed the Sauks that they should vacate Saukenuk and their other settlements east of the Mississippi.<ref>Trask, 70; Jung, 52\u201353.</ref>\n\n===Sauks divided===\nThe Sauks were divided about whether to resist implementation of the disputed 1804 treaty.<ref>Jung, 52.</ref> Most Sauks decided to relocate west of the Mississippi rather than become involved in a confrontation with the United States. The leader of this group was [[Keokuk (Sauk leader)|Keokuk]], who had helped defend Saukenuk against the Americans during the [[War of 1812]]. Keokuk was not a chief, but as a skilled orator, he often spoke on behalf of the Sauk civil chiefs in negotiations with the Americans.<ref>Jung, 55.</ref> Keokuk regarded the 1804 treaty as a fraud, but after having seen the size of American cities on the east coast in 1824, he did not think the Sauks could successfully oppose the United States.<ref>Jung, 54\u201355; Nichols, 78.</ref>\n\nAlthough the majority of the tribe decided to follow Keokuk's lead, about 800 Sauks\u2014roughly one-sixth of the tribe\u2014chose instead to resist American expansion.<ref name=\"Jung, 56\">Jung, 56.</ref> [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], a war captain who had fought against the United States in the War of 1812 and was now in his 60s, emerged as the leader of this faction in 1829.<ref>Jung, 53.</ref> Like Keokuk, Black Hawk was not a civil chief, but he became Keokuk's primary rival for influence within the tribe. Black Hawk had actually signed a treaty in May 1816 that affirmed the disputed 1804 land cession, but he insisted that what had been written down was different from what had been spoken at the treaty conference. According to Black Hawk, the \"whites were in the habit of saying one thing to the Indians and putting another thing down on paper.\"<ref>Jung, 53; Trask, 73.</ref>\n\n[[File:Keokuk1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Native American chief in regalia|Keokuk by [[George Catlin]], c. 1830s]]\n\nBlack Hawk was determined to hold onto Saukenuk, a village at the confluence of the Rock River with the Mississippi, where he lived and had been born. When the Sauks returned to the village in 1829 after their annual winter hunt in the west, they found that it had been occupied by white squatters who were anticipating the sale of land.<ref>Hall, 90; Trask, 71.</ref> After months of clashes with the squatters, the Sauks left in September 1829 for the next winter hunt. Hoping to avoid further confrontations, Keokuk told Forsyth that he and his followers would not return to Saukenuk.<ref>Trask, 79.</ref>\n\nAgainst the advice of Keokuk and Forsyth, Black Hawk's faction returned to Saukenuk in the spring of 1830.<ref>Jung, 59.</ref> This time, they were joined by more than 200 [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoos]], a people who had often allied with the Sauks.<ref>Jung, 47, 58.</ref> Black Hawk and his followers became known as the \"[[British Band]]\" because they sometimes flew a British flag to defy claims of U.S. sovereignty, and because they hoped to gain the support of the British at [[Fort Malden]] in Canada.<ref>Hall, 90, 127; Jung, 56.</ref>\n[[File:Black Hawk 1831 newspaper.jpg|thumb|Newspaper account of the alarm caused by Sauk returning to [[Saukenuk]], ''Washington National Intelligencer'', June 13, 1831]]\nWhen the British Band once again returned to Saukenuk in 1831, Black Hawk's following had grown to about 1,500 people, and now included some [[Potawatomi]]s,<ref>Jung, 60.</ref> a people with close ties to the Sauks and Meskwakis.<ref>Edmunds, 235\u201336.</ref> American officials determined to force the British Band out of the state. General [[Edmund P. Gaines]], commander of the Western Department of the [[United States Army]], assembled troops with the hope of intimidating Black Hawk into leaving. The army had no cavalry to pursue the Sauks should they flee further into Illinois on horseback, and so on June 5 Gaines requested that the state [[Militia in the United States|militia]] provide a mounted battalion.<ref>Eby, 83\u201386.</ref> Illinois governor [[John Reynolds (U.S. politician)|John Reynolds]] had already alerted the militia; about 1,500 volunteers turned out.<ref>Eby, 88; Jung, 62.</ref> Meanwhile, Keokuk convinced many of Black Hawk's followers to leave Illinois.<ref>Jung, 62.</ref>\n\nOn June 25, 1831, Gaines sent troops to [[Vandruff Island]] across from Saukenuk. The island had been named for a farmer and trader who operated a ferry, as well as sold liquor to the natives, which had previously prompted a raid by Black Hawk to destroy the whiskey.<ref>http://www.rockislandpreservation.org/postcards-from-home/view-of-vandruff-island-from-black-hawk-tower/</ref> This time, underbrush had grown to impede the militiamen from landing, so the next day the militia tried to assault Saukenuk itself, only to find that Black Hawk and his followers had abandoned the village and recrossed the Mississippi.<ref>Eby, 88\u201389; Jung, 63; Trask, 102.</ref> On June 30, Black Hawk, [[Quashquame]], and other Sauk leaders met with Gaines and signed an agreement in which the Sauks promised to remain west of the Mississippi and to break off further contact with the British in Canada.<ref>Jung, 64; Trask, 105.</ref>\n\n==Black Hawk's return==\nBlack Hawk did not remain west of the Mississippi for long. In late 1831, [[Neapope]], a Sauk civil chief, returned from Fort Malden and told Black Hawk that the British and the other Illinois tribes were prepared to support the Sauks against the United States. Why Neapope made these claims, which would prove to be unfounded, is unclear. Historians have described Neapope's report to Black Hawk as \"wishful thinking\"<ref>Hall, 116.</ref> and the product of a \"fertile imagination\".<ref name=\"Jung, 66\">Jung, 66.</ref> Black Hawk welcomed the information, though he would later criticize Neapope for misleading him. He spent the winter in an unsuccessful attempt to recruit additional allies from other tribes and from Keokuk's followers.<ref>Jung, 69; Hall, 116.</ref>\n\nAccording to Neapope's erroneous report, [[Wabokieshiek]] (\"White Cloud\"), a shaman known to Americans as the \"Winnebago Prophet\", had claimed that other tribes were ready to support Black Hawk.<ref name=\"Jung, 66\"/> Wabokieshiek's mother was a [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago), but his father had belonged to a Sauk clan that provided the tribe's civil leaders. When Wabokieshiek joined the British Band in 1832, he would become the ranking Sauk civil chief in the group.<ref>Jung, 74.</ref> His village, [[Prophetstown, Illinois|Prophetstown]], was about thirty-five miles up the Rock River from Saukenuk.<ref>Trask, 63, 69.</ref> The village was inhabited by about 200<ref name=\"Jung, 56\"/> Ho-Chunks, Sauks, Meskwakis, Kickapoos, and Potawatomis who were dissatisfied with tribal leaders who refused to stand up to American expansion.<ref>Dowd, 193; Hall, 110.</ref> Although some Americans would later characterize Wabokieshiek as a primary instigator of the Black Hawk War, the Winnebago Prophet, according to historian John Hall, \"actually discouraged his followers from resorting to armed conflict with the whites\".<ref>Hall, 110.</ref>\n\nOn April 5, 1832, the British Band entered Illinois once again.<ref>Jung, 74; Hall, 116; Trask, 145, gives a more general date of \"probably April 6\".</ref> Numbering about 500 warriors and 600 non-combatants, they crossed near the mouth of the [[Iowa River]] over to Yellow Banks (present-day [[Oquawka, Illinois]]), and then headed north.<ref>Jung, 74\u201375; Trask, 145.</ref> Black Hawk's intentions upon reentering Illinois are not entirely clear, since reports from both white and Indian sources are conflicting. Some said that the British Band intended to reoccupy Saukenuk, while others said that the destination was Prophetstown.<ref>Trask, 149\u201350; Hall, 129\u201330.</ref> According to historian Kerry Trask, \"even Black Hawk may not have been sure where they were going and what they intended to do\".<ref>Trask, 150.</ref>\n\nAs the British Band moved into Illinois, American officials urged Wabokieshiek to advise Black Hawk to turn back. Previously, the Winnebago Prophet had encouraged Black Hawk to come to Prophetstown, arguing that the 1831 agreement made with General Gaines prohibited a return to Saukenuk, but did not  forbid the Sauks from moving to Prophetstown.<ref>Jung, 73; Trask, 146\u201347.</ref> Now, instead of telling Black Hawk to turn back, Wabokieshiek told him that, as long as the British Band remained peaceful, the Americans would have no choice but to let them settle at Prophetstown, especially if the British and the area tribes supported the band.<ref>Hall, 110; Jung, 73.</ref> Although the British Band traveled with armed guards as a security precaution, Black Hawk was probably hoping to avoid a war when he reentered Illinois. The presence of women, children, and the elderly indicated that the band was not a war party.<ref>Eby, 35; Jung, 74\u201375.</ref>\n\n==Intertribal war and American policy==\nAlthough the return of Black Hawk's band worried U.S. officials, they were at the time more concerned about the possibility of a war among the Native American tribes in the region.<ref>Jung 50, 70; Hall, 99\u2013100.</ref> Most accounts of the Black Hawk War focus on the conflict between Black Hawk and the United States, but historian John Hall argues that this overlooks the perspective of many Native American participants. According to Hall, \"the Black Hawk War also involved an intertribal conflict that had smoldered for decades\".<ref>Hall, 9.</ref> Tribes along the Upper Mississippi had long fought for control of diminishing hunting grounds, and the Black Hawk War provided an opportunity for some Natives to resume a war that had nothing to do with Black Hawk.<ref>Hall, 100.</ref>\n\nAfter having displaced the British as the dominant outside power following the War of 1812, the United States had assumed the role of mediator in intertribal disputes. Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal warfare. This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare made it more difficult for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as [[Indian removal]], which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s.<ref>Hall, 55, 95; Buckley, 165.</ref> U.S. efforts at mediation included multi-tribal treaty councils at [[Prairie du Chien]] in [[First Treaty of Prairie du Chien|1825]] and [[Fourth Treaty of Prairie du Chien|1830]], in which tribal boundaries were drawn.<ref>Buckley, 172\u201375; Hall, 77\u201378, 100\u201302.</ref> Native Americans sometimes resented American mediation, especially young men, for whom warfare was an important avenue of social advancement.<ref>Hall, 9, 24, 55, 237.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort armstrong.JPG|thumb|left|[[Fort Armstrong, Illinois|Fort Armstrong]] was located on Rock Island, which is now known as [[Rock Island Arsenal|Arsenal Island]]. The view is from the Illinois side, with Iowa in the background.]]\n\nThe situation was complicated by the American [[spoils system]]. After [[Andrew Jackson]] assumed the [[President of the United States|U.S. presidency]] in March 1829, many competent [[Indian agent]]s were replaced by unqualified Jackson loyalists, argues historian John Hall. Men like [[Thomas Forsyth (Indian agent)|Thomas Forsyth]], [[John Marsh (pioneer)|John Marsh]], and [[Thomas McKenney]] were replaced by less qualified men such as [[Felix St. Vrain]]. In the 19th century, historian [[Lyman Draper]] argued that the Black Hawk War could have been avoided had Forsyth remained as the agent to the Sauks.<ref>Hall, 103\u201304. Eby, 79, echoed the argument.</ref>\n\nIn 1830, violence threatened to undo American attempts at preventing intertribal warfare. In May, Dakotas ([[Santee Sioux]]) and [[Menominee]]s killed fifteen Meskwakis attending a treaty conference at Prairie du Chien. In retaliation, a party of Meskwakis and Sauks killed twenty-six Menominees, including women and children, at Prairie du Chien in July 1831.<ref>Jung, 49; Hall, 111.</ref> American officials discouraged the Menominees from seeking revenge, but the western bands of the tribe formed a coalition with the Dakotas to strike at the Sauks and Meskwakis.<ref>Hall, 113\u201315.</ref>\n\nHoping to prevent the outbreak of a wider war, American officials ordered the U.S. Army to arrest the Meskwakis who massacred the Menominees.<ref>Hall, 115; Jung, 49\u201350.</ref> General Gaines was ill, and so his subordinate, Brigadier General [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]], received the assignment.<ref>Hall, 115; Jung, 70.</ref> Atkinson was a middle-aged officer who had ably handled administrative and diplomatic tasks, most notably during the 1827 [[Winnebago War]], but he had never seen combat.<ref>Hall, 115; Jung, 71\u201372; Trask, 143.</ref> On April 8, he set out from [[Jefferson Barracks]] in Missouri, moving up the Mississippi River by steamboat with about 220 soldiers. By chance, Black Hawk and his British Band had just crossed into Illinois. Although Atkinson did not realize it, his boats passed Black Hawk's band.<ref>Trask, 146.</ref>\n\nWhen Atkinson arrived at [[Fort Armstrong, Illinois|Fort Armstrong]] on [[Rock Island Arsenal|Rock Island]] on April 12, he learned that the British Band was in Illinois, and that most of the Meskwakis he wanted to arrest were now with the band.<ref>Hall, 117; Jung, 75.</ref> Like other American officials, Atkinson was convinced that the British Band intended to start a war. Because he had few troops at his disposal, Atkinson hoped to get support from the Illinois state militia. He wrote to Governor Reynolds on April 13, describing\u2014and perhaps purposely exaggerating\u2014the threat that the British Band posed.<ref>Jung, 76; Trask, 158\u201359.</ref> Reynolds, who was eager for a war to drive the Indians out of the state, responded as Atkinson had hoped: he called for militia volunteers to assemble at [[Beardstown, Illinois|Beardstown]] by April 22 to begin a thirty-day enlistment. The 2,100 men who volunteered were organized into a brigade of five regiments under Brigadier General [[Samuel Whiteside]].<ref>Jung, 79\u201380; Trask, 174.</ref> Among the militiamen was [[Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War|23-year-old Abraham Lincoln]], who was elected captain of his company.<ref>Jung, 79.</ref>\n\n==Initial diplomacy==\n[[File:Shabbona (chief)1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Potawatomi]] chief [[Shabbona]] tried to keep his tribe out of the war.]]\n\nAfter Atkinson's arrival at Rock Island on April 12, 1832, he, Keokuk, and Meskwaki chief [[Wapello (chief)|Wapello]] sent emissaries to the British Band, which was now ascending the Rock River. Black Hawk rejected the messages advising him to turn back.<ref>Jung, 76\u201377; Nichols, 117\u201318.</ref> Colonel [[Zachary Taylor]], a regular army officer who served under Atkinson, later stated that Atkinson should have made an attempt to stop the British Band by force. Some historians have agreed, arguing that Atkinson could have prevented the outbreak of war with more decisive action or astute diplomacy. Cecil Eby charged that \"Atkinson was a paper general, unwilling to proceed until all risk had been eliminated\".<ref>Eby, 93.</ref> Kerry Trask, however, argued that Atkinson was correct in believing that he did not yet have enough troops to stop the British Band.<ref>Trask, 152\u201355.</ref> According to Patrick Jung, leaders on both sides had little chance of avoiding bloodshed at this point, because the militiamen and some of Black Hawk's warriors were spoiling for a fight.<ref>Jung, 86.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Black Hawk learned that the [[Ho-Chunk]] and [[Potawatomi]] tribes were less supportive than anticipated. As in other tribes, different bands of these tribes often pursued different policies.<ref>Hall, 10\u201311.</ref> The Ho-Chunks who lived along the Rock River in Illinois had family ties to the Sauks; they cautiously supported the British Band while trying not to provoke the Americans.<ref>Hall, 131.</ref> Ho-Chunks in Wisconsin were more divided. Some bands, remembering their loss to the Americans in the 1827 [[Winnebago War]], decided to stay clear of the conflict. Other Ho-Chunks with ties to the Dakotas and Menominees, most notably [[Waukon Decorah]] and his brothers, were eager to fight against the British Band.<ref>Hall, 122\u201323; Jung, 78\u201379.</ref>\n\nMost Potawatomis wanted to remain neutral in the conflict, but found it difficult to do so.<ref>Hall, 125.</ref> Many white settlers, recalling the [[Fort Dearborn massacre]] of 1812, distrusted the Potawatomis and assumed that they would join Black Hawk's uprising.<ref>Hall, 122.</ref> Potawatomi leaders worried that the tribe as a whole would be punished if any Potawatomis supported Black Hawk. At a council outside Chicago on May 1, 1832, Potawatomi leaders including [[Billy Caldwell]] \"passed a resolution declaring any Potawatomi who supported Black Hawk a traitor to his tribe\".<ref>Hall, 132.</ref> In mid May, Potawatomi chiefs [[Shabonna]] and [[Waubonsie]] told Black Hawk that neither they nor the British would come to his aid.<ref>Jung, 86\u201387; Edmunds, 236.</ref>\n\nWithout British supplies, adequate provisions, or Native allies, Black Hawk realized that his band was in serious trouble.<ref>Jung, 83\u201384; Nichols, 120; Trask, 180\u201381.</ref> By some accounts, he was ready to negotiate with Atkinson to end the crisis, but an ill-fated encounter with Illinois militiamen would end all possibility of a peaceful resolution.<ref>Hall, 133.</ref>\n\n==Stillman's Run==\n{{main|Battle of Stillman's Run}}\n[[File:Major Isaiah Stillman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Isaiah Stillman]], militia commander at the [[Battle of Stillman's Run]]]]\n\nGeneral [[Samuel Whiteside]]'s militia brigade had been mustered into federal service at Rock Island under General Atkinson in late April, and divided into a scout or spy battalion commanded by [[James D. Henry]], as well as four regiments (commanded by Colonels John DeWitt, Jacob Fry, John Thomas and Samuel M. Thompson),<ref>Harrington, George B. Past and Present of [[Bureau County, Illinois]]. Chicago, IL, USA: Pioneer Publishing (1906) p. 39 </ref> with judge William Thomas as their quartermaster. Atkinson had allowed Reynolds, Whiteside, and the militiamen to leave up the Rock River on April 27, while he brought up the rear with the regular soldiers, directing his least trained and disciplined men\u2014to \"move upon the Indians should they be within striking distance without waiting for my arrival\".<ref name=\"Jung, 84\">Jung, 84.</ref><ref>[[Thomas Ford (politician)|Thomas Ford]], A History of Illinois: from its commencement as a state in 1818 to 1847 (annotated and introduced by Rodney O Davis; University of Illinois Press 1995) pp. 76-77</ref> Governor Reynolds accompanied the expedition as a major general of militia. \n\nOn May 10 the militia marching up the Rock River in pursuit of the British Band reached Prophetstown (about 35 miles from their starting point at the confluence). Rather than wait per Atkinson's plan, they burned White Cloud's empty village before proceeding about 40 miles upriver to Dixon's Ferry, where they waited for Atkinson and his troops.<ref>Prophetstown State Park brochure, available at https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/publications/Documents/00000097.pdf</ref><ref>Ford p. 78</ref> Although Reynolds wanted to allow the 260 eager militiamen not yet federalized to continue further as scouts, the cautious Whiteside insisted on waiting for Atkinson at the settlement.<ref>Jung, 85\u201386.</ref> Dixon's Ferry had actually been established in 1826 by Ogee, of half-native ancestry, where the wagon trail connecting Peoria to the lead mines in Galena crossed the Rock River; settlers has established cabins along the Peoria/Galena trace and at the crossing, so that by 1829 its post office served settlers up the river as far as Rockford.<ref>William V. Pooley, Settlement of Illinois, 1830-1850 (Thesis submitted to the University of Wisconsin in 1905; printed at Ann Arbor, Michigan, University Microfilms in 1968) p. 147</ref>\n\nOn May 12, learning that Black Hawk's band was only twenty-five miles away, eager militiamen led by Major [[Isaiah Stillman]] left Whiteside's encampment, making another camp on a tributary of the Rock River later named  [[Stillman Valley, Illinois|Stillman Valley]] after him. Seeing a small party of natives with a red flag, Major Samuel Hackelton and some men pursued without waiting for orders, and Hackelton killed a native before returning to Whiteside's camp with the news.<ref>Ford p. 78</ref> However, Black Hawk and others were nearby, and near dusk on May 14 attacked Stillman's party in what became known as the [[Battle of Stillman's Run]]. Accounts of the battle vary.<ref>Jung, 88; Trask, 183.</ref> Black Hawk later stated that he sent three men under a white flag to parley, but the Americans imprisoned them and opened fire on a second group of emissaries who followed. Some militiamen claimed they never saw a white flag; others believed that the flag was a ruse the Indians used to set an ambush.<ref>Jung, 88\u201389; Trask, 186.</ref> All accounts agree that Black Hawk's warriors attacked the militia camp at dusk, that the much more numerous militia were routed, and stragglers reached Whiteside's camp. To Black Hawk's surprise, his forty warriors killed twelve Illinois militiamen; his British Band suffered only three fatalities.<ref>Jung, 89; Hall, 133\u201334.</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Stillman's Run proved a turning point. Before the battle, Black Hawk had not committed to war. Now he determined to avenge what he saw as the treacherous killing of his warriors under a flag of truce.<ref>Jung, 89.</ref> Whiteside too was incensed when he returned to the battle site with a burial party and viewed the mutilated corpses. <ref>\"Battle of Stillman's Run\" in William B. Kessell, Encyclopedia of Native American Wars and Warfare (2005), available online</ref>  After Stillman's defeat, American leaders like President Jackson and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Lewis Cass]] refused to consider a diplomatic solution; they wanted a resounding victory over Black Hawk to serve as an example to other Native Americans who might consider similar uprisings.<ref>Jung, 118\u201320.</ref>\n\n==Initial raids==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear:right\"\n|-\n| {{Black Hawk War Map}}\n|-\n|Map of Black Hawk War sites<br />[[File:Red Battle X.png|8px|link=]] <small>Battle (with name)</small> [[File:Red pog.svg|7px|link=]] <small>Fort / settlement</small> [[File:Green pog.svg|7px|link=]] <small>Native village</small><br /><small>Symbols are wikilinked to article</small>\n|}\n\nWith hostilities now underway, and few allies to depend upon, Black Hawk sought a place of refuge for the women, children, and elderly in his band. Accepting an offer from the Rock River Ho-Chunks, the band traveled further upriver to [[Lake Koshkonong]] in the [[Michigan Territory]] and camped in an isolated place known as the \"Island\".<ref>Jung, 93\u201394.</ref> With the non-combatants secure, members of the British Band, with a number of Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi allies, began raiding white settlers.<ref>Jung, 94, 108.</ref> Not all Native Americans in the region supported this turn of events; most notably, Potawatomi chief [[Shabonna]] rode throughout the settlements, warning whites of the impending attacks.<ref>Edmunds, 237; Trask, 200; Jung, 95.</ref>\n\nThe initial raiding parties consisted primarily of Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi warriors. The first attack came on May 19, 1832, when Ho-Chunks [[Buffalo Grove ambush|ambushed six men]] near [[Buffalo Grove, Illinois (Ogle County)|Buffalo Grove, Illinois]], killing a man named William Durley.<ref>Jung, 95; Trask, 198.</ref> Durley's [[scalping|scalped]] and mutilated body was found by Indian agent [[Felix St. Vrain]]. The Indian agent was himself [[St. Vrain massacre|killed and mutilated]], along with three other men, several days later at [[Kellogg's Grove]].<ref>Jung, 97; Trask, 198\u201399.</ref>\n\nThe Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis who took part in the war were sometimes motivated by grievances not directly related to Black Hawk's objectives.<ref name=\"Jung, 95\">Jung, 95.</ref> One such incident was the [[Indian Creek massacre]]. In the spring of 1832, Potawatomis living along Indian Creek were upset that a settler named William Davis had dammed the creek, preventing fish from reaching their village. Davis ignored the protests, and assaulted a Potawatomi man who tried to dismantle the dam.<ref>Hall, 135\u201336.</ref> The Black Hawk War provided the Indian Creek Potawatomis with an opportunity for revenge. On May 21, about fifty Potawatomis and three Sauks from the British Band attacked Davis's settlement, killing, scalping, and mutilating fifteen men, women, and children.<ref>Jung, 95; Trask, 202.</ref> Two teenage girls from the settlement were kidnapped and taken to Black Hawk's camp.<ref>Jung, 96; Trask, 215.</ref> A Ho-Chunk chief named White Crow negotiated their release two weeks later.<ref>Trask, 212\u201317.</ref> Like other Rock River Ho-Chunks, White Crow was trying to placate the Americans while clandestinely aiding the British Band.<ref>Hall, 152\u201354; 164\u201365.</ref>\n\n==American reorganization==\nNews of Stillman's defeat, the Indian Creek massacre, and other smaller attacks triggered panic among the white population. Many settlers fled to [[Chicago]], then a small town, which became overcrowded with hungry refugees.<ref>Trask, 200\u201306; Jung, 97.</ref> Many Potawatomis also fled towards Chicago, not wanting to get caught in the conflict nor be mistaken for hostiles.<ref>Edmunds, 238; Jung, 103.</ref> Throughout the region, settlers hurriedly organized militia units and built small forts.<ref>Jung, 96.</ref>\n\nAfter Stillman's defeat on May 14, the regulars and militia continued up the Rock River to search for Black Hawk. The militiamen became discouraged at not being able to find the British Band. When they heard about the Indian raids, many deserted so that they could return home to defend their families.<ref>Trask, 194\u201396.</ref> As morale plummeted, Governor Reynolds asked his militia officers to vote on whether to continue the campaign. General Whiteside, disgusted with the performance of his men, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of disbanding.<ref>Jung, 100; Trask, 196.</ref> Most of Whiteside's brigade disbanded at [[Ottawa, Illinois]], on May 28. About 300 men, including Abraham Lincoln, agreed to remain in the field for twenty more days until a new militia force could be organized.<ref>Jung, 101; Trask, 196\u201397.</ref>\n\nAs Whiteside's brigade disbanded, Atkinson organized a new force in June 1832 that he dubbed the \"Army of the Frontier\".<ref>Jung, 115.</ref> The army consisted of 629 regular army infantrymen and 3,196 mounted militia volunteers. The militia was divided into three brigades commanded by Brigadier Generals [[Alexander Posey (general)|Alexander Posey]], [[Milton Alexander]], and [[James D. Henry]]. Since many men were assigned to local patrols and guard duties, Atkinson had only 450 regulars and 2,100 militiamen available for campaigning.<ref>Jung, 114\u201315.</ref> Many more militiamen served in units that were not part of the Army of the Frontier's three brigades. Abraham Lincoln, for example, reenlisted as a private in an independent company that was taken into federal service. [[Henry Dodge]], a Michigan territorial militia colonel who would prove to be one of the best commanders in the war,<ref>Jung, 103.</ref> fielded a battalion of mounted volunteers that numbered 250 men at its strongest. The overall number of militiamen who took part in the war is not precisely known; the total from Illinois alone has been estimated at six to seven thousand.<ref>Jung, 116.</ref>\n\nIn addition to organizing a new militia army, Atkinson also began to recruit Native American allies, reversing the previous American policy of trying to prevent intertribal warfare.<ref>Hall, 143\u201345.</ref> Menominees, Dakotas, and some Ho-Chunks bands were eager to go to war against the British Band. By June 6, agent [[Joseph M. Street]] had assembled about 225 Natives at Prairie du Chien.<ref>Hall, 148.</ref> This force included about eighty Dakotas under [[Wapasha II|Wabasha]] and L'Arc, forty Menominees, and several bands of Ho Chunks.<ref>Hall, 148; Jung 104.</ref> Although the Indian warriors followed their own leaders, Atkinson placed the force under the nominal command of [[William S. Hamilton]], a militia colonel and a son of [[Alexander Hamilton]]. Hamilton would prove to be an unfortunate choice to lead the force; historian John Hall characterized him as \"pretentious and unqualified\".<ref>Hall, 145.</ref> Before long, the Indians became frustrated with marching around under Hamilton and not seeing any action. Some Menominee scouts remained, but most of the Natives eventually left Hamilton and fought the war on their own terms.<ref>Hall, 162\u201363; Jung, 105.</ref>\n\n==June raids==\nIn June 1832, after hearing that Atkinson was forming a new army, Black Hawk began sending out raiding parties. Perhaps hoping to lead the Americans away from his camp at Lake Koshkonong, he targeted areas to the west.<ref>Jung, 108.</ref> The first major attack occurred on June 14 near present-day [[South Wayne, Wisconsin]], when a band of about 30 warriors attacked a group of farmers, [[Spafford Farm massacre|killing and scalping four]].<ref>Jung, 109.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pecatonica Battleground1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Painting of rolling hills, a river, and trees|An 1857 painting of the battlefield at Horseshoe Bend]]\n\nResponding to this attack, militia Colonel Henry Dodge gathered a force of twenty-nine mounted volunteers and set out in pursuit of the attackers. On June 16, Dodge and his men cornered about eleven of the raiders at a bend in the [[Pecatonica River]]. In a brief battle, the Americans killed and scalped all of the Natives.<ref>Jung, 109\u201310; Trask, 233\u201334.</ref> The [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1832)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] (or Battle of Pecatonica) was the first real American victory in the war, and helped restore public confidence in the volunteer militia force.<ref>Jung, 110; Trask, 234\u201337.</ref>\n\nOn the same day of Dodge's victory, another skirmish took place at [[Kellogg's Grove]] in present-day [[Stephenson County, Illinois]]. American forces had occupied Kellogg's Grove in an effort to intercept war parties raiding to the west. In the [[First Battle of Kellogg's Grove]], militia commanded by [[Adam W. Snyder]] pursued a British Band raiding party of about thirty warriors. Three Illinois militiamen and six Native warriors died in the fighting.<ref>Jung, 111\u201312.</ref> Two days later, on June 18, militia under [[James W. Stephenson]] encountered what was probably the same war party near [[Yellow Creek (Illinois)|Yellow Creek]]. The [[Battle of Waddams Grove]] became a hard fought, hand-to-hand melee. Three militiamen and five or six Indians were killed in the action.<ref>Jung, 112; Trask, 220\u201321.</ref>\n\nBack on June 6, when a civilian miner was killed by raiders near the village of [[Blue Mounds, Wisconsin|Blue Mounds]] in the Michigan Territory, residents began to fear that the Rock River Ho-Chunks were joining the war.<ref>Trask, 220.</ref> On June 20, a Ho-Chunk raiding party estimated by one eyewitness to be as large as 100 warriors [[Attacks at Fort Blue Mounds|attacked the settler fort]] at Blue Mounds. Two militiamen were killed in the attack, one of whom was badly mutilated.<ref>Jung, 112; Trask, 220.</ref>\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Il Apple River Fort2.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A wooden stockade fronted by a wall of vertically-placed logs and a corner blockhouse|Replica of Apple River Fort in Elizabeth, Illinois]]\n\nOn June 24, 1832, Black Hawk and about 200 warriors attacked at the hastily constructed [[Apple River Fort]], near present-day [[Elizabeth, Illinois]]. Local settlers, warned of Black Hawk's approach, took refuge in the fort, which was defended by about 20<ref name=\"Trask, 222\">Trask, 222.</ref> to 35<ref>Jung, 113.</ref> militiamen. The [[Battle of Apple River Fort]] lasted about forty-five minutes. The women and girls inside the fort, under the direction of [[Elizabeth Armstrong (settler)|Elizabeth Armstrong]], loaded muskets and molded bullets.<ref name=\"Trask, 222\"/> After losing several men, Black Hawk broke off the siege, looted the nearby homes, and headed back towards his camp.<ref>Jung, 114.</ref>\n\nThe next day, June 25, Black Hawk's party encountered a militia battalion commanded by Major [[John Dement]]. In the [[Second Battle of Kellogg's Grove]], Black Hawk's warriors drove the militiamen inside their fort and commenced a two-hour siege. After losing nine warriors and killing five militiamen, Black Hawk broke off the siege and returned to his main camp at Lake Koshkonong.<ref>Jung, 121\u201323.</ref> This would prove to be Black Hawk's last military success in the war. With his band running low on food, he decided to take them back across the Mississippi.<ref>Jung, 124.</ref>\n\n==Final campaign==\nOn June 15, 1832, President [[Andrew Jackson]], displeased with Atkinson's handling of the war, appointed General [[Winfield Scott]] to take command.<ref>Jung, 118; Trask, 272.</ref> Scott gathered about 950 troops from eastern army posts just as a [[Second cholera pandemic|cholera pandemic]] had spread to eastern North America.<ref>Jung, 139.</ref> As Scott's troops traveled by steamboat from [[Buffalo, New York]], across the Great Lakes towards Chicago, his men started getting sick from cholera, with many of them dying. At each place the vessels landed, the sick were deposited and soldiers deserted. By the time the last steamboat landed in Chicago, Scott had only about 350 effective soldiers left.<ref>Jung, 140\u201341; Trask, 271\u201375.</ref> On July 29, Scott began a hurried journey west, ahead of his troops, eager to take command of what was certain to be the war's final campaign, but he would be too late to see any combat.<ref>Jung, 141; Trask, 276.</ref>\n\nGeneral Atkinson, who learned in early July that Scott would be taking command, hoped to bring the war to a successful conclusion before Scott's arrival.<ref>Jung, 130.</ref> The Americans had difficulty locating the British Band, however, thanks in part to false intelligence given to them by area Native Americans. Potawatomis and Ho-Chunks in Illinois, many of whom had sought to remain neutral in the war, decided to cooperate with the Americans. Tribal leaders knew that some of their warriors had aided the British Band, and so they hoped that a highly visible show of support for the Americans would dissuade U.S. officials from punishing the tribes after the conflict was over. Wearing white headbands to distinguish themselves from hostile Natives, Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis served as guides for Atkinson's army.<ref>Edmunds, 239; Hall, 244\u201349.</ref> Ho-Chunks sympathetic to the plight of Black Hawk's people misled Atkinson into thinking that the British Band was still at Lake Koshkonong. While Atkinson's men were trudging through the swamps and running low on provisions, the British Band had in fact relocated miles to the north.<ref>Jung, 131\u201334.</ref> Potawatomis under Billy Caldwell also managed to demonstrate support for the Americans while avoiding battle.<ref>Hall, 165\u201367.</ref>\n\nIn mid-July, Colonel Dodge learned from m\u00e9tis trader Pierre Paquette that the British Band was camped near the Rock River rapids, at present [[Hustisford, Wisconsin]].<ref>Jung, 142.</ref> Dodge and [[James D. Henry]] set out in pursuit from [[Fort Winnebago]] on July 15.<ref>Jung, 144.</ref> The British Band, reduced to fewer than 600 people due to death and desertion, headed for the Mississippi River as the militia approached.<ref>Jung, 146\u201348.</ref> The Americans pursued them, killing and scalping several Native stragglers along the way.<ref>Jung, 149\u201350.</ref>\n\n===Wisconsin Heights===\n{{Main|Battle of Wisconsin Heights}}\n\nOn July 21, 1832, the militiamen caught up with the British Band near present-day [[Sauk City, Wisconsin]]. To buy time for the noncombatants to cross the Wisconsin River, Black Hawk and Neapope confronted the Americans in a rear guard action that became known as the [[Battle of Wisconsin Heights]]. Black Hawk was desperately outnumbered, leading about 50 Sauks and 60 to 70 Kickapoos against 750 militiamen.<ref>Jung, 153\u201356.</ref> The battle was a lopsided victory for the militiamen, who lost only one man while killing as many as 68 of Black Hawk's warriors.<ref>Jung, 156; Trask, 260\u201361.</ref> Despite the high casualties, the battle allowed much of the British Band, including many women and children, to escape across the river.<ref name=\"lewis\">{{cite web|url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2c.html |title=The Black Hawk War of 1832 |last=Lewis |first=James |work=Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project |publisher=Northern Illinois University |page=2c |accessdate=2009-08-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815021319/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2c.html |archivedate=2009-08-15 }}</ref> Black Hawk had managed to hold off a much larger force while allowing most of his people to escape, a difficult military operation that impressed some U.S. Army officers when they learned of it.<ref>Jung, 157.</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Wisconsin Heights had been a victory for the militia; no regular soldiers of the U.S. Army had been present.<ref>Jung, 156.</ref> Atkinson and the regulars joined up with the volunteers several days after the battle. With a force of about 400 regulars and 900 militiamen, the Americans crossed the Wisconsin River on July 27 and resumed the pursuit of the British Band.<ref>Jung, 161; Trask, 268.</ref> The British Band was moving slow, encumbered with wounded warriors and people dying of starvation. The Americans followed the trail of dead bodies, cast off equipment, and the remains of horses the hungry Natives had eaten.<ref>Jung, 162; Trask, 270\u201371.</ref>\n\n===Bad Axe===\n{{Main|Battle of Bad Axe}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a messenger from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band was going back across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No one in the American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret.<ref>Nichols, 131; Trask, 266.</ref> Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, and that they had not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.<ref>Jung, 168\u201369.</ref>\n\n[[File: Battle of Bad Axe.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Native American women and children fleeing for their lives, preparing to cross the Mississippi River, during Black Hawk's defeat at the [[Battle of Bad Axe]]]]\n\nThe Americans, however, had no intentions of letting the British Band escape. The [[Warrior (steamboat)|''Warrior'']], a steamboat outfitted with an artillery piece, patrolled the Mississippi River, while American-allied Dakotas, Menominees, and Ho-Chunks watched the banks.<ref>Hall, 192\u201394.</ref> On August 1, the ''Warrior'' arrived at the mouth of the [[Bad Axe River]], where the Dakotas told the Americans that they would find Black Hawk's people.<ref>Jung, 164\u201365; Hall, 194.</ref> Black Hawk raised a white flag in an attempt to surrender, but his intentions may have been garbled in translation.<ref>Jung, 165; Nichols, 133.</ref> The Americans, in no mood to accept a surrender anyway, thought that the Indians were using the white flag to set an ambush. When they became certain that the Natives on land were the British Band, they opened fire. Twenty-three Natives were killed in the exchange of gunfire, while just one soldier on the ''Warrior'' was injured.<ref>Jung, 166; Trask, 279.</ref>\n\n[[File:1832 Battle of Bad Axe and steamboat Warrior.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The steamboat ''[[Warrior (steamboat)|Warrior]]'' firing upon escaping Native Americans trying to get across the Mississippi River to safety in Iowa]]\n\nAfter the ''Warrior'' left, Black Hawk decided to seek refuge in the north with the [[Ojibwe]]s. Only about 50 people, including Wabokieshiek, agreed to go with him; the others remained, determined to cross the Mississippi and return to Sauk territory.<ref>Jung, 166; Nichols, 133. Jung says \"about 60 people\" left with Black Hawk; Nichols, 135, estimated \"perhaps forty\".</ref> The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north when he learned that the American army had closed in on the members of the British Band who were trying to cross the Mississippi.<ref name=\"Jung, 169\">Jung, 169.</ref> He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day [[Victory, Wisconsin]], he gave up the attempt.<ref name=\"Jung, 169\"/> Sauk chief [[Weesheet]] later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for abandoning the people during the final battle of the war.<ref>Jung, 180\u201381; Trask, 282.</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Bad Axe]] began at about 9:00 am on August 2 after the Americans caught up with the remnants of the British Band a few miles downstream from the mouth of the Bad Axe River. The British Band was reduced to roughly 500 people by this time, including about 150 warriors.<ref>Jung, 170.</ref> The warriors fought with the Americans while the Native noncombatants frantically tried to cross the river. Many made it to one of the two nearby islands, but were dislodged after the steamboat ''Warrior'' returned at noon, carrying regulars and Menominees allied with the Americans.<ref>Trask, 286\u201387; Jung, 170\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe battle was another lopsided victory for the Americans, who lost just 14 men, including one Menominee who died by [[friendly fire]] and was buried with honors alongside the white soldiers.<ref>Jung, 171\u201372; Hall, 196.</ref> At least 260 members of the British Band were killed, including about 110 who drowned while trying to cross the river. Although the regular soldiers of the U.S. Army generally tried to avoid needless bloodshed, many of the militiamen intentionally killed Native noncombatants, sometimes in cold blood.<ref>Trask, 285\u201386, 293.</ref> The encounter was, in the words of historian Patrick Jung, \"less of a battle and more of a massacre\".<ref name=\"Jung, 172\"/>\n\nMenominees from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], who had mobilized a battalion of nearly 300 men, arrived too late for the battle. They were upset at having missed the chance to fight their old enemies, and so on August 10, General Scott sent 100 of them after a part of the British Band that had escaped.<ref>Hall, 197.</ref> Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not to take any scalps, but Chief Grizzly Bear insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced.<ref>Hall, 198.</ref> The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but spared the women and children.<ref>Hall, 199.</ref>\n\nThe Dakotas, who had volunteered 150 warriors to fight against the Sauks and Meskwakis, also arrived too late to participate in the Battle of Bad Axe, but they pursued the members of the British Band who made it across the Mississippi into Iowa. On about August 9, in the final engagement of the war,<ref>Hall, 202.</ref> they attacked the remnants of the British Band along the [[Cedar River (Iowa River)|Cedar River]], killing 68 and taking 22 prisoners.<ref>Jung, 175; Hall, 201.</ref> Ho-Chunks also hunted survivors of the British Band, taking between fifty and sixty scalps.<ref>Jung, 177; Hall, 210\u201311.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Black Hawk War resulted in the deaths of 77 white settlers, militiamen, and regular soldiers.<ref name=\"Jung, 172\">Jung, 172.</ref> This figure does not include the deaths from cholera suffered by the relief force under General Winfield Scott. Estimates of how many members of the British Band died during the conflict range from about 450 to 600, or about half of the 1,100 people who entered Illinois with Black Hawk in 1832.<ref>Jung, 172, 179.</ref>\n\nA number of American men with political ambitions fought in the Black Hawk War. At least seven future [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]]s took part, as did four future Illinois governors; future governors of Michigan, Nebraska, and the [[Wisconsin Territory]]; and one future U.S. president.<ref name=\"lewis2d\">{{cite web|url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2d.html|title=The Black Hawk War of 1832|last=Lewis|first=James|work=Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project|publisher=Northern Illinois University|page=2d|accessdate=2009-08-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619071514/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/blackhawk/page2d.html|archivedate=2009-06-19}}</ref> The Black Hawk War demonstrated to American officials the need for mounted troops to fight a mounted foe. During the war, the U.S. Army did not have cavalry; the only mounted soldiers were part-time volunteers. After the war, Congress created the [[US Army Rangers#Black Hawk War|Mounted Ranger Battalion]] under the command of [[Henry Dodge]], which was expanded to the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment]] in 1833.<ref>Jung 205\u201306.</ref>\n\n===Black Hawk's imprisonment and legacy===\n[[File:Black hawk statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Black Hawk, [[Black Hawk State Historic Site]]]]\n\nAfter the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, and their followers traveled northeast to seek refuge with the Ojibwes. American officials offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture.<ref>Jung, 181.</ref> While camping near present-day [[Tomah, Wisconsin]], Black Hawk's party was seen by a passing Ho-Chunk man, who alerted his village chief. The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and convinced him to surrender to the Americans. On August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street.<ref>Jung, 182; Trask, 294\u201395.</ref> Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, and sent them by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]].<ref>Jung, 183.</ref>\n\nBy war's end, Black Hawk and nineteen other leaders of the British Band were incarcerated at Jefferson Barracks. Most of the prisoners were released in the succeeding months, but in April 1833, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, Neapope, and three others were transferred to [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia, which was better equipped to hold prisoners.<ref>Jung, 190\u201391.</ref> The American public was eager to catch a glimpse of the captured Indians. Large crowds gathered in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and [[Cincinnati]] to watch them pass.<ref>Trask, 298; Jung, 192.</ref> On April 26, the prisoners met briefly with President Jackson in [[Washington, D.C.]], before being taken to Fort Monroe.<ref>Jung, 192; Trask, 298.</ref> Even in prison they were treated as celebrities: they posed for portraits by artists such as [[Charles Bird King]] and [[John Wesley Jarvis]], and a dinner was held in their honor before they left.<ref>Nichols, 147; Trask, 298.</ref>\n\nAmerican officials decided to release the prisoners after a few weeks. First, however, the Natives were required to visit several large U.S. cities on the east coast. This was a tactic often used when Native American leaders came to the East, because it was thought that a demonstration of the size and power of the United States would discourage future resistance to U.S. expansion.<ref>Jung, 191; Nichols, 148; Trask, 300.</ref> Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were taken on a tour of [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]]. They attended dinners and plays, and were shown a battleship, various public buildings, and a military parade. Huge crowds gathered to see them. Black Hawk's handsome son Nasheweskaska (Whirling Thunder) was a particular favorite.<ref>Jung, 195\u201397; Nichols, 148\u201349; Trask, 300\u201301.</ref> Reaction in the west, however, was less welcoming. When the prisoners traveled through [[Detroit]] on their way home, one crowd burned and hanged [[effigies]] of the Indians.<ref>Trask, 301\u201302; Jung, 197.</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Kerry Trask, Black Hawk and his fellow prisoners were treated like celebrities because the Indians served as a living embodiment of the [[noble savage]] myth that had become popular in the eastern United States. Then and later, argues Trask, white Americans absolved themselves of complicity in the dispossession of Native Americans by expressing admiration or sympathy for defeated Indians like Black Hawk.<ref>Trask, 298\u2013303.</ref> The mythologizing of Black Hawk continued, argues Trask, with the many plaques and memorials that were later erected in his honor. \"Indeed,\" writes Trask, \"most of the reconstructed memory of the Black Hawk War has been designed to make white people feel good about themselves.\"<ref>Trask, 308.</ref> Black Hawk also became an admired symbol of resistance among Native Americans, even among descendants of those who had opposed him.\n\n===Treaties and removals===\nThe Black Hawk War marked the end of Native armed resistance to U.S. expansion in the [[Northwest Territory|Old Northwest]]<ref>Buckley, 210; Hall, 255; Jung, 208.</ref> The war provided an opportunity for American officials such as Andrew Jackson, Lewis Cass, and John Reynolds to compel Native American tribes to sell their lands east of the Mississippi River and move to the West, a policy known as [[Indian removal]]. Officials conducted a number of treaties after the war to purchase the remaining Native American land claims in the Old Northwest. The Dakotas and Menominees, who won approval from American officials for their role in the war, largely avoided postwar removal pressure until later decades.<ref>Hall, 207.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, American officials learned that some Ho-Chunks had aided Black Hawk more than had been previously known.<ref>Hall, 209\u201310.</ref> Eight Ho-Chunks were briefly imprisoned at Fort Winnebago for their role in the war, but charges against them were eventually dropped due to a lack of witnesses.<ref>Jung, 207.</ref> In September 1832, General Scott and Governor Reynolds conducted a treaty with the Ho-Chunks at Rock Island. The Ho-Chunks ceded all their land south of the Wisconsin River in exchange for a forty-mile strip of land in Iowa and annual payments of $10,000 for twenty-seven years.<ref>Hall, 212\u201313; Jung, 285\u201386.</ref> The land in Iowa was known as the \"Neutral Ground\" because it had been designated in 1830 as a buffer zone between the Dakotas and their enemies to the south, the Sauks and Meskwakis.<ref>Jung, 49; Buckley, 203.</ref> Scott hoped that the settlement of the Ho-Chunks in the Neutral Ground would help keep the peace.<ref name=\"Jung, 186\">Jung, 186.</ref> Ho-Chunks remaining in Wisconsin were pressured to sign a removal treaty in 1837, even though leaders such as Waukon Decorah had been U.S. allies during the Black Hawk War. General Atkinson was assigned to use the army to forcibly relocate those Ho-Chunks who refused to move to Iowa.<ref>Hall, 259\u201361.</ref>\n\nFollowing the September 1832 treaty with the Ho-Chunks, Scott and Reynolds conducted another with the Sauks and Meskwakis, with Keokuk and Wapello serving as the primary representatives of their tribes. Scott told the assembled chiefs that \"if a particular part of a nation goes out of their country, and makes war, the whole nation is responsible\".<ref name=\"Jung, 186\"/> The tribes sold about 6 million acres (24,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of [[Black Hawk Purchase|land in eastern Iowa]] to the United States for payments of $20,000 per year for thirty years, among other provisions.<ref>Trask, 304; Jung, 187.</ref> Keokuk was granted a [[Indian reservation|reservation]] within the cession and recognized by the Americans as the primary chief of the Sauks and Meskwakis.<ref>Jung, 187.</ref> The tribes sold the reservation to the United States in 1836, and additional land in Iowa the following year.<ref>Jung, 198.</ref> Their last lands in Iowa were sold in 1842, and most of the Natives moved to a reservation in Kansas.<ref>Jung, 201\u201302.</ref>\n\nThanks to the decision of Potawatomi leaders to aid the U.S. during the war, American officials did not seize tribal land as [[war reparations]]. Instead, only three individuals accused of leading the Indian Creek massacre were tried in court; they were acquitted.<ref>Edmunds, 238; Hall, 208, 215.</ref> Nevertheless, the drive to purchase Potawatomi land west of the Mississippi began in October 1832, when [[Treaty of Tippecanoe|commissioners in Indiana]] bought a large amount of Potawatomi land, even though not all Potawatomi bands were represented at the treaty.<ref>Hall, 215\u201316.</ref> The tribe was compelled to sell their remaining land west of the Mississippi in a [[Treaty of Chicago|treaty held in Chicago]] in September 1833.<ref>Edmunds, 247\u201348; Hall, 231.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Black Hawk War}}\n* [[Abraham Lincoln in the Black Hawk War]]\n* [[Second Black Hawk War]]\n* [[American Indian Wars]]\n* [[Sixty Years' War]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n===Secondary sources===\n* Buckley, Jay H.
