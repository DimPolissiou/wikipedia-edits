It is close to the main terminus of the [[M180 motorway|A180]], which ends in Cleethorpes.\n\nGrimsby lies in the [[national character area]]s of the Humber, and the Lincolnshire coast and Marshes; it is predominantly low in topography. The town was historically settled on low-lying islands and raised areas of the Humber marsh, and subsequently expanded onto the surrounding marshes as they were drained. The town still has areas named East Marsh and West Marsh. The [[Lincolnshire Wolds]] are situated to the south west of the town, from which the town's [[River Freshney]] rises.\n\n==History==\nThere is some [[archeological|archaeological]] evidence of a small town of Roman workers sited in the area in the second century. Located on the [[River Haven]], which flowed into the [[Humber]], this provided an ideal location for ships to shelter from approaching storms. It was also well situated to exploit the rich fishing grounds in the [[North Sea]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Vikings===\nGrimsby was settled by [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] sometime in the 9th century AD.

The legendary founding of Grimsby is described in a medieval romance, the ''[[Lay of Havelock the Dane]],'' but historians consider this account to be myth.\n\nIn Norse mythology, ''Grim'' (Mask) and ''Grimnir'' (Masked One) are names adopted by the deity [[Odin]] (Anglo-Saxon ''[[Woden]]'') when travelling incognito amongst mortals, as in the short poem known as 'Grimnir's Sayings' (''Grimnismal'') in the ''[[Poetic Edda]].''<ref>Grimnir's Sayings (verses 46,49), ''The [[Poetic Edda]]''</ref> The intended audience of the Havelock tale (recorded much later in the form of the ''[Lay of Havelock the Dane)'' may have understood the fisherman Grim to be Odin in disguise. The Odinic name \"Grimr/Grim\" occurs in many English place names within the historical [[Danelaw]] and elsewhere in Britain, examples being the numerous earthworks named ''Grimsdyke''.<ref>''Mysterious Britain'', Janet and Colin Bord, (1972) Garnstone Press Ltd., p. 88</ref> Other British place names containing the element ''Grim'' are explained as referring to [[Woden]]/[[Odin]] (e.g. Grimsbury, Grimspound, Grime's Graves, Grimsditch, Grimsworne), and Grimsby is likely to have the same derivation.\n\nGrimsby is listed in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as having a population of around 200, a priest, a mill and a ferry.\n\n===Medieval period===\nDuring the 12th century, Grimsby developed into a fishing and trading port, at one point ranking twelfth in importance to the Crown in terms of tax revenue. The town was granted its charter by [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1201. The first mayor was installed in 1202.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shaw |first=George |title=Old Grimsby |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tSmDDJyouIIC&pg=PA136 |accessdate=6 June 2013 |publisher=Wellowgate Publications Ltd. |isbn=978-1-4092-3671-9 |page=136|date=November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nGrimsby is noted in the {{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga Saga]]|italic=yes}} in this {{lang|non|[[Dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt]]}} stanza by [[Kali Kolsson]]:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|V\u00e9r h\u01ebfum va\u00f0nar leirur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vikur fimm megingrimmar;\nsaurs vara vant, er v\u00e1rum,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi\u00f0r, \u00ed Gr\u00edmsb\u0153 mi\u00f0jum.\nN\u00fa'r \u00feat's m\u00e1s of m\u00fdrar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;megink\u00e1tliga l\u00e1tum\nbranda elg \u00e1 bylgjur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bj\u01ebrgynjar til dynja.\n|We have waded in mire for five terrible weeks;\nthere was no lack of mud where we were, in the middle of Grimsby.\nBut now away we let our beaked moose [[kenning|{{!(}}ship{{)!}}]] resound merrily\non the waves over the seagull's swamp [sea] to Bergen.\n}}\n\n[[File:St. James' Church, Grimsby.jpg|thumb|St James' Church, now [[Grimsby Minster]], before its extension]]\n\nGrimsby does not have town walls. It was too small and was protected by the marshy land around it. However, the town did have a ditch.\n\nIn medieval times, Grimsby had two parish churches, [[St Mary's Church, Grimsby|St Mary's]] and [[St. James' Church, Grimsby|St James]]. Only St James, now known as [[Grimsby Minster]], remains. St James is associated with a folk tale of an [[Imp]] who played tricks in the church and was turned into stone by an angel (a similar story is told for [[Lincoln Cathedral]]; see [[Lincoln Imp]]).\n\nIn the mid-14th century, the town benefited from the generosity of [[Edmund de Grimsby]], a local man who became a senior Crown official and judge in Ireland.\n\nIn the 15th century, The Haven began to silt up, preventing ships in the Humber from docking. As a result, Grimsby entered a long period of decline which lasted until the late 18th century. By 1801, the population of Grimsby numbered 1,524,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} around the same size that it had been in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n===Rise of fishing and maritime industry===\nThe [[Grimsby Haven Company]] was formed by Act of Parliament in May 1796 (the Grimsby Haven Act) for the purpose of \"widening, deepening, enlarging, altering and improving the Haven of the Town and Port of Great Grimsby\". After dredging of The Haven and related improvement, in the early 19th century the town grew rapidly as the port was revived. Grimsby's port boomed, importing iron, timber, wheat, hemp and flax. New docks were needed to cope with the expansion. The Grimsby Docks Act of 1845 allowed the necessary building works.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Alexandra Docks.jpg|thumb|right|Alexandra Docks and [[National Fishing Heritage Centre]] ]]\n\nThe arrival of the railway in 1848 made it easier to transport goods to and from the port to markets and farms. Coal mined in the South [[Yorkshire]] coalfields was brought by rail and exported through Grimsby. Rail links direct to London and the [[Billingsgate Fish Market]] allowed for fresh \"Grimsby Fish\" to gain renown nationwide. The first true fish dock opened in Grimsby in 1856, and the town became a centre for the development of the commercial fishing industry.\n\nThe [[Dock Tower]] was completed in 1851, followed by the [[Royal Dock, Grimsby|Royal Dock]] in 1852. [[No.1 Fish Dock]] was completed in 1856, followed by [[No.2 Fish Dock]] in 1877. [[Alexandra Dock, Grimsby|Alexandra Dock]] and [[Union Dock, Grimsby|Union Dock]] were completed in 1879. During this period, the fishing fleet was greatly expanded. In a rare reversal of the usual trends, large numbers of fishermen from the South-East and Devon travelled North to join the Grimsby fleet. Over 40 per cent of these newcomers came from Barking in East London, and other Thames-side towns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.localpopulationstudies.org.uk/PDF/LPS50_1993_39-50.pdf |title=Following the Fish to Grimsby |last=Gerrish |first=Dr. Margaret |publisher=University of Hull |accessdate=11 August 2010}} {{Dead link |date=September 2010 |bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nIn 1857 there were 22 vessels in Grimsby.

Major expansion came with the coming of the railways, and construction of the [[Royal Dock, Grimsby]] in the 1840s. A [[No.1 Fish Dock|Fish Dock]] was added in 1857, and the fish docks expanded over the next 80 years, with Grimsby becoming a major fishing centre.

It is close to the main terminus of the [[M180 motorway|A180]], which ends in Cleethorpes.\n\nGrimsby lies in the [[national character area]]s of the Humber, and the Lincolnshire coast and Marshes; it is predominantly low in topography. The town was historically settled on low-lying islands and raised areas of the Humber marsh, and subsequently expanded onto the surrounding marshes as they were drained. The town still has areas named East Marsh and West Marsh. The [[Lincolnshire Wolds]] are situated to the south west of the town, from which the town's [[River Freshney]] rises.\n\n==History==\nThere is some [[archeological|archaeological]] evidence of a small town of Roman workers sited in the area in the second century. Located on the [[River Haven]], which flowed into the [[Humber]], this provided an ideal location for ships to shelter from approaching storms. It was also well situated to exploit the rich fishing grounds in the [[North Sea]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Vikings===\nGrimsby was settled by [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] sometime in the 9th century AD.

The legendary founding of Grimsby is described in a medieval romance, the ''[[Lay of Havelock the Dane]],'' but historians consider this account to be myth.\n\nIn Norse mythology, ''Grim'' (Mask) and ''Grimnir'' (Masked One) are names adopted by the deity [[Odin]] (Anglo-Saxon ''[[Woden]]'') when travelling incognito amongst mortals, as in the short poem known as 'Grimnir's Sayings' (''Grimnismal'') in the ''[[Poetic Edda]].''<ref>Grimnir's Sayings (verses 46,49), ''The [[Poetic Edda]]''</ref> The intended audience of the Havelock tale (recorded much later in the form of the ''[Lay of Havelock the Dane)'' may have understood the fisherman Grim to be Odin in disguise. The Odinic name \"Grimr/Grim\" occurs in many English place names within the historical [[Danelaw]] and elsewhere in Britain, examples being the numerous earthworks named ''Grimsdyke''.<ref>''Mysterious Britain'', Janet and Colin Bord, (1972) Garnstone Press Ltd., p. 88</ref> Other British place names containing the element ''Grim'' are explained as referring to [[Woden]]/[[Odin]] (e.g. Grimsbury, Grimspound, Grime's Graves, Grimsditch, Grimsworne), and Grimsby is likely to have the same derivation.\n\nGrimsby is listed in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as having a population of around 200, a priest, a mill and a ferry.\n\n===Medieval period===\nDuring the 12th century, Grimsby developed into a fishing and trading port, at one point ranking twelfth in importance to the Crown in terms of tax revenue. The town was granted its charter by [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1201. The first mayor was installed in 1202.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shaw |first=George |title=Old Grimsby |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tSmDDJyouIIC&pg=PA136 |accessdate=6 June 2013 |publisher=Wellowgate Publications Ltd. |isbn=978-1-4092-3671-9 |page=136|date=November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nGrimsby is noted in the {{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga Saga]]|italic=yes}} in this {{lang|non|[[Dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt]]}} stanza by [[Kali Kolsson]]:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|V\u00e9r h\u01ebfum va\u00f0nar leirur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vikur fimm megingrimmar;\nsaurs vara vant, er v\u00e1rum,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi\u00f0r, \u00ed Gr\u00edmsb\u0153 mi\u00f0jum.\nN\u00fa'r \u00feat's m\u00e1s of m\u00fdrar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;megink\u00e1tliga l\u00e1tum\nbranda elg \u00e1 bylgjur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bj\u01ebrgynjar til dynja.\n|We have waded in mire for five terrible weeks;\nthere was no lack of mud where we were, in the middle of Grimsby.\nBut now away we let our beaked moose [[kenning|{{!(}}ship{{)!}}]] resound merrily\non the waves over the seagull's swamp [sea] to Bergen.\n}}\n\n[[File:St. James' Church, Grimsby.jpg|thumb|St James' Church, now [[Grimsby Minster]], before its extension]]\n\nGrimsby does not have town walls. It was too small and was protected by the marshy land around it. However, the town did have a ditch.\n\nIn medieval times, Grimsby had two parish churches, [[St Mary's Church, Grimsby|St Mary's]] and [[St. James' Church, Grimsby|St James]]. Only St James, now known as [[Grimsby Minster]], remains. St James is associated with a folk tale of an [[Imp]] who played tricks in the church and was turned into stone by an angel (a similar story is told for [[Lincoln Cathedral]]; see [[Lincoln Imp]]).\n\nIn the mid-14th century, the town benefited from the generosity of [[Edmund de Grimsby]], a local man who became a senior Crown official and judge in Ireland.\n\nIn the 15th century, The Haven began to silt up, preventing ships in the Humber from docking. As a result, Grimsby entered a long period of decline which lasted until the late 18th century. By 1801, the population of Grimsby numbered 1,524,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} around the same size that it had been in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n===Rise of fishing and maritime industry===\nThe [[Grimsby Haven Company]] was formed by Act of Parliament in May 1796 (the Grimsby Haven Act) for the purpose of \"widening, deepening, enlarging, altering and improving the Haven of the Town and Port of Great Grimsby\". After dredging of The Haven and related improvement, in the early 19th century the town grew rapidly as the port was revived. Grimsby's port boomed, importing iron, timber, wheat, hemp and flax. New docks were needed to cope with the expansion. The Grimsby Docks Act of 1845 allowed the necessary building works.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Alexandra Docks.jpg|thumb|right|Alexandra Docks and [[National Fishing Heritage Centre]] ]]\n\nThe arrival of the railway in 1848 made it easier to transport goods to and from the port to markets and farms. Coal mined in the South [[Yorkshire]] coalfields was brought by rail and exported through Grimsby. Rail links direct to London and the [[Billingsgate Fish Market]] allowed for fresh \"Grimsby Fish\" to gain renown nationwide. The first true fish dock opened in Grimsby in 1856, and the town became a centre for the development of the commercial fishing industry.\n\nThe [[Dock Tower]] was completed in 1851, followed by the [[Royal Dock, Grimsby|Royal Dock]] in 1852. [[No.1 Fish Dock]] was completed in 1856, followed by [[No.2 Fish Dock]] in 1877. [[Alexandra Dock, Grimsby|Alexandra Dock]] and [[Union Dock, Grimsby|Union Dock]] were completed in 1879. During this period, the fishing fleet was greatly expanded. In a rare reversal of the usual trends, large numbers of fishermen from the South-East and Devon travelled North to join the Grimsby fleet.

It is known as Morrisons Cleethorpes. This anomalous name is derived from the period when the area was part of the now defunct [[Cleethorpes]] Borough. Most major supermarkets have expanded in the early 21st century, including Asda, and Tesco at Hewitts Circus (this store is technically in the adjoining town, Cleethorpes).\n\nSuch is the quality of shopping in the area that bus services bring in shoppers from across [[Lincolnshire]], especially from smaller towns such as [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stagecoachbus.com/GetUpload.ashx?Id%3D375 |accessdate=2 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508045525/http://www.stagecoachbus.com/GetUpload.ashx?Id=375 |archivedate=8 May 2010}}</ref> [[Brigg]], and [[Scunthorpe]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.stagecoachbus.com/GetUpload.ashx?Id%3D2574 |accessdate=2 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611232008/http://www.stagecoachbus.com/GetUpload.ashx?Id=2574 |archivedate=11 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Renewable energy===\nGrimsby is beginning to develop as a renewable energy centre, and generates more electricity from solar, wind, biomass and [[landfill gas]] than anywhere else in England.<ref name=\"Green\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/grimsby-generating-more-electricity-from-renewables-than-anywhere-else-in-england-a6858291.html |title=Grimsby 'generating more electricity from renewables than anywhere else in England' |first=Tom |last=Bawden |date=6 February 2016 |work=The Independent |accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref> The town makes 28 per cent of the electricity it uses from green sources.<ref name=\"Green\"/> Its proximity to the biggest cluster of offshore [[wind farms]] in Europe, have brought around 1,500 jobs to the area, most of these are in turbine maintenance.<ref name=\"Green\"/>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education 1.JPG|thumbnail|right|Grimsby Institute and University Centre Grimsby]]\n{{See also|List of schools in North East Lincolnshire}}\n\nThere are numerous primary schools in Grimsby.

Stagecoach had all the buses resprayed to their standard livery to replace the buses previous colour-scheme of orange and white. Prior to this, the buses were painted blue and white until 1981, when the colours were changed to caramel and cream. The orange and white livery was introduced in 1987. Until 1982 ''GCT'' ran a mixture of crewed and one-person operated services.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} However, in that year the job of conductor was abolished and the company changed entirely to driver-only services.\n\nIn 2005, Stagecoach bought out ''Lincolnshire Road Car'', which provided buses to [[South Killingholme]], [[Louth, Lincolnshire|Louth]], [[Barton-upon-Humber]] and the Willows Estate. The company is now known as ''[[Stagecoach in Lincolnshire]]''.

The Grimsby Electric was a normal gauge tramway opened in 1912 between [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/52622 Corporation Bridge] at Grimsby and [[Immingham]]. There was no physical connection with the railway system. The tramway served the town with a passenger service between Grimsby and Immingham until closure in 1961. It is claimed that once this was controlled by the Corporation, they were more interested in supporting the motorbus service, now number&nbsp;45.\n\nThe Grimsby Light Railway opened in 1881 using horse-drawn trams. In 1901, these were replaced with electric tramways.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1925 the Grimsby Transport Company bought the tramway company and in 1927 moved the depot to the Victoria Street Depot, an old [[sea plane]] hangar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} This system closed in 1937.

He is primarily remembered today as a household name in several [[Northwestern Europe]]an countries for his 1963 television comedic sketch entitled ''[[Dinner for One]]'', a perennial national television broadcast New Year's Eve favourite there, whilst being largely forgotten in his home country.\n\n==Early life==\nFrinton was born in Hainton Avenue, [[Grimsby]], [[Lincolnshire]], the illegitimate child of a [[seamstress]], Florence Elisabeth Coo (born 1892), and was brought up by [[foster parent]]s. He started working in a Grimsby [[fish processing plant]], where he is said to have entertained his colleagues with parodies and jokes, but was eventually sacked. He moved into music hall, where he enjoyed modest success and renamed himself Freddie Frinton.\n\n==Career==\nDuring the [[Second World War]] he made a moderate breakthrough as a comedian. In 1945, Frinton first performed the sketch ''Dinner for One'' in [[Blackpool]]. As he had to pay a royalty every time he performed the sketch, he bought the rights to ''Dinner for One'' in the 1950s, which turned out to be a fateful decision.\n\nIn 1964, at the age of 55, Frinton became a belated success as the [[plumber]] husband in the popular television [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[Meet the Wife (TV series)|Meet the Wife]]'', which ran for 40 episodes (the wife was played by [[Thora Hird]]). The series is mentioned in the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song \"[[Good Morning Good Morning]]\" with the line \"It's time for tea and ''Meet the Wife''\".\n\n===''Dinner for One''===\nIn 1963, Frinton's ''[[Dinner for One]]'' was recorded by the [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] (NDR) German television station. The role of Miss Sophie was played by [[May Warden]]. Watching the (unsubtitled) English language sketch on television has subsequently become a German, Austrian, and Swiss [[New Year's Eve]] tradition, with multiple repeats of the comedy short being shown every year from 1972 onwards.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=John|title=British comedy lives on in German television|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/dec/31/broadcasting.germany|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 December 2002|accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Jude|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2133551/|work=Slate|date=30 December 2005|accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n''Dinner for One'' also found fame in Scandinavia where it has been a hugely popular institution on Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Estonian and Swedish television on New Year's Eve for many years, as well as in Belgium in the original version. It has become so popular that several versions in various [[German language|German]] dialects have been produced and a version was made for [[Netherlands|Dutch]] viewers, with the Dutch actor [[Joop Doderer]] playing Frinton's role. It is shown every 23 December on Norwegian television ([[NRK]] since 1980), and has been shown on the Australian [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] television network on New Year's Eve for at least the last fifteen years. It also became a family tradition in South Africa when the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] aired it every New Year's Eve during the 1980s and 1990s. The TV short and its main actor Frinton are far less renowned in [[UK|Britain]] than in any of these countries.\n\nAlthough Frinton originated from the East of England, his most famous comedy short has never been shown in full on British television.

He is primarily remembered today as a household name in several [[Northwestern Europe]]an countries for his 1963 television comedic sketch entitled ''[[Dinner for One]]'', a perennial national television broadcast New Year's Eve favourite there, whilst being largely forgotten in his home country.\n\n==Early life==\nFrinton was born in Hainton Avenue, [[Grimsby]], [[Lincolnshire]], the illegitimate child of a [[seamstress]], Florence Elisabeth Coo (born 1892), and was brought up by [[foster parent]]s. He started working in a Grimsby [[fish processing plant]], where he is said to have entertained his colleagues with parodies and jokes, but was eventually sacked. He moved into music hall, where he enjoyed modest success and renamed himself Freddie Frinton.\n\n==Career==\nDuring the [[Second World War]] he made a moderate breakthrough as a comedian. In 1945, Frinton first performed the sketch ''Dinner for One'' in [[Blackpool]]. As he had to pay a royalty every time he performed the sketch, he bought the rights to ''Dinner for One'' in the 1950s, which turned out to be a fateful decision.\n\nIn 1964, at the age of 55, Frinton became a belated success as the [[plumber]] husband in the popular television [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[Meet the Wife]]'', which ran for 40 episodes (the wife was played by [[Thora Hird]]). The series is mentioned in the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song \"[[Good Morning Good Morning]]\" with the line \"It's time for tea and ''Meet the Wife''\".\n\n===''Dinner for One''===\nIn 1963, Frinton's ''[[Dinner for One]]'' was recorded by the [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] (NDR) German television station. The role of Miss Sophie was played by [[May Warden]]. Watching the (unsubtitled) English language sketch on television has subsequently become a German, Austrian, and Swiss [[New Year's Eve]] tradition, with multiple repeats of the comedy short being shown every year from 1972 onwards.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web|last=Hooper|first=John|title=British comedy lives on in German television|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/dec/31/broadcasting.germany|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 December 2002|accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Jude|title=The Mystery of Dinner for One|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2133551/|work=Slate|date=30 December 2005|accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n''Dinner for One'' also found fame in Scandinavia where it has been a hugely popular institution on Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Estonian and Swedish television on New Year's Eve for many years, as well as in Belgium in the original version. It has become so popular that several versions in various [[German language|German]] dialects have been produced and a version was made for [[Netherlands|Dutch]] viewers, with the Dutch actor [[Joop Doderer]] playing Frinton's role. It is shown every 23 December on Norwegian television ([[NRK]] since 1980), and has been shown on the Australian [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] television network on New Year's Eve for at least the last fifteen years. It also became a family tradition in South Africa when the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] aired it every New Year's Eve during the 1980s and 1990s. The TV short and its main actor Frinton are far less renowned in [[UK|Britain]] than in any of these countries.\n\nAlthough Frinton originated from the East of England, his most famous comedy short has never been shown in full on British television.

The programme is divided into two segments:\n\n=== public events: DOK.forum Perspectives ===\n\nIn panel discussions, workshops and case studies, the DOK.forum Perspectives take a look at the developments in documentary work and invite you to develop visions and impulses and explore relevant media policy issues. The public events are aimed both at the industry and the interested festival audience.\n\n=== Coproduction and ideas market: DOK.forum Marketplace ===\n\nThe marketplace offers filmmakers the opportunity to meet editors and producers from Germany, Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol at moderated roundtables and present their concepts.

The documentary film school for school classes offers media pedagogically accompanied film screenings and talks with filmmakers. In this workshop format, the participants learn to analyse non-fictional films and are motivated to apply this to their own everyday media use in order to become critical and self-confident media users. The programme also includes media education courses for teachers. DOK.education offers events at the festival in May and all year round.\n\n== DOK.forum \u2013 industry platform ==\n\nDOK.forum sees itself as a think tank for the documentary film industry and as a platform for projects in the development process.

The programme is divided into two segments:\n\n=== public events: DOK.forum Perspectives ===\n\nIn panel discussions, workshops and case studies, the DOK.forum Perspectives take a look at the developments in documentary work and invite you to develop visions and impulses and explore relevant media policy issues. The public events are aimed both at the industry and the interested festival audience.\n\n=== Coproduction and ideas market: DOK.forum Marketplace ===\n\nThe marketplace offers filmmakers the opportunity to meet editors and producers from Germany, Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol at moderated roundtables and present their concepts.
