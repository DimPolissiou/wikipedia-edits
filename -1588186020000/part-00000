The aircraft had a very peculiar design. Granville reasoned that a teardrop-shaped [[fuselage]]&nbsp;\u2014 especially as seen from directly above&nbsp;\u2014 would have lower drag than a straight-tapered one, so the fuselage was wider than the engine at its widest point (at the wing attachment point[s], within the length of the [[Chord (aeronautics)|wing chord]]). The cockpit was located very far aft, just in front of the [[vertical stabilizer]], in order to give the [[Aircraft pilot|racing pilot]] better vision while making crowded [[Air racing|pylon]] turns.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Granville Brothers Model R-1 SuperSportster (2835379758).jpg|thumb|A reproduction of the R-1 that won the Thompson Trophy Race]]\n\nThe R-1 won the 1932 Thompson Trophy  race, piloted by [[Jimmy Doolittle]].  He also set a new world landplane speed record of 476&nbsp;km/h (296&nbsp;mph) in the Shell Speed Dash. The distinction of a landplane record was noteworthy because, at that time, specialized speed [[seaplane]]s outran landplanes, ''e.g.'' the [[Macchi M.C.72]] with over 700&nbsp;km/h. The ''Springfield Union'' of September 6, 1932 quoted Doolittle as saying, \"She is the sweetest ship I've ever flown. She is perfect in every respect and the motor is just as good as it was a week ago. It never missed a beat and has lots of stuff in it yet. I think this proves that the Granville brothers up in Springfield build the very best speed ships in America today.\"\n\nThe R-1 rapidly earned a reputation as a potentially very dangerous machine. This shortcoming was common to most air racers of the day. During the 1933 [[Bendix Trophy]] race, racing pilot Russell Boardman was killed, flying Number 11. During takeoff from a refueling stop in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], Boardman pulled up too soon, [[Stall (fluid mechanics) |stalled]] the R-1 and crashed.<ref>Gilbert 1978, p.t 67.</ref>\n\nThe R-1 was later repaired and now incorporated a fuselage extension of approximately 18&nbsp;inches, creating the \"Long Tail Racer.\" This aircraft carried race number 11 and was named Intestinal Fortitude. It was decided not to rebuild the wings, but to use the original wings from the R-2, which had been removed in February 1933 when a new wing with flaps was built and installed. This aircraft crashed in a landing overrun incident soon after it was built, but Roy Minor, the pilot, was not severely injured. After another rebuild, the Long Tail Racer was sold to Cecil Allen. Against the advice of the Granvilles,  Allen modified it by installing larger gas tanks aft of its normal center of gravity, which apparently made the aircraft unstable in pitch from tail-heaviness. Allen took off with a full fuel tank, crashed, and was killed. After this final crash, the aircraft was never rebuilt.<ref>Graves, Darrell and Scott Brenner.

{"title_page": "Biographical research", "text_new": "{{essay|date=June 2018}}\n'''Biographical research''' is a [[qualitative research]] approach aligned to the social interpretive paradigm of research. The biographical research is concerned with the reconstruction of [[Life history (sociology)|life histories]] and the constitution of meaning based on biographical narratives and documents. The material for analysis consists of interview protocols ([[memorandum]]s), video recordings, photographs, and a diversity of sources. These documents are evaluated and interpreted according to specific rules and criteria. The starting point for this approach is the understanding of an individual [[biography]] in terms of its social constitution. The biographical approach was influenced by the [[symbolic interactionism]], the [[Sociology of knowledge|phenomenological sociology of knowledge]] ([[Alfred Sch\u00fctz]], [[Peter L. Berger]], and [[Thomas Luckmann]]), and [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]). Therefore, biography is understood in terms of a [[Social constructionism|social construct]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge|last=Berger|first=Peter|last2=Luckmann|first2=Thomas|publisher=Anchor Books|year=1966|isbn=|location=Garden City, NY|pages=}}</ref> and the reconstruction of biographies can give insight on [[Figurational sociology|social processes and figurations]] (as in [[Norbert Elias]]), thus helping to bridge the gap between micro-, meso-, and macro- [[Level of analysis|levels of analysis]]. The biographical approach is particularly important in German sociology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soziologie.de/de/sektionen/biographieforschung/portrait/|title=DGS - Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Soziologie: Portrait|website=soziologie.de|language=DE|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> This approach is used in the [[Social science|Social Sciences]] as well as in [[Pedagogy]] and other disciplines. The Research Committee 38 \"Biography and Society\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.isa-sociology.org/en/research-networks/research-committees/rc38-biography-and-society/|title=ISA - RC38 Biography and Society|website=ISA, International Sociological Association}}</ref> of the [[International Sociological Association|International Sociological Association (ISA)]] was created in 1984 and is dedicated \"to help develop a better understanding of the relations between individual lives, the social structures and historical processes within which they take shape and which they contribute to shape, and the individual accounts of biographical experience (such as life stories or autobiographies)\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isa-sociology.org/en/research-networks/research-committees/rc38-biography-and-society/|title=Objectives of the RC 38 Biography and Society|website=isa-sociology.org}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Biography|Biographies]], including autobiographies, have always contained a sociological dimension since their advent in the Antiquity ([[Plutarch]]). For the most part of the usage of this notion, biographers dealt with outstanding individual personalities (such as politicians and artists) but there were also exceptions, such as [[Ulrich Br\u00e4ker]]'s autobiography, \"The Poor Man of Toggenburg\" (''Der arme Mann im Toggenburg''). The emergence of [[Sociology]] influenced an approach to biography that extended this notion beyond the individual dimension, such as the works of [[Alphons Silbermann]] on the life of the composer [[Jacques Offenbach]] and [[Norbert Elias]] on the life of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mozart: Portrait of a Genius|last=Elias|first=Norbert|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0520084759|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Biography as a form of access to larger groupings ===\nThe biographical method as a research approach to understand larger groupings was used as sociological material by [[Florian Znaniecki]] and [[W. I. Thomas|William Isaac Thomas]] in the 1920s. After their work, the biographical approach was considered amongst the dominant research approaches in empirical social research. The study ''[[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]]'' (1918\u20131920) by Znaniecki and Thomas used an extensive collection of diaries, letters, [[memoir]]s, [[Autobiography|autobiographies]], and other personal and archival documents as main source for a sociological investigation. The reception of this work was initially late due to linguistic barriers, but it was then absorbed and disseminated in the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC). The biographical research approach formed an important foundation for the development of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], which later influenced the [[symbolic interactionism]] and the work of sociologists such as [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ernest Burgess|Ernest W. Burgess]], and [[George Herbert Mead]].\n\nAnother milestone in the development of biographical research was the analysis of the [[Life course approach|life course]] of delinquent youths written by Clifford R. Shaw in 1930<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Jack Roller. A Delinquent Boy's Own Story|last=Shaw|first=Clifford|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-70093-1|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1930}}</ref> and 1931.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Natural History of a Delinquent Career|last=Shaw|first=Clifford|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=|orig-year=1931}}</ref> After 1945, the interest in biographical research declined due to the success of [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]] and [[Structural functionalism|structural-functionalist]] theories. The biographical approach influence was felt mainly in the study of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]].

Different approaches to the development of typologies exist, as well as for the contrastive comparison between types in order to allow for [[Theory|theoretical generalizations]] (see Uta Gerhardt, 1984; Gabriele Rosenthal, 1993;<ref name=\"Rosenthal 1993\" /> and Susann Kluge, 2000<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kluge|first=Susann|date=2000|title=Empirically Grounded Construction of Types and Typologies in Qualitative Social Research|url=http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/1124/2499|journal=Forum: Qualitative Social Research|volume=1 |issue=1|pages=|via=FQS}}</ref>).\n\n=== Experienced life history and narrated life story (''erlebte und erz\u00e4hlte Lebensgeschichte'') ===\nA fundamental problem exists regarding the differences between the levels of the experienced (''erlebte'') [[Life history (sociology)|life history]] and the [[Narrative|narrated]] (''erz\u00e4hlte'') life story.<ref name=\"Rosenthal 1993\" /> Another fundamental implication is the interrelation of [[experience]], [[memory]], and [[narration]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=Gabriele|date=2006|title=The Narrated Life Story: On the Interrelation Between Experience, Memory and Narration|url=http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/4894/2/Chapter_1_-_Gabriele_Rosenthal.pdf|journal=Narrative, Memory & Knowledge: Representations, Aesthetics, Contexts|volume=|pages=1\u201316|via=}}</ref> In the early studies of biographical research, great value was placed on the reconstruction of the actual life course of the individual using data from additional sources (such as institutional archives, diaries, interviews with relatives and friends, etc.) and thus eliminating \"errors\" in the memory and presentation of the interviewee. Today \u2013 according to the phenomenological \"bracketing\" of the being of objects (as by the grounded theory principles) \u2013 it is increasingly assumed that the actual life course cannot be reconstructed: experiences are always interpreted by the subject and are mediated by perception, thus constituting the memory in regard to the framework of the overall biography as well as to the situation (for more, see [[Erving Goffman]]n notion of [[frame analysis]]) where the narrative is collected.<ref name=\"Rosenthal 2018\" />\n\nThus, the main concern of the biographical research should be the life as experiences and narrated by subjects in clear contrast to the \"true facts\" of a life course reconstruction. Interpretations and constructions of meaning are of utmost importance to reconstruct a biographical case, as the actions and the self-interpretation of these actions by the individual turns his own biography into a coherent totality. Based on empirical experiences with narrated life history and using the research method of biographical narrative interviews, the method of biographical case reconstruction has developed in the last decades in fields that range from the study of migration<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Apitzsch|first=Ursula|last2=Siouti|first2=Irini|date=2007|title=Biographical Analysis as an Interdisciplinary Research Perspective in the Field of Migration Studies|url=https://www.york.ac.uk/res/researchintegration/Integrative_Research_Methods/Apitzsch%20Biographical%20Analysis%20April%202007.pdf|journal=University of York, UK|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> to professional careers and healthcare.\n\n=== Reconstruction of the latent structures of meaning ===\nThe question of the construction of meaning leads to the questions of the subjectively intended and the objective meaning. Ulrich Oevermann says that an actor in a situation of interaction produces more meaning than he is aware of. Therefore, some researchers consider the task of the biographical research to be the reconstruction of both types of meaning \u2013 the intended and the objective.<ref name=\"Oevermann 1987\">{{Cite book|last=Oevermann|first=Ulrich|last2=Tilman|first2=Allert|last3=Konau|first3=Elisabeth|last4=Krambeck|first4=J\u00fcrgen|date=1987|title=Structures of Meaning and Objective Hermeneutics|url=|journal=In: Volker Meja, Dieter Misgeld, Nico Stehr (Eds.): Modern German Sociology|volume=|pages=436\u2013447|isbn=978-0-231-05854-4|via=}}</ref> Behind and below the interpretations expressed by the interviewees are the latent structures of meaning that constitute the sense of life and manifest themselves in biographical life situations.<ref name=\"Oevermann 1987\" /> In these latent, hidden patterns of meaning, individual experience and societal conditioning are intertwined. Thus, behind individual action lies a direction and a framework for action.

The biographical research is concerned with the reconstruction of [[Life history (sociology)|life histories]] and the constitution of meaning based on biographical narratives and documents. The material for analysis consists of interview protocols ([[memorandum]]s), video recordings, photographs, and a diversity of sources. These documents are evaluated and interpreted according to specific rules and criteria. The starting point for this approach is the understanding of an individual [[biography]] in terms of its social constitution. The biographical approach was influenced by the [[symbolic interactionism]], the [[Sociology of knowledge|phenomenological sociology of knowledge]] ([[Alfred Sch\u00fctz]], [[Peter L. Berger]], and [[Thomas Luckmann]]), and [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]). Therefore, biography is understood in terms of a [[Social constructionism|social construct]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge|last=Berger|first=Peter|last2=Luckmann|first2=Thomas|publisher=Anchor Books|year=1966|isbn=|location=Garden City, NY|pages=}}</ref> and the reconstruction of biographies can give insight on [[Figurational sociology|social processes and figurations]] (as in [[Norbert Elias]]), thus helping to bridge the gap between micro-, meso-, and macro- [[Level of analysis|levels of analysis]]. The biographical approach is particularly important in German sociology.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soziologie.de/de/sektionen/biographieforschung/portrait/|title=DGS - Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Soziologie: Portrait|website=soziologie.de|language=DE|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref> This approach is used in the [[Social science|Social Sciences]] as well as in [[Pedagogy]] and other disciplines. The Research Committee 38 \"Biography and Society\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.isa-sociology.org/en/research-networks/research-committees/rc38-biography-and-society/|title=ISA - RC38 Biography and Society|website=ISA, International Sociological Association}}</ref> of the [[International Sociological Association|International Sociological Association (ISA)]] was created in 1984 and is dedicated \"to help develop a better understanding of the relations between individual lives, the social structures and historical processes within which they take shape and which they contribute to shape, and the individual accounts of biographical experience (such as life stories or autobiographies)\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isa-sociology.org/en/research-networks/research-committees/rc38-biography-and-society/|title=Objectives of the RC 38 Biography and Society|website=isa-sociology.org}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Biography|Biographies]], including autobiographies, have always contained a sociological dimension since their advent in the Antiquity ([[Plutarch]]). For the most part of the usage of this notion, biographers dealt with outstanding individual personalities (such as politicians and artists) but there were also exceptions, such as [[Ulrich Br\u00e4ker]]'s autobiography, \"The Poor Man of Toggenburg\" (''Der arme Mann im Toggenburg''). The emergence of [[Sociology]] influenced an approach to biography that extended this notion beyond the individual dimension, such as the works of [[Alphons Silbermann]] on the life of the composer [[Jacques Offenbach]] and [[Norbert Elias]] on the life of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mozart: Portrait of a Genius|last=Elias|first=Norbert|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0520084759|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== Biography as a form of access to larger groupings ===\nThe biographical method as a research approach to understand larger groupings was used as sociological material by [[Florian Znaniecki]] and [[W. I. Thomas|William Isaac Thomas]] in the 1920s. After their work, the biographical approach was considered amongst the dominant research approaches in empirical social research. The study ''[[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]]'' (1918\u20131920) by Znaniecki and Thomas used an extensive collection of diaries, letters, [[memoir]]s, [[Autobiography|autobiographies]], and other personal and archival documents as main source for a sociological investigation. The reception of this work was initially late due to linguistic barriers, but it was then absorbed and disseminated in the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC). The biographical research approach formed an important foundation for the development of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]], which later influenced the [[symbolic interactionism]] and the work of sociologists such as [[Robert E. Park]], [[Ernest Burgess|Ernest W. Burgess]], and [[George Herbert Mead]].\n\nAnother milestone in the development of biographical research was the analysis of the [[Life course approach|life course]] of delinquent youths written by Clifford R. Shaw in 1930<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Jack Roller. A Delinquent Boy's Own Story|last=Shaw|first=Clifford|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-70093-1|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1930}}</ref> and 1931.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Natural History of a Delinquent Career|last=Shaw|first=Clifford|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=|orig-year=1931}}</ref> After 1945, the interest in biographical research declined due to the success of [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]] and [[Structural functionalism|structural-functionalist]] theories. The biographical approach influence was felt mainly in the study of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]]. In 1978, [[Aaron Cicourel|Aaron Victor Cicourel]] published a case study on the [[Life history (sociology)|life history]] of a boy named Mark, that received special attention in the discipline of [[social work]]. Cicourel's study explored in detail how a criminal career was constructed through [[Interrogation|police interrogation]], individual and distorted interpretations, and institutional [[document]]s.\n\n=== Recent research ===\nSince the 1980s, biographical research gained momentum in the wake of a growing interest for qualitative social research.

Therefore, some researchers consider the task of the biographical research to be the reconstruction of both types of meaning \u2013 the intended and the objective.<ref name=\"Oevermann 1987\">{{Cite book|last=Oevermann|first=Ulrich|last2=Tilman|first2=Allert|last3=Konau|first3=Elisabeth|last4=Krambeck|first4=J\u00fcrgen|date=1987|title=Structures of Meaning and Objective Hermeneutics|url=|journal=In: Volker Meja, Dieter Misgeld, Nico Stehr (Eds.): Modern German Sociology|volume=|pages=436\u2013447|isbn=978-0-231-05854-4|via=}}</ref> Behind and below the interpretations expressed by the interviewees are the latent structures of meaning that constitute the sense of life and manifest themselves in biographical life situations.<ref name=\"Oevermann 1987\" /> In these latent, hidden patterns of meaning, individual experience and societal conditioning are intertwined. Thus, behind individual action lies a direction and a framework for action. According to Heinz Bude, the method of [[objective hermeneutics]] and reconstruction of structures of meaning is used in biographical research as a method for the reconstruction of the latent structures of meaning at play in specific situations of a case<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bude|first=Heinz|date=1984|title=Rekonstruktion von Lebenskonstruktionen.

The Solihull Unitary Development Plan proposed a settlement of 850 new houses adjacent to the existing hamlets of Dickens Heath Road and Tythebarn Lane.\n\nIn May 1991, there was a public enquiry into objections and, following a favourable response by the Government Inspector, Solihull Council approved the principle of the Dickens Heath project in December 1992.\n\nFrom the outset, the Council decided that Dickens Heath would be special and wouldn't be just a large housing estate in the country. The Council decided that the new development would be based on the model of a traditional village, made up of shops, offices, restaurants, and homes as well as a school, library, village hall, doctors' surgery, pub, village green and country park.\n\nLondon architects [[John Simpson (architect)|John Simpson]] and Partners devised a concept plan, which was developed and refined to become the approved Master Plan in 1995.\n\nThe four key elements of the Master Plan were that the new settlement should:\n\n#have a clear identity which gives residents a sense of place and belonging\n#echo the traditional features of village development including homes, employment, recreation, social and welfare facilities intermixed to create a cohesive whole\n#provide a range of housing, from first-time buyer housing through to family housing and smaller units suitable for the elderly, thereby creating a mixed community of all ages and incomes\n#create a safe and pleasing environment for pedestrians while still accommodating the motor car, but without allowing it to dominate the environment\n\nIn March 1995, there was a second public enquiry into the Solihull Unitary Development Plan. Outline Planning Permission was approved by the Council in December 1996.\n\nConstruction began in August 1997 with the first show home opening in December 1997. The first house was occupied in May 1998. The school opened in September 2002 and the library opened in October 2004.\n\n== Constructing the new village ==\n\nThe Consortium of Developers was legally obliged to provide the village infrastructure at a total cost of around \u00a310 million.\n\nThe agreement required a financial contribution and/or provision of land for:\n\n*the village school\n*the community hall and library\n*the village green\n*the parkland\n*the nature reserve\n*the walkways\n*the wharf\n*the highways\n*the medical centre\n*a church\n\n== Canal Side in the New Village ==\n\nThe Stratford-upon-Avon canal, which links Solihull with Warwickshire, flows around the edge of the village and is popular with canal boaters. Herons, kingfishers and ducks can be seen here, as well as bats, foxes and badgers.\n\nNearby woodlands, which are remnants of the ancient Forest of Arden provide a home for bluebells, [[Anemone nemorosa|wood anemones]] and [[wood sorrel]].\n\n== New Village Timeline ==\n\nKey milestones in the development of Dickens Heath New Village are:\n\n*1989: The original concept for a new village was created in response to the search for housing land to accommodate 8,100 new homes in the borough between 1988 and 2001.\n*1991: The principle of a new village at Dickens Heath was examined at the Public Local Inquiry into the Council\u2019s development plan (the Solihull Unitary Development Plan)\n*1992: The Government Inspector who conducted the Inquiry endorsed the principle of the new village and the site was subsequently released for housing by the Council with an estimated capacity of at least 850 dwellings\n*1994: The Council approved a detailed Master Plan.

Although steel shortages or quotas are sometimes mentioned as a factor in the decision to use fiberglass, no evidence exists to support this.

It was some time later that we decided to produce this quantity in reinforced plastic.''\n\n''About this time, some doubt was expressed that we should build the 1954 model of steel. People seemed to be captivated by the idea of the fiberglass plastic body. Furthermore, information being given to us by the reinforced plastic industry seemed to indicate the practicality of fabricating plastic body parts for automobiles on a large scale.''\n}}\n\nA 55 degree raked windshield was made of safety glass, while the license plate holder was set back in the trunk, covered with a plastic window.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Underneath the new body material were standard components from Chevrolet's regular car line, including the \"Blue Flame\" [[Straight-6|inline six-cylinder]] engine, two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, and [[drum brake]]s.

It is known that 1954 models were painted Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red, and Black, in addition to Polo White. All had red interiors, except for those finished in Pennant Blue which had a beige interior and beige canvas soft top.

The surprising finding was their opinions in comparison to foreign sports cars. It was found that 36% of those taking the survey had owned a foreign sports car, and of that, half of them rated the Corvette as better than their previous foreign sports car. Nineteen percent rated the Corvette as equal to their foreign sports car and 22% rated the Corvette as inferior. While many were well pleased with the Corvette, they did not consider it as a true sports car.

At first 1955 V8 Corvettes continued with the mandatory-option Powerglide automatic transmission (as did the few 6-cylinder models built), but a new three-speed manual transmission came along later in the year for V8 models only. Exterior color choices were expanded to at least five, combined with at least four interior colors. Even soft-tops came in three colors and different materials. Despite all this, only 700 1955 Corvettes were built, making it second only to 1953 in scarcity. Very few six-cylinder 1955 models were built, and all documented examples are equipped with automatic transmissions. The \"V\" in the Corvette emblem was enlarged and gold colored, signifying the V8 engine under the hood and 12 volt electrical systems, while 6-cylinder models retained the 6-volt systems used in 1953-54.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Rare option estimate: Manual transmission (75).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlthough not a part of the original Corvette project, [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]] was responsible for the addition of the V8 engine and three-speed manual transmission.

It was introduced late in the 1953 model year, and produced through 1962. It is commonly referred to as the \"solid-axle\" generation, as the independent rear suspension did not appear until the 1963 Sting Ray. The Corvette was rushed into production for its debut model year to capitalize on the enthusiastic public reaction to the [[concept car|concept vehicle]], but expectations for the new model were largely unfulfilled.<ref name=Prince/> Reviews were mixed and sales fell far short of expectations through the car's early years. The program was nearly canceled, but Chevrolet would ultimately stay the course.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\n[[Harley Earl]], as head of GM's Styling Section, was an avid fan of sporting cars.

Because there was currently no manual transmission available to Chevrolet rated to handle 150 HP, a two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic was used. {{cvt|0|-|60|mph}} time was 11.5 seconds.\n\nThree body variants were created. The [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] was built as the Corvette, the Corvair [[fastback]] variant never went in production, and two-door Nomad [[station wagon]] was eventually built as the [[Chevrolet Nomad]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfX4o9YQT8g ''Concept Cars of the 1950s''], History TV</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n| title  = Corvette Corvair Show Car\n| lines  = 2\n| width  = 170\n| height = 170\n| align     = center \n|File:Corvette Corvair 1.jpg|alt1=|Corvette Corvair show car, front view\n|File:Corvette Corvair 2.jpg|alt2=|Corvette Corvair show car, rear view\n}}\n\nDuring the last half of 1953, 300 Corvettes were to a large degree, hand-built on a makeshift assembly line that was installed in an old truck plant in [[Flint, Michigan]]<ref name=Prince/><!--This facility is now an academic building at [[Kettering University]].--> while a factory was being prepped for a full-scale 1954 production run. The outer body was made out of then-revolutionary [[fiberglass|glass fiber reinforced plastic]] material. Although steel shortages or quotas are sometimes mentioned as a factor in the decision to use fiberglass, no evidence exists to support this. In calendar years 1952 and 1953 Chevrolet produced nearly 2 million steel bodied full-size passenger cars and the intended production volume of 10,000 Corvette for 1954 was only a small fraction of that.<ref name=Premo1>{{cite journal|last=Premo |first=Ellis |title=The Corvette Plastic Body|journal=Society of Automotive Engineers |date=1954 |volume=540257 |url= http://papers.sae.org/540257/ |accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=SAE International}}</ref>\n\nThe body engineer for the Corvette was Ellis James Premo. He presented a paper to the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] in 1954 regarding the development of the body.<ref name=Premo1 /> Several excerpts highlight some of the key points in the body material choice:\n{{Quote|text=\n''The body on the show model was made of reinforced plastic purely as an expedient to get the job done quickly.''\n\n''Although we were going ahead with the building of an experimental plastic body in order to get a car rolling for chassis development work \u2013 at the time of the Waldorf Show, we were actually concentrating body-design-wise on a steel body utilizing [[Zamak|Kirksite]] tooling for the projected production of 10,000 units during the 1954 model year. It was some time later that we decided to produce this quantity in reinforced plastic.''\n\n''About this time, some doubt was expressed that we should build the 1954 model of steel. People seemed to be captivated by the idea of the fiberglass plastic body. Furthermore, information being given to us by the reinforced plastic industry seemed to indicate the practicality of fabricating plastic body parts for automobiles on a large scale.''\n}}\n\nA 55 degree raked windshield was made of safety glass, while the license plate holder was set back in the trunk, covered with a plastic window.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Underneath the new body material were standard components from Chevrolet's regular car line, including the \"Blue Flame\" [[Straight-6|inline six-cylinder]] engine, two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, and [[drum brake]]s.

Even so, the Ford-Chevrolet rivalry in those days demanded GM not appear to back down from the challenge. The original concept for the Corvette emblem incorporated an American flag into the design, but was changed well before production since associating the flag with a product was [[United States Flag Code|frowned upon]].\n\n==1953\u20131955==\n[[File:Corvette logo.jpg|thumb|Performance-themed logo]]\n[[File:53 Corvette.jpg|thumb|1953, the first year of production]]\n\n===1953===\nThe 1953 model year was not only the Corvette's first production year, but at 300 produced it was also the lowest-volume Corvette. The cars were essentially hand-built and techniques evolved during the production cycle, so that each 1953 Corvette is slightly different.

Other problems, such as water leaks and doors that could open while the car was driven, were reported with the most severe errors corrected in subsequent units produced, but some shortcomings continued beyond the Corvette's inaugural year.<ref name=Prince/> By December 1953, Chevrolet had a newly equipped factory in St. Louis ready to build 10,000 Corvettes annually. However, negative customer reaction in 1953 and early 1954 models caused sales to plummet.\n\n===1954===\nIn 1954, only 3,640 of this model were built and nearly a third were unsold at year's end. New colors were available, but the six-cylinder engine and Powerglide automatic, the only engine and transmission available, were not what sports car enthusiasts expected. It is known that 1954 models were painted Pennant Blue, Sportsman Red, and Black, in addition to Polo White. All had red interiors, except for those finished in Pennant Blue which had a beige interior and beige canvas soft top. Order guides listed several options, but all options were \"mandatory\" and all 1954 Corvettes were equipped the same.<ref name=gunnel>{{cite book |editor-last=Gunnel |editor-first=John |title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975 |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1987 | isbn=0-87341-096-3}}</ref>\n[[File:Corvette c1 1954.JPG|thumb|Two-toned color schemes were popular in and out (1954)]]\n\nIn the October 1954 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' there was an extensive survey of Corvette owners in America. The surprising finding was their opinions in comparison to foreign sports cars. It was found that 36% of those taking the survey had owned a foreign sports car, and of that, half of them rated the Corvette as better than their previous foreign sports car. Nineteen percent rated the Corvette as equal to their foreign sports car and 22% rated the Corvette as inferior. While many were well pleased with the Corvette, they did not consider it as a true sports car. The principal complaint of the surveyed owners was the tendency of the body to leak extensively during rain storms.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xNwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA118&dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oMYwT4n1Lsnyggfv2OCyBQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Corvette Is A Fine Fun Car But It Has Its Limitations.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1954, pp. 118-122/356.</ref>\n\n===1955===\nChevrolet debuted its [[Chevrolet small-block engine#265|{{cvt|265|CID|L}} small-block, {{cvt|195|hp}}]] [[V8]] in 1955 and the engine found its way into the Corvette. At first 1955 V8 Corvettes continued with the mandatory-option Powerglide automatic transmission (as did the few 6-cylinder models built), but a new three-speed manual transmission came along later in the year for V8 models only. Exterior color choices were expanded to at least five, combined with at least four interior colors. Even soft-tops came in three colors and different materials. Despite all this, only 700 1955 Corvettes were built, making it second only to 1953 in scarcity. Very few six-cylinder 1955 models were built, and all documented examples are equipped with automatic transmissions. The \"V\" in the Corvette emblem was enlarged and gold colored, signifying the V8 engine under the hood and 12 volt electrical systems, while 6-cylinder models retained the 6-volt systems used in 1953-54.<ref name=\"Black Book\"/> Rare option estimate: Manual transmission (75).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAlthough not a part of the original Corvette project, [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]] was responsible for the addition of the V8 engine and three-speed manual transmission. Duntov improved the car's marketing and image and helped the car compete with the new V8\u2014engined [[Ford Thunderbird]], and turned the Corvette from its lackluster performance into a credible performer. In 1956 he became the director of high-performance vehicle design and development for Chevrolet helping him earn the nickname \"Father of the Corvette.\"<ref>{{cite book |title= Corvette, 1968-1982 |last= Mueller |first= Mike |year= 2000 |publisher= MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |isbn= 978-0-7603-0418-1 |page= 94 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WCN7CfWjhhoC&pg=PA94&dq }}</ref><ref name=\"Prince\" />\n\nAlthough the C1 Corvette chassis and suspension design were derived from Chevrolet's full-size cars, the same basic design was continued through the 1962 model even after the full-size cars were completely redesigned for the 1955 model year. {{Citation needed span|This was due to the combined factors of the relatively high re-engineering and re-tooling costs for this low-volume production vehicle, the continued potential for cancellation of the car, and the increased size and weight of the all-new suspension design for the full-size cars, which made it unsuitable for use in the lighter weight Corvette.|date=August 2014}}\n\n{{Gallery|title=1953-1955 Corvette\n| lines  = 2\n| width  = 170\n| height = 170\n| align     = center \n|File:53 Corvette.jpg|1953\n|File:Corvette 1953 trunk.JPG|1953\n|File:54 Chevrolet Corvette (9684047670).jpg|1954\n|File:1955 Chevrolet Corvette roadster - svl (12913501534).jpg|1955\n}}\n\n==1956\u20131957==\n[[File:Chevrolet Corvette Transistorized Hybrid Car Radio-1956.JPG|thumb|left|Options in 1956-57 included a car radio that featured both transistors &ndash;cutting-edge technology at that time &ndash; and a vacuum tube]]\n[[File:1957 Chevrolet Corvette EUD883.jpg|thumb|Fuel-injected 1957 convertible]]\n\n===1956===\nThe 1956 Corvette featured a new body, with real glass roll up windows and a more substantial convertible top.

Other leadership elections were made at that board meeting including John Jenkins, senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Glenarden, to the office of chair of the NAE board; and Jo Anne Lyon, general superintendent emerita and ambassador of The Wesleyan Church, to the office of vice chair.<ref>https://www.nae.net/nae-appoints-walter-kim-as-next-president/</ref>\n\n==Initiatives==\n\n===National Religious Broadcasters===\nIn 1944, the NAE formed the [[National Religious Broadcasters]] (NRB) at its convention in Columbus, Ohio.<ref>Edith Waldvogel Blumhofer, ''Restoring the Faith: The Assemblies of God, Pentecostalism, and American Culture'', University of Illinois Press, USA, 1993, p. 192</ref> NRB was the first of many related service agencies NAE would charter with a particular purpose in mind. Following the lead of CBS and NBC, the Mutual Radio Network had announced it would no longer sell time for religious broadcasting and turned the Protestant broadcasting slot over to the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]]. NRB, after holding its own constitutional convention later that year, responded to the challenge, eventually persuading the networks to reverse their policies. NRB is now a separate organization.\n\n===Evangelical Chaplains Commission===\nIn addition to NRB, NAE created the Chaplains Commission in 1944 to assist evangelical chaplains in the military. The NAE Chaplains Commission continues to provide support and endorsement for evangelicals to minister as chaplains to three branches of the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Free exercise and expression of faith in U.S. military institutions is a primary cause that the Chaplains Commission supports. The commission also supports institutional chaplains who serve in hospitals, prisons, workplaces and other areas of ministry.\n\n===World Relief===\nThe War Relief Commission was formed in 1944 to address the needs of war-torn Europe. The War Relief Commission sent clothing and food to victims of World War II. After the war, the War Relief Commission expanded its outreach beyond war relief, and its name changed to [[World Relief]]. As the humanitarian arm of the NAE, World Relief offers assistance to victims of poverty, disease, hunger, war, disasters and persecution. The organization has offices worldwide. It is supported by churches and individual donors, as well as through United States Government grants from USAID and other agencies. World Relief's core programs focus on microfinance, AIDS prevention and care, maternal and child health, child development, agricultural training, disaster response, refugee resettlement and immigrant services.\n\n===Missio Nexus===\nIn 1945, NAE created the Evangelical Foreign Missions Association (later called the Evangelical Fellowship of Mission Agencies, then The Mission Exchange, and now Missio Nexus). It was chartered to handle the special needs of missionaries and their agencies and is the largest missionary association in the world. Missio Nexus now operates independently of the NAE, though it is a member of the NAE.\n\n===New International Version===\nAn NAE initiative in the 1950s with long-range consequences was the formation of a committee in 1957 to explore the possibility of a new translation of the Bible. The National Council had five years earlier released the [[Revised Standard Version]], but the new translation did not prove popular among many evangelicals. The NAE committee began meeting with a similar committee commissioned by the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]] in 1961. By 1965, the two committees formed the independent Committee on Bible Translation and two years later, the New York Bible Society (today the [[International Bible Society]]) became the official sponsor. In 1978, the first copies of the [[New International Version]] of the Bible came off the presses.\n\n===For the Health of the Nation===\nThe Evangelical Project for Public Engagement was initiated at the 60th annual convention of the NAE in March 2001. The project team worked to articulate a framework for evangelical civic and political engagement for the 21st century under the direction of [[Richard Cizik]], then-vice president of governmental affairs. The project generated a major volume edited by Diane Knippers and [[Ronald Sider]] and published by Baker Books titled \"Toward an Evangelical Public Policy.\"\n\n\"For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility\"<ref name=\"nae.net\"/> calls evangelicals to address seven spheres of social involvement from a biblical framework and also provides specific principles of engagement. The NAE's political action is based on the document, which outlines seven different issues that are important to evangelicals, including religious freedom, family life and protection of children, sanctity of life, caring for the poor and vulnerable, human rights, peacemaking, and caring for creation.\n\nWhile the underlying principles of the document have not changed, the NAE Board of Directors updated and adopted the revised version in 2018. New attention has been called to long-time social ills, including the broken immigration system, sexual harassment and abuse, human trafficking, racial injustice and white supremacy. Concern about these issues was implicit in the original document and is further elaborated in the updated edition, notably through the addition of a section on racial justice and reconciliation.<ref>https://www.nae.net/for-the-health-of-the-nation/</ref>\n\n==Member denominations==\n{{Christian denominations in the United States}}\nThe following Protestant church denominations were members as of 2017.

After the war, the War Relief Commission expanded its outreach beyond war relief, and its name changed to [[World Relief]]. As the humanitarian arm of the NAE, World Relief offers assistance to victims of poverty, disease, hunger, war, disasters and persecution. The organization has offices worldwide. It is supported by churches and individual donors, as well as through United States Government grants from USAID and other agencies. World Relief's core programs focus on microfinance, AIDS prevention and care, maternal and child health, child development, agricultural training, disaster response, refugee resettlement and immigrant services.\n\n===Missio Nexus===\nIn 1945, NAE created the Evangelical Foreign Missions Association (later called the Evangelical Fellowship of Mission Agencies, then The Mission Exchange, and now Missio Nexus). It was chartered to handle the special needs of missionaries and their agencies and is the largest missionary association in the world. Missio Nexus now operates independently of the NAE, though it is a member of the NAE.\n\n===New International Version===\nAn NAE initiative in the 1950s with long-range consequences was the formation of a committee in 1957 to explore the possibility of a new translation of the Bible. The National Council had five years earlier released the [[Revised Standard Version]], but the new translation did not prove popular among many evangelicals. The NAE committee began meeting with a similar committee commissioned by the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed Church]] in 1961. By 1965, the two committees formed the independent Committee on Bible Translation and two years later, the New York Bible Society (today the [[International Bible Society]]) became the official sponsor. In 1978, the first copies of the [[New International Version]] of the Bible came off the presses.\n\n===For the Health of the Nation===\nThe Evangelical Project for Public Engagement was initiated at the 60th annual convention of the NAE in March 2001. The project team worked to articulate a framework for evangelical civic and political engagement for the 21st century under the direction of [[Richard Cizik]], then-vice president of governmental affairs. The project generated a major volume edited by Diane Knippers and [[Ronald Sider]] and published by Baker Books titled \"Toward an Evangelical Public Policy.\"\n\n\"For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility\"<ref name=\"nae.net\"/> calls evangelicals to address seven spheres of social involvement from a biblical framework and also provides specific principles of engagement. The NAE's political action is based on the document, which outlines seven different issues that are important to evangelicals, including religious freedom, family life and protection of children, sanctity of life, caring for the poor and vulnerable, human rights, peacemaking, and caring for creation.\n\nWhile the underlying principles of the document have not changed, the NAE Board of Directors updated and adopted the revised version in 2018. New attention has been called to long-time social ills, including the broken immigration system, sexual harassment and abuse, human trafficking, racial injustice and white supremacy. Concern about these issues was implicit in the original document and is further elaborated in the updated edition, notably through the addition of a section on racial justice and reconciliation.<ref>https://www.nae.net/for-the-health-of-the-nation/</ref>\n\n==Member denominations==\n{{Christian denominations in the United States}}\nThe following Protestant church denominations were members as of 2017.
