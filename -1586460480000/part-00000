Both the curing agent and the epoxy resin can be made waterborne. Solid epoxy resin (molecular weight >1000) dispersions are available and consist of an epoxy resin dispersed in water sometimes with the aid of co-solvents and [[surfactants]]. The resin backbone is often modified to ensure water dispersibility. These resins dry in their own right by water/co-solvent evaporation and he particles coalescence.<ref>Darwen S. \u201cDevelopments in high performance water-borne epoxy coatings\u201d\u00a0 Polymers Paints and Colours Journal February. 23 1994 ppp. 65\u201367</ref>. To cure the resin and crosslink it, an amine based curing agent is usually added. This produces a two-component system. An alternative is to use standard medium viscosity liquid epoxy resins and emulsify them in a water soluble polyamine or polyaminoamide hardener resin which also gives a two component system. Polyaminoamides are made by reacting ethylene amines with dimerized fatty acids to give a species with amide links but still having amine functionality.

Typical components are vegetable oils or fatty acids such as linseed, soyabean, castor, dehydrated castor, safflower, tung, coconut and tall oil. Acids include isophthalic, terephthalic, adipic, benzoic, succinic acids and phthalic, maleic and trimellitic anhydride.  Polyols include [[glycerol]], [[pentaerythritol]], [[Trimethylolpropane]], [[ethylene glycol]], [[propylene glycol]], diethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, [[1,6-hexanediol]] and [[1,4-butanediol]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/32/ea/0d/7e3fc96ff56ddf/US5137965.pdf|title=US Patent 5137965|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \nTypical methods for introducing varying degrees of water miscibility are similar to other resin systems. Methods basically involve introducing hydrophilic centres such as acid groups that can then be neutrazised to form a salt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323203238_Synthesis_of_waterborne_alkyd_resins|title=Synthesis of waterborne alkyd resins|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Introducing polar groups onto the backbone is another method. With alkyds typical methods include maleinization of unsaturated fatty acids with maleic anhydride. This involves making a [[Diels-Alder]] adduct near the double bond sites. The acid groups introduced can then be further reacted with polyols. A Diels-Alder reaction only occurs where there is a conjugated double bond system. Simple addition occurs if not conjugated. Other techniques include synthesizing the resin with hydroxyl functional oligomers e.g. containing ethylene glycol then adding specific acid or hydroxyl containing substances towards the end of the reaction. Another technique is making an [[acryloyl group|acrylic]] functional [[alkyd]] with an acrylic monomer blend rich in [[carboxylic acid]] groups.\n\n==== Waterborne polyester resins    ====\nsee also [[Polyester resin]]\n\nSaturated polyester resins contain many of the materials used in conventional alkyd resins but without the oil or fatty acid components. Typical components for these resins are poly carboxylic and polyhydroxyl  components. The more commonly used polyacids are phthalic, isophthalic, terephthalic and adipic acid. Phthalic and trimellitic anhydrides may also be used. Polyols tend to be neopentyl glycol, [[1,6-hexanediol]] and  [[trimethylolpropane]]. To make them waterborne organic acids or anhydrides are added in a two-stage process but there are other methods too.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a1/ba/e1/791921a407820d/US5218042.pdf|title=Water-dispersible polyester resins and process for their preparation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.justia.com/patent/8309229|title=US Patent for Polyester resin and thermosetting water-borne coating compositions Patent (Patent # 8,309,229 issued November 13, 2012) - Justia Patents Search|website=patents.justia.com|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==== Waterborne polyurethane resins  ====\nsee article [[Polyurethane dispersion]]\n\nPolyurethanes resins are available waterborne.

Synthetic lattices are usuaully made by [[Polymerization|polymerizing]] a [[monomer]] such as [[vinyl acetate]] that has been [[Emulsion|emulsified]] with [[surfactant]]s dispersed in [[water]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/latex|title=Definition of LATEX|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>.\n\n==== Waterborne electrophoretic deposition resins  ====\nsee article [[Electrophoretic deposition]]\n\nThe resins used for electrodeposition are usually epoxy, acrylic or phenolic resin types. They are formulated with functional groups which when neutralised form ionic groups on the polymer backbone. These confer water solubility on the polymer. They are available as anodic versions which deposit on the cathode of an electrochemical cell or cathodic which deposit on the cathode<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sato|first=Toshihiko|date=1982-01-01|title=Mechanism of Electrophoretic Deposition of Organic Coatings on Anodized Aluminium|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00202967.1982.11870598|journal=Transactions of the IMF|volume=60|issue=1|pages=25\u201330|doi=10.1080/00202967.1982.11870598|issn=0020-2967}}</ref>. Cathodic electrodeposition resins dominate and they have revolutionised corrosion protection in the automotive industry. They are applied as OEM (Original Equipment Manufacture) rather than as a refinishing system.  Cathodic resins contain [[amine]]s on the [[polymer]] backbone which are neutralised by acids groups such as [[acetic acid]] to give a stable aqueous dispersion. When an [[electric current]] is passed through a car body that is dipped in a bath containing a paint based on a cathodic electrodeposition resin, the hydroxyl ions formed near the cathode deposit the paint on the car body. The electric current needed for this is determined by the number of ionic centres. \nDispersions of waterborne resins for electrocoating usually contain some co-solvents such as butyl glycol and isopropanol and are usually very low in solids content i.e. 15%. They usually have molecular weights in the region of 3\u20134000. Paints based on them tend to have PVCs of less than 10 i.e. a very high binder to pigment ratio.\n\n==== Waterborne hybrid resins    ====\n\nMany resins are available waterborne but can be hybrids or blends. An example would be [[polyurethane dispersion]]s blended or hybridized with [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] resins<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insights.basf.com/home|title=BASF Insights {{!}} Where business meets science|website=insights.basf.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. Waterborne epoxy resins may be modified with acrylate and then further modified with side chains having many [[fluorine]] atoms on them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Hongyi|date=2020|title=Waterborne epoxy resins modified by reactive polyacrylate modifier with fluorinated side chains|url=|journal=J. Coat. Technol. Res.|volume=17 (2)|pages=427-437|via=}}</ref>.\n\n==Water== \nsee main article [[Water]]\n\nWater is in some ways an unusual chemical. It is a very powerful and universal solvent. Most liquids reduce in volume on freezing, but water expands. It occurs naturally on earth in all three states of solid (ice), liquid (water) and gas(water vapour and steam). At 273.16 K or 0.16 \u00b0C (known as the [[triple point]]) it can coexist in all three states simultaneously. It has a very low molecular weight of 18 and yet a relatively high boiling point of 100 <sup>0</sup> C. This is due to inter molecular forces and in particular [[hydrogen bonding]]. The surface tension is also high at 72 dynes/cm (mN/metre) which affects its ability to wet certain surfaces. It evaporates (latent heat of evaporation 2260 kJ per kg) very slowly in comparison to some solvents and hardly at all when the relative humidity is very high. It has a very high specific heat capacity (4.184 kJ/kg/K ) and that is why it is used in central heating systems in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]]. These factors have to be borne in mind when formulating waterborne resins and other water based systems such as adhesives and coatings.\n\n==Uses==\n\nWaterborne resins find use in industrial coatings,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wernerblank.com/pdfiles/paper12b.pdf|title=FORMULATING POLYURETHANE DISPERSIONS|last=Blank|first=Werner}}</ref> UV coatings,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asif|first=Anila|last2=Huang|first2=Chengyu|last3=Shi|first3=Wenfang|date=2003|title=UV curing behaviors and hydrophilic characteristics of UV curable waterborne hyperbranched aliphatic polyesters|journal=Polymers for Advanced Technologies|language=en|volume=14|issue=9|pages=609\u2013615|doi=10.1002/pat.380|issn=1099-1581}}</ref> floor coatings,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pharosproject.net/uploads/files/sources/1828/1332269830.pdf|title=Floor Coatings with PUD}}</ref> hygiene coatings,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Howarth|first=G A|last2=Manock|first2=H L|date=July 1997|title=Water-borne polyurethane dispersions and their use in functional coatings|journal=Surface Coatings International|volume=80|issue=7|pages=324\u2013328|doi=10.1007/bf02692680|issn=1356-0751}}</ref> wood coatings,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pharosproject.net/uploads/files/sources/1828/1332269830.pdf|title=Waterborne Floor Coatings for Wood Floors}}</ref> adhesives,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dispersions-pigments.basf.com/portal/basf/ien/dt.jsp?setCursor=1_736943|title=PUD - Polymers - Adhesive Raw Materials - Adhesives - Markets & Industries - BASF Dispersions & Pigments|website=www.dispersions-pigments.basf.com|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref> concrete coatings,<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF02699621|title = Polyurethanes, polyurethane dispersions and polyureas: Past, present and future|journal = Surface Coatings International Part B: Coatings Transactions|volume = 86|issue = 2|pages = 111\u2013118|year = 2003|last1 = Howarth|first1 = GA}}</ref> automotive coatings,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/79/fb/a5/4a3014e443e9ee/US5071904.pdf|title=Patent US5071904A}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coatings.covestro.com/en/Applications/Automotive-Transportation/OEM-Metal/Metal-basecoat|title=Automotive OEM Metal Metal Basecoat|last=Communications|first=Covestro AG|website=www.coatings.covestro.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref> clear coatings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygem.com/products/ureseal-water-based-high-gloss-polyurethane-coating|title=URESEAL - Water-Based High-Gloss Polyurethane Coating {{!}} Polygem Epoxy|website=www.polygem.com|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> and anticorrosive applications including waterborne epoxy based anticorrosive primers<ref>Howarth\u00a0 G.A. \u201cWaterborne epoxy resin systems for use in anti-corrosive primers\u201d Pigment and Resin Technology Vol. 24 No 6 Nov./Dec. 1995 pp 3-6</ref><ref>Howarth, G.A. and Hayward, G.R., \u201cWaterborne Resins,\u201d OCCA Student Monograph No. 3, Oil and Colour Chemists\u2019 Association, UK, 1996.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Christopher|first=Gnanaprakasam|last2=Anbu Kulandainathan|first2=Manickam|last3=Harichandran|first3=Gurusamy|date=2015-07-01|title=Highly dispersive waterborne polyurethane/ZnO nanocomposites for corrosion protection|journal=Journal of Coatings Technology and Research|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=657\u2013667|doi=10.1007/s11998-015-9674-3|issn=1935-3804}}</ref> They are also used in the design and manufacture of medical devices such as the polyurethane dressing, a liquid bandage based on polyurethane dispersion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Design and Manufacture of Medical Devices|last=Davim|first=J.

Polyols include [[glycerol]], [[pentaerythritol]], [[Trimethylolpropane]], [[ethylene glycol]], [[propylene glycol]], diethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, [[1,6-hexanediol]] and [[1,4-butanediol]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/32/ea/0d/7e3fc96ff56ddf/US5137965.pdf|title=US Patent 5137965|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \nTypical methods for introducing varying degrees of water miscibility are similar to other resin systems. Methods basically involve introducing hydrophilic centres such as acid groups that can then be neutrazised to form a salt<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323203238_Synthesis_of_waterborne_alkyd_resins|title=Synthesis of waterborne alkyd resins|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Introducing polar groups onto the backbone is another method. With alkyds typical methods include maleinization of unsaturated fatty acids with maleic anhydride. This involves making a [[Diels-Alder]] adduct near the double bond sites. The acid groups introduced can then be further reacted with polyols. A Diels-Alder reaction only occurs where there is  a conjugated double bond system. Simple addition occurs if not conjugated. Other techniques include synthesizing the resin  with hydroxyl functional oligomers e.g. containing ethylene glycol then adding specific acid or hydroxyl containing substances towards the end of the reaction. Another technique is making an [[acryloyl group|acrylic]] functional [[alkyd]] with an acrylic monomer blend rich in [[carboxylic acid]] groups.\n\n==== Waterborne polyester resins    ====\nsee also [[Polyester resin]]\n\nSaturated polyester resins contain many of the materials used in conventional alkyd resins but without the oil or fatty acid components. Typical components for these resins are poly carboxylic and polyhydroxyl  components. The more commonly used polyacids are phthalic, isophthalic, terephthalic and adipic acid. Phthalic and trimellitic anhydrides may also be used. Polyols tend to be neopentyl glycol, [[1,6-hexanediol]] and  [[trimethylolpropane]]. To make them waterborne organic acids or anhydrides are added in a two-stage process but there are other methods too. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a1/ba/e1/791921a407820d/US5218042.pdf|title=Water-dispersible polyester resins and process for their preparation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.justia.com/patent/8309229|title=US Patent for Polyester resin and thermosetting water-borne coating compositions Patent (Patent # 8,309,229 issued November 13, 2012) - Justia Patents Search|website=patents.justia.com|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>.\n\n==== Waterborne polyurethane resins    ====\nsee article [[Polyurethane dispersion]]\n\nPolyurethanes resins are available waterborne. The single component versions are usually referred to as [[Polyurethane dispersion]]s. \nThey are available in anionic, cationic and nonionic versions though anionic moieties are the most readily available commercially<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/water-based-polyurethanes-dispersionspuds-an-overview-nikhil-gupta|title=Water Based Polyurethanes Dispersions(PUDs)-An Overview|website=www.linkedin.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>.

Synthetic lattices are usuaully made by [[Polymerization|polymerizing]] a [[monomer]] such as [[vinyl acetate]] that has been [[Emulsion|emulsified]] with [[surfactant]]s dispersed in [[water]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/latex|title=Definition of LATEX|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>.\n\n==== Waterborne electrophoretic deposition resins    ====\nsee article [[Electrophoretic deposition]]\n\nThe resins used for electrodeposition are usually epoxy, acrylic or phenolic resin types. They are formulated with functional groups which when neutralised form ionic groups on the polymer backbone. These confer water solubility on the polymer. They are available as anodic versions which deposit on the cathode of an electrochemical cell or cathodic which deposit on the cathode<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sato|first=Toshihiko|date=1982-01-01|title=Mechanism of Electrophoretic Deposition of Organic Coatings on Anodized Aluminium|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00202967.1982.11870598|journal=Transactions of the IMF|volume=60|issue=1|pages=25\u201330|doi=10.1080/00202967.1982.11870598|issn=0020-2967}}</ref>. Cathodic electrodeposition resins dominate and they have revolutionised corrosion protection in the automotive industry. They are applied as OEM (Original Equipment Manufacture) rather than as a refinishing system.  Cathodic resins contain [[amine]]s on the [[polymer]] backbone which are neutralised by acids groups such as [[acetic acid]] to give a stable aqueous dispersion.. When an [[electric current]] is passed though a car body which is dipped in a bath containing a paint based on an cathodic electrodeposition resin, the hydroxyl ions formed near the cathode deposit the paint on the car body. The electric current needed for this is determined by the number of ionic centres. \nDispersions of waterborne resins for electrocoating usually contain some co-solvents such as butyl glycol and isopropanol and are usually very low in solids content i.e. 15%. They usually have molecular weights in the region of 3-4000. Paints based on them  tend to have PVC\u2019s of less than 10 i.e. a very high binder to pigment ratio.\n\n==== Waterborne hybrid resins    ====\n\nMany resins are available waterborne but can be hybrids or blends. An example would be [[polyurethane dispersion]]s blended or hybridized with [[acrylic resin|acrylic]] resins<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insights.basf.com/home|title=BASF Insights {{!}} Where business meets science|website=insights.basf.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. Waterborne epoxy resins may be modified with acrylate and then further modified with side chains having many [[fluorine]] atoms on them<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shi|first=Hongyi|date=2020|title=Waterborne epoxy resins modified by reactive polyacrylate modifier with fluorinated side chains|url=|journal=J. Coat. Technol. Res.|volume=17 (2)|pages=427-437|via=}}</ref>.\n\n==Water== \nsee main article [[Water]]\n\nWater is in some ways an unusual chemical. It is a very powerful and universal solvent. Most liquids reduce in volume on freezing, but water expands. It occurs naturally on earth in all three states of solid (ice), liquid (water) and gas(water vapour and steam). At 273.16 K or 0.16 <sup>0</sup> C (known as the [[triple point]]) it can coexist in all three states simultaneously. It has a very low molecular weight of 18 and yet a relatively high boiling point of 100 <sup>0</sup> C. This is due to inter molecular forces and in particular [[hydrogen bonding]]. The surface tension is also high at 72 dynes/cm (mN/metre) which affects its ability to wet certain surfaces. It evaporates (latent heat of evaporation 2260 kJ per kg) very slowly in comparison to some solvents and hardly at all when the relative humidity is very high. It has a very high specific heat capacity (4.184 kJ/kg/K ) and that is why it is used in central heating systems in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]]. These factors have to be borne in mind when formulating waterborne resins and other water based systems such as adhesives and coatings.\n\n==Uses==\n\nWaterborne resins find use in industrial coatings,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wernerblank.com/pdfiles/paper12b.pdf|title=FORMULATING POLYURETHANE DISPERSIONS|last=Blank|first=Werner}}</ref> UV coatings,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Asif|first=Anila|last2=Huang|first2=Chengyu|last3=Shi|first3=Wenfang|date=2003|title=UV curing behaviors and hydrophilic characteristics of UV curable waterborne hyperbranched aliphatic polyesters|journal=Polymers for Advanced Technologies|language=en|volume=14|issue=9|pages=609\u2013615|doi=10.1002/pat.380|issn=1099-1581}}</ref> floor coatings,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pharosproject.net/uploads/files/sources/1828/1332269830.pdf|title=Floor Coatings with PUD}}</ref> hygiene coatings,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Howarth|first=G A|last2=Manock|first2=H L|date=July 1997|title=Water-borne polyurethane dispersions and their use in functional coatings|journal=Surface Coatings International|volume=80|issue=7|pages=324\u2013328|doi=10.1007/bf02692680|issn=1356-0751}}</ref> wood coatings,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pharosproject.net/uploads/files/sources/1828/1332269830.pdf|title=Waterborne Floor Coatings for Wood Floors}}</ref> adhesives,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dispersions-pigments.basf.com/portal/basf/ien/dt.jsp?setCursor=1_736943|title=PUD - Polymers - Adhesive Raw Materials - Adhesives - Markets & Industries - BASF Dispersions & Pigments|website=www.dispersions-pigments.basf.com|access-date=2019-04-11}}</ref> concrete coatings,<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF02699621|title = Polyurethanes, polyurethane dispersions and polyureas: Past, present and future|journal = Surface Coatings International Part B: Coatings Transactions|volume = 86|issue = 2|pages = 111\u2013118|year = 2003|last1 = Howarth|first1 = GA}}</ref> automotive coatings,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/79/fb/a5/4a3014e443e9ee/US5071904.pdf|title=Patent US5071904A}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coatings.covestro.com/en/Applications/Automotive-Transportation/OEM-Metal/Metal-basecoat|title=Automotive OEM Metal Metal Basecoat|last=Communications|first=Covestro AG|website=www.coatings.covestro.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref> clear coatings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygem.com/products/ureseal-water-based-high-gloss-polyurethane-coating|title=URESEAL - Water-Based High-Gloss Polyurethane Coating {{!}} Polygem Epoxy|website=www.polygem.com|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref> and anticorrosive applications including waterborne epoxy based anticorrosive primers<ref>Howarth\u00a0 G.A. \u201cWaterborne epoxy resin systems for use in anti-corrosive primers\u201d Pigment and Resin Technology Vol. 24 No 6 Nov./Dec. 1995 pp 3-6</ref><ref>Howarth, G.A. and Hayward, G.R., \u201cWaterborne Resins,\u201d OCCA Student Monograph No. 3, Oil and Colour Chemists\u2019 Association, UK, 1996.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Christopher|first=Gnanaprakasam|last2=Anbu Kulandainathan|first2=Manickam|last3=Harichandran|first3=Gurusamy|date=2015-07-01|title=Highly dispersive waterborne polyurethane/ZnO nanocomposites for corrosion protection|journal=Journal of Coatings Technology and Research|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=657\u2013667|doi=10.1007/s11998-015-9674-3|issn=1935-3804}}</ref> They are also used in the design and manufacture of medical devices such as the polyurethane dressing, a liquid bandage based on polyurethane dispersion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Design and Manufacture of Medical Devices|last=Davim|first=J.

Professor [[Chelva Kanaganayagam]], in a critical review of ''Mathangaculamani'', concludes that {{cquote|The major contribution of the text is its attempt to establish drama as a valid academic discipline rather than provide a basis for performance.}}\n\nVipulanada also served as editor of several publications including ''Ramakrishna Vijayam'' (Tamil), ''Vivekananda'' (Tamil) and ''Prabuddha Bharata'' (English). He also edited and helped publish literary works of several well-known scholars. His translations from English to Tamil include selected writings of [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindra Nath Tagore]] and [[historian]] [[Kathiresan Chettiar]]. He also translated from Tamil to English selected poems from the [[Sangam literature]] period, devotional songs from the [[Bhakti movement]] period, and poems of [[Subramanya Bharathi]] and Navaneetha Krishna Bharathi.\n\nVipulanada authored six major Tamil publications: a collection of four ''Prabanthangal'', ''Mathangaculamani'', ''The Great Dance of Thillai'', ''Umamageswaram'' (all related to [[Saiva]] traditions of the Hindu religion), ''Dictionary of Technical Terms on Chemistry'' and ''Yal Nool''. A collection of 170 essays, written from 1914 to 1947, were published posthumously in four parts in [[1995 in literature|1995]]. He also wrote many poems, and a collection of 32 of his poems was published in 1995. He was a good public speaker and most of his speeches, focusing mainly on history of the Tamils, [[Tamil literature]], Tamil music and musical instruments, and [[Vedanta]] philosophy, were published in international journals and magazines.<ref name=DCS /><ref name=BV />\n\n== Ramakrishna Mission ==\n{{Main|Ramakrishna Mission|Hinduism in Sri Lanka}}\nFounded in 1897 by [[Swami Vivekananda]], the disciple of [[Ramakrishna]], the Ramakrishna Mission is a unique order of ascetics and volunteers dedicated to service to community, irrespective of [[Religion in Sri Lanka|religious]], [[caste]], [[creed]] or [[Languages of Sri Lanka|language]] differences. The mission, while promoting spiritual development, does not believe in religious conversion. The mission's charitable and philanthropic activities focus mainly on the provision of educational and medical services to the weaker segment of the population through schools, hospitals and orphanages run by the mission. It became a counter weight to [[Christian missionary]]-run charitable  organizations throughout [[South Asia]].\n\nVipulananda initially met the head of the [[Mylapore]] Ramakrishna Mission, Swami Sarvananda,<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rkmissiondel/Swami_Sarvananda.html&date=2009-10-26+01:44:02 Swami Sarvananda] RKM Bio (English)</ref> in [[Colombo]] in 1916. This was followed up with another visit in [[Jaffna]] in 1917. He entered the Mylapore Ramakrishna Math in 1922 for his monastic training. On completion of the training in 1924, he was given the name Vipulananda. After his ordination he dedicated his life to educational and spiritual pursuits and service to the community in Sri Lanka and India.\n\nIn 1925 Vipulanada became an administrator of Ramakrishna Mission (RKM) schools in Sri Lanka. He was instrumental in founding new RKM schools in [[Jaffna]], Batticalao, Trincomalee  and in many villages. He also founded orphanages \u2013 two for boys at Vaitheeswara Vidyalayam, Jaffna and Sivananda Vidyalayam in Batticaloa, and one for girls in Karativu. Thereafter, a number of RKM schools were opened in several remote villages in the North and East of Sri Lanka. This provided an alternative to the natives to go to schools and orphanages that were not associated with western [[Christian missionaries]].<ref name=DCS /><ref name=BV /> He also helped his lifelong friend [[A.

Azeez]], a pioneering Sri Lankan [[Muslim]] educator and [[civil servant]], to establish charitable organizations to help poor Muslims in the east of the country.<ref name=Island>{{cite news\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =A.M.A Azeez\n  | work =\n  | pages =\n  | publisher = The Island\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.island.lk/2007/10/06/features3.html\n  | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Jameel\n  | first = S.H.M\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Dr. Azeez's contribution to eastern development\n  | work =\n  | pages =\n  | publisher = Daily Mirror\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.dailymirror.lk/2007/10/04/opinion/3.asp\n  | accessdate =  }}</ref>\n\n== Professional career ==\n[[File:\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bbf.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Swami Vipulananda's burial place and memorial]]\nAs a noted educationist, scholar and community worker, Vipulanada was invited by the [[University of Madras]] to present its case for the establishment of a Tamil University to the special commission set up to investigate the proposal. On the recommendation of the commission, the [[Annamalai University]] was opened in 1927. In 1931 he became its first Professor of Tamil language. Professor Vipulananda also received a second invitation to become the first Professor of Tamil soon after the [[University of Ceylon]] was established in 1943, which he held until his death in 1947. Thus Professor Vipulananda enjoys the unique distinction of being the first scholar to be appointed the first professor of Tamil in two Universities in two different countries.\n\nVipulanada was a strong advocate of the [[mother tongue]] as the [[Medium of instruction|medium of education]], but stressed the importance of learning other languages. At Sivananda Vidyalayam, in addition to Tamil, Vipulanada facilitated the teaching of English, Sinhala and Latin. He also recognized and promoted the importance of learning sciences such as biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics, as well as job-related technical subjects. He facilitated the efforts of other Tamil scholars to translate science and technology publications into Tamil by providing suitable technical terms.\n\nBased on his critical studies of some of Professor Vipulananda's writings, Mr. [[K.S. Sivakumaran]], one of the notable literary critics from Sri Lanka, has called him a pioneer of Tamil literary criticism and the first Sri Lankan Tamil literary critic.\n\nAs a social reformer, Vipulanada led the movement to recognize [[Subramanya Bharathi]], a [[Brahmin]] by birth, as the '''Maha Kavi''' (National Poet), and succeeded despite strong opposition from socially and politically powerful elites due to Bharathi's [[Indian caste system#Criticism|anti-castist]] views and his opposition to the perpetuation of the [[caste]] system and the [[superstition|superstitious]] Hindu practices and [[ritual]]s. As a [[Indian nationalism|nationalist]], he hoisted the [[Indian flag]] on the occasion of the visit of Sir [[George Fredrick Stanley]] to the [[Annamalai University]] for the 1937 convocation, while India was still a [[Britain Raj|British]] possession.\n\nThere are number of institutions named after him in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka and [[Germany]] have issued stamps honoring him.<ref name=DCS /><ref name=BV /><ref name=Island /> He died after a brief illness on July 19, 1947. Swami Vipulanada is buried close to the Sivananda Vidyalayam in [[Kalladi (Batticaloa)|Kalladi]], near Batticaloa city.

Professor [[Chelva Kanaganayagam]], in a critical review of ''Mathangaculamani'', concludes that {{cquote|The major contribution of the text is its attempt to establish drama as a valid academic discipline rather than provide a basis for performance.}}\n\nVipulanada also served as editor of several publications including ''Ramakrishna Vijayam'' (Tamil), ''Vivekananda'' (Tamil) and ''Prabuddha Bharata'' (English). He also edited and helped publish literary works of several well-known scholars. His translations from English to Tamil include selected writings of [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Rabindra Nath Tagore]] and [[historian]] [[Kathiresan Chettiar]]. He also translated from Tamil to English selected poems from the [[Sangam literature]] period, devotional songs from the [[Bhakti movement]] period, and poems of [[Subramanya Bharathi]] and Navaneetha Krishna Bharathi.\n\nVipulanada authored six major Tamil publications: a collection of four ''Prabanthangal'', ''Mathangaculamani'', ''The Great Dance of Thillai'', ''Umamageswaram'' (all related to [[Saiva]] traditions of the Hindu religion), ''Dictionary of Technical Terms on Chemistry'' and ''Yal Nool''. A collection of 170 essays, written from 1914 to 1947, were published posthumously in four parts in [[1995 in literature|1995]]. He also wrote many poems, and a collection of 32 of his poems was published in 1995. He was a good public speaker and most of his speeches, focusing mainly on history of the Tamils, [[Tamil literature]], Tamil music and musical instruments, and [[Vedanta]] philosophy, were published in international journals and magazines.<ref name=DCS /><ref name=BV />\n\n== Ramakrishna Mission ==\n{{Main|Ramakrishna Mission|Hinduism in Sri Lanka}}\nFounded in 1897 by [[Swami Vivekananda]], the disciple of [[Ramakrishna]], the Ramakrishna Mission is a unique order of ascetics and volunteers dedicated to service to community, irrespective of [[Religion in Sri Lanka|religious]], [[caste]], [[creed]] or [[Languages of Sri Lanka|language]] differences. The mission, while promoting spiritual development, does not believe in religious conversion. The mission's charitable and philanthropic activities focus mainly on the provision of educational and medical services to the weaker segment of the population through schools, hospitals and orphanages run by the mission. It became a counter weight to [[Christian missionary]]-run charitable  organizations throughout [[South Asia]].\n\nVipulananda initially met the head of the [[Mylapore]] Ramakrishna Mission, Swami Sarvananda,<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rkmissiondel/Swami_Sarvananda.html&date=2009-10-26+01:44:02 Swami Sarvananda] RKM Bio (English)</ref> in [[Colombo]] in 1916. This was followed up with another visit in [[Jaffna]] in 1917. He entered the Mylapore Ramakrishna Math in 1922 for his monastic training. On completion of the training in 1924, he was given the name Vipulananda. After his ordination he dedicated his life to educational and spiritual pursuits and service to the community in Sri Lanka and India.\n\nIn 1925 Vipulanada became an administrator of Ramakrishna Mission (RKM) schools in Sri Lanka. He was instrumental in founding new RKM schools in [[Jaffna]], Batticalao, Trincomalee  and in many villages. He also founded orphanages \u2013 two for boys at Vaitheeswara Vidyalayam, Jaffna and Sivananda Vidyalayam in Batticaloa, and one for girls in Karativu. Thereafter, a number of RKM schools were opened in several remote villages in the North and East of Sri Lanka. This provided an alternative to the natives to go to schools and orphanages that were not associated with western [[Christian missionaries]].<ref name=DCS /><ref name=BV /> He also helped his lifelong friend [[A. M. A. Azeez]], a pioneering Sri Lankan [[Muslim]] educator and [[civil servant]], to establish charitable organizations to help poor Muslims in the east of the country.<ref name=Island>{{cite news\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =A.M.A Azeez\n  | work =\n  | pages =\n  | publisher = The Island\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.island.lk/2007/10/06/features3.html\n  | accessdate =  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  | last = Jameel\n  | first = S.H.M\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Dr. Azeez's contribution to eastern development\n  | work =\n  | pages =\n  | publisher = Daily Mirror\n  | date =\n  | url = http://www.dailymirror.lk/2007/10/04/opinion/3.asp\n  | accessdate =  }}</ref>\n\n== Professional career ==\n[[File:\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb0\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bbf.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Swami Vipulananda's burial place and memorial]]\nAs a noted educationist, scholar and community worker, Vipulanada was invited by the [[University of Madras]] to present its case for the establishment of a Tamil University to the special commission set up to investigate the proposal. On the recommendation of the commission, the [[Annamalai University]] was opened in 1927. In 1931 he became its first Professor of Tamil language. Professor Vipulananda also received a second invitation to become the first Professor of Tamil soon after the [[University of Ceylon]] was established in 1943, which he held until his death in 1947. Thus Professor Vipulananda enjoys the unique distinction of being the first scholar to be appointed the first professor of Tamil in two Universities in two different countries.\n\nVipulanada was a strong advocate of the [[mother tongue]] as the [[Medium of instruction|medium of education]], but stressed the importance of learning other languages. At Sivananda Vidyalayam, in addition to Tamil, Vipulanada facilitated the teaching of English, Sinhala and Latin. He also recognized and promoted the importance of learning sciences such as biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics, as well as job-related technical subjects. He facilitated the efforts of other Tamil scholars to translate science and technology publications into Tamil by providing suitable technical terms.\n\nBased on his critical studies of some of Professor Vipulananda's writings, Mr. [[K.S. Sivakumaran]], one of the notable literary critics from Sri Lanka, has called him a pioneer of Tamil literary criticism and the first Sri Lankan Tamil literary critic.\n\nAs a social reformer, Vipulanada led the movement to recognize [[Subramanya Bharathi]], a [[Brahmin]] by birth, as the '''Maha Kavi''' (National Poet), and succeeded despite strong opposition from socially and politically powerful elites due to Bharathi's [[Indian caste system#Criticism|anti-castist]] views and his opposition to the perpetuation of the [[caste]] system and the [[superstition|superstitious]] Hindu practices and [[ritual]]s. As a [[Indian nationalism|nationalist]], he hoisted the [[Indian flag]] on the occasion of the visit of Sir [[George Fredrick Stanley]] to the [[Annamalai University]] for the 1937 convocation, while India was still a [[Britain Raj|British]] possession.\n\nThere are number of institutions named after him in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka and [[Germany]] have issued stamps honoring him.<ref name=DCS /><ref name=BV /><ref name=Island /> He died after a brief illness on July 19, 1947. Swami Vipulanada is buried close to the Sivananda Vidyalayam in [[Kalladi (Batticaloa)|Kalladi]], near Batticaloa city.
