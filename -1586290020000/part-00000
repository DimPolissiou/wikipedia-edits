German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855) said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences\u2014and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\"{{sfn|Long|1972|p=1}} Number theorists study [[prime number]]s as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (for example, [[rational number]]s) or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, [[algebraic integer]]s). Number theory seeks to understand the properties of integer systems in spite of their apparent complexity.\n\nIntegers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations ([[Diophantine geometry]]). Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of [[Complex analysis|analytical]] objects (for example, the [[Riemann zeta function]]) that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion ([[analytic number theory]]). One may also study [[real number]]s in relation to rational numbers, for example, as approximated by the latter ([[Diophantine approximation]]).\n\nThe older term for number theory is ''arithmetic''. By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by \"number theory\".<ref group=\"note\">Already in 1921, [[T. L. Heath]] had to explain: \"By arithmetic, Plato meant, not arithmetic in our sense, but the science which considers numbers in themselves, in other words, what we mean by the Theory of Numbers.\" {{harv|Heath|1921|p=13}}</ref> (The word \"[[arithmetic]]\" is used by the general public to mean \"[[Elementary arithmetic|elementary calculations]]\"; it has also acquired other meanings in [[mathematical logic]], as in ''[[Peano arithmetic]]'', and [[computer science]], as in ''[[floating point|floating point arithmetic]]''.) The use of the term ''arithmetic'' for ''number theory'' regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century, arguably in part due to French influence.<ref group=\"note\">Take, for example, {{harvnb|Serre|1973}}. In 1952, [[Harold Davenport|Davenport]] still had to specify that he meant ''The Higher Arithmetic''. [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and Wright wrote in the introduction to ''[[An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers]]'' (1938): \"We proposed at one time to change [the title] to ''An introduction to arithmetic'', a more novel and in some ways a more appropriate title; but it was pointed out that this might lead to misunderstandings about the content of the book.\" {{harv|Hardy|Wright|2008}}</ref> In particular, ''arithmetical'' is preferred as an adjective to ''number-theoretic''.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n====Dawn of arithmetic====\n[[Image:Plimpton 322.jpg|right|thumb|The Plimpton 322 tablet]]\nThe earliest historical find of an arithmetical nature is a fragment of a table: the broken clay tablet [[Plimpton 322]] ([[Larsa|Larsa, Mesopotamia]], ca. 1800 BCE) contains a list of \"[[Pythagorean triples]]\", that is, integers <math>(a,b,c)</math> such that <math>a^2+b^2=c^2</math>.\nThe triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by [[brute force method|brute force]]. The heading over the first column reads: \"The ''takiltum'' of the diagonal which has been subtracted such that the width...\"<ref>{{harvnb|Neugebauer & Sachs|1945|p=40}}. The term ''takiltum'' is problematic. Robson prefers the rendering \"The holding-square of the diagonal from which 1 is torn out, so that the short side comes up...\".{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=192}}</ref>\n\nThe table's layout suggests<ref>{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=189}}.

It has been suggested instead that the table was a source of numerical examples for school problems.{{sfn|Friberg|1981|p=302}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=201}}. This is controversial.

Like the Pythagoreans' perfect numbers, [[magic squares]] have passed from superstition into recreation.\n\n====Classical Greece and the early Hellenistic period====\n{{Further|Ancient Greek mathematics}}\n\nAside from a few fragments, the mathematics of Classical Greece is known to us either through the reports of contemporary non-mathematicians or through mathematical works from the early Hellenistic period.{{sfn|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|p=82}} In the case of number theory, this means, by and large, ''Plato'' and ''Euclid'', respectively.\n\nWhile Asian mathematics influenced Greek and Hellenistic learning, it seems to be the case that Greek mathematics is also an indigenous tradition.\n\n[[Eusebius]], PE X, chapter 4 mentions of [[Pythagoras]]:\n\n<blockquote>\"In fact the said Pythagoras, while busily studying the wisdom of each nation, visited Babylon, and Egypt, and all Persia, being instructed by the Magi and the priests: and in addition to these he is related to have studied under the Brahmans (these are Indian philosophers); and from some he gathered astrology, from others geometry, and arithmetic and music from others, and different things from different nations, and only from the wise men of Greece did he get nothing, wedded as they were to a poverty and dearth of wisdom: so on the contrary he himself became the author of instruction to the Greeks in the learning which he had procured from abroad.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_10_book10.htm | title=Eusebius of Caesarea: Praeparatio Evangelica (Preparation for the Gospel). Tr. E.H. Gifford (1903) \u2013 Book 10}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAristotle claimed that the philosophy of Plato closely followed the teachings of the Pythagoreans,<ref>Metaphysics, 1.6.1 (987a)</ref> and Cicero repeats this claim: ''Platonem ferunt didicisse Pythagorea omnia'' (\"They say Plato learned all things Pythagorean\").<ref>Tusc. Disput. 1.17.39.</ref>\n\n[[Plato]] had a keen interest in mathematics, and distinguished clearly between arithmetic and calculation. (By ''arithmetic'' he meant, in part, theorising on number, rather than what ''arithmetic'' or ''number theory'' have come to mean.) It is through one of Plato's dialogues\u2014namely, [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']]\u2014that we know that [[Theodorus of Cyrene|Theodorus]] had proven that <math>\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{5}, \\dots, \\sqrt{17}</math> are irrational. [[Theaetetus of Athens|Theaetetus]] was, like Plato, a disciple of Theodorus's; he worked on distinguishing different kinds of [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurables]], and was thus arguably a pioneer in the study of [[number systems]]. (Book X of [[Euclid's Elements]] is described by [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] as being largely based on Theaetetus's work.)\n\n[[Euclid]] devoted part of his ''Elements'' to prime numbers and divisibility, topics that belong unambiguously to number theory and are basic to it (Books VII to IX of [[Euclid's Elements]]). In particular, he gave an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers (the [[Euclidean algorithm]]; ''Elements'', Prop. VII.2) and the first known proof of the [[infinitude of primes]] (''Elements'', Prop. IX.20).\n\nIn 1773, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] published an [[epigram]] he had found in a manuscript during his work as a librarian; it claimed to be a letter sent by [[Archimedes]] to [[Eratosthenes]].{{sfn|Vardi|1998|pp=305\u201319}}{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=17\u201324}} The epigram proposed what has become known as\n[[Archimedes's cattle problem]]; its solution (absent from the manuscript) requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation (which reduces to what would later be misnamed [[Pell's equation]]). As far as we know, such equations were first successfully treated by the [[#\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara|Indian school]]. It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.\n\n====Diophantus====\n[[Image:Diophantus-cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of the 1621 edition of Diophantus's ''Arithmetica'', translated into [[Latin]] by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac]].]]\n\nVery little is known about [[Diophantus of Alexandria]]; he probably lived in the third century CE, that is, about five hundred years after Euclid. Six out of the thirteen books of Diophantus's ''[[Arithmetica]]'' survive in the original Greek; four more books survive in an Arabic translation. The ''Arithmetica'' is a collection of worked-out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations, usually of the form <math>f(x,y)=z^2</math> or <math>f(x,y,z)=w^2</math>. Thus, nowadays, we speak of ''Diophantine equations'' when we speak of polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions must be found.\n\nOne may say that Diophantus was studying rational points, that is, points whose coordinates are rational\u2014on [[curve]]s and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]; however, unlike the Greeks of the Classical period, who did what we would now call basic algebra in geometrical terms, Diophantus did what we would now call basic algebraic geometry in purely algebraic terms. In modern language, what Diophantus did was to find rational parametrizations of varieties; that is, given an equation of the form (say)\n<math>f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=0</math>, his aim was to find (in essence) three [[rational functions]] <math>g_1, g_2, g_3</math> such that, for all values of <math>r</math> and <math>s</math>, setting\n<math>x_i = g_i(r,s)</math> for <math>i=1,2,3</math> gives a solution to <math>f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=0.</math>\n\nDiophantus also studied the equations of some non-rational curves, for which no rational parametrisation is possible. He managed to find some rational points on these curves ([[elliptic curve]]s, as it happens, in what seems to be their first known occurrence) by means of what amounts to a tangent construction: translated into coordinate geometry\n(which did not exist in Diophantus's time), his method would be visualised as drawing a tangent to a curve at a known rational point, and then finding the other point of intersection of the tangent with the curve; that other point is a new rational point. (Diophantus also resorted to what could be called a special case of a secant construction.)\n\nWhile Diophantus was concerned largely with rational solutions, he assumed some results on integer numbers, in particular that [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|every integer is the sum of four squares]] (though he never stated as much explicitly).\n\n====\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara====\nWhile Greek astronomy probably influenced Indian learning, to the point of introducing trigonometry,{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=119}} it seems to be the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an indigenous tradition;<ref name=\"Plofbab\">Any early contact between Babylonian and Indian mathematics remains conjectural {{harv|Plofker|2008|p=42}}.</ref> in particular, there is no evidence that Euclid's Elements reached India before the 18th century.{{sfn|Mumford|2010|p=387}}\n\n[[Aryabhata|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]] (476\u2013550 CE) showed that pairs of simultaneous congruences <math>n\\equiv a_1 \\bmod m_1</math>, <math>n\\equiv a_2 \\bmod m_2</math> could be solved by a method he called ''ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka'', or ''pulveriser'';<ref>\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, \u0100ryabhat\u012bya, Chapter 2, verses 32\u201333, cited in: {{harvnb|Plofker|2008|pp=134\u201340}}.

Later Sanskrit authors would follow, using Brahmagupta's technical terminology. A general procedure (the [[Chakravala method|chakravala]], or \"cyclic method\") for solving Pell's equation was finally found by Jayadeva (cited in the eleventh century; his work is otherwise lost); the earliest surviving exposition appears in [[Bh\u0101skara II]]'s B\u012bja-ga\u1e47ita (twelfth century).{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=194}}\n\nIndian mathematics remained largely unknown in Europe until the late eighteenth century;{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=283}} Brahmagupta and Bh\u0101skara's work was translated into English in 1817 by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|Henry Colebrooke]].{{sfn|Colebrooke|1817}}\n\n====Arithmetic in the Islamic golden age====\n{{Further|Mathematics in medieval Islam}}\n\n[[File:Hevelius Selenographia frontispiece.png|upright|right|thumb|[[Al-Haytham]] seen by the West: frontispice of ''[[Selenographia]]'', showing Alhasen {{sic}} representing knowledge through reason, and Galileo representing knowledge through the senses.]]\n\nIn the early ninth century, the caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] ordered translations of many Greek mathematical works and at least one Sanskrit work (the ''Sindhind'',\nwhich may <ref>{{harvnb|Colebrooke|1817|p=lxv}}, cited in {{harvnb|Hopkins|1990|p=302}}.

The modern proof would have been within Fermat's means (and was indeed given later by Euler), even though the modern concept of a group came long after Fermat or Euler. (It helps to know that inverses exist modulo ''p'', that is, given ''a'' not divisible by a prime ''p'', there is an integer ''x'' such that <math> x a \\equiv 1 \\bmod p</math>); this fact (which, in modern language, makes the residues mod ''p'' into a group, and which was already known to [[Aryabhata|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]]; see [[#Indian school: \u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara|above]]) was familiar to Fermat thanks to its rediscovery by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac|Bachet]] {{harv|Weil|1984|p=7}}. Weil goes on to say that Fermat would have recognised that Bachet's argument is essentially Euclid's algorithm.</ref>\n* If ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime, then <math>a^2 + b^2</math> is not divisible by any prime congruent to \u22121 modulo 4;<ref>{{harvnb|Tannery|Henry|1891|loc=Vol. II, p. 204}}, cited in {{harvnb|Weil|1984|p=63}}.

The problem was solved in a few months by Wallis and Brouncker.{{sfn|Weil|1984|p=92}} Fermat considered their solution valid, but pointed out they had provided an algorithm without a proof (as had Jayadeva and Bhaskara, though Fermat wasn't aware of this). He stated that a proof could be found by infinite descent.\n* Fermat stated and proved (by infinite descent) in the appendix to ''Observations on Diophantus'' (Obs.

A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] (1837),{{sfn|Apostol|1976|p=7}} {{sfn|Davenport|Montgomery|2000|p=1}} whose proof introduced [[L-functions]] and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable.<ref>See the proof in {{harvnb|Davenport|Montgomery|2000|loc=section 1}}</ref> The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually\ngoes back to Euler (1730s),{{sfn|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}} {{sfn|Varadarajan|2006|loc=sections 2.5, 3.1 and 6.1}} who used formal power series and non-rigorous (or implicit) limiting arguments. The use of ''complex'' analysis in number theory comes later: the work of [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1859) on the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] is the canonical starting point;{{sfn|Granville|2008|pp=322\u201348}} [[Jacobi's four-square theorem]] (1839), which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory ([[modular form]]s).<ref>See the comment on the importance of modularity in {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe history of each subfield is briefly addressed in its own section below; see the main article of each subfield for fuller treatments. Many of the most interesting questions in each area remain open and are being actively worked on.\n\n==Main subdivisions==\n===Elementary tools===\nThe term ''[[elementary proof|elementary]]'' generally denotes a method that does not use [[complex analysis]]. For example, the [[prime number theorem]] was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by [[Paul Erd\u0151s|Erd\u0151s]] and [[Atle Selberg|Selberg]].{{sfn|Goldfeld|2003}} The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex [[Tauberian theorem]]s (for example, [[Wiener\u2013Ikehara theorem|Wiener\u2013Ikehara]]) are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an ''elementary'' proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non-elementary one.\n[[File:Paul Erdos with Terence Tao.jpg|thumb|270px|Number theorists [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] and [[Terence Tao]] in 1985, when Erd\u0151s was 72 and Tao was 10.]]\nNumber theory has the reputation of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible, in part because the range of tools they use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics.<ref>See, for example, the initial comment in {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}.</ref>\n\n===Analytic number theory===\n{{main|Analytic number theory}}\n\n[[Image:Complex zeta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Riemann zeta function]] \u03b6(''s'') in the [[complex plane]].

The region in grey is the standard [[fundamental domain]].]]\n\n''Analytic number theory'' may be defined\n\n* in terms of its tools, as the study of the integers by means of tools from real and complex analysis;{{sfn|Apostol|1976|p=7}} or\n* in terms of its concerns, as the study within number theory of estimates on size and density, as opposed to identities.<ref>{{harvnb|Granville|2008|loc=section 1}}: \"The main difference is that in algebraic number theory [...] one typically considers questions with answers that are given by exact formulas, whereas in analytic number theory [...] one looks for ''good approximations''.\"</ref>\n\nSome subjects generally considered to be part of analytic number theory, for example, [[sieve theory]],<ref group=\"note\">Sieve theory figures as one of the main subareas of analytic number theory in many standard treatments; see, for instance, {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004}} or {{harvnb|Montgomery|Vaughan|2007}}</ref> are better covered by the second rather than the first definition: some of sieve theory, for instance, uses little analysis,<ref group=\"note\">This is the case for small sieves (in particular, some combinatorial sieves such as the [[Brun sieve]]) rather than for [[large sieve]]s; the study of the latter now includes ideas from [[harmonic analysis|harmonic]] and [[functional analysis]].</ref> yet it does belong to analytic number theory.\n\nThe following are examples of problems in analytic number theory: the [[prime number theorem]], the [[Goldbach conjecture]] (or the [[twin prime conjecture]], or the [[Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture]]s), the [[Waring problem]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. Some of the most important tools of analytic number theory are the [[circle method]], [[sieve theory|sieve methods]] and [[L-functions]] (or, rather, the study of their properties). The theory of [[modular form]]s (and, more generally, [[automorphic forms]]) also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory.<ref>See the remarks in the introduction to {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}: \"However much stronger...\".</ref>\n\nOne may ask analytic questions about [[algebraic number]]s, and use analytic means to answer such questions; it is thus that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define [[prime ideals]] (generalizations of [[prime number]]s in the field of algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question [[Landau prime ideal theorem|can be answered]] by means of an examination of [[Dedekind zeta function]]s, which are generalizations of the [[Riemann zeta function]], a key analytic object at the roots of the subject.<ref>{{harvnb|Granville|2008|loc=section 3}}: \"[Riemann] defined what we now call the Riemann zeta function [...] Riemann's deep work gave birth to our subject [...]\"</ref> This is an example of a general procedure in analytic number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the analytic behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.<ref>See, for example, {{harvnb|Montgomery|Vaughan|2007}}, p. 1.</ref>\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n{{main|Algebraic number theory}}\n\nAn ''[[algebraic number]]'' is any complex number that is a solution to some polynomial equation <math>f(x)=0</math> with rational coefficients; for example, every solution <math>x</math> of <math>x^5 + (11/2) x^3 - 7 x^2 + 9 = 0 </math> (say) is an algebraic number. Fields of algebraic numbers are also called ''[[algebraic number field]]s'', or shortly ''[[number field]]s''. Algebraic number theory studies algebraic number fields.{{sfn|Milne|2017|p=2}} Thus, analytic and algebraic number theory can and do overlap: the former is defined by its methods, the latter by its objects of study.\n\nIt could be argued that the simplest kind of number fields (viz., quadratic fields) were already studied by Gauss, as the discussion of quadratic forms in ''Disquisitiones arithmeticae'' can be restated in terms of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] and\n[[Norm (mathematics)|norms]] in quadratic fields. (A ''quadratic field'' consists of all\nnumbers of the form <math> a + b \\sqrt{d}</math>, where\n<math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are rational numbers and <math>d</math>\nis a fixed rational number whose square root is not rational.)\nFor that matter, the 11th-century [[chakravala method]] amounts\u2014in modern terms\u2014to an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field. However, neither [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bh\u0101skara]] nor Gauss knew of number fields as such.\n\nThe grounds of the subject as we know it were set in the late nineteenth century, when ''ideal numbers'', the ''theory of ideals'' and ''valuation theory'' were developed; these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorisation in algebraic number fields. (For example, in the field generated by the rationals\nand <math> \\sqrt{-5}</math>, the number <math>6</math> can be factorised both as <math> 6 = 2 \\cdot 3</math> and\n<math> 6 = (1 + \\sqrt{-5}) ( 1 - \\sqrt{-5})</math>; all of <math>2</math>, <math>3</math>, <math>1 + \\sqrt{-5}</math> and\n<math> 1 - \\sqrt{-5}</math>\nare irreducible, and thus, in a na\u00efve sense, analogous to primes among the integers.) The initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers (by [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]]) seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws,{{sfn|Edwards|2000|p=79}} that is, generalisations of [[quadratic reciprocity]].\n\nNumber fields are often studied as extensions of smaller number fields: a field ''L'' is said to be an ''extension'' of a field ''K'' if ''L'' contains ''K''.\n(For example, the complex numbers ''C'' are an extension of the reals ''R'', and the reals ''R'' are an extension of the rationals ''Q''.)\nClassifying the possible extensions of a given number field is a difficult and partially open problem. Abelian extensions\u2014that is, extensions ''L'' of ''K'' such that the [[Galois group]]<ref group=\"note\">The Galois group of an extension ''K/L'' consists of the operations ([[isomorphisms]]) that send elements of L to other elements of L while leaving all elements of K fixed.\nThus, for instance, ''Gal(C/R)'' consists of two elements: the identity element\n(taking every element ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iy'' of ''C'' to itself) and complex conjugation\n(the map taking each element ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iy'' to ''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''iy'').\nThe Galois group of an extension tells us many of its crucial properties. The study of Galois groups started with [[\u00c9variste Galois]]; in modern language, the main outcome of his work is that an equation ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 can be solved by radicals\n(that is, ''x'' can be expressed in terms of the four basic operations together\nwith square roots, cubic roots, etc.) if and only if the extension of the rationals by the roots of the equation ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 has a Galois group that is [[solvable group|solvable]]\nin the sense of group theory. (\"Solvable\", in the sense of group theory, is a simple property that can be checked easily for finite groups.)</ref> Gal(''L''/''K'') of ''L'' over ''K'' is an [[abelian group]]\u2014are relatively well understood.\nTheir classification was the object of the programme of [[class field theory]], which was initiated in the late 19th century (partly by [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] and [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]) and carried out largely in 1900\u20131950.\n\nAn example of an active area of research in algebraic number theory is [[Iwasawa theory]]. The [[Langlands program]], one of the main current large-scale research plans in mathematics, is sometimes described as an attempt to generalise class field theory to non-abelian extensions of number fields.\n\n===Diophantine geometry===\n{{main|Diophantine geometry}}\n\nThe central problem of ''Diophantine geometry'' is to determine when a [[Diophantine equation]] has solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object.\n\nFor example, an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation, or system of equations, in two or more variables defines a [[algebraic curve|curve]], a [[algebraic surface|surface]] or some other such object in ''n''-dimensional space. In Diophantine geometry, one asks whether there are any ''[[rational points]]'' (points all of whose coordinates are rationals) or\n''integral points'' (points all of whose coordinates are integers) on the curve or surface. If there are any such points, the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed. A basic question in this direction is if there are finitely\nor infinitely many rational points on a given curve (or surface).\n\nIn the [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean equation]] <math>x^2+y^2 = 1,</math>\nwe would like to study its rational solutions, that is, its solutions\n<math>(x,y)</math> such that\n''x'' and ''y'' are both rational. This is the same as asking for all integer solutions\nto <math>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</math>; any solution to the latter equation gives\nus a solution <math>x = a/c</math>, <math>y = b/c</math> to the former. It is also the\nsame as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve\ndescribed by <math>x^2 + y^2 = 1</math>. (This curve happens to be a circle of radius 1 around the origin.)\n\n[[Image:ECClines-3.svg|right|thumb|300px|Two examples of an [[elliptic curve]], that is, a curve\nof genus 1 having at least one rational point. (Either graph can be seen as a slice of a [[torus]] in four-dimensional space.)]]\n\nThe rephrasing of questions on equations in terms of points on curves turns out to be felicitous. The finiteness or not of the number of rational or integer points on an algebraic curve\u2014that is, rational or integer solutions to an equation <math>f(x,y)=0</math>, where <math>f</math> is a polynomial in two variables\u2014turns out to depend crucially on the ''genus'' of the curve. The ''genus'' can be defined as follows:<ref group=\"note\">If we want to study the curve <math>y^2 = x^3 + 7</math>. We allow ''x'' and ''y'' to be complex numbers: <math>(a + b i)^2 = (c + d i)^3 + 7</math>. This is, in effect, a set of two equations on four variables, since both the real\nand the imaginary part on each side must match. As a result, we get a surface (two-dimensional) in four-dimensional space. After we choose a convenient hyperplane on which to project the surface (meaning that, say, we choose to ignore the coordinate ''a''), we can\nplot the resulting projection, which is a surface in ordinary three-dimensional space. It\nthen becomes clear that the result is a [[torus]], loosely speaking, the surface of a doughnut (somewhat\nstretched). A doughnut has one hole; hence the genus is 1.</ref> allow the variables in <math>f(x,y)=0</math> to be complex numbers; then <math>f(x,y)=0</math> defines a 2-dimensional surface in (projective) 4-dimensional space (since two complex variables can be decomposed into four real variables, that is, four dimensions). If we count the number of (doughnut) holes in the surface; we call this number the ''genus'' of <math>f(x,y)=0</math>. Other geometrical notions turn out to be just as crucial.\n\nThere is also the closely linked area of [[Diophantine approximations]]: given a number <math>x</math>, then finding how well can it be approximated by rationals. (We are looking for approximations that are good relative to the amount of space that it takes to write the rational: call <math>a/q</math> (with <math>\\gcd(a,q)=1</math>) a good approximation to <math>x</math> if <math>|x-a/q|<\\frac{1}{q^c}</math>, where <math>c</math> is large.) This question is of special interest if <math>x</math> is an algebraic number. If <math>x</math> cannot be well approximated, then some equations do not have integer or rational solutions. Moreover, several concepts (especially that of [[Glossary of arithmetic and diophantine geometry#H|height]]) turn out to be critical both in Diophantine geometry and in the study of Diophantine approximations. This question is also of special interest in [[transcendental number theory]]: if a number can be better approximated than any algebraic number, then it is a [[transcendental number]]. It is by this argument that [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] have been shown to be transcendental.\n\nDiophantine geometry should not be confused with the [[geometry of numbers]], which is a collection of graphical methods for answering certain questions in algebraic number theory. ''Arithmetic geometry'', however, is a contemporary term\nfor much the same domain as that covered by the term ''Diophantine geometry''. The term ''arithmetic geometry'' is arguably used\nmost often when one wishes to emphasise the connections to modern algebraic geometry (as in, for instance, [[Faltings's theorem]]) rather than to techniques in Diophantine approximations.\n\n==Other subfields==\nThe areas below date from no earlier than the mid-twentieth century, even if they are based on older material. For example, as is explained below, the matter of algorithms in number theory is very old, in some sense older than the concept of proof; at the same time, the modern study of [[computability]] dates only from the 1930s and 1940s, and [[computational complexity theory]] from the 1970s.\n\n===Probabilistic number theory===\n{{main|Probabilistic number theory}}\n\nMuch of probabilistic number theory can be seen as an important special case of the study of variables that are almost, but not quite, mutually [[statistical independence|independent]]. For example, the event that a random integer between one and a million be divisible by two and the event that it be divisible by three are almost independent, but not quite.\n\nIt is sometimes said that [[probabilistic combinatorics]] uses the fact that whatever happens with probability greater than <math>0</math> must happen sometimes; one may say with equal justice that many applications of probabilistic number theory hinge on the fact that whatever is unusual must be rare. If certain algebraic objects (say, rational or integer solutions to certain equations) can be shown to be in the tail of certain sensibly defined distributions, it follows that there must be few of them; this is a very concrete non-probabilistic statement following from a probabilistic one.\n\nAt times, a non-rigorous, probabilistic approach leads to a number of [[heuristic]] algorithms and open problems, notably [[Cram\u00e9r's conjecture]].\n\n===Arithmetic combinatorics===\n{{main|Arithmetic combinatorics|Additive number theory}}\n\nIf we begin from a fairly \"thick\" infinite set <math>A</math>, does it contain many elements in arithmetic progression: <math>a</math>,\n<math>a+b, a+2 b, a+3 b, \\ldots, a+10b</math>, say? Should it be possible to write large integers as sums of elements of <math>A</math>?\n\nThese questions are characteristic of ''arithmetic combinatorics''. This is a presently coalescing field; it subsumes ''[[additive number theory]]'' (which concerns itself with certain very specific sets <math>A</math> of arithmetic significance, such as the primes or the squares) and, arguably, some of the ''[[geometry of numbers]]'',\ntogether with some rapidly developing new material. Its focus on issues of growth and distribution accounts in part for its developing links with [[ergodic theory]], [[finite group theory]], [[model theory]], and other fields. The term ''additive combinatorics'' is also used; however, the sets <math>A</math> being studied need not be sets of integers, but rather subsets of non-commutative [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], for which the multiplication symbol, not the addition symbol, is traditionally used; they can also be subsets of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], in which case the growth of <math>A+A</math> and <math>A</math>\u00b7<math>A</math> may be\ncompared.\n\n===Computational number theory===\n{{main|Computational number theory}}[[Image:Lehmer sieve.jpg|thumb|A [[Lehmer sieve]], which is a primitive [[digital computer]] once used for finding [[Prime number|primes]] and solving simple [[Diophantine equations]].]]While the word ''algorithm'' goes back only to certain readers of [[al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]], careful descriptions of methods of solution are older than proofs: such methods (that is, algorithms) are as old as any recognisable mathematics\u2014ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Vedic, Chinese\u2014whereas proofs appeared only with the Greeks of the classical period.\nAn interesting early case is that of what we now call the [[Euclidean algorithm]]. In its basic form (namely, as an algorithm for computing the [[greatest common divisor]]) it appears as Proposition 2 of Book VII in ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', together with a proof of correctness. However, in the form that is often used in number theory (namely, as an algorithm for finding integer solutions to an equation <math>a x + b y = c</math>,\nor, what is the same, for finding the quantities whose existence is assured by the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]) it first appears in the works of [[Aryabhata#Indeterminate equations|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]] (5th\u20136th century CE) as an algorithm called\n''ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka'' (\"pulveriser\"), without a proof of correctness.\n\nThere are two main questions: \"can we compute this?\" and \"can we compute it rapidly?\". Anyone can test whether a number is prime or, if it is not, split it into prime factors; doing so rapidly is another matter. We now know fast algorithms for [[primality test|testing primality]], but, in spite of much work (both theoretical and practical), no truly fast algorithm for factoring.\n\nThe difficulty of a computation can be useful: modern protocols for [[cryptography|encrypting messages]] (for example, [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]) depend on functions that are known to all, but whose inverses are known only to a chosen few, and would take one too long a time to figure out on one's own. For example, these functions can be such that their inverses can be computed only if certain large integers are factorized. While many difficult computational problems outside number theory are known, most working encryption protocols nowadays are based on the difficulty of a few number-theoretical problems.\n\nSome things may not be computable at all; in fact, this can be proven in some instances. For instance, in 1970, it was proven, as a solution to [[Hilbert's 10th problem]], that there is no [[Turing machine]] which can solve all Diophantine equations.<ref>{{cite book | editor=Felix E.

(We would necessarily be speaking of Diophantine equations for which there are no integer solutions, since, given a Diophantine equation with at least one solution, the solution itself provides a proof of the fact that a solution exists. We cannot prove that a particular Diophantine equation is of this kind, since this would imply that it has no solutions.)\n\n==Applications==\n{{Expand section|1=<nowiki />\n* Modern applications of Number theory|date=March 2016}}\nThe number-theorist [[Leonard Dickson]] (1874\u20131954) said \"Thank God that number theory is unsullied by any application\".

German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855) said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences\u2014and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\"{{sfn|Long|1972|p=1}} Number theorists study [[prime number]]s as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (for example, [[rational number]]s) or defined as generalizations of the integers (for example, [[algebraic integer]]s). Number theory seeks to understand the properties of integer systems in spite of their apparent complexity.\n\nIntegers can be considered either in themselves or as solutions to equations ([[Diophantine geometry]]). Questions in number theory are often best understood through the study of [[Complex analysis|analytical]] objects (for example, the [[Riemann zeta function]]) that encode properties of the integers, primes or other number-theoretic objects in some fashion ([[analytic number theory]]). One may also study [[real number]]s in relation to rational numbers, for example, as approximated by the latter ([[Diophantine approximation]]).\n\nThe older term for number theory is ''arithmetic''. By the early twentieth century, it had been superseded by \"number theory\".<ref group=\"note\">Already in 1921, [[T. L. Heath]] had to explain: \"By arithmetic, Plato meant, not arithmetic in our sense, but the science which considers numbers in themselves, in other words, what we mean by the Theory of Numbers.\" {{harv|Heath|1921|p=13}}</ref> (The word \"[[arithmetic]]\" is used by the general public to mean \"[[Elementary arithmetic|elementary calculations]]\"; it has also acquired other meanings in [[mathematical logic]], as in ''[[Peano arithmetic]]'', and [[computer science]], as in ''[[floating point|floating point arithmetic]]''.) The use of the term ''arithmetic'' for ''number theory'' regained some ground in the second half of the 20th century, arguably in part due to French influence.<ref group=\"note\">Take, for example, {{harvnb|Serre|1973}}. In 1952, [[Harold Davenport|Davenport]] still had to specify that he meant ''The Higher Arithmetic''. [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and Wright wrote in the introduction to ''[[An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers]]'' (1938): \"We proposed at one time to change [the title] to ''An introduction to arithmetic'', a more novel and in some ways a more appropriate title; but it was pointed out that this might lead to misunderstandings about the content of the book.\" {{harv|Hardy|Wright|2008}}</ref> In particular, ''arithmetical'' is preferred as an adjective to ''number-theoretic''.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n====Dawn of arithmetic====\n[[Image:Plimpton 322.jpg|right|thumb|The Plimpton 322 tablet]]\nThe earliest historical find of an arithmetical nature is a fragment of a table: the broken clay tablet [[Plimpton 322]] ([[Larsa|Larsa, Mesopotamia]], ca. 1800 BCE) contains a list of \"[[Pythagorean triples]]\", that is, integers <math>(a,b,c)</math> such that <math>a^2+b^2=c^2</math>.\nThe triples are too many and too large to have been obtained by [[brute force method|brute force]]. The heading over the first column reads: \"The ''takiltum'' of the diagonal which has been subtracted such that the width...\"<ref>{{harvnb|Neugebauer & Sachs|1945|p=40}}. The term ''takiltum'' is problematic. Robson prefers the rendering \"The holding-square of the diagonal from which 1 is torn out, so that the short side comes up...\".{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=192}}</ref>\n\nThe table's layout suggests<ref>{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=189}}. Other sources give the modern formula <math>(p^2-q^2,2pq,p^2+q^2)</math>. Van der Waerden gives both the modern formula and what amounts to the form preferred by Robson.{{harv|van der Waerden|1961|p=79}}</ref> that it was constructed by means of what amounts, in modern language, to the identity\n\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\left(x - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right)^2 + 1 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\left(x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right)\\right)^2,</math>\n\nwhich is implicit in routine Old Babylonian exercises.{{sfn|van der Waerden|1961|p=184}} If some other method was used,<ref>Neugebauer {{harv|Neugebauer|1969|pp=36\u201340}} discusses the table in detail and mentions in passing Euclid's method in modern notation {{harv|Neugebauer|1969|p=39}}.</ref> the triples were first constructed and then reordered by <math>c/a</math>, presumably for actual use as a \"table\", for example, with a view to applications.\n\nIt is not known what these applications may have been, or whether there could have been any; [[Babylonian astronomy]], for example, truly came into its own only later. It has been suggested instead that the table was a source of numerical examples for school problems.{{sfn|Friberg|1981|p=302}}<ref group=\"note\">{{harvnb|Robson|2001|p=201}}. This is controversial. See [[Plimpton 322]]. Robson's article is written polemically {{harv|Robson|2001|p=202}} with a view to \"perhaps [...] knocking [Plimpton 322] off its pedestal\" {{harv|Robson|2001|p=167}}; at the same time, it settles to the conclusion that <blockquote>[...] the question \"how was the tablet calculated?\" does not have to have the same answer as the question \"what problems does the tablet set?\" The first can be answered most satisfactorily by reciprocal pairs, as first suggested half a century ago, and the second by some sort of right-triangle problems {{harv|Robson|2001|p=202}}. </blockquote>\nRobson takes issue with the notion that the scribe who produced Plimpton 322 (who had to \"work for a living\", and would not have belonged to a \"leisured middle class\") could have been motivated by his own \"idle curiosity\" in the absence of a \"market for new mathematics\".{{harv|Robson|2001|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\nWhile Babylonian number theory\u2014or what survives of [[Babylonian mathematics]] that can be called thus\u2014consists of this single, striking fragment, Babylonian algebra (in the secondary-school sense of \"algebra\") was exceptionally well developed.{{sfn|van der Waerden|1961|p=43}} Late Neoplatonic sources<ref name=\"vanderW2\">[[Iamblichus]], ''Life of Pythagoras'',(trans., for example, {{harvnb|Guthrie|1987}}) cited in {{harvnb|van der Waerden|1961|p=108}}.

Disput. 1.17.39.</ref>\n\n[[Plato]] had a keen interest in mathematics, and distinguished clearly between arithmetic and calculation. (By ''arithmetic'' he meant, in part, theorising on number, rather than what ''arithmetic'' or ''number theory'' have come to mean.) It is through one of Plato's dialogues\u2014namely, [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']]\u2014that we know that [[Theodorus of Cyrene|Theodorus]] had proven that <math>\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{5}, \\dots, \\sqrt{17}</math> are irrational. [[Theaetetus of Athens|Theaetetus]] was, like Plato, a disciple of Theodorus's; he worked on distinguishing different kinds of [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurables]], and was thus arguably a pioneer in the study of [[number systems]]. (Book X of [[Euclid's Elements]] is described by [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] as being largely based on Theaetetus's work.)\n\n[[Euclid]] devoted part of his ''Elements'' to prime numbers and divisibility, topics that belong unambiguously to number theory and are basic to it (Books VII to IX of [[Euclid's Elements]]). In particular, he gave an algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two numbers (the [[Euclidean algorithm]]; ''Elements'', Prop. VII.2) and the first known proof of the [[infinitude of primes]] (''Elements'', Prop. IX.20).\n\nIn 1773, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] published an [[epigram]] he had found in a manuscript during his work as a librarian; it claimed to be a letter sent by [[Archimedes]] to [[Eratosthenes]].{{sfn|Vardi|1998|pp=305\u201319}}{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=17\u201324}} The epigram proposed what has become known as\n[[Archimedes's cattle problem]]; its solution (absent from the manuscript) requires solving an indeterminate quadratic equation (which reduces to what would later be misnamed [[Pell's equation]]). As far as we know, such equations were first successfully treated by the [[#\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara|Indian school]]. It is not known whether Archimedes himself had a method of solution.\n\n====Diophantus====\n[[Image:Diophantus-cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of the 1621 edition of Diophantus's ''Arithmetica'', translated into [[Latin]] by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac]].]]\n\nVery little is known about [[Diophantus of Alexandria]]; he probably lived in the third century CE, that is, about five hundred years after Euclid. Six out of the thirteen books of Diophantus's ''[[Arithmetica]]'' survive in the original Greek; four more books survive in an Arabic translation. The ''Arithmetica'' is a collection of worked-out problems where the task is invariably to find rational solutions to a system of polynomial equations, usually of the form <math>f(x,y)=z^2</math> or <math>f(x,y,z)=w^2</math>. Thus, nowadays, we speak of ''Diophantine equations'' when we speak of polynomial equations to which rational or integer solutions must be found.\n\nOne may say that Diophantus was studying rational points, that is, points whose coordinates are rational\u2014on [[curve]]s and [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]]; however, unlike the Greeks of the Classical period, who did what we would now call basic algebra in geometrical terms, Diophantus did what we would now call basic algebraic geometry in purely algebraic terms. In modern language, what Diophantus did was to find rational parametrizations of varieties; that is, given an equation of the form (say)\n<math>f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=0</math>, his aim was to find (in essence) three [[rational functions]] <math>g_1, g_2, g_3</math> such that, for all values of <math>r</math> and <math>s</math>, setting\n<math>x_i = g_i(r,s)</math> for <math>i=1,2,3</math> gives a solution to <math>f(x_1,x_2,x_3)=0.</math>\n\nDiophantus also studied the equations of some non-rational curves, for which no rational parametrisation is possible. He managed to find some rational points on these curves ([[elliptic curve]]s, as it happens, in what seems to be their first known occurrence) by means of what amounts to a tangent construction: translated into coordinate geometry\n(which did not exist in Diophantus's time), his method would be visualised as drawing a tangent to a curve at a known rational point, and then finding the other point of intersection of the tangent with the curve; that other point is a new rational point. (Diophantus also resorted to what could be called a special case of a secant construction.)\n\nWhile Diophantus was concerned largely with rational solutions, he assumed some results on integer numbers, in particular that [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|every integer is the sum of four squares]] (though he never stated as much explicitly).\n\n====\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara====\nWhile Greek astronomy probably influenced Indian learning, to the point of introducing trigonometry,{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=119}} it seems to be the case that Indian mathematics is otherwise an indigenous tradition;<ref name=\"Plofbab\">Any early contact between Babylonian and Indian mathematics remains conjectural {{harv|Plofker|2008|p=42}}.</ref> in particular, there is no evidence that Euclid's Elements reached India before the 18th century.{{sfn|Mumford|2010|p=387}}\n\n[[Aryabhata|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]] (476\u2013550 CE) showed that pairs of simultaneous congruences <math>n\\equiv a_1 \\bmod m_1</math>, <math>n\\equiv a_2 \\bmod m_2</math> could be solved by a method he called ''ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka'', or ''pulveriser'';<ref>\u0100ryabha\u1e6da, \u0100ryabhat\u012bya, Chapter 2, verses 32\u201333, cited in: {{harvnb|Plofker|2008|pp=134\u201340}}.

Later Sanskrit authors would follow, using Brahmagupta's technical terminology. A general procedure (the [[Chakravala method|chakravala]], or \"cyclic method\") for solving Pell's equation was finally found by Jayadeva (cited in the eleventh century; his work is otherwise lost); the earliest surviving exposition appears in [[Bh\u0101skara II]]'s B\u012bja-ga\u1e47ita (twelfth century).{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=194}}\n\nIndian mathematics remained largely unknown in Europe until the late eighteenth century;{{sfn|Plofker|2008|p=283}} Brahmagupta and Bh\u0101skara's work was translated into English in 1817 by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|Henry Colebrooke]].{{sfn|Colebrooke|1817}}\n\n====Arithmetic in the Islamic golden age====\n{{Further|Mathematics in medieval Islam}}\n\n[[File:Hevelius Selenographia frontispiece.png|upright|right|thumb|[[Al-Haytham]] seen by the West: frontispice of ''[[Selenographia]]'', showing Alhasen {{sic}} representing knowledge through reason, and Galileo representing knowledge through the senses.]]\n\nIn the early ninth century, the caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] ordered translations of many Greek mathematical works and at least one Sanskrit work (the ''Sindhind'',\nwhich may <ref>{{harvnb|Colebrooke|1817|p=lxv}}, cited in {{harvnb|Hopkins|1990|p=302}}.

According to Rashed Roshdi, Al-Karaj\u012b's contemporary [[Ibn al-Haytham]] knew{{sfn|Rashed|1980|pp=305\u201321}} what would later be called [[Wilson's theorem]].\n\n====Western Europe in the Middle Ages====\nOther than a treatise on squares in arithmetic progression by [[Fibonacci]]\u2014who traveled and studied in north Africa and Constantinople\u2014no number theory to speak of was done in western Europe during the Middle Ages. Matters started to change in Europe in the late [[Renaissance]], thanks to a renewed study of the works of Greek antiquity. A catalyst was the textual emendation and translation into Latin of Diophantus' ''[[Arithmetica]]''.<ref>[[Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac|Bachet]], 1621, following a first attempt by [[Guilielmus Xylander|Xylander]], 1575</ref>\n<!--Fibonaaci sequence, unknown author of 1486 ms, Luca Pacioli.. -->\n\n===Early modern number theory===\n====Fermat====\n[[Image:Pierre de Fermat.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Pierre de Fermat]]]]\n\n[[Pierre de Fermat]] (1607\u20131665) never published his writings; in particular, his work on number theory is contained almost entirely in letters to mathematicians and in private marginal notes.{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=45\u201346}} In his notes and letters, he scarcely wrote any proofs - he had no models in the area.<ref>{{harvnb|Weil|1984|p=118}}.

This notation is actually much later than Fermat's; it first appears in section 1 of [[Gauss]]'s [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]. Fermat's little theorem is a consequence of the [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|fact]] that the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of an element of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] divides the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of the [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. The modern proof would have been within Fermat's means (and was indeed given later by Euler), even though the modern concept of a group came long after Fermat or Euler. (It helps to know that inverses exist modulo ''p'', that is, given ''a'' not divisible by a prime ''p'', there is an integer ''x'' such that <math> x a \\equiv 1 \\bmod p</math>); this fact (which, in modern language, makes the residues mod ''p'' into a group, and which was already known to [[Aryabhata|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]]; see [[#Indian school: \u0100ryabha\u1e6da, Brahmagupta, Bh\u0101skara|above]]) was familiar to Fermat thanks to its rediscovery by [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de M\u00e9ziriac|Bachet]] {{harv|Weil|1984|p=7}}.

He gave a full treatment of the equation <math>a x^2 + b y^2 + c z^2 = 0</math>{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=327\u201328}} and worked on quadratic forms along the lines later developed fully by Gauss.{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=332\u201334}} In his old age, he was the first to prove \"Fermat's last theorem\" for <math>n=5</math> (completing work by [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]], and crediting both him and [[Sophie Germain]]).{{sfn|Weil|1984|pp=337\u201338}}\n\n[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|left|Carl Friedrich Gauss]]\n\nIn his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1798), [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855) proved the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]] and developed the theory of quadratic forms (in particular, defining their composition). He also introduced some basic notation ([[congruences]]) and devoted a section to computational matters, including primality tests.{{sfn|Goldstein|Schappacher|2007|p=14}} The last section of the ''Disquisitiones'' established a link between [[roots of unity]] and number theory:\n<blockquote>The theory of the division of the circle...which is treated in sec. 7 does not belong\nby itself to arithmetic, but its principles can only be drawn from higher arithmetic.<ref>From the preface of ''Disquisitiones Arithmeticae''; the translation is taken from {{harvnb|Goldstein|Schappacher|2007|p=16}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn this way, Gauss arguably made a first foray towards both [[\u00c9variste Galois]]'s work and [[algebraic number theory]].\n\n===Maturity and division into subfields===\n[[Image:ErnstKummer.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ernst Kummer]]]]\n[[Image:Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]]]\n\nStarting early in the nineteenth century, the following developments gradually took place:\n\n* The rise to self-consciousness of number theory (or ''higher arithmetic'') as a field of study.<ref>See the discussion in section 5 of {{harvnb|Goldstein|Schappacher|2007}}. Early signs of self-consciousness are present already in letters by Fermat: thus his remarks on what number theory is, and how \"Diophantus's work [...] does not really belong to [it]\" (quoted in {{harvnb|Weil|1984|p=25}}).</ref>\n* The development of much of modern mathematics necessary for basic modern number theory: [[complex analysis]], [[group theory]], [[Galois theory]]\u2014accompanied by greater rigor in analysis and abstraction in algebra.\n* The rough subdivision of number theory into its modern subfields\u2014in particular, [[analytic number theory|analytic]] and [[algebraic number theory]].\n\nAlgebraic number theory may be said to start with the study of reciprocity and [[root of unity|cyclotomy]], but truly came into its own with the development of [[abstract algebra]] and early ideal theory and [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]] theory; see below. A conventional starting point for analytic number theory is [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]] (1837),{{sfn|Apostol|1976|p=7}} {{sfn|Davenport|Montgomery|2000|p=1}} whose proof introduced [[L-functions]] and involved some asymptotic analysis and a limiting process on a real variable.<ref>See the proof in {{harvnb|Davenport|Montgomery|2000|loc=section 1}}</ref> The first use of analytic ideas in number theory actually\ngoes back to Euler (1730s),{{sfn|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}} {{sfn|Varadarajan|2006|loc=sections 2.5, 3.1 and 6.1}} who used formal power series and non-rigorous (or implicit) limiting arguments. The use of ''complex'' analysis in number theory comes later: the work of [[Bernhard Riemann]] (1859) on the [[Riemann zeta function|zeta function]] is the canonical starting point;{{sfn|Granville|2008|pp=322\u201348}} [[Jacobi's four-square theorem]] (1839), which predates it, belongs to an initially different strand that has by now taken a leading role in analytic number theory ([[modular form]]s).<ref>See the comment on the importance of modularity in {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe history of each subfield is briefly addressed in its own section below; see the main article of each subfield for fuller treatments. Many of the most interesting questions in each area remain open and are being actively worked on.\n\n==Main subdivisions==\n===Elementary tools===\nThe term ''[[elementary proof|elementary]]'' generally denotes a method that does not use [[complex analysis]]. For example, the [[prime number theorem]] was first proven using complex analysis in 1896, but an elementary proof was found only in 1949 by [[Paul Erd\u0151s|Erd\u0151s]] and [[Atle Selberg|Selberg]].{{sfn|Goldfeld|2003}} The term is somewhat ambiguous: for example, proofs based on complex [[Tauberian theorem]]s (for example, [[Wiener\u2013Ikehara theorem|Wiener\u2013Ikehara]]) are often seen as quite enlightening but not elementary, in spite of using Fourier analysis, rather than complex analysis as such. Here as elsewhere, an ''elementary'' proof may be longer and more difficult for most readers than a non-elementary one.\n[[File:Paul Erdos with Terence Tao.jpg|thumb|270px|Number theorists [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] and [[Terence Tao]] in 1985, when Erd\u0151s was 72 and Tao was 10.]]\nNumber theory has the reputation of being a field many of whose results can be stated to the layperson. At the same time, the proofs of these results are not particularly accessible, in part because the range of tools they use is, if anything, unusually broad within mathematics.<ref>See, for example, the initial comment in {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}.</ref>\n\n===Analytic number theory===\n{{main|Analytic number theory}}\n\n[[Image:Complex zeta.jpg|right|thumb|[[Riemann zeta function]] \u03b6(''s'') in the [[complex plane]].

The region in grey is the standard [[fundamental domain]].]]\n\n''Analytic number theory'' may be defined\n\n* in terms of its tools, as the study of the integers by means of tools from real and complex analysis;{{sfn|Apostol|1976|p=7}} or\n* in terms of its concerns, as the study within number theory of estimates on size and density, as opposed to identities.<ref>{{harvnb|Granville|2008|loc=section 1}}: \"The main difference is that in algebraic number theory [...] one typically considers questions with answers that are given by exact formulas, whereas in analytic number theory [...] one looks for ''good approximations''.\"</ref>\n\nSome subjects generally considered to be part of analytic number theory, for example, [[sieve theory]],<ref group=\"note\">Sieve theory figures as one of the main subareas of analytic number theory in many standard treatments; see, for instance, {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004}} or {{harvnb|Montgomery|Vaughan|2007}}</ref> are better covered by the second rather than the first definition: some of sieve theory, for instance, uses little analysis,<ref group=\"note\">This is the case for small sieves (in particular, some combinatorial sieves such as the [[Brun sieve]]) rather than for [[large sieve]]s; the study of the latter now includes ideas from [[harmonic analysis|harmonic]] and [[functional analysis]].</ref> yet it does belong to analytic number theory.\n\nThe following are examples of problems in analytic number theory: the [[prime number theorem]], the [[Goldbach conjecture]] (or the [[twin prime conjecture]], or the [[Hardy\u2013Littlewood conjecture]]s), the [[Waring problem]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. Some of the most important tools of analytic number theory are the [[circle method]], [[sieve theory|sieve methods]] and [[L-functions]] (or, rather, the study of their properties). The theory of [[modular form]]s (and, more generally, [[automorphic forms]]) also occupies an increasingly central place in the toolbox of analytic number theory.<ref>See the remarks in the introduction to {{harvnb|Iwaniec|Kowalski|2004|p=1}}: \"However much stronger...\".</ref>\n\nOne may ask analytic questions about [[algebraic number]]s, and use analytic means to answer such questions; it is thus that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define [[prime ideals]] (generalizations of [[prime number]]s in the field of algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This question [[Landau prime ideal theorem|can be answered]] by means of an examination of [[Dedekind zeta function]]s, which are generalizations of the [[Riemann zeta function]], a key analytic object at the roots of the subject.<ref>{{harvnb|Granville|2008|loc=section 3}}: \"[Riemann] defined what we now call the Riemann zeta function [...] Riemann's deep work gave birth to our subject [...]\"</ref> This is an example of a general procedure in analytic number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the analytic behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.<ref>See, for example, {{harvnb|Montgomery|Vaughan|2007}}, p. 1.</ref>\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n{{main|Algebraic number theory}}\n\nAn ''[[algebraic number]]'' is any complex number that is a solution to some polynomial equation <math>f(x)=0</math> with rational coefficients; for example, every solution <math>x</math> of <math>x^5 + (11/2) x^3 - 7 x^2 + 9 = 0 </math> (say) is an algebraic number. Fields of algebraic numbers are also called ''[[algebraic number field]]s'', or shortly ''[[number field]]s''. Algebraic number theory studies algebraic number fields.{{sfn|Milne|2014|p=2}} Thus, analytic and algebraic number theory can and do overlap: the former is defined by its methods, the latter by its objects of study.\n\nIt could be argued that the simplest kind of number fields (viz., quadratic fields) were already studied by Gauss, as the discussion of quadratic forms in ''Disquisitiones arithmeticae'' can be restated in terms of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] and\n[[Norm (mathematics)|norms]] in quadratic fields. (A ''quadratic field'' consists of all\nnumbers of the form <math> a + b \\sqrt{d}</math>, where\n<math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are rational numbers and <math>d</math>\nis a fixed rational number whose square root is not rational.)\nFor that matter, the 11th-century [[chakravala method]] amounts\u2014in modern terms\u2014to an algorithm for finding the units of a real quadratic number field. However, neither [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bh\u0101skara]] nor Gauss knew of number fields as such.\n\nThe grounds of the subject as we know it were set in the late nineteenth century, when ''ideal numbers'', the ''theory of ideals'' and ''valuation theory'' were developed; these are three complementary ways of dealing with the lack of unique factorisation in algebraic number fields. (For example, in the field generated by the rationals\nand <math> \\sqrt{-5}</math>, the number <math>6</math> can be factorised both as <math> 6 = 2 \\cdot 3</math> and\n<math> 6 = (1 + \\sqrt{-5}) ( 1 - \\sqrt{-5})</math>; all of <math>2</math>, <math>3</math>, <math>1 + \\sqrt{-5}</math> and\n<math> 1 - \\sqrt{-5}</math>\nare irreducible, and thus, in a na\u00efve sense, analogous to primes among the integers.) The initial impetus for the development of ideal numbers (by [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]]) seems to have come from the study of higher reciprocity laws,{{sfn|Edwards|2000|p=79}} that is, generalisations of [[quadratic reciprocity]].\n\nNumber fields are often studied as extensions of smaller number fields: a field ''L'' is said to be an ''extension'' of a field ''K'' if ''L'' contains ''K''.\n(For example, the complex numbers ''C'' are an extension of the reals ''R'', and the reals ''R'' are an extension of the rationals ''Q''.)\nClassifying the possible extensions of a given number field is a difficult and partially open problem. Abelian extensions\u2014that is, extensions ''L'' of ''K'' such that the [[Galois group]]<ref group=\"note\">The Galois group of an extension ''K/L'' consists of the operations ([[isomorphisms]]) that send elements of L to other elements of L while leaving all elements of K fixed.\nThus, for instance, ''Gal(C/R)'' consists of two elements: the identity element\n(taking every element ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iy'' of ''C'' to itself) and complex conjugation\n(the map taking each element ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iy'' to ''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''iy'').\nThe Galois group of an extension tells us many of its crucial properties. The study of Galois groups started with [[\u00c9variste Galois]]; in modern language, the main outcome of his work is that an equation ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 can be solved by radicals\n(that is, ''x'' can be expressed in terms of the four basic operations together\nwith square roots, cubic roots, etc.) if and only if the extension of the rationals by the roots of the equation ''f''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 has a Galois group that is [[solvable group|solvable]]\nin the sense of group theory. (\"Solvable\", in the sense of group theory, is a simple property that can be checked easily for finite groups.)</ref> Gal(''L''/''K'') of ''L'' over ''K'' is an [[abelian group]]\u2014are relatively well understood.\nTheir classification was the object of the programme of [[class field theory]], which was initiated in the late 19th century (partly by [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] and [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]) and carried out largely in 1900\u20131950.\n\nAn example of an active area of research in algebraic number theory is [[Iwasawa theory]]. The [[Langlands program]], one of the main current large-scale research plans in mathematics, is sometimes described as an attempt to generalise class field theory to non-abelian extensions of number fields.\n\n===Diophantine geometry===\n{{main|Diophantine geometry}}\n\nThe central problem of ''Diophantine geometry'' is to determine when a [[Diophantine equation]] has solutions, and if it does, how many. The approach taken is to think of the solutions of an equation as a geometric object.\n\nFor example, an equation in two variables defines a curve in the plane. More generally, an equation, or system of equations, in two or more variables defines a [[algebraic curve|curve]], a [[algebraic surface|surface]] or some other such object in ''n''-dimensional space. In Diophantine geometry, one asks whether there are any ''[[rational points]]'' (points all of whose coordinates are rationals) or\n''integral points'' (points all of whose coordinates are integers) on the curve or surface. If there are any such points, the next step is to ask how many there are and how they are distributed. A basic question in this direction is if there are finitely\nor infinitely many rational points on a given curve (or surface).\n\nIn the [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean equation]] <math>x^2+y^2 = 1,</math>\nwe would like to study its rational solutions, that is, its solutions\n<math>(x,y)</math> such that\n''x'' and ''y'' are both rational. This is the same as asking for all integer solutions\nto <math>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</math>; any solution to the latter equation gives\nus a solution <math>x = a/c</math>, <math>y = b/c</math> to the former. It is also the\nsame as asking for all points with rational coordinates on the curve\ndescribed by <math>x^2 + y^2 = 1</math>. (This curve happens to be a circle of radius 1 around the origin.)\n\n[[Image:ECClines-3.svg|right|thumb|300px|Two examples of an [[elliptic curve]], that is, a curve\nof genus 1 having at least one rational point. (Either graph can be seen as a slice of a [[torus]] in four-dimensional space.)]]\n\nThe rephrasing of questions on equations in terms of points on curves turns out to be felicitous. The finiteness or not of the number of rational or integer points on an algebraic curve\u2014that is, rational or integer solutions to an equation <math>f(x,y)=0</math>, where <math>f</math> is a polynomial in two variables\u2014turns out to depend crucially on the ''genus'' of the curve. The ''genus'' can be defined as follows:<ref group=\"note\">If we want to study the curve <math>y^2 = x^3 + 7</math>. We allow ''x'' and ''y'' to be complex numbers: <math>(a + b i)^2 = (c + d i)^3 + 7</math>. This is, in effect, a set of two equations on four variables, since both the real\nand the imaginary part on each side must match. As a result, we get a surface (two-dimensional) in four-dimensional space. After we choose a convenient hyperplane on which to project the surface (meaning that, say, we choose to ignore the coordinate ''a''), we can\nplot the resulting projection, which is a surface in ordinary three-dimensional space. It\nthen becomes clear that the result is a [[torus]], loosely speaking, the surface of a doughnut (somewhat\nstretched). A doughnut has one hole; hence the genus is 1.</ref> allow the variables in <math>f(x,y)=0</math> to be complex numbers; then <math>f(x,y)=0</math> defines a 2-dimensional surface in (projective) 4-dimensional space (since two complex variables can be decomposed into four real variables, that is, four dimensions). If we count the number of (doughnut) holes in the surface; we call this number the ''genus'' of <math>f(x,y)=0</math>. Other geometrical notions turn out to be just as crucial.\n\nThere is also the closely linked area of [[Diophantine approximations]]: given a number <math>x</math>, then finding how well can it be approximated by rationals. (We are looking for approximations that are good relative to the amount of space that it takes to write the rational: call <math>a/q</math> (with <math>\\gcd(a,q)=1</math>) a good approximation to <math>x</math> if <math>|x-a/q|<\\frac{1}{q^c}</math>, where <math>c</math> is large.) This question is of special interest if <math>x</math> is an algebraic number. If <math>x</math> cannot be well approximated, then some equations do not have integer or rational solutions. Moreover, several concepts (especially that of [[Glossary of arithmetic and diophantine geometry#H|height]]) turn out to be critical both in Diophantine geometry and in the study of Diophantine approximations. This question is also of special interest in [[transcendental number theory]]: if a number can be better approximated than any algebraic number, then it is a [[transcendental number]]. It is by this argument that [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] have been shown to be transcendental.\n\nDiophantine geometry should not be confused with the [[geometry of numbers]], which is a collection of graphical methods for answering certain questions in algebraic number theory. ''Arithmetic geometry'', however, is a contemporary term\nfor much the same domain as that covered by the term ''Diophantine geometry''. The term ''arithmetic geometry'' is arguably used\nmost often when one wishes to emphasise the connections to modern algebraic geometry (as in, for instance, [[Faltings's theorem]]) rather than to techniques in Diophantine approximations.\n\n==Other subfields==\nThe areas below date from no earlier than the mid-twentieth century, even if they are based on older material. For example, as is explained below, the matter of algorithms in number theory is very old, in some sense older than the concept of proof; at the same time, the modern study of [[computability]] dates only from the 1930s and 1940s, and [[computational complexity theory]] from the 1970s.\n\n===Probabilistic number theory===\n{{main|Probabilistic number theory}}\n\nMuch of probabilistic number theory can be seen as an important special case of the study of variables that are almost, but not quite, mutually [[statistical independence|independent]]. For example, the event that a random integer between one and a million be divisible by two and the event that it be divisible by three are almost independent, but not quite.\n\nIt is sometimes said that [[probabilistic combinatorics]] uses the fact that whatever happens with probability greater than <math>0</math> must happen sometimes; one may say with equal justice that many applications of probabilistic number theory hinge on the fact that whatever is unusual must be rare. If certain algebraic objects (say, rational or integer solutions to certain equations) can be shown to be in the tail of certain sensibly defined distributions, it follows that there must be few of them; this is a very concrete non-probabilistic statement following from a probabilistic one.\n\nAt times, a non-rigorous, probabilistic approach leads to a number of [[heuristic]] algorithms and open problems, notably [[Cram\u00e9r's conjecture]].\n\n===Arithmetic combinatorics===\n{{main|Arithmetic combinatorics|Additive number theory}}\n\nIf we begin from a fairly \"thick\" infinite set <math>A</math>, does it contain many elements in arithmetic progression: <math>a</math>,\n<math>a+b, a+2 b, a+3 b, \\ldots, a+10b</math>, say? Should it be possible to write large integers as sums of elements of <math>A</math>?\n\nThese questions are characteristic of ''arithmetic combinatorics''. This is a presently coalescing field; it subsumes ''[[additive number theory]]'' (which concerns itself with certain very specific sets <math>A</math> of arithmetic significance, such as the primes or the squares) and, arguably, some of the ''[[geometry of numbers]]'',\ntogether with some rapidly developing new material. Its focus on issues of growth and distribution accounts in part for its developing links with [[ergodic theory]], [[finite group theory]], [[model theory]], and other fields. The term ''additive combinatorics'' is also used; however, the sets <math>A</math> being studied need not be sets of integers, but rather subsets of non-commutative [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], for which the multiplication symbol, not the addition symbol, is traditionally used; they can also be subsets of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], in which case the growth of <math>A+A</math> and <math>A</math>\u00b7<math>A</math> may be\ncompared.\n\n===Computational number theory===\n{{main|Computational number theory}}[[Image:Lehmer sieve.jpg|thumb|A [[Lehmer sieve]], which is a primitive [[digital computer]] once used for finding [[Prime number|primes]] and solving simple [[Diophantine equations]].]]While the word ''algorithm'' goes back only to certain readers of [[al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]], careful descriptions of methods of solution are older than proofs: such methods (that is, algorithms) are as old as any recognisable mathematics\u2014ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Vedic, Chinese\u2014whereas proofs appeared only with the Greeks of the classical period.\nAn interesting early case is that of what we now call the [[Euclidean algorithm]]. In its basic form (namely, as an algorithm for computing the [[greatest common divisor]]) it appears as Proposition 2 of Book VII in ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', together with a proof of correctness. However, in the form that is often used in number theory (namely, as an algorithm for finding integer solutions to an equation <math>a x + b y = c</math>,\nor, what is the same, for finding the quantities whose existence is assured by the [[Chinese remainder theorem]]) it first appears in the works of [[Aryabhata#Indeterminate equations|\u0100ryabha\u1e6da]] (5th\u20136th century CE) as an algorithm called\n''ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka'' (\"pulveriser\"), without a proof of correctness.\n\nThere are two main questions: \"can we compute this?\" and \"can we compute it rapidly?\". Anyone can test whether a number is prime or, if it is not, split it into prime factors; doing so rapidly is another matter. We now know fast algorithms for [[primality test|testing primality]], but, in spite of much work (both theoretical and practical), no truly fast algorithm for factoring.\n\nThe difficulty of a computation can be useful: modern protocols for [[cryptography|encrypting messages]] (for example, [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]) depend on functions that are known to all, but whose inverses are known only to a chosen few, and would take one too long a time to figure out on one's own. For example, these functions can be such that their inverses can be computed only if certain large integers are factorized. While many difficult computational problems outside number theory are known, most working encryption protocols nowadays are based on the difficulty of a few number-theoretical problems.\n\nSome things may not be computable at all; in fact, this can be proven in some instances. For instance, in 1970, it was proven, as a solution to [[Hilbert's 10th problem]], that there is no [[Turing machine]] which can solve all Diophantine equations.<ref>{{cite book | editor=Felix E.

(We would necessarily be speaking of Diophantine equations for which there are no integer solutions, since, given a Diophantine equation with at least one solution, the solution itself provides a proof of the fact that a solution exists. We cannot prove that a particular Diophantine equation is of this kind, since this would imply that it has no solutions.)\n\n==Applications==\n{{Expand section|1=<nowiki />\n* Modern applications of Number theory|date=March 2016}}\nThe number-theorist [[Leonard Dickson]] (1874\u20131954) said \"Thank God that number theory is unsullied by any application\".

Komodo islands is also a part of the [[Coral Triangle]], which contains some of the richest marine biodiversity on Earth.\n\n==History==\nKomodo National Park was established in 1980.  It was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] and a Man and Biosphere Reserve by [[UNESCO]] in 1991.  The park was initially established to conserve the unique [[Komodo dragon]] (''Varanus komodoensis''), first discovered by the scientific world in 1912 by Lieutenant [[J. K. H. van Steyn van Henbroek]], the Civil Administrator in Reo, [[Flores]] Island.  Since then conservation goals have expanded to protecting the entire biodiversity of the region, both marine and terrestrial.\n\nThe majority of the people in and around the park are fishermen originally from [[Bima]] (Sumbawa), Manggarai, South Flores, and [[South Sulawesi]].  Those from South Sulawesi are from the Suku Bajau or Bugis ethnic groups.  The Suku Bajau were originally nomadic and moved from location to location in the region of [[Sulawesi]], [[Nusa Tenggara]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], to make their livelihoods. Descendants of the original people of Komodo, the Ata Modo, still live in Komodo, but there are no pure blood people left and their culture and language is slowly being integrated with the recent migrants.\n\nLittle is known of the early history of the Komodo islanders. They were subjects of  the Sultanate of Bima, although the island\u2019s remoteness from Bima meant its affairs were probably little troubled by the Sultanate other than by occasional demands for tribute.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Komodo Islands.jpg|thumb|The rugged terrain of Komodo Island with few trees makes it one of the driest locations in Indonesia.]]\n[[File:Rinca Island.jpg|thumbnail|[[Rinca|Rinca Island]]]]\n[[File:Adelaar off Padar Island (1998).jpg|thumb|[[Padar Island]]]]\nThe park comprises a coastal section of western [[Flores]], the three larger islands of [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]], [[Padar (island)|Padar]] and [[Rinca]], 26 smaller islands and the surrounding waters of the Sape Straights. The islands of the national park are of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin.

The number of terrestrial animal species found in the park is not high, but the area is important from a conservation perspective as some species are endemic. Many of the mammals are Asiatic in origin Including the Timor deer, wild boar, water buffalo, crab eating macaques and civet. Several of the reptiles and birds are Australian in origin. These include the [[orange-footed scrubfowl]], the [[Yellow-crested cockatoo|lesser sulpher crested cockatoo]], and the [[helmeted friarbird]].\n\nThe most famous of Komodo National Park's reptiles is the [[Komodo dragon]] (''Varanus komodoensis''). It is the world's largest lizard and is among the world's largest reptiles and can reach 3m or more in length and weigh over 70&nbsp;kg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.diveglobal.com/marine_life/komodo-dragon/|title=Komodo Dragon \u00ab Scuba Diving Reviews}}</ref>\n\nTwelve terrestrial snake species are found on the island in addition to marine species. Snakes include the [[Javan spitting cobra]] (''Naja sputatrix''), [[Russell\u2019s viper]] (''Daboia russelii''), [[Trimeresurus albolabris|white-lipped pit viper]] (''Trimeresurus albolabris''), [[Laticauda laticaudata|blue lipped sea krait]] (''Laticauda laticaudata''), and [[Python timoriensis|Timor python]] (''Python timoriensis''). Lizards include nine skink species (Scinidae), geckos (Gekkonidae), limbless lizards (Dibamidae), and the monitor lizards such as the Komodo dragon (Varanidae). Frogs include the [[Kaloula baleata|Asian bullfrog]] (''Kaloula baleata''), the endemic [[Oreophryne jeffersoniana|Komodo cross frog]] (''Oreophryne jeffersoniana'') and ''Oreophryne darewskyi''. Frogs are typically found at higher, moister altitudes. The [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porosus'') was once present within the park in coastal areas including mangrove swamps but is now extinct within the area.\n\nMammals found within the park include the [[Javan rusa|Timor rusa deer]] (''Cervus timorensis''), the main prey of the Komodo dragon, horses (''Equus'' sp.), [[water buffalo]] (''Bubalus bubalis''), [[banded pig|wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa vittatus''), [[crab-eating macaque]] (''Macaca fascicularis''), [[Asian palm civet]] (''Paradoxurus hermaphroditus lehmanni''), the endemic [[Komodo rat|Rinca rat]] (''Rattus rintjanus''), and fruit bats. Domestic mammals on within the park include goats, cats and dogs which are feral.\n\nOne of the main bird species is the [[orange-footed scrubfowl]] (''Megapodius reinwardti''), a ground dwelling bird. In areas of savanna, 27 species were observed. The [[zebra dove]] (''Geopelia striata'') and [[spotted dove]] (''Spilopelia chinensis'') were the most common species. In mixed tropical deciduous habitat, 28 bird species were observed, and [[helmeted friarbird]] (''Philemon buceroides''), [[green imperial pigeon]] (''Ducula aenea''), and [[lemon-bellied white-eye]] (''Zosterops chloris'') were the most common. Other birds include vibrantly coloured species such as [[green junglefowl]] (''Gallus varius''), [[great-billed parrot]] (''Tanygnathus megalorynchos''), and the critically endangered [[Yellow-crested cockatoo|lesser sulpher crested cockatoo]] (''Cacatua sulphurea''). Two eagle species are found in the park, the [[white-bellied sea eagle]] and the extremely rare [[Flores hawk-eagle]] which is present on Rinca and Flores and reported but unconfirmed on Komodo Island.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Komodo Dragon Eating Rinca.jpg|Komodo dragon feeding on a carcass\nFile:Water buffalo at Rinca.jpg|Water buffalo\nFile:Crab-eating macaque at Rinca.JPG|Crab-eating macaque\nFile:Komodo dragon stalking deer.png|Komodo dragon stalking deer.

Komodo Island was declared a nature reserve in 1965, and in January 1977 as a [[biosphere reserve]] under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme.<ref name=\"Unesco609\"/> The three islands were declared a national park in 1980, which was later extended to include the surrounding marine area and a section of Flores in 1984.<ref name=\"UNESCO-ABE\"/> In 1991 the national park was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].\n\nFor a period after 1995 the national park authority was supported by [[The Nature Conservancy]] (TNC), an American environmental organization.<ref name=\"tcn2\">{{cite web|title=Indonesia: The Nature Conservancy\u2019s plans in Komodo National Park|url=https://wrm.org.uy/articles-from-the-wrm-bulletin/section1/indonesia-the-nature-conservancys-plans-in-komodo-national-park/|date=March 11, 2004|accessdate=April 3, 2019|work=[[World Rainforest Movement|WRM]]}}</ref> A management plan was co-authored with TNC and implemented in 2000 to address problem of increasing [[resource exploitation]], both marine and terrestrial.  The plan was supported by the World Bank but faced objections from some local people and local NGOs who argued that they had not been consulted by the plan and would not share in the benefits.<ref name=\"tcn2\" /> Most pressure on [[marine resources]] originates from fishing communities and commercial enterprises from outside the park. However, regulations and restrictions on resource use impact mostly on park residents, who have few options to make a living but rely on what the park has to offer. The provision of alternative livelihoods is part of the overall management strategy, but communities within the park are yet to benefit from appropriate measures addressing their needs.<ref>WALHI 2004</ref>\n\nA non-profit joint venture company, ''PT Putri Naga Komodo'' (PT PNK), was established to operate tourist facilities in the hope of eventually making the park financially self-sustaining.<ref name=\"tcn2\" /> PT PNK was partially funded by the TNC and the World Bank. After 5 years operation, in 2010 Putri Naga Komodo's (PNK) permit was compromised.  After that, more illegal fishermen arrived as enforcement declined greatly following the exit of TNC which had helped fight destructive fishing practices. In early 2012, dive operators and conservationists found many desolate coral sites, reminiscent of grey moonscapes. Illegal fishermen continue to blast sites with 'bombs' in a process known as [[blast fishing]]. The fisherman use a mixture of fertilizer and kerosene in beer bottles as explosives, or use squeeze bottles to squirt cyanide into the coral in order to stun and capture fish. In the past two years more than 60 illegal fishermen have been arrested. One of the suspects was shot and killed after he tried to evade capture by throwing fish bombs at the rangers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/20/fishermen-blast-premier-dive-sites-indonesia.html |title=Fishermen blast premier dive sites off Indonesia |date=April 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421231136/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/20/fishermen-blast-premier-dive-sites-indonesia.html |archivedate=21 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Human habitation==\nThere are presently almost 4,000 people living within the park spread out over four settlements (Komodo, Rinca, Kerora, and Papagaran). All villages existed before 1980 when the area was declared a [[national park]].  In 1928 there were only 30 people living in [[Komodo (village)|Komodo Village]] (known locally as ''Kampung Komodo''), and approximately 250 people on [[Rinca|Rinca Island]] in 1930. The population increased rapidly, and by 1999, there were 281 families numbering 1,169 people on Komodo Island.  Komodo Village has had the highest population within the park, mostly due to migration by people from Sape, Manggarai, [[Madura]], and South Sulawesi. The number of buildings in Komodo Village has increased rapidly from 30 houses in 1958, to 194 houses in 1994, and 270 houses in 2000. Papagaran Village is similar in size, with 258 families totaling 1,078 people. At the 2010 Census, Komodo Village had 1,508 inhabitants and Papagaran Village had 1,262 inhabitants. As of 1999, Rinca\u2019s population was 835, and Kerora's population was 185 people. The total population currently living in the park is 3,267 people with 16,816 people live in the area immediately surrounding the park.\n\n===Education===\nThe average level of education in the villages of Komodo National Park is grade four of elementary school. There is an elementary school located in each of the villages but new students are not admitted each year. On average, each village has four classes and four teachers. Most of the children from the small islands in the Kecamatan Komodo (Komodo, Rinca, Kerora, Papagaran, Mesa) do not finish elementary school. Less than 10% of those who do graduate from elementary school continue to high school since the major economic opportunity (fishing) does not require further education.  Children must be sent to [[Labuan Bajo]] to attend high school, but this is rarely done in fishermen's families.\n\n===Health===\nMost of the villages located in and around the park have few fresh water facilities available, if any, particularly during the dry season. Water quality declines during this time period and many people become ill. Malaria and diarrhea are rampant in the area. On Mesa island, with a population of around 1,500 people, there is no fresh water available. Fresh water is brought by boat in jerrycans from Labuan Bajo. Each family needs an average of Rp 100,000.- per month to buy fresh water (2000). Almost every village has a local medical facility with staff, and at least a paramedic. The quality of medical care facilities is low.\n\n===Socio-cultural and anthropologic conditions===\nTraditional Customs: Traditional communities in Komodo, Flores and Sumbawa have been subjected to outside influences and the influence of traditional customs is dwindling. Television, radio, and increased mobility have all played a part in accelerating the rate of change. There has been a steady influx of migrants into the area. At the moment nearly all villages consist of more than one ethnic group.\n\n===Religion===\nThe majority of fishermen living in the villages in the vicinity of the park are Muslims.  Hajis have a strong influence in the dynamics of community development.  Fishermen hailing from South Sulawesi (Bajau, Bugis) and Bima are mostly Muslims.  The community from Manggarai are mostly Christians.\n\n===Anthropology and language===\nThere are several cultural sites within the park, particularly on Komodo Island. These sites are not well documented, however, and there are many questions concerning the history of human inhabitance on the island. Outside the park, in Warloka village on Flores, there is a Chinese trading post remnant of some interest. Archeological finds from this site have been looted in the recent past. Most communities in and around the park can speak [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. [[Bajaw language|Bajo language]] is the language used for daily communication in most communities.\n\n===Conflicts between conservationists and local community===\nControversy surrounds the death of several fishermen since the 1980s. The circumstances of the fishermen\u2019s deaths are contested. While park patrols (including, at the time, police and navy personnel) claim they acted in self-defense, fishing communities accuse park management of having deliberately killed the fishermen.<ref>Down to Earth 2003</ref>\n\nIn late February 2014, Brimob Special Police shot dead two poachers, when they opened fire with their homemade firearms. The poachers attempted to hunt deer in the park which fall prey to Komodo dragons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/03/01/poachers-shot-dead-komodo-park.html |title=Poachers shot dead in Komodo park |author=Markus Markur |date=March 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Kanawa Island.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kanawa Island, a touristic island in the Komodo National Park.]]\n[[Scuba diving]] is popular because of the park's high marine [[biodiversity]].<ref>Novia D. Rulistia, 'Under the seas in Komodo,' ''The Jakarta Post'', 26 June 2013.</ref>\nThe development of, largely marine-based, [[ecotourism]] is the main strategy to make the park self-financing and generate sufficient revenue through entrance fees and tourism licenses to cover operational and managerial costs. To this end, a [[joint venture]] between TNC and a tourism operator were granted a tourism concession, that also entails extensive [[park management]] rights.<ref>PKA & TNC 2000:78</ref> This concession has generated an ongoing controversy. The joint venture has been accused of making decisions behind closed doors, and many people in and around Komodo claim that they haven't been consulted regarding decisions that ultimately affect their lives.<ref>WALHI 2003, Dhume, 2000, Jurassic Showdown\u2019, Far Eastern Economic Review, March 16th, pp.50\u201352</ref>\n\nKomodo Island and Rinca were once part of Flores and they are separated from the large Island of Sumbawa to the West by the Sape Strait. The ocean in the Strait drops hundreds of meters. The Pacific Ocean to the north and the Indian Ocean to the south are actually at different heights \u2013 so the flow of currents from the Pacific to the Indian during tidal exchanges makes the currents among the strongest in the world. In the (relatively) shallow waters along the east coast of Komodo towards Labaun Bajo, these currents can be extremely dangerous with inexperienced guides.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.komodo.travel/komodo-diving/komodo-dive-centers/\n| title = Komodo Dive Centers\n| website = Komodo Travel\n| language = en-US\n| access-date = 2016-02-27\n}}</ref>\n\nThe number of visitors to the park increased from 36,000 in 2009 to 45,000 in 2010. Most of the visitors were foreign tourists as the high transport cost to this remote location is less affordable for local visitors. The park can accommodate up to 60,000 visitors a year according to the local tourism agency.<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/24/komodo-park-attendance-9000-2010.html The Jakarta Post: ''Komodo Park attendance up by 9,000 in 2010''], 24 July 2011</ref>\n\nSeveral types of boat tours run through the national park including upscale scuba liveaboards, short daily snorkel trips and 4 day, 3 night 'tourist boats' between Lombok and Flores.  The tourist boats run very frequently, but have uncertain safety records. In an August 2014 incident one of these tourist boats sank, and 2 tourists were lost.  Strong currents and waves separated the stranded passengers and crew who were floating at sea in lifevests.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/08/tourists-missing-after-indonesia-boat-sinks-2014817213523630689.html Al Jazeera: \"Tourists Missing after Indonesia Boat Sinks\"], 18 August 2014</ref>\n\n'''Closure of the park'''\n\nIn early 2019, the Nusa Tenggara Timor (NTT) provincial governor [[Viktor Laiskodat]] announced a plan to close a section of the park (a main section on Komodo Island) for a year in order to make improvements.<ref>'[https://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2019/01/21/komodo-national-park-to-be-closed-one-year-for-habitat-restoration.html Komodo National Part to be close for one year for habitat restoration'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 21 January 2019.</ref>  The suggestion was that other parts of the park, including Rinca and Padar Islands and certain parts of Komodo Island, would remain open. The governor's plan met with opposition from the local community and some parts of the wider public.

Komodo islands is also a part of the [[Coral Triangle]], which contains some of the richest marine biodiversity on Earth.\n\n==History==\nKomodo National Park was established in 1980.  It was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] and a Man and Biosphere Reserve by [[UNESCO]] in 1991.  The park was initially established to conserve the unique [[Komodo dragon]] (''Varanus komodoensis''), first discovered by the scientific world in 1912 by Lieutenant [[J. K. H. van Steyn van Henbroek]], the Civil Administrator in Reo, [[Flores]] Island.  Since then conservation goals have expanded to protecting the entire biodiversity of the region, both marine and terrestrial.\n\nThe majority of the people in and around the park are fishermen originally from [[Bima]] (Sumbawa), Manggarai, South Flores, and [[South Sulawesi]].  Those from South Sulawesi are from the Suku Bajau or Bugis ethnic groups.  The Suku Bajau were originally nomadic and moved from location to location in the region of [[Sulawesi]], [[Nusa Tenggara]] and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], to make their livelihoods. Descendants of the original people of Komodo, the Ata Modo, still live in Komodo, but there are no pure blood people left and their culture and language is slowly being integrated with the recent migrants.\n\nLittle is known of the early history of the Komodo islanders. They were subjects of  the Sultanate of Bima, although the island\u2019s remoteness from Bima meant its affairs were probably little troubled by the Sultanate other than by occasional demands for tribute.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Komodo Islands.jpg|thumb|The rugged terrain of Komodo Island with few trees makes it one of the driest locations in Indonesia.]]\n[[File:Rinca Island.jpg|thumbnail|[[Rinca|Rinca Island]]]]\n[[File:Adelaar off Padar Island (1998).jpg|thumb|[[Padar Island]]]]\nThe park comprises a coastal section of western [[Flores]], the three larger islands of [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]], [[Padar (island)|Padar]] and [[Rinca]], 26 smaller islands and the surrounding waters of the Sape Straights. The islands of the national park are of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin.

The number of terrestrial animal species found in the park is not high, but the area is important from a conservation perspective as some species are endemic. Many of the mammals are Asiatic in origin Including the Timor deer, wild boar, water buffalo, crab eating macaques and civet. Several of the reptiles and birds are Australian in origin. These include the [[orange-footed scrubfowl]], the [[Yellow-crested cockatoo|lesser sulpher crested cockatoo]], and the [[helmeted friarbird]].\n\nThe most famous of Komodo National Park's reptiles is the [[Komodo dragon]] (''Varanus komodoensis''). It is the world's largest lizard and is among the world's largest reptiles and can reach 3m or more in length and weigh over 70&nbsp;kg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.diveglobal.com/marine_life/komodo-dragon/|title=Komodo Dragon \u00ab Scuba Diving Reviews}}</ref>\n\nTwelve terrestrial snake species are found on the island in addition to marine species. Snakes include the [[Javan spitting cobra]] (''Naja sputatrix''), [[Russell\u2019s viper]] (''Daboia russelii''), [[Trimeresurus albolabris|white-lipped pit viper]] (''Trimeresurus albolabris''), [[Laticauda laticaudata|blue lipped sea krait]] (''Laticauda laticaudata''), and [[Python timoriensis|Timor python]] (''Python timoriensis''). Lizards include nine skink species (Scinidae), geckos (Gekkonidae), limbless lizards (Dibamidae), and the monitor lizards such as the Komodo dragon (Varanidae). Frogs include the [[Kaloula baleata|Asian bullfrog]] (''Kaloula baleata''), the endemic [[Oreophryne jeffersoniana|Komodo cross frog]] (''Oreophryne jeffersoniana'') and ''Oreophryne darewskyi''. Frogs are typically found at higher, moister altitudes. The [[saltwater crocodile]] (''Crocodylus porosus'') was once present within the park in coastal areas including mangrove swamps but is now extinct within the area.\n\nMammals found within the park include the [[Javan rusa|Timor rusa deer]] (''Cervus timorensis''), the main prey of the Komodo dragon, horses (''Equus'' sp.), [[water buffalo]] (''Bubalus bubalis''), [[banded pig|wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa vittatus''), [[crab-eating macaque]] (''Macaca fascicularis''), [[Asian palm civet]] (''Paradoxurus hermaphroditus lehmanni''), the endemic [[Komodo rat|Rinca rat]] (''Rattus rintjanus''), and fruit bats. Domestic mammals on within the park include goats, cats and dogs which are feral.\n\nOne of the main bird species is the [[orange-footed scrubfowl]] (''Megapodius reinwardti''), a ground dwelling bird. In areas of savanna, 27 species were observed. The [[zebra dove]] (''Geopelia striata'') and [[spotted dove]] (''Spilopelia chinensis'') were the most common species. In mixed tropical deciduous habitat, 28 bird species were observed, and [[helmeted friarbird]] (''Philemon buceroides''), [[green imperial pigeon]] (''Ducula aenea''), and [[lemon-bellied white-eye]] (''Zosterops chloris'') were the most common. Other birds include vibrantly coloured species such as [[green junglefowl]] (''Gallus varius''), [[great-billed parrot]] (''Tanygnathus megalorynchos''), and the critically endangered [[Yellow-crested cockatoo|lesser sulpher crested cockatoo]] (''Cacatua sulphurea''). Two eagle species are found in the park, the [[white-bellied sea eagle]] and the extremely rare [[Flores hawk-eagle]] which is present on Rinca and Flores and reported but unconfirmed on Komodo Island.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Komodo Dragon Eating Rinca.jpg|Komodo dragon feeding on a carcass\nFile:Water buffalo at Rinca.jpg|Water buffalo\nFile:Crab-eating macaque at Rinca.JPG|Crab-eating macaque\nFile:Komodo dragon stalking deer.png|Komodo dragon stalking deer.

Komodo Island was declared a nature reserve in 1965, and in January 1977 as a [[biosphere reserve]] under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme.<ref name=\"Unesco609\"/> The three islands were declared a national park in 1980, which was later extended to include the surrounding marine area and a section of Flores in 1984.<ref name=\"UNESCO-ABE\"/> In 1991 the national park was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].\n\nFor a period after 1995 the national park authority was supported by [[The Nature Conservancy]] (TNC), an American environmental organization.<ref name=\"tcn2\">{{cite web|title=Indonesia: The Nature Conservancy\u2019s plans in Komodo National Park|url=https://wrm.org.uy/articles-from-the-wrm-bulletin/section1/indonesia-the-nature-conservancys-plans-in-komodo-national-park/|date=March 11, 2004|accessdate=April 3, 2019|work=[[World Rainforest Movement|WRM]]}}</ref> A management plan was co-authored with TNC and implemented in 2000 to address problem of increasing [[resource exploitation]], both marine and terrestrial.  The plan was supported by the World Bank but faced objections from some local people and local NGOs who argued that they had not been consulted by the plan and would not share in the benefits.<ref name=\"tcn2\" /> Most pressure on [[marine resources]] originates from fishing communities and commercial enterprises from outside the park. However, regulations and restrictions on resource use impact mostly on park residents, who have few options to make a living but rely on what the park has to offer. The provision of alternative livelihoods is part of the overall management strategy, but communities within the park are yet to benefit from appropriate measures addressing their needs.<ref>WALHI 2004</ref>\n\nA non-profit joint venture company, ''PT Putri Naga Komodo'' (PT PNK), was established to operate tourist facilities in the hope of eventually making the park financially self-sustaining.<ref name=\"tcn2\" /> PT PNK was partially funded by the TNC and the World Bank. After 5 years operation, in 2010 Putri Naga Komodo's (PNK) permit was compromised.  After that, more illegal fishermen arrived as enforcement declined greatly following the exit of TNC which had helped fight destructive fishing practices. In early 2012, dive operators and conservationists found many desolate coral sites, reminiscent of grey moonscapes. Illegal fishermen continue to blast sites with 'bombs' in a process known as [[blast fishing]]. The fisherman use a mixture of fertilizer and kerosene in beer bottles as explosives, or use squeeze bottles to squirt cyanide into the coral in order to stun and capture fish. In the past two years more than 60 illegal fishermen have been arrested. One of the suspects was shot and killed after he tried to evade capture by throwing fish bombs at the rangers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/20/fishermen-blast-premier-dive-sites-indonesia.html |title=Fishermen blast premier dive sites off Indonesia |date=April 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421231136/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/20/fishermen-blast-premier-dive-sites-indonesia.html |archivedate=21 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Human habitation==\nThere are presently almost 4,000 people living within the park spread out over four settlements (Komodo, Rinca, Kerora, and Papagaran). All villages existed before 1980 when the area was declared a [[national park]].  In 1928 there were only 30 people living in [[Komodo (village)|Komodo Village]] (known locally as ''Kampung Komodo''), and approximately 250 people on [[Rinca|Rinca Island]] in 1930. The population increased rapidly, and by 1999, there were 281 families numbering 1,169 people on Komodo Island.  Komodo Village has had the highest population within the park, mostly due to migration by people from Sape, Manggarai, [[Madura]], and South Sulawesi. The number of buildings in Komodo Village has increased rapidly from 30 houses in 1958, to 194 houses in 1994, and 270 houses in 2000. Papagaran Village is similar in size, with 258 families totaling 1,078 people. At the 2010 Census, Komodo Village had 1,508 inhabitants and Papagaran Village had 1,262 inhabitants. As of 1999, Rinca\u2019s population was 835, and Kerora's population was 185 people. The total population currently living in the park is 3,267 people with 16,816 people live in the area immediately surrounding the park.\n\n===Education===\nThe average level of education in the villages of Komodo National Park is grade four of elementary school. There is an elementary school located in each of the villages but new students are not admitted each year. On average, each village has four classes and four teachers. Most of the children from the small islands in the Kecamatan Komodo (Komodo, Rinca, Kerora, Papagaran, Mesa) do not finish elementary school. Less than 10% of those who do graduate from elementary school continue to high school since the major economic opportunity (fishing) does not require further education.  Children must be sent to [[Labuan Bajo]] to attend high school, but this is rarely done in fishermen's families.\n\n===Health===\nMost of the villages located in and around the park have few fresh water facilities available, if any, particularly during the dry season. Water quality declines during this time period and many people become ill. Malaria and diarrhea are rampant in the area. On Mesa island, with a population of around 1,500 people, there is no fresh water available. Fresh water is brought by boat in jerrycans from Labuan Bajo. Each family needs an average of Rp 100,000.- per month to buy fresh water (2000). Almost every village has a local medical facility with staff, and at least a paramedic. The quality of medical care facilities is low.\n\n===Socio-cultural and anthropologic conditions===\nTraditional Customs: Traditional communities in Komodo, Flores and Sumbawa have been subjected to outside influences and the influence of traditional customs is dwindling. Television, radio, and increased mobility have all played a part in accelerating the rate of change. There has been a steady influx of migrants into the area. At the moment nearly all villages consist of more than one ethnic group.\n\n===Religion===\nThe majority of fishermen living in the villages in the vicinity of the park are Muslims.  Hajis have a strong influence in the dynamics of community development.  Fishermen hailing from South Sulawesi (Bajau, Bugis) and Bima are mostly Muslims.  The community from Manggarai are mostly Christians.\n\n===Anthropology and language===\nThere are several cultural sites within the park, particularly on Komodo Island. These sites are not well documented, however, and there are many questions concerning the history of human inhabitance on the island. Outside the park, in Warloka village on Flores, there is a Chinese trading post remnant of some interest. Archeological finds from this site have been looted in the recent past. Most communities in and around the park can speak [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. [[Bajaw language|Bajo language]] is the language used for daily communication in most communities.\n\n===Conflicts between conservationists and local community===\nControversy surrounds the death of several fishermen since the 1980s. The circumstances of the fishermen\u2019s deaths are contested. While park patrols (including, at the time, police and navy personnel) claim they acted in self-defense, fishing communities accuse park management of having deliberately killed the fishermen.<ref>Down to Earth 2003</ref>\n\nIn late February 2014, Brimob Special Police shot dead two poachers, when they opened fire with their homemade firearms. The poachers attempted to hunt deer in the park which fall prey to Komodo dragons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/03/01/poachers-shot-dead-komodo-park.html |title=Poachers shot dead in Komodo park |author=Markus Markur |date=March 1, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Kanawa Island.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kanawa Island, a touristic island in the Komodo National Park.]]\n[[Scuba diving]] is popular because of the park's high marine [[biodiversity]].<ref>Novia D. Rulistia, 'Under the seas in Komodo,' ''The Jakarta Post'', 26 June 2013.</ref>\nThe development of, largely marine-based, [[ecotourism]] is the main strategy to make the park self-financing and generate sufficient revenue through entrance fees and tourism licenses to cover operational and managerial costs. To this end, a [[joint venture]] between TNC and a tourism operator were granted a tourism concession, that also entails extensive [[park management]] rights.<ref>PKA & TNC 2000:78</ref> This concession has generated an ongoing controversy. The joint venture has been accused of making decisions behind closed doors, and many people in and around Komodo claim that they haven\u2019t been consulted regarding decisions that ultimately affect their lives.<ref>WALHI 2003, Dhume, 2000, Jurassic Showdown\u2019, Far Eastern Economic Review, March 16th, pp.50\u201352</ref>\n\nKomodo Island and Rinca were once part of Flores and they are separated from the large Island of Sumbawa to the West by the Sape Strait. The ocean in the Strait drops hundreds of meters. The Pacific Ocean to the north and the Indian Ocean to the south are actually at different heights \u2013 so the flow of currents from the Pacific to the Indian during tidal exchanges makes the currents among the strongest in the world. In the (relatively) shallow waters along the east coast of Komodo towards Labaun Bajo, these currents can be extremely dangerous with inexperienced guides.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.komodo.travel/komodo-diving/komodo-dive-centers/\n| title = Komodo Dive Centers\n| website = Komodo Travel\n| language = en-US\n| access-date = 2016-02-27\n}}</ref>\n\nThe number of visitors to the park increased from 36,000 in 2009 to 45,000 in 2010. Most of the visitors were foreign tourists as the high transport cost to this remote location is less affordable for local visitors. The park can accommodate up to 60,000 visitors a year according to the local tourism agency.<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/07/24/komodo-park-attendance-9000-2010.html The Jakarta Post: ''Komodo Park attendance up by 9,000 in 2010''], 24 July 2011</ref>\n\nSeveral types of boat tours run through the national park including upscale scuba liveaboards, short daily snorkel trips and 4 day, 3 night 'tourist boats' between Lombok and Flores.  The tourist boats run very frequently, but have uncertain safety records. In an August 2014 incident one of these tourist boats sank, and 2 tourists were lost.  Strong currents and waves separated the stranded passengers and crew who were floating at sea in lifevests.<ref>[http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia-pacific/2014/08/tourists-missing-after-indonesia-boat-sinks-2014817213523630689.html Al Jazeera: \"Tourists Missing after Indonesia Boat Sinks\"], 18 August 2014</ref>\n\n'''Closure of the park'''\n\nIn early 2019, the Nusa Tenggara Timor (NTT) provincial governor [[Viktor Laiskodat]] announced a plan to close a section of the park (a main section on Komodo Island) for a year in order to make improvements.<ref>'[https://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2019/01/21/komodo-national-park-to-be-closed-one-year-for-habitat-restoration.html Komodo National Part to be close for one year for habitat restoration'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 21 January 2019.</ref>  The suggestion was that other parts of the park, including Rinca and Padar Islands and certain parts of Komodo Island, would remain open.

The transformation can be undertaken manually by the programmer or by an [[optimizing compiler]].\n\nThe goal of loop unwinding is to increase a program's speed by reducing or eliminating instructions that control the loop, such as [[pointer arithmetic]] and \"end of loop\" tests on each iteration;<ref>{{cite book |author1=Ullman, Jeffrey D. |author2=Aho, Alfred V. |title=Principles of compiler design |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofcomp0000ahoa |url-access=registration |publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub.

If an optimizing compiler or assembler is able to pre-calculate offsets to each ''individually referenced'' array variable, these can be built into the [[machine code]] instructions directly, therefore requiring no additional arithmetic operations at run time.\n\n* Significant gains can be realized if the reduction in executed instructions compensates for any performance reduction caused by any increase in the size of the program.\n* [[Branch predictor|Branch penalty]] is minimized.<ref name=\"fog2012\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_assembly.pdf|quote=12.11 Loop unrolling |pages=100|title=Optimizing subroutines in assembly language|first=Agner|last=Fog |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-09-22| publisher=Copenhagen University College of Engineering}}</ref>\n* If the statements in the loop are independent of each other (i.e. where statements that occur earlier in the loop do not affect statements that follow them), the statements can potentially be executed in [[Parallel computing|parallel]].\n* Can be implemented dynamically if the number of array elements is unknown at compile time (as in [[Duff's device]]).\n\nOptimizing compilers will sometimes perform the unrolling automatically, or upon request.\n\n==Disadvantages==\n* Increased program code size, which can be undesirable, particularly for embedded applications.  Can also cause an increase in instruction cache misses, which may adversely affect performance.\n* Unless performed transparently by an optimizing compiler, the code may become less [[Readability#Readability in computer programming|readable]].\n* If the code in the body of the loop involves function calls, it may not be possible to combine unrolling with [[inlining]], since the increase in code size might be excessive. Thus there can be a trade-off between the two optimizations.\n* Possible increased register usage in a single iteration to store temporary variables{{Dubious|date=December 2009}}, which may reduce performance, though much will depend on possible optimizations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sarkar, Vivek |title=Optimized Unrolling of Nested Loops |journal=International Journal of Parallel Programming |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=545\u2013581 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1012246031671 |url=https://doi.org/10.1023%2FA%3A1012246031671}}</ref>\n* Apart from very small and simple codes, unrolled loops that contain branches are even slower than recursions.<ref>Adam Horvath [http://blog.teamleadnet.com/2012/02/code-unwinding-performance-is-far-away.html \"Code unwinding - performance is far away\"]</ref>\n\n==Static/manual loop unrolling==\nManual (or static) loop unrolling involves the programmer analyzing the loop and interpreting the iterations into a sequence of instructions which will reduce the loop overhead.  This is in contrast to dynamic unrolling which is accomplished by the compiler.\n\n===Simple manual example in C===\nA procedure in a computer program is to delete 100 items from a collection. This is normally accomplished by means of a <code>''for''</code>-loop which calls the function ''delete(item_number)''. If this part of the program is to be optimized, and the overhead of the loop requires significant resources compared to those for the ''delete(x)'' function, unwinding can be used to speed it up.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n!Normal loop\n!After loop unrolling\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|\n<source lang=\"c\">\n int x;\n for (x = 0; x < 100; x++)\n {\n     delete(x);\n }\n</source>\n|\n<source lang=\"c\">\n int x; \n for (x = 0; x < 100; x += 5 )\n {\n     delete(x);\n     delete(x + 1);\n     delete(x + 2);\n     delete(x + 3);\n     delete(x + 4);\n }\n</source>\n|}\n\nAs a result of this modification, the new program has to make only 20 iterations, instead of 100. Afterwards, only 20% of the jumps and conditional branches need to be taken, and represents, over many iterations, a potentially significant decrease in the loop administration overhead. To produce the optimal benefit, no variables should be specified in the unrolled code that require [[pointer arithmetic]]. This usually requires \"[[Base address|base]] plus offset\" addressing, rather than indexed referencing.\n\nOn the other hand, this ''manual'' loop unrolling expands the source code size from 3 lines to 7, that have to be produced, checked, and debugged, and the compiler may have to allocate more registers to store variables in the expanded loop iteration {{Dubious|date=December 2009}}. In addition, the loop control variables and number of operations inside the unrolled loop structure have to be chosen carefully so that the result is indeed the same as in the original code (assuming this is a later optimization on already working code). For example, consider the implications if the iteration count were not divisible by 5. The manual amendments required also become somewhat more complicated if the test conditions are variables. See also [[Duff's device]].\n\n===Early complexity===\nIn the simple case, the loop control is merely an administrative overhead that arranges the productive statements. The loop itself contributes nothing to the results desired, merely saving the programmer the tedium of replicating the code a hundred times which could have been done by a pre-processor generating the replications, or a text editor. Similarly, <code>if</code>-statements and other flow control statements could be replaced by code replication, except that [[code bloat]] can be the result. Computer programs easily track the combinations, but programmers find this repetition boring and make mistakes. \nConsider:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n!Normal loop\n!After loop unrolling\n|-\n|\n for i := 1:8 do\n     if i mod 2 = 0 then do_even_stuff(i) \n                    else do_odd_stuff(i);\n     next i;\n|\n do_odd_stuff(1); do_even_stuff(2);\n do_odd_stuff(3); do_even_stuff(4);\n do_odd_stuff(5); do_even_stuff(6);\n do_odd_stuff(7); do_even_stuff(8);\n|}\n\nBut of course, the code performed need not be the invocation of a procedure, and this next example involves the index variable in computation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n!Normal loop\n!After loop unrolling\n|-\n|\n x(1) := 1;\n For i := 2:9 do\n     x(i) := x(i - 1) * i;\n     print i, x(i);\n     next i;\n|\n x(1) := 1;\n x(2) := x(1) * 2; print 2, x(2);\n x(3) := x(2) * 3; print 3, x(3);\n x(4) := x(3) * 4; print 4, x(4);\n ... etc.\n|}\n\nwhich, if compiled, might produce a lot of code (''print'' statements being notorious) but further optimization is possible. This example makes reference only to ''x(i)'' and ''x(i - 1)'' in the loop (the latter only to develop the new value ''x(i)'') therefore, given that there is no later reference to the array ''x'' developed here, its usages could be replaced by a simple variable. Such a change would however mean a simple variable ''whose value is changed'' whereas if staying with the array, the compiler's analysis might note that the array's values are constant, each derived from a previous constant, and therefore carries forward the constant values so that the code becomes \n print 2, 2;\n print 3, 6;\n print 4, 24;\n ...etc.\n\nIn general, the content of a loop might be large, involving intricate array indexing. These cases are probably best left to optimizing compilers to unroll. Replicating innermost loops might allow many possible optimisations yet yield only a small gain unless n is large.\n\n=== Unrolling WHILE loops ===\nConsider a pseudocode WHILE loop similar to the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n!Normal loop\n!After loop unrolling\n!Unrolled & \"tweaked\" loop\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|\n WHILE (condition) DO\n     action\n ENDWHILE\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n|\n WHILE (condition) DO\n     action\n     IF NOT(condition) THEN GOTO break\n     action\n     IF NOT(condition) THEN GOTO break\n     action\n ENDWHILE\n LABEL break:\n .\n|\n IF (condition) THEN\n     REPEAT\n         action\n         IF NOT(condition) THEN GOTO break\n         action\n         IF NOT(condition) THEN GOTO break\n         action\n     WHILE (condition)\n LABEL break:\n|}\nIn this case, unrolling is faster because the ENDWHILE (a jump to the start of the loop) will be executed 66% less often.\n\nEven better, the \"tweaked\" pseudocode example, that may be performed automatically by some optimizing compilers, eliminating unconditional jumps altogether.\n\n== Dynamic unrolling ==\nSince the benefits of loop unrolling are frequently dependent on the size of an array&mdash;which may often not be known until run time&mdash;[[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compilers (for example) can determine whether to invoke a \"standard\" loop sequence or instead generate a (relatively short) sequence of individual instructions for each element. This flexibility is one of the advantages of just-in-time techniques versus static or manual optimization in the context of loop unrolling. In this situation, it is often with relatively small values of ''n'' where the savings are still useful&mdash;requiring quite small (if any) overall increase in program size (that might be included just once, as part of a standard library).\n\n[[Assembly language]] programmers (including optimizing compiler writers) are also able to benefit from the technique of dynamic loop unrolling, using a method similar to that used for efficient [[branch table]]s. Here, the advantage is greatest where the maximum offset of any referenced field in a particular array is less than the maximum offset that can be specified in a machine instruction (which will be flagged by the assembler if exceeded).\n\n=== Assembler example (IBM/360 or Z/Architecture) ===\n{{Hatnote|For an x86 example, see the [[#External links|External links]] section.}}This example is for [[IBM/360]] or [[Z/Architecture]] assemblers and assumes a field of 100 bytes (at offset zero) is to be copied from array ''FROM'' to array ''TO''&mdash;both having 50 entries with element lengths of 256 bytes each.<source lang=\"text\" line=\"1\" highlight=\"39-41,44-58\">\n* The return address is in R14.\n* Initialize registers R15, R0, R1, and R2 from data defined at the end of \n* the program starting with label INIT/MAXM1.\n         LM    R15,R2,INIT                  Set R15 = maximum number of MVC\n*                                           instructions (MAXM1 = 16), \n*                                           R0 = number of entries of array,\n*                                           R1 = address of 'FROM' array, and\n*                                           R2 = address of 'TO' array.\n*\n* The loop starts here.\nLOOP     EQU   *                            Define LOOP label.\n* At this point, R15 will always contain the number 16 (MAXM1).\n         SR    R15,R0                       Subtract the remaining number of \n*                                           entries in the array (R0) from R15.\n         BNP   ALL                          If R15 is not positive, meaning we\n*                                           have more than 16 remaining entries\n*                                           in the array, jump to do the entire\n*                                           MVC sequence and then repeat.\n*\n* Calculate an offset (from start of MVC sequence) for unconditional branch to \n* the 'unwound' MVC loop below.\n* If the number of remaining entries in the arrays is zero, R15 will be 16, so \n* all the MVC instructions will be bypassed.\n         MH    R15,=AL2(ILEN)               Multiply R15 by the length of one\n*                                           MVC instruction.\n         B     ALL(R15)                     Jump to ALL+R15, the address of the\n*                                           calculated specific MVC instruction \n*                                           with drop through to the rest of them.\n*\n* MVC instruction 'table'. \n* First entry has maximum allowable offset with single register = hexadecimal F00\n* (15*256) in this example.\n* All 16 of the following MVC ('move character') instructions use base-plus-offset \n* addressing and each to/from offset decreases by the length of one array element\n* (256).

If the array had consisted of only two entries, it would still execute in approximately the same time as the original unwound loop. The increase in [[binary file|code]] size is only about 108 bytes{{snd}} even if there are thousands of entries in the array.\n\nSimilar techniques can of course be used where multiple instructions are involved, as long as the combined instruction length is adjusted accordingly. For example, in this same example, if it is required to clear the rest of each array entry to nulls immediately after the 100 byte field copied, an additional clear instruction, <code>XC&nbsp;xx*256+100(156,R1),xx*256+100(R2)</code>, can be added immediately after every MVC in the sequence (where <code>xx</code> matches the value in the MVC above it).\n\nIt is, of course, perfectly possible to generate the above code \"inline\" using a single assembler [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] statement, specifying just four or five operands (or alternatively, make it into a library subroutine, accessed by a simple call, passing a list of parameters), making the optimization readily accessible.\n\n=== C example ===\nThe following example demonstrates dynamic loop unrolling for a simple program written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Unlike the assembler example above, pointer/index arithmetic is still generated by the compiler in this example because a variable (i) is still used to address the array element. Full optimization is only possible if absolute indexes are used in the replacement statements.\n<source lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/* The number of entries processed per loop iteration.                        */\n/* Note that this number is a 'constant constant' reflecting the code below.  */\n#define BUNCHSIZE (8)\n\nint main(void)\n{ \n  int i = 0;                                    /* counter */\n  int entries = 50;                             /* total number to process    */\n  int repeat;                                   /* number of while repetitions*/\n  int left = 0;                                 /* remainder (process later)  */ \n \n  /* If the number of elements is not be divisible by BUNCHSIZE,              */ \n  /* get repeat times required to do most processing in the while loop        */\n\n  repeat = (entries / BUNCHSIZE);                /* number of times to repeat */\n  left   = (entries % BUNCHSIZE);                /* calculate remainder       */\n\n  /* Unroll the loop in 'bunches' of 8                                        */ \n  while (repeat--) \n  { \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i    );\n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 1); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 2); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 3); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 4); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 5); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 6); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 7);\n\n    /* update the index by amount processed in one go                         */ \n    i += BUNCHSIZE;\n  }\n\n  /* Use a switch statement to process remaining by jumping to the case label */ \n  /* at the label that will then drop through to complete the set             */ \n  switch (left) \n  {\n     case 7 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 6);   /* process and rely on drop \n                                                   through                    */\n     case 6 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 5); \n     case 5 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 4);  \n     case 4 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 3);  \n     case 3 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 2); \n     case 2 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 1);   /* two left                   */\n     case 1 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i);       /* just one left to process   */ \n     case 0 : ;                                 /* none left                  */\n  } \n}\n</source>\nCode duplication could be avoided by writing the two parts together as in [[Duff's device]].\n\n=== C to MIPS assembly language loop unrolling example<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/arch/loop-unrolling.xhtml|title=Loop Unrolling|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Minessota}}</ref> ===\nThe following example will compute a [[dot product]] of two 100-entry vectors A and B of type <code>double</code>.

If an optimizing compiler or assembler is able to pre-calculate offsets to each ''individually referenced'' array variable, these can be built into the [[machine code]] instructions directly, therefore requiring no additional arithmetic operations at run time.\n\n* Significant gains can be realized if the reduction in executed instructions compensates for any performance reduction caused by any increase in the size of the program.\n* [[Branch predictor|Branch penalty]] is minimized.<ref name=\"fog2012\">{{cite web|url=http://www.agner.org/optimize/optimizing_assembly.pdf|quote=12.11 Loop unrolling |pages=100|title=Optimizing subroutines in assembly language|first=Agner|last=Fog |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-09-22| publisher=Copenhagen University College of Engineering}}</ref>\n* If the statements in the loop are independent of each other (i.e. where statements that occur earlier in the loop do not affect statements that follow them), the statements can potentially be executed in [[Parallel computing|parallel]].\n* Can be implemented dynamically if the number of array elements is unknown at compile time (as in [[Duff's device]]).\n\nOptimizing compilers will sometimes perform the unrolling automatically, or upon request.\n\n==Disadvantages==\n* Increased program code size, which can be undesirable, particularly for embedded applications.  Can also cause an increase in instruction cache misses, which may adversely affect performance.\n* Unless performed transparently by an optimizing compiler, the code may become less [[Readability#Readability in computer programming|readable]].\n* If the code in the body of the loop involves function calls, it may not be possible to combine unrolling with [[inlining]], since the increase in code size might be excessive. Thus there can be a trade-off between the two optimizations.\n* Possible increased register usage in a single iteration to store temporary variables{{Dubious|date=December 2009}}, which may reduce performance, though much will depend on possible optimizations.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sarkar, Vivek |title=Optimized Unrolling of Nested Loops |journal=International Journal of Parallel Programming |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=545\u2013581 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1012246031671 |url=https://doi.org/10.1023%2FA%3A1012246031671}}</ref>\n* Apart from very small and simple codes, unrolled loops that contain branches are even slower than recursions.<ref>Adam Horvath [http://blog.teamleadnet.com/2012/02/code-unwinding-performance-is-far-away.html \"Code unwinding - performance is far away\"]</ref>\n\n==Static/manual loop unrolling==\nManual (or static) loop unrolling involves the programmer analyzing the loop and interpreting the iterations into a sequence of instructions which will reduce the loop overhead.  This is in contrast to dynamic unrolling which is accomplished by the compiler.\n\n===Simple manual example in C===\nA procedure in a computer program is to delete 100 items from a collection. This is normally accomplished by means of a <code>''for''</code>-loop which calls the function ''delete(item_number)''. If this part of the program is to be optimized, and the overhead of the loop requires significant resources compared to those for the ''delete(x)'' function, unwinding can be used to speed it up.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n!Normal loop\n!After loop unrolling\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|\n<source lang=\"c\">\n int x;\n for (x = 0; x < 100; x++)\n {\n     delete(x);\n }\n</source>\n|\n<source lang=\"c\">\n int x; \n for (x = 0; x < 100; x += 5 )\n {\n     delete(x);\n     delete(x + 1);\n     delete(x + 2);\n     delete(x + 3);\n     delete(x + 4);\n }\n</source>\n|}\n\nAs a result of this modification, the new program has to make only 20 iterations, instead of 100. Afterwards, only 20% of the jumps and conditional branches need to be taken, and represents, over many iterations, a potentially significant decrease in the loop administration overhead. To produce the optimal benefit, no variables should be specified in the unrolled code that require [[pointer arithmetic]]. This usually requires \"[[Base address|base]] plus offset\" addressing, rather than indexed referencing.\n\nOn the other hand, this ''manual'' loop unrolling expands the source code size from 3 lines to 7, that have to be produced, checked, and debugged, and the compiler may have to allocate more registers to store variables in the expanded loop iteration {{Dubious|date=December 2009}}. In addition, the loop control variables and number of operations inside the unrolled loop structure have to be chosen carefully so that the result is indeed the same as in the original code (assuming this is a later optimization on already working code). For example, consider the implications if the iteration count were not divisible by 5. The manual amendments required also become somewhat more complicated if the test conditions are variables. See also [[Duff's device]].\n\n===Early complexity===\nIn the simple case, the loop control is merely an administrative overhead that arranges the productive statements. The loop itself contributes nothing to the results desired, merely saving the programmer the tedium of replicating the code a hundred times which could have been done by a pre-processor generating the replications, or a text editor. Similarly, <code>if</code>-statements and other flow control statements could be replaced by code replication, except that [[code bloat]] can be the result. Computer programs easily track the combinations, but programmers find this repetition boring and make mistakes. \nConsider:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n!Normal loop\n!After loop unrolling\n|-\n|\n for i := 1:8 do\n     if i mod 2 = 0 then do_even_stuff(i) \n                    else do_odd_stuff(i);\n     next i;\n|\n do_odd_stuff(1); do_even_stuff(2);\n do_odd_stuff(3); do_even_stuff(4);\n do_odd_stuff(5); do_even_stuff(6);\n do_odd_stuff(7); do_even_stuff(8);\n|}\n\nBut of course, the code performed need not be the invocation of a procedure, and this next example involves the index variable in computation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n!Normal loop\n!After loop unrolling\n|-\n|\n x(1) := 1;\n For i := 2:9 do\n     x(i) := x(i - 1) * i;\n     print i, x(i);\n     next i;\n|\n x(1) := 1;\n x(2) := x(1) * 2; print 2, x(2);\n x(3) := x(2) * 3; print 3, x(3);\n x(4) := x(3) * 4; print 4, x(4);\n ... etc.\n|}\n\nwhich, if compiled, might produce a lot of code (''print'' statements being notorious) but further optimization is possible. This example makes reference only to ''x(i)'' and ''x(i - 1)'' in the loop (the latter only to develop the new value ''x(i)'') therefore, given that there is no later reference to the array ''x'' developed here, its usages could be replaced by a simple variable. Such a change would however mean a simple variable ''whose value is changed'' whereas if staying with the array, the compiler's analysis might note that the array's values are constant, each derived from a previous constant, and therefore carries forward the constant values so that the code becomes \n print 2, 2;\n print 3, 6;\n print 4, 24;\n ...etc.\n\nIn general, the content of a loop might be large, involving intricate array indexing. These cases are probably best left to optimizing compilers to unroll. Replicating innermost loops might allow many possible optimisations yet yield only a small gain unless n is large.\n\n=== Unrolling WHILE loops ===\nConsider a pseudocode WHILE loop similar to the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n!Normal loop\n!After loop unrolling\n!Unrolled & \"tweaked\" loop\n|-style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|\n WHILE (condition) DO\n     action\n ENDWHILE\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n|\n WHILE (condition) DO\n     action\n     IF NOT(condition) THEN GOTO break\n     action\n     IF NOT(condition) THEN GOTO break\n     action\n ENDWHILE\n LABEL break:\n .\n|\n IF (condition) THEN\n     REPEAT\n         action\n         IF NOT(condition) THEN GOTO break\n         action\n         IF NOT(condition) THEN GOTO break\n         action\n     WHILE (condition)\n LABEL break:\n|}\nIn this case, unrolling is faster because the ENDWHILE (a jump to the start of the loop) will be executed 66% less often.\n\nEven better, the \"tweaked\" pseudocode example, that may be performed automatically by some optimizing compilers, eliminating unconditional jumps altogether.\n\n== Dynamic unrolling ==\nSince the benefits of loop unrolling are frequently dependent on the size of an array&mdash;which may often not be known until run time&mdash;[[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compilers (for example) can determine whether to invoke a \"standard\" loop sequence or instead generate a (relatively short) sequence of individual instructions for each element. This flexibility is one of the advantages of just-in-time techniques versus static or manual optimization in the context of loop unrolling. In this situation, it is often with relatively small values of ''n'' where the savings are still useful&mdash;requiring quite small (if any) overall increase in program size (that might be included just once, as part of a standard library).\n\n[[Assembly language]] programmers (including optimizing compiler writers) are also able to benefit from the technique of dynamic loop unrolling, using a method similar to that used for efficient [[branch table]]s.

If the array had consisted of only two entries, it would still execute in approximately the same time as the original unwound loop. The increase in [[binary file|code]] size is only about 108 bytes{{snd}} even if there are thousands of entries in the array.\n\nSimilar techniques can of course be used where multiple instructions are involved, as long as the combined instruction length is adjusted accordingly. For example, in this same example, if it is required to clear the rest of each array entry to nulls immediately after the 100 byte field copied, an additional clear instruction, <code>XC&nbsp;xx*256+100(156,R1),xx*256+100(R2)</code>, can be added immediately after every MVC in the sequence (where <code>xx</code> matches the value in the MVC above it).\n\nIt is, of course, perfectly possible to generate the above code \"inline\" using a single assembler [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] statement, specifying just four or five operands (or alternatively, make it into a library subroutine, accessed by a simple call, passing a list of parameters), making the optimization readily accessible.\n\n=== C example ===\nThe following example demonstrates dynamic loop unrolling for a simple program written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Unlike the assembler example above, pointer/index arithmetic is still generated by the compiler in this example because a variable (i) is still used to address the array element. Full optimization is only possible if absolute indexes are used in the replacement statements.\n<source lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/* The number of entries processed per loop iteration.                        */\n/* Note that this number is a 'constant constant' reflecting the code below.  */\n#define BUNCHSIZE (8)\n\nint main(void)\n{ \n  int i = 0;                                    /* counter */\n  int entries = 50;                             /* total number to process    */\n  int repeat;                                   /* number of while repetitions*/\n  int left = 0;                                 /* remainder (process later)  */ \n \n  /* If the number of elements is not be divisible by BUNCHSIZE,              */ \n  /* get repeat times required to do most processing in the while loop        */\n\n  repeat = (entries / BUNCHSIZE);                /* number of times to repeat */\n  left   = (entries % BUNCHSIZE);                /* calculate remainder       */\n\n  /* Unroll the loop in 'bunches' of 8                                        */ \n  while (repeat--) \n  { \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i    );\n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 1); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 2); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 3); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 4); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 5); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 6); \n    printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 7);\n\n    /* update the index by amount processed in one go                         */ \n    i += BUNCHSIZE;\n  }\n\n  /* Use a switch statement to process remaining by jumping to the case label */ \n  /* at the label that will then drop through to complete the set             */ \n  switch (left) \n  {\n     case 7 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 6);   /* process and rely on drop \n                                                   through                    */\n     case 6 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 5); \n     case 5 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 4);  \n     case 4 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 3);  \n     case 3 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 2); \n     case 2 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i + 1);   /* two left                   */\n     case 1 : printf(\"process(%d)\\n\", i);       /* just one left to process   */ \n     case 0 : ;                                 /* none left                  */\n  } \n}\n</source>\nCode duplication could be avoided by writing the two parts together as in [[Duff's device]].\n\n=== C to MIPS assembly language loop unrolling example<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/arch/loop-unrolling.xhtml|title=Loop Unrolling|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Minessota}}</ref> ===\nThe following example will compute a [[dot product]] of two 100-entry vectors A and B of type <code>double</code>.

The WAS adopted the [[Declaration of Sexual Rights]], which originally included 11 sexual rights.

The WAS adopted the [[Declaration of Sexual Rights]], which originally included 11 sexual rights. It was heavily revised and expanded in March 2014 by the WAS Advisory Council to include 16 sexual rights:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsexology.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/declaration_of_sexual_rights_sep03_2014.pdf |title=Declaration of sexual rights' |publisher=Worldsexology.org |date=2014-03-01 |access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref>\n\n# The right to equality and non-discrimination\n# The right to life, liberty and security of the person\n# The right to autonomy and bodily integrity\n# The right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment\n# The right to be free from all forms of violence and coercion\n# The right to privacy\n# The right to the highest attainable standard of health, including sexual health; with the possibility of pleasurable, satisfying, and safe sexual experiences\n# The right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its application\n# The right to information\n# The right to education and the right to comprehensive sexuality education\n# The right to enter, form, and dissolve marriage and similar types of relationships based on equality and full and free consent\n# The right to decide whether to have children, the number and spacing of children, and to have the information and the means to do so\n# The right to the freedom of thought, opinion, and expression\n# The right to freedom of association and peaceful assembly\n# The right to participation in public and political life\n# The right to access to justice, remedies, and redress\n\nThis Declaration influenced [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] (which were launched as a set of international principles relating to sexual orientation and gender identity on 26 March 2007), especially on the idea of each person's [[integrity]], and right to sexual and [[reproductive health]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://yogyakartaprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/A5_yogyakartaWEB-2.pdf | title = The Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity | work = Yogyakartaprinciples.org | date = 10 November 2017 }}</ref>  \n\nIn 2015 the U.S. government said it would begin using the term \"sexual rights\" in discussions of human rights and global development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/us-government-says-it-will-now-use-the-term-sexual-rights/ar-AAer3sZ?li=AAa0dzB&ocid=HPCDHP |title=US government says it will now use the term 'sexual rights' |publisher=Msn.com |date=2015-06-26 |access-date=2015-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Reproductive health==\n{{Main article|Reproductive health}}\nWithin the framework of the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) definition of [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, '''reproductive health''', or '''sexual health'''/'''hygiene''', addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en/|title=WHO: Reproductive health|access-date=2008-08-19}}</ref>  Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and [[Safer sex|safer sex life]] and that they have the capability to reproduce and the [[Family planning|freedom to decide]] if, when and how often to do so.

It was the last draft held at the home arena of an NBA team until [[2011 NBA draft|2011]]; the following and subsequent drafts (through 2010) all took place at [[The Theater at Madison Square Garden]] in New York City (though Madison Square Garden itself is the home of the [[New York Knicks]], they do not play in the theater). As of 2019, it is also the last NBA draft where a college senior would be selected as the top selection of the draft.\n\nThe 2000 draft is considered one of the worst in NBA history. To date, only top pick [[Kenyon Martin]], first-rounder [[Jamaal Magloire]] (19th pick overall), and second-rounder [[Michael Redd]] (43rd pick overall) have played in the NBA All-Star Game (each only making the team one time, in [[2004 NBA All-Star Game|2004]]). In addition, only one player made an [[All-NBA Team]] (Redd, whose sole appearance was on the third team in [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2004]]); only three players in the draft class have won a major end-of-season award ([[Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu]] was named [[NBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player]] in [[2007\u201308 NBA season|2008]], [[Mike Miller (basketball player)|Mike Miller]] won both the [[NBA Rookie of the Year]] and [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] awards in 2001 and 2006 respectively, and [[Jamal Crawford]] was named 3x [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year]] in 2010, 2014 and 2016); and few draft selections have enjoyed extended careers in the NBA. As of 2019, Crawford is the last remaining active player from this draft.\n\n''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named this entire draft class (as opposed to individual players) the 6th biggest bust of the modern era \u2013 making it the only draft class among the site's top 20 list.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/2005/06/24/gallery.nbabusts/content.15.html |work=CNN |title=SI.com \u2013 Photo Gallery \u2013 NBA Draft Busts |accessdate=28 March 2007  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418103854/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/2005/06/24/gallery.nbabusts/content.15.html |archivedate=18 April 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Just before the [[2009 NBA draft|2009 draft]], ''[[ESPN.com]]'' columnist David Schoenfield wrote a piece in which he rated all of the drafts since the institution of the [[NBA Draft Lottery|draft lottery]] in [[1985 NBA draft|1985]], and the only draft which he gave the lowest possible grade of \"F\" was the 2000 draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story?page=draftreview/090624|title=The first lottery draft still rates the best |first=David |last=Schoenfield |publisher=ESPN|date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2009-06-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627133325/http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=draftreview%2F090624 |archivedate=27 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Using the [[Wins Above Replacement|WARP]] (wins above replacement player) metric, the 2000 NBA [[Draft (sports)|draft]] class collectively produced at a rate of 17.3 wins worse than a group of \"average replacement players\", effectively making 2000 the only draft class in [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] history to leave the NBA talent pool worse off than it had been prior to the given year's [[rookie]] draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/10714672/nba-2013-14-rookie-class-worst-ever|title=Is 2013-14 worst rookie class ever?|first=Kevin|last=Pelton|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2014-04-02|accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Draft selections==\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n| G || [[Basketball position#Back court|Guard]]\n| PG || [[Point guard]]\n| SG || [[Shooting guard]]\n| F || [[Basketball position#Frontcourt (forwards and center)|Forward]]\n| SF || [[Small forward]]\n| PF || [[Power forward (basketball)|Power forward]]\n| C || [[Center (basketball)|Center]]\n|}\n\n{{NBA Draft legend|1=|2=y|3=y|4=|5=y|6=y}}\n\n\n{{stack|\n[[File:Kenyon Martin Nuggets.jpg|right|thumb|upright|150px|Kenyon Martin, the 1st pick]]\n[[File:Jamal_Crawford_2010_cropped.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jamal Crawford, the 8th pick]]\n[[File:Hedo_Turkoglu_point_guard_11-27-08.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu, the 16th pick]]\n[[File:Jamaal MagloireHeat.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jamaal Magloire, the 19th pick]]\n[[File:DeShawn_Stevenson_at_the_Championship_parade.jpg|thumb|right|150px|DeShawn Stevenson, the 23rd pick]]\n[[File:ReddBucks.jpg|right|thumb|150px|upright|Michael Redd, the 43rd pick]]\n}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n! width=\"1%\"| Round\n! width=\"1%\"| Pick\n! width=\"19%\"| Player\n! width=\"1%\"| Position\n! width=\"16%\"| Nationality{{refn|group=n|Nationality indicates the player's national team or representative nationality.
