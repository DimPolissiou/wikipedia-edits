In order to settle the matter, the federal authorities set up a five-member commission presided over by [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] in June 1945.

His company is now called [[Jules J\u00fcrgensen]] after one of his two sons and is based in [[Switzerland]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nJ\u00fcrgensen was born on 5 August 1776 in [[Copenhagen]], the son of royal watchmaker J\u00f8rgen J\u00f8rgensen (1745\u20131811) and Anne Leth Bruun (1755\u20131828). He attended Eftersl\u00e6gtens skole where his teachers included Edvard Storm and  [[Knud Lyhne Rahbek]]. J\u00fcrgensen was in the same time a watchmaker's apprentice in his father's workshop. At the age of 20, we went on a five-year journey abroad with economic support from Fonden ad usus publicos oanddet Reiersenske Fond. He spent one and a half year in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] and half a year in [[Switzerland]] before continuing to [[Paris]] and then [[London]]. He then returned to Paris.<ref name=DBL>{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/H\u00e5ndv\u00e6rk/Urmager/Urban_J\u00fcrgensen|title=Urban J\u00fcrgensen|language=Danish|publisher=[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]|accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nJ\u00fcrgensen  returned to Copenhagen in 1801. He was supposed to enter into a partnership with a French watchmaker, Etienne Magnin, who had been called to Denmark to construct the next [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]]s for the shipping industry. These plans changed when watchmaker continued to [[Saint Petersburg]] and J\u00fcrgensen then joined his father's workshop. In 1804, he published ''Regler for Tidens n\u00f8jagtige Afmaaling ved Uhre''. It was the following year published in an improved edition in French. It was followed by a German translation. In 1804, he was also awarded the Academy of Sciences' silver medal for a publication about [[mainspring]]s published in one of its journals. In 1705, he was awarded Landhusholdningsselskabet's large gold medal for a metal thermometer. In 1807, weakened by gard work and personal griefs (the death of several children), he left Copenhagen for Neuch\u00e2tel where he stayed for two and a half years. He brough an extensive collection of machines and instruments back to Denmark which was the largest of its kind in the country. He was accompanied by a team of Swiss watchmakers which replaced his poorly trained Danish employees. In Geneva, he had been able to study the art of perforating precious stones, a technique which had for many years been kept secret.

His company is now called [[Jules J\u00fcrgensen]] after one of his two sons and is based in [[Switzerland]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nJ\u00fcrgensen was born on 5 August 1776 in [[Copenhagen]], the son of royal watchmaker J\u00f8rgen J\u00f8rgensen (1745\u20131811) and Anne Leth Bruun (1755\u20131828). He attended Eftersl\u00e6gtens skole where his teachers included Edvard Storm and  [[Knud Lyhne Rahbek]]. J\u00fcrgensen was in the same time a watchmaker's apprentice in his father's workshop. At the age of 20, we went on a five-year journey abroad with economic support from Fonden ad usus publicos oanddet Reiersenske Fond. He spent one and a half year in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] and half a year in [[Switzerland]] before continuing to [[Paris]] and then [[London]]. He then returned to Paris.<ref name=DBL>{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/H\u00e5ndv\u00e6rk/Urmager/Urban_J\u00fcrgensen|title=Urban J\u00fcrgensen|language=Danish|publisher=[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]|accessdate=3 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nJ\u00fcrgensen  returned to Copenhagen in 1801. He was supposed to enter into a partnership with a French watchmaker, Etienne Magnin, who had been called to Denmark to construct the next [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]]s for the shipping industry. These plans changed when watchmaker continued to [[Saint Petersburg]] and J\u00fcrgensen then joined his father's workshop. In 1804, he published ''Regler for Tidens n\u00f8jagtige Afmaaling ved Uhre''. It was the following year published in an improved edition in French. It was followed by a German translation. In 1804, he was also awarded the Academy of Sciences' silver medal for a publication about [[mainspring]]s published in one of its journals. In 1705, he was awarded Landhusholdningsselskabet's large gold medal for a metal termometer. In 1807, weakened by gard work and personal griefs (the death of several children), he left Copenhagen for Neuch\u00e2tel where he stayed for two and a half years. He brough an extensive collection of machines and instruments back to Denmark which was the largest of its kind in the country. He was accompanied by a team of Swiss watchmakers which replaced his poorly trained Danish employees. In Geneva, he had been able to study the art of perforating precious stones, a technique which had for many years been kept secret. J\u00fcrgensen  was also the first in Denmark to make cylindrical wheels in steel instead of brass.<ref name=DBL/>\n\nJ\u00fcrgensen   continued the workshop alone after his father's death in 1811.

Founded in 1995 as a division of [[Bombardier Aerospace]], it is currently owned by Directional Aviation, an aviation private investment firm.\n\n==Background==\n\nFlexjet is a provider of fractional jet ownership, leasing and jet card services. Directional Aviation, the private investment firm founded by aviation entrepreneur [[Kenn Ricci]], has owned Flexjet since 2013.<ref name=\"auto\" />  Headquartered in [[Richmond Heights, Ohio]], Flexjet is led by Ricci, its chairman, and by [[Michael Silvestro|Michael J. Silvestro]], its chief executive officer. Flexjet is one of the largest fractional private jet companies. The company employs more than 600 pilots serving 2,100 clients.<ref name=\"Barrons2016\" />\n\n==History==\n\nFounded in 1995, Flexjet entered the fractional jet ownership market as a division of Bombardier Aerospace, the world's largest business aviation manufacturer<ref name=\"Qatar_PressRelease_20120514\" /> and itself a division of Bombardier Inc.<ref name=\"2019FlexJetAboutUs\" />\n\nBy 1998, Flexjet, doing business as Business Jet Solutions, had 41 aircraft, including the [[Learjet_31#Learjet_31A|Learjet 31A]], [[Learjet 45]], [[Learjet 60]] and Challenger 60, serving more than 200 clients.<ref name=\"IndyStar\" />\n\nAt one time, Flexjet offered not only fractional ownership and jet card but also [[aircraft charter]] services. Flexjet entered the charter market in 2000 when Bombardier Aerospace acquired Skyjet, which pioneered the online booking of private jet charters. Under Bombardier, Skyjet became one of the first companies to offer a membership program; eventually, the program became the Skyjet Card.<ref name=\"BombSkyJet\" />\n\nBy 2002, Flexjet had seen 20 percent annual growth since its founding. It employed more than 1,000 people, half of them [[flight crew]] members, and operated a fleet of 105 aircraft to serve 640 owners. At the time, Flexjet held an approximately one-sixth of the total fractional market, which then amounted to 650 aircraft and 3,500 owners.<ref name=\"2017FlexJetMediaKit\" />\n\nFlexjet saw its first substantial profit in 2006, with sales of fractional shares up 28 percent and revenue up 30 percent compared to 2005. It maintained the approximate 16 percent share of the fractional market it had enjoyed four years earlier. During this period, the company began expanding its range of aircraft, including the [[Learjet 40]] and [[Learjet 45|45]], [[Learjet 60|60]], 60 XR, [[Challenger 300]], [[Bombardier Challenger 600 series|Challenger 604]] and [[Bombardier Challenger 600 series|Challenger 605]].<ref name=\"AINonline2006\" />\n\nIn 2008, [[VistaJet]] acquired the firm's non-U.S. operations, then branded as Skyjet International, and absorbed its operations.<ref name=\"AINonline2014\" />  Subsequently, Flexjet consolidated the remaining domestic charter services under its own brand.<ref name=\"AWIN2014\" />\n\nThe [[The Great Recession|financial crisis of 2008]] and subsequent recession had a substantial impact on the private jet industry, forcing cutbacks and retrenchment at many carriers. Flexjet weathered the downturn and, by the spring of 2013, was again reporting robust sales, with fractional share sales increasing 108 percent year over year in the first quarter.<ref name=\"AINonline2013\" />  Flexjet began bringing back pilots who had been furloughed during the downturn.<ref name=\"2013CorpJetInvest\" />\n\nIn September 2013, private aviation investment firm Directional Aviation announced that it would acquire Flexjet from Bombardier for $185 million in cash.<ref name=\"auto\"/> At the same time, Flexjet placed orders with Bombardier for 85 jets valued at about $1.8 billion, with options for up to an additional 160 jets that could bring the contract's value to $5.2 billion.<ref name=\"Flying2013\" />\n\nIn 2014, Flexjet exited the charter market. As part of the first consolidation of its aviation companies, Directional Aviation moved the charter brokerage operations of its Flexjet and Sentient Jet companies to the Skyjet brand. Skyjet would concentrate solely on charter services, with Flexjet continuing to offer fractional programs and Sentient Jet offering jet card programs.<ref name=\"AWIN2014_B\" />\n\nCurrently, Flexjet offers three programs: Fractional ownership, lease, and the Flexjet 25 Jet Card.\n\nIn 2015, Flexjet also launched Red Label, an offering under which each aircraft has a dedicated flight crew, customized interiors, and seating configurations and the industry's youngest fleet. Each of the aircraft under Red Label is less than five years old.<ref name=\"ForbesRedLabel2016\" />\n\nOther developments included the 2016 opening of the company's first exclusive private jet terminal, in [[Naples, Florida]],<ref name=\"NaplesDaily2016\" /> followed by the opening of similar facilities at [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] and [[Westchester County Airport]], New York. A facility at [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] is expected to open during 2019.<ref name=\"RobbReport2018\" />\n\nFlexjet also announced the launch of intra-European service in 2016, establishing the infrastructure for its offering initially through the acquisition of [[United Kingdom]]-based charter and management company [[Flairjet]], enabling operations within Europe.<ref name=\"AINonline2016\" /> In 2018, a European affiliate of Directional Aviation's OneSky acquired a controlling interest in [[Milan, Italy]]-based Sirio S.P.A., a private jet operator and aircraft management firm.<ref name=\"AINonline2018\" />  More recently, OneSky acquired United Kingdom-headquartered [[PrivateFly]], a digital booking service for private jet charter flights.<ref name=\"PrivateFly2018\" />\n\n==Fleet==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center\"\n|+ FlexJet Fleet<br />{{as of|2019|10|24}}\n!Aircraft\n!ICAO code\n!In Service\n!Orders\n!Passengers\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Ref\n|-\n|[[Bombardier Challenger 300]]    \n|CL30    \n|34    \n|&mdash;    \n|9    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Bombardier Challenger 350]]    \n|CL35    \n|17    \n|&mdash;    \n|9    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Bombardier Challenger 600 series|Bombardier Challenger 650]]    \n|CL60    \n|13    \n|&mdash;    \n|19    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 450]]    \n|E545    \n|17    \n|&mdash;    \n|9    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]]    \n|E550    \n|4    \n|&mdash;    \n|12    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Embraer Phenom 300]]    \n|E55P    \n|34    \n|&mdash;    \n|6    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Bombardier Global Express|Bombardier Global 6000]]    \n|GLEX    \n|4    \n|&mdash;    \n|13    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Gulfstream IV|Gulfstream IV/G400/G450/4SP]]    \n|GLF4    \n|7    \n|&mdash;    \n|16    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Gulfstream V]]    \n|GLF5    \n|1    \n|&mdash;    \n|19    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Gulfstream_G650#G700|Gulfstream G700]]<br />North American Launch Customer    \n|&mdash;\n|&mdash;\n|16    \n|19    \n|<ref name=\"LaunchCustomer2019\" />\n|-\n|[[Hawker 800|Hawker 800XP]]    \n|H25B    \n|1    \n|&mdash;    \n|8    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Learjet 40]]    \n|LJ40    \n|0    \n|&mdash;    \n|7    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Learjet 45]]    \n|LJ45    \n|11    \n|&mdash;    \n|9    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Learjet 60]]    \n|LJ60    \n|8    \n|&mdash;    \n|8    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n|[[Learjet 70/75|Learjet 75]]    \n|LJ75    \n|6    \n|&mdash;    \n|8    \n|<ref name=\"20191024FlexJetFleet\" />\n|-\n!Total\n!\n!140\n!\n! colspan=\"7\" class=\"unsortable\"|\n|}\n<!-- This section hasbeen commented out because it is out-of-date. 2019-10-25 -->\n\n<!--\nFlexjet's order with Bombardier in 2013 called for Challenger and Learjet aircraft.

The three-engine jet, now under development, is expected to make its first flight in 2021 and enter service in 2023.<ref>\u201c[http://aviationweek.com/nbaa-2015/flexjet-order-20-supersonic-jets-boosts-aerion Flexjet Order for 20 Supersonic Jets Boosts Aerion],\u201d by Molly McMillin, Aviation Week Network, November 18, 2015</ref>\n\n-->\n\n{{as of|2019|10|alt=In October 2019}}, Flexjet announced an order for 64 aircraft from Embraer Executive Jets, including the [[Embraer_Legacy_450/500_and_Praetor_500/600#Praetor_500/600|Praetor 500]], [[Embraer_Legacy_450/500_and_Praetor_500/600#Praetor_500/600|Praetor 600]], and [[Embraer Phenom 300|Phenom 300]].<ref name=\"EmbraerOrder2019\" /> Additionally, it will be the North American launch customer for the [[Gulfstream_G650#G700|Gulfstream G700]].<ref name=\"LaunchCustomer2019\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]]\n*[[AirSprint]]\n*[[NetJets]]\n*[[PlaneSense]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"2017FlexJetMediaKit\">{{cite web |url= https://www.flexjet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-Flexjet-Media-Kit-v1.2.pdf |title= 2017 FLEXJET MEDIA KIT |date= 2017 |website= flexjet.com |publisher= [[FlexJet]] |language= en |format= PDF |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170709032825/https://www.flexjet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2017-Flexjet-Media-Kit-v1.2.pdf |archive-date= 2017-07-09 |url-status= live |access-date= 2019-10-25 |ref= 2017FlexJetMediaKit |df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news | last1= Ostrower | first1= Jon | last2= Johnson | first2= Karen | date= 2013-09-05 | title= Bombardier Bails Out of Its Flexjet Business | url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/bombardier-bails-out-of-its-flexjet-business-1378392511 |url-status= live | url-access= subscription | work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] | language= en | issn= 0099-9660 | oclc= 781541372 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180203225130/https://www.wsj.com/articles/bombardier-bails-out-of-its-flexjet-business-1378392511 | archive-date= 2018-02-03 | access-date= 2019-10-24 | quote= Bombardier Inc. said Thursday it has agreed to sell its Flexjet fractional-jet operation, reflecting the post-recession dynamics of business aviation, and landed an order from the buyer for new jets worth up to $5.2 billion. | ref= auto | df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Barrons2016\">{{cite news | last1= Huber | first1= Mark | date= 2016-06-18 | title= Flexjet Takes On NetJets | url= https://www.barrons.com/articles/flexjet-takes-on-netjets-1466222365 | url-status= live | work= [[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] | language= en | issn= 1077-8039 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160619140113/https://www.barrons.com/articles/flexjet-takes-on-netjets-1466222365 | archive-date= 2016-06-19 | access-date= 2019-10-24 | quote= Flexjet's fleet services 2,100 customers;

Founded in 1995 as a division of [[Bombardier Aerospace]], it is currently owned by Directional Aviation, an aviation private investment firm.\n\n==Background==\n\nFlexjet is a provider of fractional jet ownership, leasing and jet card services. Directional Aviation, the private investment firm founded by aviation entrepreneur [[Kenn Ricci]], has owned Flexjet since 2013.<ref name=\"auto\" />  Headquartered in [[Richmond Heights, Ohio]], Flexjet is led by Ricci, its chairman, and by [[Michael Silvestro|Michael J. Silvestro]], its chief executive officer. Flexjet is one of the largest fractional private jet companies. The company employs more than 600 pilots serving 2,100 clients.<ref name=\"Barrons2016\" />\n\n==History==\n\nFounded in 1995, Flexjet entered the fractional jet ownership market as a division of Bombardier Aerospace, the world's largest business aviation manufacturer<ref name=\"Qatar_PressRelease_20120514\" /> and itself a division of Bombardier Inc.<ref name=\"2019FlexJetAboutUs\" />\n\nBy 1998, Flexjet, doing business as Business Jet Solutions, had 41 aircraft, including the [[Learjet_31#Learjet_31A|Learjet 31A]], [[Learjet 45]], [[Learjet 60]] and Challenger 60, serving more than 200 clients.<ref name=\"IndyStar\" />\n\nAt one time, Flexjet offered not only fractional ownership and jet card but also [[aircraft charter]] services. Flexjet entered the charter market in 2000 when Bombardier Aerospace acquired Skyjet, which pioneered the online booking of private jet charters. Under Bombardier, Skyjet became one of the first companies to offer a membership program; eventually, the program became the Skyjet Card.<ref name=\"BombSkyJet\" />\n\nBy 2002, Flexjet had seen 20 percent annual growth since its founding. It employed more than 1,000 people, half of them [[flight crew]] members, and operated a fleet of 105 aircraft to serve 640 owners. At the time, Flexjet held an approximately one-sixth of the total fractional market, which then amounted to 650 aircraft and 3,500 owners.<ref name=\"2017FlexJetMediaKit\" />\n\nFlexjet saw its first substantial profit in 2006, with sales of fractional shares up 28 percent and revenue up 30 percent compared to 2005. It maintained the approximate 16 percent share of the fractional market it had enjoyed four years earlier. During this period, the company began expanding its range of aircraft, including the [[Learjet 40]] and [[Learjet 45|45]], [[Learjet 60|60]], 60 XR, [[Challenger 300]], [[Bombardier Challenger 600 series|Challenger 604]] and [[Bombardier Challenger 600 series|Challenger 605]].<ref name=\"AINonline2006\" />\n\nIn 2008, [[VistaJet]] acquired the firm's non-U.S. operations, then branded as Skyjet International, and absorbed its operations.<ref name=\"AINonline2014\" />  Subsequently, Flexjet consolidated the remaining domestic charter services under its own brand.<ref name=\"AWIN2014\" />\n\nThe [[The Great Recession|financial crisis of 2008]] and subsequent recession had a substantial impact on the private jet industry, forcing cutbacks and retrenchment at many carriers. Flexjet weathered the downturn and, by the spring of 2013, was again reporting robust sales, with fractional share sales increasing 108 percent year over year in the first quarter.<ref name=\"AINonline2013\" />  Flexjet began bringing back pilots who had been furloughed during the downturn.<ref name=\"2013CorpJetInvest\" />\n\nIn September 2013, private aviation investment firm Directional Aviation announced that it would acquire Flexjet from Bombardier for $185 million in cash.<ref name=\"auto\"/> At the same time, Flexjet placed orders with Bombardier for 85 jets valued at about $1.8 billion, with options for up to an additional 160 jets that could bring the contract's value to $5.2 billion.<ref name=\"Flying2013\" />\n\nIn 2014, Flexjet exited the charter market. As part of the first consolidation of its aviation companies, Directional Aviation moved the charter brokerage operations of its Flexjet and Sentient Jet companies to the Skyjet brand. Skyjet would concentrate solely on charter services, with Flexjet continuing to offer fractional programs and Sentient Jet offering jet card programs.<ref name=\"AWIN2014_B\" />\n\nCurrently, Flexjet offers three programs: Fractional ownership, lease, and the Flexjet 25 Jet Card.\n\nIn 2015, Flexjet also launched Red Label, an offering under which each aircraft has a dedicated flight crew, customized interiors, and seating configurations and the industry's youngest fleet. Each of the aircraft under Red Label is less than five years old.<ref name=\"ForbesRedLabel2016\" />\n\nOther developments included the 2016 opening of the company's first exclusive private jet terminal, in [[Naples, Florida]],<ref name=\"NaplesDaily2016\" /> followed by the opening of similar facilities at [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] and [[Westchester County Airport]], New York.
