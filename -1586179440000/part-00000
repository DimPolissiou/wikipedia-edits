Before the Iazyge conquest in the 1st century, Indo-European peoples of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] descent inhabited this area. In the 3rd century BC, this area was controlled by Celtic [[Boii]] and [[Eravisci]], while in the 1st century BC, it became part of the [[Dacian kingdom]]. Since the 1st century, the area came under the control of the [[Sarmatian]] [[Iazyges]] (which possibly included [[Serboi]]{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} tribe), who occasionally were allies and occasionally enemies of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. Iazyge rule lasted until the 4th century, after which the region came into the possession of various other peoples and states.\n\n===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===\nIn the Early Middle Ages various [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Turkic peoples]] and states ruled in the area of Subotica. These peoples included [[Huns]], [[Gepids]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Slavs]] and [[Bulgarians]]. [[Slavs]] settled today's Subotica in the 6th and 7th centuries, before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the [[Balkans]].\n\nThe Slavic tribe living in the territory of present-day Subotica were the [[Obotrites]], a subgroup of the [[Serbs]]. In the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the [[Principality of Lower Pannonia]], [[Great Moravia]] and the [[Bulgarian Empire]].\n\n===Late-Middle Ages===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Tsar Jovan Nenad monument.jpg|[[Emperor Jovan Nenad]] monument in the downtown|thumb|left]]\nSubotica probably first became a settlement of note when people poured into it from nearby villages destroyed during the [[Tatar invasions]] of 1241\u201342. However the settlement has surely been older. It has been established that people inhabited these territories even 3000 years ago.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} When ''Zabadka''/''Zabatka'' was first recorded in 1391, it was a tiny town in the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Later, the city belonged to the [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadis]], one of the most influential aristocratic families in the whole of [[Central Europe]].\n\nKing [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] gave the town to one of his relatives, [[J\u00e1nos Pongr\u00e1c Dengelegi]], who, fearing an invasion by the [[Ottoman Empire]], fortified the castle of Subotica, erecting a fortress in 1470. Some decades later, after the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, Subotica became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The majority of the Hungarian population fled northward to [[Royal Hungary]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[B\u00e1lint T\u00f6r\u00f6k]], a local noble who had ruled over Subotica, also escaped from the city. During the military and political havoc following the defeat at [[Moh\u00e1cs]], Subotica came under the control of Serbian [[mercenaries]] recruited in [[Banat]]. These soldiers were in the service of the [[Transylvania]]n general [[John Z\u00e1polya|John I Z\u00e1polya]], a later Hungarian king.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe leader of these mercenaries, [[Jovan Nenad]], established in 1526\u201327 his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]] and created an independent entity, with Subotica as its administrative centre. At the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself as Serbian [[tsar]] in Subotica. He named [[Radoslav \u010celnik]] as the general commander of his army, while his treasurer and [[palatine]] was Subota Vrli\u0107, a Serbian noble from [[Jagodina]]. When B\u00e1lint T\u00f6r\u00f6k returned and recaptured Subotica from the Serbs, Jovan Nenad moved the administrative centre to [[Szeged]].<ref>Borovszky Samu: Magyarorsz\u00e1g v\u00e1rmegy\u00e9i \u00e9s v\u00e1rosai, B\u00e1cs-Bodrog v\u00e1rmegye I-II. k\u00f6tet, Apoll\u00f3 Irodalmi \u00e9s Nyomdai R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, 1909.</ref>\n\nSome months later, in the summer of 1527, Jovan Nenad was [[assassinated]] and his entity collapsed. However, after Jovan Nenad's death, Radoslav \u010celnik led the remains of the army to Ottoman Syrmia, where he briefly ruled as an Ottoman vassal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Ottoman administration===\n{{Quote box\n| width = 23em\n| align = right\n| bgcolor = #B0C4DE\n| title = Historical affiliations\n| fontsize = 90%\n| quote = {{flagicon image|Flag_of_Hungary_(15th_century%2C_rectangular).svg}} [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)|Kingdom of Hungary]] c. 1391\u20131526<br>\n{{flag|Ottoman Empire}} 1542\u20131686<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg}} [[Habsburg Monarchy]] 1686\u20131804<br>\n{{flag|Austrian Empire}} 1804\u20131867<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Austria-Hungary_(1869-1918).svg}} [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] 1867\u20131918<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Serbia_(1882-1918).svg}} [[Kingdom of Serbia]] 1918<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia.svg}} [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]{{refn|Officially known  as the ''Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes'' until 1929}} 1918\u20131941<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Hungary_(1920\u20131946).svg}} [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]] 1941\u20131944<br>\n{{flag|SFR Yugoslavia}}{{refn|Known as ''Democratic Federal Yugoslavia'' until 1945}} 1944\u20131992<br>\n{{flag|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}} 1992\u22122003<br>\n{{flag|Serbia and Montenegro}} 2003\u20132006<br>\n{{flag|Serbia|name=Republic of Serbia}} 2006\u2013present\n}}\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] ruled the city from 1542 to 1686. At the end of this almost 150-year-long period, not much remained of the old town of ''Zabadka''/''Zabatka''. As much of the population had fled, the Ottomans encouraged the settlement of the area by different colonists from the [[Balkans]]. The settlers were mostly [[Serbian Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]]. They cultivated the extremely fertile land around Subotica. In 1570, the population of Subotica numbered 49 houses, and in 1590, 63 houses. In 1687, the region was settled by [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] ''[[Dalmatia|Dalmatas]]'' (called [[Bunjevci]] today). It was called ''Sobotka'' under Ottoman rule and was a kaza centre in [[Sanjak of Segedin|Segedin]] sanjak at first in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyaleti]] until 1596, and after that in [[Egir Province, Ottoman Empire|E\u011fri Eyaleti]] between 1596\u20131686.<ref>[[Sanjak of Segedin]]</ref>\n\n===Habsburg administration===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1687, about 5,000 [[Bunjevci]], led by Dujo Markovi\u0107 and \u0110uro Vidakovi\u0107 settled in Ba\u010dka (including Subotica). After the decisive battle against the Ottomans at [[Senta]] led by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] on 11 September 1697, Subotica became part of the [[Military Frontier|military border]] zone [[Potisje|Theiss]]-[[Pomori\u0161je|Mieresch]] established by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In the meantime the uprising of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] broke out, which is also known as the [[Kuruc War]].\n\nIn the region of Subotica, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi joined battle against the ''Rac National Militia''. ''[[R\u00e1c (ethnonym)|R\u00e1c]]'' was a designation for the South Slavic people (mostly Serbs and Bunjevci) and they often were referred to as ''r\u00e1cok'' in the Kingdom of Hungary. In a later period ''r\u00e1cok'' came to mean, above all, Serbs of Orthodox religion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\nThe Serbian military families enjoyed several privileges thanks to their service for the Habsburg Monarchy. Subotica gradually, however, developed from being a mere garrison town to becoming a market town with its own civil charter in 1743. When this happened, many Serbs complained about the loss of their privileges. The majority left the town in protest and some of them founded a new settlement just outside 18th century Subotica in [[Aleksandrovo, Subotica|Aleksandrovo]], while others emigrated to [[Russia]]. In [[New Serbia (historical province)|New Serbia]], a new Russian province established for them, those Serbs founded a new settlement and also named it ''Subotica''. In 1775, a Jewish community in Subotica was established.\n\nIt was perhaps to emphasise the new civic serenity of Subotica that the pious name ''[[Saint Mary]]'' came to be used for it at this time. Some decades later, in 1779, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] advanced the town's status further by proclaiming it a Free Royal Town. The enthusiastic inhabitants of the city renamed Subotica once more as ''Maria-Theresiopolis''.\n\nThis Free Royal Town status gave a great impetus to the development of the city. During the 19th century, its population doubled twice, attracting many people from all over the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. This led eventually to a considerable demographic change. In the first half of the 19th century, the Bunjevci had still been in the majority, but there was an increasing number of Hungarians and Jews settling in Subotica. This process was not stopped even by the outbreak of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolutions in the Habsburg Monarchy (1848-49)]].\n\n===1848/1849 Revolutions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Szabadka_1.jpg|thumb|left|Subotica (Szabadka) in 1914 Hungarian postcard]]\nDuring the 1848-49 revolution, the proclaimed borders of autonomous [[Serbian Vojvodina]] included Subotica, but Serb troops could not establish control in the region. On 5 March 1849, at the locality named Kaponja (between Tavankut and Bajmok), there was a battle between the Serb and Hungarian armies, which was won by the Hungarians.\n\nThe first newspaper in the town was also published during the 1848/49 revolution\u2014it was called ''Honunk \u00e1llapota'' (\"State of Our Homeland\") and was published in Hungarian by K\u00e1roly Bitterman's local printing company. Unlike most Serbs and Croats who confronted the Hungarians, part of the local Bunjevci people supported the Hungarian revolution.\n\nIn 1849, after the [[Hungarian revolution of 1848]] was defeated by the Russian and Habsburg armies, the town was separated from the Kingdom of Hungary together with most of the Ba\u010dka region, and became part of a separate Habsburg province, called [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. The administrative centre of this new province was [[Timi\u0219oara]]. The province existed until 1860. During the existence of the voivodeship, in 1853, Subotica acquired its impressive theatre.\n\n===Hungarian administration===\nAfter the establishment of the [[Ausgleich|Dual-Monarchy]] in 1867, there followed what is often called the \"golden age\" of city development of Subotica. Many schools were opened after 1867 and in 1869 the railway connected the city to the world. In 1896 an electrical power plant was built, further enhancing the development of the city and the whole region. Subotica now adorned itself with its remarkable Central European, [[fin de si\u00e8cle]] architecture.

In changed economic and political circumstances, Subotica was now a border-town in [[Yugoslavia]] and did not, for a time, experience again the dynamic prosperity it enjoyed in the years preceding World War I. However, at that time, Subotica was the third-largest city in Yugoslavia by population, following [[Belgrade]] and [[Zagreb]].\n\nIn 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and partitioned by the [[Axis Powers]], and its northern parts, including Subotica, were [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|annexed by Hungary]] (This partition of Yugoslavia was not recognized by the international community and city was, from the legal point of view, still part of Yugoslavia, whose only legal representative was the Yugoslav government in exile). Hungarian troops entered Subotica on 11 April 1941.\n\nAs the majority of people living in the city were ethnic Hungarians and the city had been part of Hungary for over 600 years, Hungary felt it had to protect its people now living outside of its borders. During [[World War II]] the city lost approximately 7,000 of its citizens, mostly Serbs, Hungarians and Jews. Before the war about 6,000 [[Jews]] lived in Subotica; many of these were deported from the city during the [[Holocaust]], mostly to [[Auschwitz]].\n\nIn April 1944, a ghetto was set up. In addition, many [[communists]] were put to death during Axis rule. In 1944, the Axis forces left the city, and Subotica became part of the new [[Yugoslavia]]. During the 1944\u201345 period, about 8,000 citizens (mainly Hungarian) were killed by [[Yugoslav partisans|Partisans]] while re-taking the city as retribution for supporting Axis Hungary.<ref>M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros S\u00e1ndor: Holtt\u00e1 nyilv\u00e1n\u00edtva - D\u00e9lvid\u00e9ki magyar f\u00e1tum 1944\u201345, I-II, Hatodik S\u00edp Alap\u00edtv\u00e1ny, Budapest 1995.</ref><ref>Cseres Tibor: V\u00e9rbossz\u00fa B\u00e1csk\u00e1ban, Magvet\u0151 kiad\u00f3, Budapest 1991.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n\nIn the post-war period, Subotica has gradually been modernised. During the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav]] and [[Kosovo war|Kosovo]] wars of the 1990s, a considerable number of Serb refugees came to the city from [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Kosovo]], while many ethnic Hungarians and Croats, as well as some local Serbs, left the region due to economical stagnation and fear of racism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Folk_Theater_Subotica_Serbia.JPG|thumb|right|[[National Theatre in Subotica]]]]\n[[File:Subotica02.jpg|thumb|right|Municipal Library]]\n[[File:Pa\u0142ac Rajhla (Galeria Sztuki Wsp\u00f3\u0142czesnej) w Suboticy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Reichel Palace]]]]\n[[File:Suboticka arhitektura.jpg|thumb|right|Secession architecture in downtown]]\nUnique in Serbia, Subotica has the most buildings built in the art nouveau style.

The Subotica buses transport people via nine city, six suburban, and ten interurban, as well as two international lines of bus operations. Per year the buses travel some 4.7 million kilometres, and carry about ten million people.\n\nThe city is served by [[Subotica Airport]]; its runway is too short for airliners, limiting usage to mostly recreational aviation.

Iazyge rule lasted until the 4th century, after which the region came into the possession of various other peoples and states.\n\n===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===\nIn the Early Middle Ages various [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Turkic peoples]] and states ruled in the area of Subotica. These peoples included [[Huns]], [[Gepids]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Slavs]] and [[Bulgarians]]. [[Slavs]] settled today's Subotica in the 6th and 7th centuries, before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the [[Balkans]].\n\nThe Slavic tribe living in the territory of present-day Subotica were the [[Obotrites]], a subgroup of the [[Serbs]]. In the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the [[Principality of Lower Pannonia]], [[Great Moravia]] and the [[Bulgarian Empire]].\n\n===Late-Middle Ages===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Tsar Jovan Nenad monument.jpg|[[Emperor Jovan Nenad]] monument in the downtown|thumb|left]]\nSubotica probably first became a settlement of note when people poured into it from nearby villages destroyed during the [[Tatar invasions]] of 1241\u201342. However the settlement has surely been older. It has been established that people inhabited these territories even 3000 years ago.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} When ''Zabadka''/''Zabatka'' was first recorded in 1391, it was a tiny town in the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Later, the city belonged to the [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadis]], one of the most influential aristocratic families in the whole of [[Central Europe]].\n\nKing [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] gave the town to one of his relatives, [[J\u00e1nos Pongr\u00e1c Dengelegi]], who, fearing an invasion by the [[Ottoman Empire]], fortified the castle of Subotica, erecting a fortress in 1470. Some decades later, after the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, Subotica became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The majority of the Hungarian population fled northward to [[Royal Hungary]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[B\u00e1lint T\u00f6r\u00f6k]], a local noble who had ruled over Subotica, also escaped from the city. During the military and political havoc following the defeat at [[Moh\u00e1cs]], Subotica came under the control of Serbian [[mercenaries]] recruited in [[Banat]]. These soldiers were in the service of the [[Transylvania]]n general [[John Z\u00e1polya|John I Z\u00e1polya]], a later Hungarian king.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe leader of these mercenaries, [[Jovan Nenad]], established in 1526\u201327 his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]] and created an independent entity, with Subotica as its administrative centre. At the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself as Serbian [[tsar]] in Subotica. He named [[Radoslav \u010celnik]] as the general commander of his army, while his treasurer and [[palatine]] was Subota Vrli\u0107, a Serbian noble from [[Jagodina]]. When B\u00e1lint T\u00f6r\u00f6k returned and recaptured Subotica from the Serbs, Jovan Nenad moved the administrative centre to [[Szeged]].<ref>Borovszky Samu: Magyarorsz\u00e1g v\u00e1rmegy\u00e9i \u00e9s v\u00e1rosai, B\u00e1cs-Bodrog v\u00e1rmegye I-II. k\u00f6tet, Apoll\u00f3 Irodalmi \u00e9s Nyomdai R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, 1909.</ref>\n\nSome months later, in the summer of 1527, Jovan Nenad was [[assassinated]] and his entity collapsed. However, after Jovan Nenad's death, Radoslav \u010celnik led the remains of the army to Ottoman Syrmia, where he briefly ruled as an Ottoman vassal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Ottoman administration===\n{{Quote box\n| width = 23em\n| align = right\n| bgcolor = #B0C4DE\n| title = Historical affiliations\n| fontsize = 90%\n| quote = {{flagicon image|Flag_of_Hungary_(15th_century%2C_rectangular).svg}} [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)|Kingdom of Hungary]] c. 1391\u20131526<br>\n{{flag|Ottoman Empire}} 1542\u20131686<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg}} [[Habsburg Monarchy]] 1686\u20131804<br>\n{{flag|Austrian Empire}} 1804\u20131867<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Austria-Hungary_(1869-1918).svg}} [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] 1867\u20131918<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Serbia_(1882-1918).svg}} [[Kingdom of Serbia]] 1918<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia.svg}} [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]{{refn|Officially known  as the ''Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes'' until 1929}} 1918\u20131941<br>\n{{flagicon image|Flag_of_Hungary_(1920\u20131946).svg}} [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]] 1941\u20131944<br>\n{{flag|SFR Yugoslavia}}{{refn|Known as ''Democratic Federal Yugoslavia'' until 1945}} 1944\u20131992<br>\n{{flag|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}} 1992\u22122003<br>\n{{flag|Serbia and Montenegro}} 2003\u20132006<br>\n{{flag|Serbia|name=Republic of Serbia}} 2006\u2013present\n}}\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] ruled the city from 1542 to 1686. At the end of this almost 150-year-long period, not much remained of the old town of ''Zabadka''/''Zabatka''. As much of the population had fled, the Ottomans encouraged the settlement of the area by different colonists from the [[Balkans]]. The settlers were mostly [[Serbian Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]]. They cultivated the extremely fertile land around Subotica. In 1570, the population of Subotica numbered 49 houses, and in 1590, 63 houses. In 1687, the region was settled by [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] ''[[Dalmatia|Dalmatas]]'' (called [[Bunjevci]] today). It was called ''Sobotka'' under Ottoman rule and was a kaza centre in [[Sanjak of Segedin|Segedin]] sanjak at first in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyaleti]] until 1596, and after that in [[Egir Province, Ottoman Empire|E\u011fri Eyaleti]] between 1596\u20131686.<ref>[[Sanjak of Segedin]]</ref>\n\n===Habsburg administration===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1687, about 5,000 [[Bunjevci]], led by Dujo Markovi\u0107 and \u0110uro Vidakovi\u0107 settled in Ba\u010dka (including Subotica). After the decisive battle against the Ottomans at [[Senta]] led by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] on 11 September 1697, Subotica became part of the [[Military Frontier|military border]] zone [[Potisje|Theiss]]-[[Pomori\u0161je|Mieresch]] established by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In the meantime the uprising of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] broke out, which is also known as the [[Kuruc War]].\n\nIn the region of Subotica, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi joined battle against the ''Rac National Militia''. ''[[R\u00e1c (ethnonym)|R\u00e1c]]'' was a designation for the South Slavic people (mostly Serbs and Bunjevci) and they often were referred to as ''r\u00e1cok'' in the Kingdom of Hungary. In a later period ''r\u00e1cok'' came to mean, above all, Serbs of Orthodox religion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\nThe Serbian military families enjoyed several privileges thanks to their service for the Habsburg Monarchy. Subotica gradually, however, developed from being a mere garrison town to becoming a market town with its own civil charter in 1743. When this happened, many Serbs complained about the loss of their privileges. The majority left the town in protest and some of them founded a new settlement just outside 18th century Subotica in [[Aleksandrovo, Subotica|Aleksandrovo]], while others emigrated to [[Russia]]. In [[New Serbia (historical province)|New Serbia]], a new Russian province established for them, those Serbs founded a new settlement and also named it ''Subotica''. In 1775, a Jewish community in Subotica was established.\n\nIt was perhaps to emphasise the new civic serenity of Subotica that the pious name ''[[Saint Mary]]'' came to be used for it at this time. Some decades later, in 1779, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] advanced the town's status further by proclaiming it a Free Royal Town. The enthusiastic inhabitants of the city renamed Subotica once more as ''Maria-Theresiopolis''.\n\nThis Free Royal Town status gave a great impetus to the development of the city. During the 19th century its population doubled twice, attracting many people from all over the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. This led eventually to a considerable demographic change. In the first half of the 19th century, the Bunjevci had still been in the majority, but there was an increasing number of Hungarians and Jews settling in Subotica. This process was not stopped even by the outbreak of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolutions in the Habsburg Monarchy (1848-49)]].\n\n===1848/1849 Revolutions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Szabadka_1.jpg|thumb|left|Subotica (Szabadka) in 1914 Hungarian postcard]]\nDuring the 1848-49 revolution, the proclaimed borders of autonomous [[Serbian Vojvodina]] included Subotica, but Serb troops could not establish control in the region. On 5 March 1849, at the locality named Kaponja (between Tavankut and Bajmok), there was a battle between the Serb and Hungarian armies, which was won by the Hungarians.\n\nThe first newspaper in the town was also published during the 1848/49 revolution\u2014it was called ''Honunk \u00e1llapota'' (\"State of Our Homeland\") and was published in Hungarian by K\u00e1roly Bitterman's local printing company. Unlike most Serbs and Croats who confronted the Hungarians, part of the local Bunjevci people supported the Hungarian revolution.\n\nIn 1849, after the [[Hungarian revolution of 1848]] was defeated by the Russian and Habsburg armies, the town was separated from the Kingdom of Hungary together with most of the Ba\u010dka region, and became part of a separate Habsburg province, called [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. The administrative centre of this new province was [[Timi\u0219oara]]. The province existed until 1860. During the existence of the voivodeship, in 1853, Subotica acquired its impressive theatre.\n\n===Hungarian administration===\nAfter the establishment of the [[Ausgleich|Dual-Monarchy]] in 1867, there followed what is often called the \"golden age\" of city development of Subotica. Many schools were opened after 1867 and in 1869 the railway connected the city to the world. In 1896 an electrical power plant was built, further enhancing the development of the city and the whole region. Subotica now adorned itself with its remarkable Central European, [[fin de si\u00e8cle]] architecture. In 1902 a Jewish synagogue was built in the [[Art Nouveau]] style.\n\nBetween 1849 and 1860 it was part of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=58589|title=Subotica {{!}} Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n\n===Yugoslavia and Serbia===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Le\u0161evi na Sen\u0107anskom putu.jpg|left|thumb|Hungarian occupation troops massacred [[Serbia]]n and [[Jews|Jewish]] civilians during the occupation (1941-1944)]]\nSubotica was part of [[Austria-Hungary]] until the aftermath of [[World War I]] in 1918, when the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. In changed economic and political circumstances, Subotica was now a border-town in [[Yugoslavia]] and did not, for a time, experience again the dynamic prosperity it enjoyed in the years preceding World War I. However, at that time, Subotica was the third largest city in Yugoslavia by population, following [[Belgrade]] and [[Zagreb]].\n\nIn 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and partitioned by the [[Axis Powers]], and its northern parts, including Subotica, were [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|annexed by Hungary]] (This partition of Yugoslavia was not recognized by the international community and city was, from the legal point of view, still part of Yugoslavia, whose only legal representative was the Yugoslav government in exile). Hungarian troops entered Subotica on 11 April 1941.\n\nAs the majority of people living in the city were ethnic Hungarians and the city had been part of Hungary for over 600 years, Hungary felt it had to protect its people now living outside of its borders. During [[World War II]] the city lost approximately 7,000 of its citizens, mostly Serbs, Hungarians and Jews. Before the war about 6,000 [[Jews]] lived in Subotica; many of these were deported from the city during the [[Holocaust]], mostly to [[Auschwitz]].\n\nIn April 1944, a ghetto was set up. In addition, many [[communists]] were put to death during Axis rule. In 1944, the Axis forces left the city, and Subotica became part of the new [[Yugoslavia]]. During the 1944\u201345 period, about 8,000 citizens (mainly Hungarian) were killed by [[Yugoslav partisans|Partisans]] while re-taking the city as retribution for supporting Axis Hungary.<ref>M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros S\u00e1ndor: Holtt\u00e1 nyilv\u00e1n\u00edtva - D\u00e9lvid\u00e9ki magyar f\u00e1tum 1944\u201345, I-II, Hatodik S\u00edp Alap\u00edtv\u00e1ny, Budapest 1995.</ref><ref>Cseres Tibor: V\u00e9rbossz\u00fa B\u00e1csk\u00e1ban, Magvet\u0151 kiad\u00f3, Budapest 1991.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n\nIn the post-war period, Subotica has gradually been modernised. During the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav]] and [[Kosovo war|Kosovo]] wars of the 1990s, a considerable number of Serb refugees came to the city from [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Kosovo]], while many ethnic Hungarians and Croats, as well as some local Serbs, left the region due to economical stagnation and fear of racism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Folk_Theater_Subotica_Serbia.JPG|thumb|right|[[National Theatre in Subotica]]]]\n[[File:Subotica02.jpg|thumb|right|Municipal Library]]\n[[File:Pa\u0142ac Rajhla (Galeria Sztuki Wsp\u00f3\u0142czesnej) w Suboticy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Reichel Palace]]]]\n[[File:Suboticka arhitektura.jpg|thumb|right|Secession architecture in downtown]]\nUnique in Serbia, Subotica has the most buildings built in the art nouveau style.

The Subotica area has the highest concentration of Catholics in Serbia. 57% of the city's population are Catholic. There are eight Catholic parish churches, a [[Franciscan]] spiritual centre (the city has communities of both Franciscan friars and Franciscan nuns), a female [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] community, and two congregations of [[Augustinian]] religious sisters. The diocese of Subotica has the only Catholic secondary school in Serbia (Paulinum).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nWhen the nuns' orphanage and children's home in [[Blato, Kor\u010dula]] (present-day [[Croatia]]) had exhausted the food and funds needed for helping poor and hungry children, [[Marija Petkovi\u0107]] (later known as Blessed Mary of Jesus Crucified Petkovi\u0107), went to \n[[Ba\u010dka]], whose apostolic seat is Subotica, to solicit help for orphans and widows.

There are two [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] church buildings in the city. Orthodox Christians in Subotica belong to the [[Eparchy of Ba\u010dka]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. Subotica has two [[Protestant]] churches as well, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]. The [[Jewish]] community of Subotica is the third largest in Serbia, after those in [[Belgrade]] and [[Novi Sad]]. About 1000 (of the 6,000 pre-WWII Jews of Subotica) survived the Holocaust. According to the 2011 census, fewer than 90 Jews remained in Subotica as of 2011.<ref name=\"pod2.stat.gov.rs\"/>\n[[File:Sinagoga_u_Subotici,_Srbija,_010.JPG|thumb|[[Subotica Synagogue]]]]\n[[File:Katedrala Svete Tereze Avilske - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Saint Teresa of Avila]]]]\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Toranj gradske ku\u0107e - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|City hall]]\n{{Main|List of mayors of Subotica}}\nResults of 2016 local elections in Subotica municipality:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srbijaizbori.com/article/sns-osvojio-najvi%C5%A1e-glasova-u-subotici|title=SNS osvojio najvi\u0161e glasova u Subotici - Srbija izbori 2018|website=www.srbijaizbori.com}}</ref>\n*[[Serbian Progressive Party|SNS coalition]]: 35.6%\n*[[Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians]]: 15%\n*Movement for Civic Subotica: 12.9%\n*[[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]]: 8.5%\n*[[League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina]]: 5.7%\n\nAfter the elections, a coalition led by [[Serbian Progressive Party]] and [[Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians]]  formed the local municipal government.

Due to the surrounding farmlands Subotica has famous food producer industries in the country, including such brands as the confectionery factory \"Pionir\", \"Fidelinka\" the cereal manufacturer, \"[[Mlekara Subotica]]\" a milk producer and \"Simex\" producer of strong alcohol drinks.\n\nThere are a number of old socialistic industries that survived the transition period in Serbia. The biggest one is the chemical fertilizer factory \"Azotara\" and the rail wagon factory \"Bratstvo\". Currently the biggest export industry in town is the \"[[Siemens]] Subotica\" wind generators factory and it is the biggest brownfield investment so far. The other big companies in Subotica are: Fornetti, ATB Sever and Masterplast. More recent companies to come to Subotica include Dunkermotoren and NORMA Group. Tourism is important. In the past few years, Pali\u0107 has been famous for the [[Pali\u0107 Film Festival]]. Subotica is a festival city, hosting more than 17 festivals over the year. {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nAs of September 2017, Subotica has one of 14 [[free economic zone]]s established in Serbia.<ref name=\"srbeconomiczone2017\">{{cite news |last1=Mikavica |first1=A. |title=Slobodne zone mamac za investitore |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/388105/Slobodne-zone-mamac-za-investitore |accessdate=17 March 2019 |work=politika.rs |date=3 September 2017 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats18\">{{cite web|title=MUNICIPALITIES AND REGIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA, 2019.|url=https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2019/PdfE/G201913046.pdf|website=stat.gov.rs|publisher=[[Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia]]|date=25 December 2019|accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

It runs alongside the Budapest\u2013Belgrade railway, which connects it to major European cities.\n\nThe city used to have a tram system, the [[Subotica tram system]], but it was discontinued in 1974. The Subotica tram, put into operation in 1897, ran on electricity from the start. While neighbouring cities' trams at this date were often still horse-drawn, this gave the Subotica system an advantage over other municipalities including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Zagreb, and Szeged. Its existence was important for the citizens of Subotica, as well as tourists who came to visit.\nSubotica has since developed a bus system. The Subotica buses transport people via nine city, six suburban, and ten interurban, as well as two international lines of bus operations. Per year the buses travel some 4.7 million kilometres, and carry about ten million people.\n\nThe city is served by [[Subotica Airport]]; its runway is too short for airliners, limiting usage to mostly recreational aviation. Southwest of the city there is a 218.5 metres tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting. It is the tallest of its kind in Serbia and one of the tallest in the region.\n\n==Famous citizens==\n*[[Branimir Aleksi\u0107]], football player and member of the [[Serbia national football team]]\n*[[Sava Babi\u0107]] (born 1934), writer, translator and university professor\n*[[G\u00e9za Cs\u00e1th]] (1887\u20131919), a tragic physician-writer\n*[[Gyula Cseszneky]] (born 1914), Hungarian, poet, voivode\n*[[Sreten Damjanovi\u0107]] (born 1946), wrestler\n*[[Oliver Duli\u0107]] (born 1975), politician\n*[[Vlatko Duli\u0107]] (born 1943), actor\n*[[Yehuda Elkana]], born 1934.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Alfred Wallace (\"Alf\") was the managing editor at Odhams, and Albert Cosser (\"Cos\") was the editor directly responsible for ''Smash''.<ref name=\"Career history of artist Ken Reid\">[http://www.fudge-the-elf.com/downloads/kenreid.doc Career history of artist Ken Reid] at DC Thomson and Odhams</ref><ref>Bart was the nickname of ''Eagle's'' Big Bartholemew</ref> Major changes of editorial policy occurred in 1969 for financial reasons, and again in 1970 when IPC was taken over by [[Albert Edwin Reed|Albert E Reed]] to form the publishing giant [[Reed Elsevier|Reed International]].<ref>[http://ketupa.net/elsevier2.htm Reed-Elsevier Group history] on Reed-Elsevier website</ref>\n\nLaunched on 5 February 1966, ''Smash'' became a Power Comic from December of that year with issue 44. The ''Power Comics'' logo, printed on the cover of each issue, was a gimmick dreamed up by Odhams to unify their five titles under a common banner. ''Smash'' remained part of that lineup for 100 issues; the logo was quietly dropped after #143 when the last of the other comics forming part of the lineup was cancelled (so that there was no longer a group of titles needing to be unified).\n\nThe other Power Comics were all ultimately absorbed into ''Smash'', which became the last survivor. On 14 September 1968, with issue 137, it merged with ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow''. On 2 November 1968, with issue&nbsp;144, it merged with ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic''.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=3 Covers Gallery for 1968] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' ceased to be published by Odhams Press Ltd, and was thereafter published by IPC Magazines Ltd (an IPC subsidiary formed during 1968). On 15 March 1969 it was relaunched without its American superhero strips. Further changes followed during the course of 1969, and then a 2nd relaunch at the start of 1970. The final issue was published on 3 April 1971.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=6 ''Smash!''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> It was then merged into ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', forming ''Valiant and Smash''.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/52861/ ''Valiant and Smash!''] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\nIn addition, ten ''Smash!''

Holiday Special in 1971.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1966, a companion to ''Wham!'' was conceived within the minds of Alf Wallace (Managing Editor of Odhams' juveniles \u2014 ''Eagle'', ''Swift'' and ''Boy's World'') and Albert Cosser.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984\">Interview with Leo Baxendale in ''British Comic World'', Issue #3 (June 1984)</ref> Leo Baxendale, who had created ''Wham!'' in 1964, was too heavily embroiled with on-going production on it, providing much of the art for each issue, so that he had little time for anything else. And he was then still working at long range from Dundee.<ref>DC Thompson Ltd, Baxendale's former employers, were based in Dundee, Scotland</ref>\n\nAccordingly, it was Alf Wallace and Albert Cosser (soon to be known to their young audience as Alf and Cos) who determined the original format of ''Smash!''. They also recruited the artists who would draw the early issues, since it was plain that Baxendale was fully occupied with the art for ''Wham!''. Baxendale's initial contribution to ''Smash'' was thus limited to providing a list of titles and situations for the humour strips, together with brief written scenarios (script ideas for the individual weekly issues), which he gave to Wallace to be farmed-out to other artists. ''The Swots and The Blots'' was one of these.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\">''British Comic World'', Issue #3 (June 1984),p.4-5</ref>\n\nBaxendale was asked only to create the ''Bad Penny'' strip, and to transfer ''Grimly Feendish'' (a character from his ''Eagle Eye, Junior Spy'' strip running in ''Wham!''), thereby giving ''Feendish'' a strip of his own. Wallace also had him draw the covers for the first three issues.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\"/>\n\n''Smash'' launched with the same format as the early issues of ''Wham'', namely 24 pages per issue, four of which were in colour, but printed on lower-quality paper than ''Wham''.\n\nThe initial line-up of strips mixed humour and adventure freely, with the comedic ''Ronnie Rich'' featuring on the cover of the first issue, inside which were adventure strips including the World War Two based ''Ghost Patrol'' \u2014 this latter a reprint strip, which lasted only until issue 25. ''Ghost Patrol'' proved symptomatic of the problem with adventure strips which plagued ''Smash'' during the Odhams years, which tended to be ''sloppy in presentation and possessed of little real character or emotion''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.6</ref>\n\nThe root of the problem was that ''Smash'' went through many changes in its early days \u2014 far too many. Particularly in its adventure strips: ''The Ghost Patrol'' came and went; ''The Legend Testers'' came and went; ''Moon Madness'' was particularly short-lived; and there were numerous others, equally forgettable. None proved popular enough to last.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref>\n\nThose readers old enough to have become emotionally attached to comics before Odhams introduced American superhero strips to their British readers tended to dislike those superhero strips.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984\"/> Whereas, according to the letters pages each week, those same Marvel and DC heroes were enormously popular among the younger age group, which had not been reading comics previously. Accordingly, ''Wham'' readers tended to resent the changes made in 1966, because British strips were cancelled in ''Wham'' and replaced with US superheroes, whereas ''Smash'' readers did not resent the superheroes, because in 1966 that comic had only just launched, so there were no real changes \u2014 ''Smash'' more or less teemed with American strips from the very beginning.\n\n==Odhams Years==\n===Superheroes===\nBlack-and-white reprints of [[Marvel Comics]] strips<ref>All the Marvel stories were written by Stan Lee</ref> were introduced into ''Smash'' with issue&nbsp;16, when the ''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' began.<ref>Issue 16 saw the first appearance of Marvel's ''[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=1 Incredible Hulk]'' strip, drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html|title=BLIMEY!

In July&nbsp;1967 ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''<ref>Drawn at various times by Bill Everett, Wally Wood and Gene Colan</ref> replaced the Hulk, from issue&nbsp;76 onwards \u2014 ''Smash'' having exhausted all Hulk stories, from all sources, which had been published in the USA up to that time.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the significance of the introduction of ''The Hulk'', in the issue dated 21 May 1966. It was the first ''Marvel Comics'' strip featured by Odhams, the success of which led to the introduction of ''Fantastic Four'' into ''Wham'' on 6 August of that year, and to the launching of two entire comics entirely dedicated to Marvel superheroes \u2014 ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' \u2014 in 1967. The Hulk's initial appearance in ''Smash'' took up a massive 6 pages, one-quarter of each 24 page issue, pushing fully five existing strips out of that issue, and causing the permanent cancellation of \"Space Jinx\" and \"Brian's Brain\" (although the latter would be revived much later).<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.11</ref>\n\nPrior to this, [[DC Comics|DC]]'s ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]]'' had become the second American superhero to debut in ''Smash'', crashing onto the front cover of issue&nbsp;20 a month after the Hulk's debut, in re-edited reprints from American daily and Sunday newspaper strips: these were credited in-page to ''Batman'' creator Bob Kane, but were actually drawn by [[Al Plastino]] and ghost-written by [[Whitney Ellsworth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/issue/368494/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Smash! #75|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> This was a response to the sudden and enormous popularity of the ''Batman'' television series starring Adam West. The impact of this hit TV show led to the ''Batman'' strip retaining the front cover of ''Smash'', in colour, for better than a year and a half, entitled ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder''.\n\nInitially, this syndicated newspaper strip adopted the camp style of the Adam West television series, with appearances by humorous guest stars such as American funnyman [[Jack Benny]]. In the later part of the run (which featured serious, rather than camp, stories) Batgirl, too, appeared in the strip, a response to her addition to the TV show in its 3rd season: in the newspaper strip, Batman initially believed her to be a criminal rather than a crime fighter. Superman then co-starred in the strip, which was retitled ''Superman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'', as Batman and Robin attempt to save Superman from the diabolical Professor Zinkk who was secretly poisoning him with kryptonite.\n\nThe expansion of the American content, with the arrival of ''Batman'', meant the loss of two more of the initial British strips: the adventure strip ''The Ghost Patrol'', and the cartoon strip ''The Tellybugs''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\"/>\n\nIn September 1968 the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' began a six-month run in ''Smash'', when it absorbed ''Pow'' (which had previously merged with ''Wham'', in which the strip had initially featured). As one of only a handful of ''Pow'' strips to survive the merger, it was used to lure ''Pow'' readers to the new comic. The strip was introduced to readers of ''Smash'' with the wedding of Reed and Sue from ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Their adventures continued with ''Defeated by the Frightful Four'', and ran through to ''Lo There Shall Be an Ending'', which was the final Marvel strip to appear in ''Smash''.\n\n''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' began a short run in November 1968 when ''Smash'' absorbed ''Fantastic''. The stories, continued from ''Fantastic'', began with ''The Ringmaster's Circus of Crime''. When the Marvel strips were discontinued the following spring, the final ''Thor'' reprint had a new ending substituted, in a rushed attempt to resolve a continuing sub-plot.\n\nThe financial crisis which overtook Odhams in 1968, resulting in the closure of all the other ''Power Comics'', also caused them to give up the expensive licence to reprint the Marvel superhero stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvuk.htm|title=Marvel UK|website=www.internationalhero.co.uk}}</ref> This decision took effect in March&nbsp;1969, when the licence came up for renewal; the final Marvel strips appeared in issue&nbsp;162. The expensive ''Batman'' newspaper strip had already been discontinued, ending in issue&nbsp;157.\n\n===Odhams Humour Strips===\nThere were typically a dozen British humour strips in each of the first 162 issues.\n\nThe initial line-up starred ''The Man From B.U.N.G.L.E.'', which usually occupied the front cover prior to issue&nbsp;20,<ref>''Smash'': [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html The first 20 covers]</ref> supported by seven other long-running humour strips (''Charlie's Choice'',<ref name=\"Brian Lewis\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Brian Lewis]</ref> ''Bad Penny'',<ref name=\"Leo Baxendale\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Leo Baxendale]</ref> ''Percy's Pets'',<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> ''The Nervs'',<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html|title=BLIMEY!

It is unclear why Alf and Cos chose this deeply unfunny strip for what must have been considered the pride of place in the new comic. ''Space Jinx'' was primarily another ''Jonah'' (a strip by Ken Reid which had run in ''The Beano''), except that it could not hold its own against the brilliance of Reid's sea-faring twit. Where ''Jonah'' dealt with sinking ships of the sea, Brian Lewis's ''Space Jinx'' dealt with similar situations in outer space, but (in practice) without the necessary degree of humour.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.7</ref>\n\nKen Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' would last only slightly longer, at 43 issues. A masterpiece of comic artistry, telling the story of the ''Buoyant Queen'' and its two-man crew, Enoch and Bert, a pair of oafs with a love/hate relationship (mostly hate!), it was perhaps too intelligent for its target audience \u2014 its disappearance was a great loss to the comic.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> Many readers failed to understand, amongst many things in the strip that went clear over their heads, that the two main characters were drawn in the likeness of comedians [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], and that the strip's humour was based on the movies of Laurel & Hardy.\n\nAfter only five months \u2013 foreshadowing many, many reshuffles to come \u2013 ''Smash!'' underwent its first major overhaul: from issue&nbsp;20 the ''Batman'' newspaper strip took over the front cover, whilst ''Grimly Feendish'' lost the colour back cover to Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' (which shrank from its original two pages each week to only a single page \u2014 the loss of the extra page was a drawback, but was compensated for by the strip now having a more prestigious location in the comic, and of course by now being in colour).\n\nFurther cover changes would follow. When, after two years, the popularity of the ''Batman'' television series eventually faded, from issue&nbsp;114 onward Batman and Robin were moved to the inside pages, yielding the front cover to the long-running success ''The Swots and the Blots'', at this point still being drawn by Mike Lacey, a humour strip in which two rival gangs vied to outwit each other at Pond Road School, with \"Teach\" caught in the crossfire. Its origins lay in Baxendale's classroom-based strip ''The Tiddlers'', which had then been running for 2 years in ''Wham''<ref>In fact it was a direct continuation of ''[https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/wham/ The Tiddlers]'', with only a change of name. The characters (i.e. \"Teach\" and the Blots), school buildings, and situations, were all largely as they had been in ''The Tiddlers''. The only difference was the addition of the Swots, so that Teach now had an ally.</ref> (and which continued in ''Pow'' when ''Wham'' merged with it in 1968, where it was combined with ''The Dolls of St Dominics'' to become ''The Tiddlers and The Dolls'').\n\n''The Swots and the Blots'' was one of the few strips in ''Smash'' to survive all the changes of 1969 and 1970, reaching a new standard of excellence when [[Leo Baxendale]] began drawing it for the new-look ''Smash'' from March 1969, but even during the Odhams years it had wit and a sense of style. In Baxendale's hands it had notable similarities to his earlier classroom-based strip, ''The Bash Street Kids'', in ''[[The Beano]]''.<ref>Around 1968, Baxendale quit Odhams for the better paying ''Fleetway'' comics. One of the strips he produced there was ''[http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2017/07/leo-baxendales-big-chief-pow-wow.html Big Chief Pow Wow]'' for ''Buster''\u2014the strip ran from 14 September 1968 to 31 January 1970 (some issues were fill-ins by other artists).</ref>\n\n''The Man from BUNGLE'', spoofing the popular TV series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', was a spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye Junior Spy'' strip in ''Wham''. BUNGLE was a secret spy organisation in Britain, organised along more chaotic lines than UNCLE, featuring a secret agent who employed a wide variety of hugely unlikely gadgets in his fight against his humorous opponents. Baxendale himself drew the first few editions, which appeared as large single illustrations on some of the early covers of ''Smash'', after which Mike Lacey took over.\n\nThe second spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye'' strip was ''[[Grimly Feendish]]'' (subtitled ''The Rottenest Crook in the World''), which Leo Baxendale himself drew. Feendish had been the most popular character in the earlier strip, thanks to his ghoulish appearance, which was based on Uncle Fester in the American television series ''[[The Addams Family]]'' (and, presumably, on Charles Adams' illustrations from which the TV series was derived).<ref>Interestingly, the strip would probably have been ''banned'' if this had been an American comic, as the [[Comics Code Authority]] prohibited presentation of crime in comics if it tended to create sympathy for the criminal, and this strip appears to fall foul of that restriction.</ref> The new strip at one point occupied a prestigious position, as the full-colour back cover feature each week, and survived throughout the entire run of 162 issues published by Odhams (even though, after giving up its cover status, it was sometimes ignominiously reduced to only a quarter-page \"filler\").\n\n''Bad Penny'' was another memorable Baxendale creation. Its title logo featured a portrait of Penny herself, alongside the 'Bad Penny' caption, and an illustration of a giant pre-decimal One Penny coin (the coin suggesting the connection with the proverb from which the character's name originated).\n\nShe had some similarities with Baxendale's earlier Minnie the Minx character in ''The Beano''. When he had been drawing Minnie, he had concentrated on experimenting with facial expressions and character traits. By the time he began working on ''Bad Penny'' his drawing style had matured, with an equal concentration on developing a zany but tight storyline, less emphasis on close-ups of facial expressions, but retaining the essentials needed to put over a character's own personality traits.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\"/>\n\nBad Penny was so popular that she survived the changes of 1969, and continued to appear in the new ''Smash''. When the strip was eventually dropped, in 1970, Bad Penny herself still continued to appear, albeit infrequently, making occasional appearances in Baxendale's ''The Swots and the Blots'' as a new member of the Blots.\n\nAs had happened in ''Wham'', artists such as Mike Lacey were commissioned from time to time to \"ghost\" Baxendale's style. Baxendale was allowed to sign his early work on ''Smash'', so there is a way to distinguish which strips he personally drew during his time at Odhams.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075207/http://26pigs.com/wham/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Wham!|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>In practice, Baxendale signed very few of his strips, so it is quite difficult to tell which are his and which are other artists substituting for him.</ref> After he transferred to Fleetway, another IPC subsidiary, he still contributed strips to ''Smash'', but now worked \"undercover\", i.e. without signing them. He explained this in his autobiography, ''A Very Funny Business'' (Duckworth, 1978, page&nbsp;91): \"I was in a delightful situation. Working under my own name, a lot was expected of me. Publishers ''expected'' me to cram my drawings with funny detail. A double standard operated. Working undercover, I was able to reduce the layouts to the simplest terms. Backgrounds were minimal or non-existent \u2014 just a horizon line. And there was no ancillary comic detail \u2014 just the characters acting out the story line against an empty backdrop.\"\n\nThe most bizarre of the Odhams humour strips was ''The Nervs'', depicting a group of little characters inhabiting a schoolboy called Fatty: the strip showed them running Fatty like a group of workers running a factory. Allocated two pages, it followed the same formula as the strip ''Georgie's Germs'' from ''Wham!''. Fatty was aptly named, with the tiny Nervs battling to save the fat twerp's stomach from its numerous overloads, as a minute never passed which was free from him guzzling!\n\nDrawn for the majority of its run by Graham Allen,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> in its final months during 1968-69 [[Ken Reid (comics artist)|Ken Reid]]<ref>Comics artist [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Ken%20Reid Ken Reid]</ref> \u2014 previously of ''Queen of the Seas'', and who had earlier contributed the ''Dare-a-Day Davy''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/dadd.htm|title=Ken Reid's Dare A Day Davy|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> strip to ''Pow'' \u2014 drew this double-page feature.\n\nReid's career had begun at ''The Beano'' in the 1950s, but for Odhams he had already produced the long running success ''Frankie Stein'', in ''Wham!'', before taking on ''Queen of the Seas'' in the early issues of ''Smash!'' and the  ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip in ''Pow!''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> He turned ''The Nervs'' into an extremely surreal, even visceral, strip; achieving a rare level of hilarity and bawdiness, in a subversive presentation of comical horror \u2014 and in the process alarming IPC's management !<ref name=\"Career history of artist Ken Reid\"/>\n\nHe already had some degree of notoriety, as being the only Odhams artist whose work so disturbed the management that it was actually banned.<ref>[http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/weird1.html Review] of the banned ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' Frankenstein strip</ref><ref>''Dare-A-Day Davy'' [http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/picts2.html Frankenstein strip], published in ''Weird Fantasy''&nbsp;#1 in 1969</ref> At the suggestion of Vance Gledhill of Blackpool, Davy was dared to dig up Frankenstein's monster (in the ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip) and bring him back to life \u2013 for which Reid decided to employ the \"kiss of life\"!

This was a device for featuring, as guest stars in the strip each week, an assortment of popular TV stars. The strip's debut appearance, for instance, featured Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, stars of top-rated secret agent show ''The Man From UNCLE'', maximising their appearance by splashing them across the front cover. It was hoped that by bringing popular television stars into its pages, this would make TV's growing popularity work ''for'' the comic \u2014 a not very subtle ploy to boost its circulation and sales.\n\n''Sammy Shrink'' (subtitled ''The Smallest Boy in the World'')<ref name=\"auto3\"/> was a humour strip about a boy who was only two inches tall. Sammy had the most successful \u2014 but also the most chequered \u2014 career of all the characters featured in ''Smash'', having originated in ''Wham'', then moved to ''Pow'' when they merged, arriving in ''Smash'' when it in turn absorbed ''Pow'', and would subsequently be revived in ''Knockout'', finally ending his career in ''Whizzer and Chips'' when it absorbed ''Knockout'' in June&nbsp;1973.\n\n''Ronnie Rich'' featured the richest kid in the world, who stands to inherit a fortune if only he can get rid of the money he's got. Drawn by Gordon Hogg,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> each week Ronnie spent his every last penny, in some reckless or extravagant way, only to have his scheme backfire and make him richer than ever. He never did get his hands on the fortune.\n\nOften a half-page feature, ''Percy's Pets'' drawn by Stan McMurtry (alias Mac)<ref>Comics artist [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1040731/Macs-secret-lady-Britains-cartoonist-reveals-hidden-images-wife.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> was popular enough to go on to make sporadic reappearances from time to time in the new ''Smash'' after March&nbsp;1969. Percy was a small plump schoolboy, who filled his family's home with his exotic collection of pets. These included (from time to time) an elephant, a giraffe, a hippopotamus, a snake, an ape \u2014 in fact almost every type of animal that might be found in a typical zoo \u2014 together with a parrot, a tortoise, a white mouse, and a hedgehog; thereby causing a predictable degree of comical chaos for his long suffering mum and dad.\n\nSome of the best-remembered strips were not included in all of the first 162 issues: a number of them were only acquired in #137, from the merger with ''Pow!'' (which had already absorbed the most popular strips running in ''Wham!'').\n\nOne such acquisition from ''Pow!'' was ''The Cloak''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/cloak.htm|title=Mike Higgs' The Cloak|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> \u2014 like ''The Man From BUNGLE'', another humorous secret agent strip. The Cloak was the top agent for Britain's Special Squad, nominally a part of Scotland Yard; but he usually operated from his personal headquarters, known as the Secret Sanctum. His ingenuity and never-ending supply of gadgets and secret weapons gave him the edge over his somewhat odd enemies (some were ''very'' odd, including Deathshead and various other agents of G.H.O.U.L.).\n\nHe had some equally odd colleagues. Assisted initially by Mole (the tall one with the bald head, big nose and specs) and Shortstuff (the short squirt with the hairy nut and big eyeballs), he then began having adventures in which he found himself also alongside the sexy and flirtatious Lady Shady, the shady lady. The strip benefited from the unusual, idiosyncratic drawing style of Mike Higgs, whose overt inclusion of pop culture imagery made the strip seem extremely modern.\n\n''Wiz War'', drawn by Mike Brown, had also begun in ''Pow!'', and would be one of a handful of strips to survive the changes of 1969. Brown seems to have been unaware of the house rule banning artists from signing their work, as the strip often bore his name. The \"War\" in the title referred to a feud between two wizards, Wizard Prang and his enemy Demon Druid. Being a humour strip, the editorial staff allowed the hero the very silly name of Wizard Prang, a piece of RAF slang from the Second World War.\n\nOther than the fact that Prang was robed entirely in white, befitting his status as the good guy, and Demon Druid was always in black, being the villain of the piece, their costumes were quite similar - a flowing wizard's robe with stars on, and a pointed hat. They would fly around on broomsticks, zapping each other with spells: which turned the other into a toad, or something equally amusing. Wizard Prang was alternately helped and hindered by Englebert, his pet bird. The best feature of the strip was the sign above Wizard Prang's front door. This usually read \"Wizard Prang is... In\" (if he was at home) or \"Wizard Prang is... Out\" (if he was out and about); but if he'd had a bad time in the story, the sign would often make a humorous remark in the final panel, such as \"Wizard Prang is... All At Sea\".\n\nThe secret of Mike Brown, unacknowledged for many years, was that Leo Baxendale needed to earn money from Odhams without disclosing to Fleetway that he was now working for both companies. Accordingly, Baxendale now pencilled the drawings, and Brown, who was a cartoon film animator, inked them in. In this way, they turned out together large numbers of ''Bad Penny'' and ''Grimly Feendish'' strips, which they sold to Odhams under Brown's name \u2014 a situation Baxendale referred to, in his 1978 autobiography, as working ''undercover''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984),p.10</ref>\n\nLost in the merger with ''Pow'' were ''Charlie's Choice'', ''Ronnie Rich'' and ''The Man From BUNGLE''. Also lost in this merger, in effect, was Ken Reid's ''Dare-A-Day Davey'' strip, one of several established features in ''Pow'' which were dropped instead of transferring to ''Smash''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.15</ref>\n\n===Odhams Adventure Strips===\n\nAs ''Smash'' was essentially a superhero and humour comic during the Odhams years, there were few traditional adventure strips in it; but a handful do bear special mention.\n\nThere were various well-remembered adventure strips in the first hundred issues, including some which were quite outstanding, such as ''Rubberman'', ''Experiment X'', ''The Legend Testers'', and ''The Python''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFrom issue 144 in November 1968 ''Smash'' was the only surviving ''Power Comic'', as this was the issue in which ''Smash and Pow'' (as it then was) merged with ''Fantastic''. Five British adventure serials were introduced in this issue, to plug the gap left by the loss of the withdrawn American superhero strips which had been major features of the four closed titles.\n\n''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' is an adventure strip in which a crime reporter on the Daily Globe newspaper is apparently killed while investigating a news story. The world believes newspaperman Jim Jordan is dead, but he still carries on his crusade against crime... calling himself The Spectre.\n\nHe is now fighting crime, rather than merely reporting it, using an array of gadgets which make it seem he is the ghost of the missing reporter. Hence his opponents are terrified to find that if they shoot him he doesn't die (a bullet-proof raincoat was the trick here). And he has a secret underground hideout beneath the statue erected in his memory, from which he would covertly and unexpectedly emerge, or disappear into, under cover of an artificial fog, to give the impression he was coming and going from the spirit world. His first case began in issue&nbsp;144, in which he tracks down Black Murdo, the racketeer who the world believes had murdered him.\n\n''Destination Danger'', a motor racing serial, also began in issue&nbsp;144. This strip was about a feud between a young English racing driver, Jeff Jackson, who was working for Puma Motors in the US, and his enemy Vic Stafford, the Puma team's chief driver, who has taken a bribe to throw a forthcoming race.\n\nAlthough new to ''Smash'', the old-fashioned artwork in the strips ''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' and ''Destination Danger'' marked them out as reprints. The use of reprints was a cost-cutting measure, indicating the straightened financial circumstances of ''Smash'' at this point \u2013 if any evidence were needed beyond the closure of all four of the other ''Power Comics''.\n\n''Laird of the Apes'' was a science fiction strip, milking the popularity of the big budget Charlton Heston motion picture ''Planet of the Apes'' which was released earlier that year. In the strip, set in the 18th century, a young Scottish laird returns to the Highlands to aid his outlaw clansmen in their struggle with the English Redcoats, bringing with him a band of highly trained Apes.\n\nAn adventure strip with a sporting theme was the wrestling serial ''King of the Ring'', featuring Ken King, who was a champion of the grunt-'n'-grapple game (although in the earliest strips he had begun as a boxer). As was not exactly uncommon in the Odhams years, there was a tendency to give the characters very silly names. The most outrageous example in this strip was King's manager, who (in spite of ''not'' being Irish) was called Blarney Stone!\n\nBlarney's real name was originally Tim Stone, and Blarney was only a nickname; but this was soon forgotten. In order to fulfil Ken's ambition to travel, Blarney agrees to manage him on a world tour, if he'll agree to fight his way round the world!\n\nThe fifth adventure strip added was ''Brian's Brain'', drawn by Bert Vandeput,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> a serial with science fiction elements, continued from ''Pow''. This featured two schoolboys: the eponymous Brian and his friend Duffy Rolls. Brian Kingsley possessed an electronic Brain resembling a human skull, which he carried about in a box. It could communicate with him telepathically, glowing when active; and it could control the actions of animals if they were within a few yards, which was the limit of its brain-wave transmissions.\n\nAll five strips commenced in issue&nbsp;144; and all were serials, with cliff-hanger endings each week.\n\n===The Closure of the ''Power Comics''===\nWhat must always be born in mind is that, in the comics industry, the 1960s were not the 1930s. With the advent in Britain of commercial television, in 1955 \u2014 displacing the staid, old-fashioned children's television offered by the BBC up to that point \u2014 the ever-increasing competition from the ''boob-tube'' began a continuous (and accelerating) decline in comics circulation. Throughout the 1960s, in consequence, the circulation wars fought in the comics publishing industry were fought out against a backdrop of ever-declining circulation figures.\n\nFollowing the initial success of ''Wham'' in 1964, Odhams had launched four more [[Power Comics]] during 1966 and '67, including ''Smash'', only to close them in quick succession: merging each in turn into the survivors until by 1969 only ''Smash'' remained. Whereas 1968 began with all five ''Power Comics'' apparently flourishing, by the year's end only ''Smash'' was still being published.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\"/> Even the sleepiest of readers began to notice that something was seriously wrong, as the increasingly frantic series of mergers resulted in ever more ludicrous titles, culminating in the astonishing ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic'' (commonly spoofed as ''Smash, Pow, Wham, incorporating Fantastic and Terrific'').\n\nThe question is why, in a limited market such as the UK, they took such a big risk as to launch five titles (which in hindsight looks an unwise decision by the Odhams management), if it was so quickly obvious that the market could only support one? It has been suggested<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> that it was common practice for a publisher to quickly clone a successful title, in order to forestall its competitors from doing so. That does not seem to be the case here. The comic's only distinctive feature was its American superhero strips, so ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' (which most of the time contained ''only'' Marvel superhero strips) might loosely be described as clones of ''Smash'', even though they lacked any humour strips; but IPC had an ''exclusive'' licence from Marvel Comics to reprint Marvel's strips in the UK, which precluded anyone else from doing so.\n\nThe actual answer lies in the unexpected nature of the economic crisis of 1968 that hit the British economy, resulting in the devaluation of the Pound.<ref>In Britain, the devaluation crisis was major news due to certain ill-judged remarks by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who would be mocked for the rest of his career for his infamous falsehood, ''This will not affect the Pound in your pocket!''</ref> The economic chaos began with a Sterling crisis in Britain in 1967, leading to devaluation in the November. There then followed a crisis for the U.S. dollar in March&nbsp;1968 which had a cascade effect on the international economic system, sending first the French franc and then the West German deutschmark into devaluation, and culminating in a ''new'' Sterling crisis in Britain in November&nbsp;1968.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2170396 ''The Economic Crisis of 1968''] \u2013 published in ''American Historical Review''</ref><ref>Article, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/dec2005/mccar-d30.shtml ''Eugene McCarthy \u2013 pivotal role in 1968 Political Crisis'']</ref>\n\nThese repeated falls in the value of the Pound against the U.S. dollar significantly increased the cost of publishing the American strips, which had to be paid for in dollars, and raised the daunting spectre of further increases if the Pound fell in value yet again. Increasing the cover price of the ''Power Comics'' to compensate was impossible because of stiff competition (with sales on a sharp downward spiral, as circulation fell victim to the ever increasing popularity of television); so the fall in the value of Sterling made the American strips unaffordable.\n\nThe toughness of the competition is apparent from examining other contemporary titles.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/ British Comics] website</ref> The first issue of its stablemate ''Fantastic'', published in February 1967, cost 9d for 40 pages (due to its very high content of American superhero strips), a cover price which forced ''Fantastic'' to close within 18 months. ''Terrific'', having the same high content of American material, also had a high cover price of 9d, and closed even quicker.\n\nIn contrast, the comics ''Dandy'' and ''Beano'' published by the rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] organisation sold at a cover price of 3d. ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' cost three times as much, which (even with double the number of pages compared to many DC Thomson titles) proved unsustainable. This is not surprising, given that ''Wham'' and ''Pow'' each peaked at a cover price of 7d, and even that proved unsustainable.\n\n''Smash'' had launched in February&nbsp;1966 with a cover price of 7d for 24&nbsp;pages. By March&nbsp;1969, although its cover price had not changed, circumstances had conspired to increase its page count, such that each issue now contained 36&nbsp;pages. In fact the page count jumped overnight from 24 pages to 36 pages (a fifty percent increase), with a consequent sharp rise in production costs, and so a marked decline in profit-per-copy.\n\nThe tipping point was issue 144, in which ''Smash'', ''Pow'' and ''Fantastic'' were merged into a single title. The recently created ''Smash and Pow'' lost its ''Daredevil'' and ''Spider-Man'' strips, which together had comprised a full third of each 24 page issue, but now had to accommodate both ''Thor'' and ''Fantastic Four'' from the discontinued titles, plus a whole slew of new British adventure strips (which were being added in preparation for the comic's impending transition to solely-British content).\n\nAll this could not be achieved within the standard ''Smash'' format of 24 pages. So IPC now \"bit the bullet\" and increased the page count, at a single bound, by fifty percent \u2014 a necessity if they were to achieve their intention of reproducing with ''Smash'' the successful formula which was buoying-up sales of their most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant'', both of which were 36-pagers (in effect, to produce another clone of them: an identical mix of adventure and humour, with an identical page count, at an identical price).\n\nOne fundamental difficulty for the ''Power Comics'', however, was always the stark economic truth that a kid could buy both ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'', at 3d each, and still have change left over, for what it cost to buy ''Smash!'', ''Wham!'' or ''Pow!'' at 7d each. However, the DC Thomson titles only had 16 pages, and this more than anything drove up the page count in ''Smash!'', from its original 24 pages to 36 pages, and eventually to 40 pages in 1970 (i.e. it might be more than double the price of a DC Thomson title but it was also more than double the size).<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.9</ref> The difficulty was that the much lower price of ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'' gave those titles a significant advantage, since a kid could choose to buy only one of them, at 3d \u2014 a winning competitive advantage which, as of 1966, would keep both of the DC Thomson titles afloat for more than 30 years to come.\n\nThe highly competitive nature of the UK's publishing industry meant margins were thin: a minimum number of sales each week were needed to reach break-even point, and the lower the cover price, the greater was the number of sales needed to reach that point; but the higher the cover price, the fewer were the number of sales that could actually be achieved.\n\nThe juvenile readers (or their parents) might be able to afford two or three comics a week, but by publishing five ''Power Comics'' IPC were pricing themselves out of the market. For the situation in Britain was not like that in America, where, with comics published just once a month, a child might afford five titles. In Britain, comics were published weekly.\n\nUnder those conditions the ''Power Comics'' were effectively competing with each other \u2014 a factor IPC were certainly aware of, as the letters pages in ''Smash'', in 1968, actually carried readers' complaints that they couldn't afford all five ''Power'' titles. The five together cost an astonishing three shillings and threpence a week (39d), to buy them all, far beyond the reach of the average child's weekly pocket money.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.13</ref>\n\nThe ''Power Comics'' were also competing with IPC's other titles, including [[Lion (comics)|Lion]], [[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]] and [[Buster (comics)|Buster]], potentially dragging the Group's entire line into bankruptcy. Rationalisation, by closing some of the titles, would produce an overall benefit, as it would dramatically cut IPC's production costs. Although it would mean fewer titles, as IPC's comics were actually competing against each other it ought to result in better sales for the survivors. In theory, there would be no overall loss of sales or revenue, provided readers switched from the closing titles to surviving IPC ones (rather than to rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] ones).\n\nAnother factor Odhams had not anticipated was the distribution of American comic books within the UK. Although this had always been a consideration, the volume of such comics arriving in Britain had traditionally been small, and their distribution haphazard. In 1968, distribution and quantity suddenly underwent a marked improvement: in America, Marvel Comics' owner, Martin Goodman, pulled off a business coup that overnight freed Marvel from a restrictive distribution agreement, which for a decade had limited it to publishing only 8 titles a month: Marvel was suddenly quadrupeling its monthly output, and dozens of new titles were flooding into Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emagazinepdf.com/2017/05/marvel_comics_-_the_untold_story/|title=''Marvel Comics \u2014 The Untold Story'', Sean Howe (2012)}}</ref> Odhams' black-and-white [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] reprints in their ''Power Comics'' range suddenly faced much more extensive competition from four-colour Marvel originals, and this began to harm sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/03/40-year-flashback-smash-regenerates.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: 40 Year Flashback: SMASH! regenerates|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the turbulent economic conditions, any part of IPC's business which was loss-making had no future. Standard industry practice was to close a comic or magazine if its revenues dipped ''towards'' the break-even point; publishers did not wait for a title to actually incur losses.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> Hence, merely to anticipate losses on the other four titles (''Pow'', ''Wham'', ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'') was enough to doom them. And the closures represented a major cost-cutting exercise, reducing the ongoing production costs on the ''Power Comics'' line by four-fifths.\n\nAs for actual losses incurred due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the problem, and the inability to quickly terminate the long-term contracts with the Americans, ''Smash'' as sole survivor couldn't hope to generate enough income on its own to meet these. In fact it didn't need to. The fortunate circumstance that the ''Power Comics'' were all published by Odhams Press Ltd, a subsidiary company with limited liability, meant that it was possible to ring-fence all debts on the Odhams publications within that one company, thus preventing any losses affecting the rest of the IPC Group (since IPC's other titles were all published by other IPC subsidiaries). Accordingly, with effect from 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' was transferred to IPC Magazines Ltd, a new IPC subsidiary formed during 1968,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/publisher/1946/|title=GCD :: Publisher :: IPC|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> leaving Odhams with no continuing titles, and ''Smash'' started again from scratch.<ref>[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?disp=1&frfsh=1414205283&#result Odhams Press Ltd] continued in being until 7 January 1998, when it changed its name to Formpart (No.11) Limited, which still exists today; currently a dormant private company.</ref>\n\nDespite being the longest survivor, and inheriting many popular strips from the other four titles, ''Smash'' was only a limited success. It was plainly on shakey ground: for, hard on the heels of the closure of the other titles, in the spring of 1969 IPC quickly made extensive changes to it, dropping the last remaining Marvel superhero strips, to shed the expense of the licensing fee for using them (having already dropped ''Batman''), and ending many other strips too.\n\nIn consequence of the decision to discontinue the American reprints, as each ''Power Comic'' closed its superhero strips were given up. Only in the case of ''Fantastic'', where the existing contract with Marvel had some months to run, were those strips transferred to its replacement, the merged ''Smash incorporating Fantastic'', until the contract expired in March&nbsp;1969.\n\n''Smash'' then introduced a new cover feature, new strips, and free gifts. In all but name it was a new comic. Even so, it required yet another major shakeup 12 months later, in the spring of 1970, when further changes of editorial policy were imposed by new owners Reed International, who had bought out IPC that year. This resulted, among other things, in the dropping of the newly introduced ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature in favour of a new lead serial: an adventure series entitled ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test''.\n\nWithin the British market, boys' comics for the age group which was too old for titles such as ''Beano'', ''Dandy'' and ''Sparky'' tended to focus around adventure, sport and war (in titles such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''), or humour (in titles such as ''Buster''). In abandoning its superheroes, ''Smash'' sought to attract readers of both types, by offering traditional adventure as well as humour.\n\nTo place these changes in context, the ''Power Comics'' were not the only casualties of the turmoil at IPC in 1969. Hulton's long-running adventure comic ''Eagle'' was also cancelled, merging with Fleetway's ''Lion'' from 2 May 1969. The merged comic was known briefly as ''Lion and Eagle'', but quickly reverted simply to ''Lion''. The humour comic, ''Giggle'', aimed at the slightly younger market dominated by Fleetway's ''Buster'', was also dropped, being merged into ''Buster'' in the spring of 1969 to form ''Buster and Giggle''. As ever, the name change lasted only long enough to absorb the discontinued comic's readership: the reference to ''Giggle'' failed to see out the year, and by December the title had reverted to simply ''Buster'' once more.<ref>''Buster'' [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/ cover gallery] at Wordpress.com</ref> And ''Buster'', like ''Smash'', also now became a publication of the Group's newest subsidiary, IPC Magazines Ltd.\n\nThe surviving titles at both Odhams and at Fleetway were now transferred to a merged operation, at New Year 1969, as merely a part of IPC's newest division, IPC Magazines Ltd, and were placed under the responsibility of Jack Legrand, formerly the Managing Editor of Fleetway's juvenile publications.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.17</ref>\n\nA notable feature of the Odhams years was how few advertisements the comic carried. There were occasional quarter-page inserts, mainly advertising foreign Postage Stamps for stamp collectors, or Subbuteo table-football; but they were few and far between, and their combined total didn't usually exceed one page per issue. Reflecting its financial problems, the relaunched comic under IPC Magazines carried a significantly greater amount of advertising. One obvious change was the back cover (the only in-colour page apart from the front cover), which gradually began to carry colourful full-page advertisements. On the inside pages, too, there was a much more noticeable quantity of adverts: each issue typically carried 4 full-page ads, plus two half-page ads. It was a noticeable feature of the relaunch that the comic now expanded to 40 pages, in order to cope with the need to carry an extra 4 pages of advertising in each issue.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ British Comics] website</ref>\n\nThis was a potentially significant new strategy, and a major change of policy. No longer did the profitability of the comic rest exclusively with the income derived from its sales figures. That sales income was now supplemented by advertising revenue, and without even having to sacrifice any significant amount of page space, nor cancel any strips, thanks to adding the additional pages.\n\n===Turmoil in 1967===\nThe events of 1968 were not even the first threat to the survival of the ''Power Comics''. Odhams had faced their first serious crisis in May 1967.\nThe editorial page warned readers in issue 68 that ''Smash'', initially printed by St Clements Press Ltd of London, had to find new printers within one month, or face closure. In the event, Odhams were able to sign a contract with Southernprint Ltd of Poole in Dorset in time to maintain publication.\n\n==''SMASH'' after Odhams==\n\nIn January 1969 Odhams ceased to exist as a publishing imprint, and ''Smash'' now became an IPC Magazines publication. Most of the consequences of the change didn't become apparent until the issue cover-dated 15 March, in which the comic changed dramatically. IPC had waited three months to relaunch ''Smash'', because, on the one hand, it needed some lead-time in which to ready new strips, and, on the other, in the publishing industry Spring was traditionally considered a good time to launch a new (in this case, a virtually new) comic.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/>\n\nWith the re-launch, ''Smash'' became the last ever British comic to feature a variety mix of adventure, humour and sports themed stories. Subsequent boys' comics featured exclusively sports, or war, or humour; such as ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher and Score]]'' and ''[[Shoot (football magazine)|Shoot]]'' (which featured only soccer), and ''[[Action (comics)|Action]]'' and ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' (which featured only war stories).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075250/http://26pigs.com/smash/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Smash|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>  A hallmark of this policy was to be the even-handedness with which the editorial staff drew the multitude of reprint strips featured in the new ''Smash'' from both ''Lion'' and ''Buster'', in seeking to appeal to readers of both (i.e. mixing serious and humorous strips without discrimination).\n\nThe symbol of the change was the new cover feature, ''Warriors of the World''. This now replaced ''The Swots and Blots'', who, drawn by Mike Lacey, had occupied the cover during the final part of the Odhams years. Happily, ''The Swots and the Blots'' survived (and prospered) on the inside pages, now drawn by Leo Baxendale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: Christmas comics: Valiant 1971|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=17 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the first relaunch issue (No.163) bearing a cover feature entitled ''Warriors of the World No.1'', the former numbering was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/25870/ Smash! - Title Notes] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> To have maintained the original sequential numbering alongside the ''Warriors of the World'' series could only have caused confusion.\n\nThe revamped ''Smash'', now comprising 40 pages, featured all-British strips \u2014 adventure serials, humour strips, and sporting strips \u2014 many of which were reprints from ''Lion'', such as ''Eric the Viking'' (originally ''Karl the Viking''), ''The Battle of Britain'' (originally ''Britain in Chains''), and ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''; and others which were reprints from ''Buster'', such as ''Wacker'' (originally ''Elmer''), ''Monty Muddle - The Man from Mars'' (originally ''Milkiway - The Man from Mars''), and ''Consternation Street''; but strictly no American superheroes.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The number of reprint strips was another significant indicator of its troubled financial situation, reprints being significantly cheaper than commissioning new strips.\n\nOf the former Odhams strips, only a handful survived. Humour strips which continued were ''The Swots and the Blots'', ''Wiz War'' and ''Bad Penny''. Additionally, ''Percy's Pets'' made occasional appearances (but did not appear every week). Much mourned were the loss of ''The Cloak'' and ''The Man from BUNGLE'', dropped due to the waning popularity of spy spoofs (in 1968 the TV series ''The Man from UNCLE'' had been cancelled); and especially mourned was the loss of Ken Reid and ''The Nervs''.\n\nThe serious offerings fared even worse. For although the survivors appeared to include ''Sergeant Rock - Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'', in reality neither of these were genuinely from the Odhams era. Both had begun only a few weeks earlier, in issues 156 and 158 respectively. They were really a part of the relaunch, but were introduced slightly ahead of time to disguise that fact. The only genuine survivor from the adventure strips of the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', and even that had only begun with issue&nbsp;144, in November&nbsp;1968.\n\nAfter a few months, superheroes appeared to be making a comeback. The Editorial column admitted receiving complaints from readers about the loss of the Marvel strips; and, in the autumn of 1969, six months after the ''Fantastic Four'' and ''Thor'' had been dropped, an all-British superhero called Tri-Man appeared, debuting in the issue of 13 September, and the character also featured in the ''Smash'' Annual that Christmas. Some indication of the effort put into this character is the fact that he was given sole possession of the front cover of the Annual! The adventures of Johnny Meek featured a hero who had triple-superpowers, hence the name Tri-Man. He leaped about rooftops (shades of Spider-Man, from the long-vanished ''Pow''), and got his powers from a ray device once every 24 hours (shades of DC's ''Green Lantern''). But the strip did not prove popular, and quietly vanished in the reshuffles of 1970.\n\nIn the light of how few strips of any sort survived from the Odhams era, and given that none of the superhero strips survived at all (which, according to the Letters pages,<ref>It was a feature of the Odhams years that the comic included a page for readers' letters, like the American comics published by Marvel and DC on which it was based, but the Letters Page was dropped in March 1969 in favour of extra advertising space.</ref> were the most popular feature of the ''Power Comics''), it would be stretching the truth to say that ''Smash'' inherited the best of the Odhams strips. Stylistically, ''The Swots and the Blots'' was the most creative and sophisticated Odhams strip (save only ''The Nervs''), and it did survive. But it was only one strip. And ''The Nervs'', which was objectively a more sophisticated strip in 1968, did not.\n\nMoreover, the publisher was taking a significant risk by re-launching the former ''Power Comic'' as, in effect, a clone of IPC's most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The publisher hoped it could repeat the success of ''Valiant'' and ''Lion'' by copying their successful formula. Nevertheless, without its discontinued superheroes ''Smash'' had nothing unique about it that might attract new readers, compared to its stablemates \u2014 featuring as it did a mix of strips reprinted from (or based on the style of) ''Lion'' and ''Buster''.\n\n===IPC Humour Strips===\n\nAs under Odhams, humour continued to play a large part in the relaunched comic (in terms of the page count): not to the extent it did in ''Buster'', but at least as much as in ''Valiant'' or ''Lion''.\n\nWith the relaunch, ''The Swots and the Blots'' (one of the handful of surviving Odhams strips) moved from the prestigious front cover to the centre pages. Nevertheless, now drawn by Leo Baxendale it became a standard bearer for sophisticated artwork. Baxendale began a five-year run on the strip (beginning in ''Smash'' and continuing in its successor, ''Valiant and Smash'', with some fill-ins by Les Barton<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=2818|title=Smash! comic the swots and the blots- Leo Baxendale - Comics UK|website=comicsuk.co.uk}}</ref>), by adopting a new style, one which influenced many others in the comics field, just as his earlier ''Beano'' work had done; and in the process attaining a new, deliriously daft, high standard, one rarely approached by other strips.\n\nNew humour strips featured in the relaunch (new to ''Smash'' at any rate) included a half-page cartoon strip drawn by Nadal, entitled ''Big 'Ead'', detailing the humorous misadventures of a Mr&nbsp;Knowall character, summed up by the strip's catchphrase, continually bellowed at the lead character by his irate victims: \"''Have a care there, Big&nbsp;'Ead!''\" Reprinted from ''Buster'', where it had initially run \u2014 under the same title \u2014 from 28 May 1960 to 18 February 1961.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p43</ref>\n\n''Wacker'' was a single page cartoon strip, subtitled ''He's All at Sea''. Drawn at different times by Rafart and by Roy Wilson, it concerned the crazy antics in the Royal Navy of Mis-leading Seaman Wacker, who was forever driving the Captain of HMS Impossible toward a nervous breakdown. Despite the Liverpudlian overtones of his surname, Wacker seemed not to be a Scouser \u2013 which may have been because it was ''not'' his real name! The strip, although new to ''Smash'', had run in ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'' from 29 October 1960 to 17 October 1964 under its real title, ''Elmer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/|title=Buster 60s|date=29 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/>\n\nAnother humour strip new to ''Smash'' was the World War Two spoof, ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men From W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' Set in 1940, this featured an English scientist named Professor Nutt, who was a boffin inventing eccentric secret weapons for a department of the War Office known as W.H.E.E.Z.E. (short for Weapon Handling Early Experimental and Zoning Establishment), who was kept out of trouble by his Army \"minder\", Sgt&nbsp;'Lightning' Bolt. Nutt and Bolt were perpetually clashing with a cunning Nazi scientist named Doktor Skull. This was another reprint strip, perhaps from ''Lion''. As its title implies, it was born out of the earlier popularity of the ''Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' television series. However, the strip had only a short run in ''Smash'', being replaced after just 22&nbsp;issues.\n\nYet it was not only in the plainly cartoon-style strips that humour flourished in the new ''Smash''. Many of the ostensibly more serious offerings were, in reality, humour strips: in particular, ''His Sporting Lordship'' and ''The World Wide Wanderers''; but there was also a strong humorous undercurrent in the new lead serial, ''Master of the Marsh''.\n\n===IPC Sporting Strips===\n\nSporting strips were now the order of the day. Reflecting this, the new lead, on page 3, was ''Master of the Marsh'', drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]],<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\">Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Solano Lopez]</ref> a sports serial about Patchman, a strange hermit who lived in the East Anglian fens. He was appointed as the new sports master at Marshside Secondary School, nicknamed 'The Marsh', because he was the only person who could control the kids \u2014 a group of hooligans known as 'the Monsters of the Marsh'. There was an association of ideas between fens and marsh, reinforced by the fact that Patchman camped in the inaccessible heart of the marshes. He was a burly woodsman who had always lived in the Fens, and could communicate after a fashion with the local wildlife, for whom he acted as protector.\n\nThe strip initially featured humorous stories about the attempts of Knocker Reeves \u2013 the worst of the 'monsters' \u2013 to get the better of the new teacher. But eventually it transpired that Patchman was secretly the guardian of a collection of relics left behind by [[Hereward the Wake]], a warlord who had fought the Norman invaders in the Fens during the 11th Century. In this respect, the strip had an occasional tendency to embrace science fiction overtones.\n\nOf the sports-based stories, the only survivor from the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', which continued to prosper. Possibly feeling the strip was suffering in the credibility stakes, the new editorial team made a decision to change the name of King's manager, who bore the remarkable name (actually a nickname) of Blarney Stone! They threw Blarney out of the series and substituted a new manager with a less silly name. ''Ballyhoo Barnes'' wasn't all that much less silly, but it's the thought that counts! Even so, Blarney reappeared after a few weeks, by popular demand.\n\nThe most successful of the new sports-based strips (certainly the most long-running) was ''His Sporting Lordship'', drawn by Douglas Maxted.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html Douglas Maxted]</ref> This humorous hit proved so popular that it ultimately became one of the few to outlast ''Smash'' itself. Henry Nobbins had been a labourer on a building site until he inherited the title of Earl of Ranworth and five million pounds. Before he could touch the money, however, he had to become champion at a number of sports. He also had to evade the nefarious attentions of Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, who was a rival claimant to the fortune, and Parkinson's villainous henchman, Fred Bloggs.\n\nLord Henry, as he had now become, was more than ably assisted by his Butler, Jarvis, who he had inherited from the previous Earl. And Jarvis proved indispensable. Henry was never portrayed as anything other than an able athlete and a good natured bloke, leaving Jarvis to supply the cunning which was (frequently) needed to defeat the dastardly Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, and prevent Henry's ancestral home, Castle Plonkton, from being turned into a glue factory.\n\nThe relaunch included a short-lived football strip with humorous overtones, entitled ''The World-Wide Wanderers'', about a League football team composed of eleven players from eleven different countries \u2014 not such a funny joke today! Football manager Harry Kraft found himself a passenger on a ship passing through the Suez Canal; ships from all over the world called there, and the crews conducted impromptu soccer matches to while away the time in port. Some of the crews had been stranded there, and constant soccer practice (since there was nothing else to do) had caused them to develop fantastic footballing skills. Kraft shipped eleven of them, from as many different countries, back to England; and they used their highly unorthodox individual skills to play as a team in the old Fourth Division.\n\n===IPC Adventure Strips===\n\nThe other staple of the new ''Smash'' was adventure serials, and far and away the most successful of these was ''The Incredible Adventures of [[Janus Stark]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Janus%2BStark|title=British Comic Art}}</ref> written by Tom Tully,<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183041 Janus Stark] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> featuring an escapologist in Victorian London who appeared to be simply an unusual act on the music-hall stage, but who privately used his extraordinary abilities to battle against injustice. Stark had an unusually flexible bone structure, enabling him to get out of an astonishing variety of tight situations, thanks to training received in childhood from his mentor, Blind Largo. Drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]], there was more than a touch of Reed Richards, from the departed ''Fantastic Four'' strip, in Stark's uncanny abilities.<ref>Stark's flexible bone structure, which was the basis of his career as an escapologist in the theatres, was perhaps more akin to ''Rubberman'', a character who had featured in ''Smash'' in 1966</ref> Lopez's dark, moody artwork also gave the strip a perfect 19th Century setting.<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\"/> The strip was one of the few to survive the merger of ''Smash'' into ''Valiant'' in 1971, and is still well remembered today. As a mark of its popularity, from week 30 it replaced ''Master of the Marsh'' as the lead serial on page 3 (swapping places with the latter, which was thus relegated to an inconspicuous location on pages 12 and 13).\n\nThis brings up the matter of economics once more. Solano Lopez was a foreign illustrator, born in the Argentine, who worked at a studio in Spain. For reasons of cost, IPC had taken a policy decision to source artwork from cheaper sources outside the UK.<ref name=\"blogs.birminghammail.net\"/> Along with the presence in the new ''Smash'' of reprint strips, which were much cheaper than commissioning new strips, this is yet another indicator of the financial pressure the comic was still under, and the absolute necessity of cutting production costs to the bone in order to make it financially viable.\n\nAnother long-running adventure strip was ''The Battle of Britain'', in which secret agent Simon Kane fought against Baron Rudolph, a usurper who had seized control of Britain using a secret weapon. The weapon emitted a sound wave which paralysed anyone who wasn't protected against it. Rudolph set up a police state, similar in emblems and uniforms to medieval England at the time of King John, and Kane led the resistance against him.\n\nIn spite of the title, the strip had no connection with the Second World War! Drawn for the initial 40 issues by Geoff Campion, and thereafter by [[John Stokes (comics)|John Stokes]],<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p109</ref> it was in fact a reprint; hence it, too, was an indication of the comic's troubled financial status (reprints being cheaper than new strips). It originally ran in ''[[Lion (comics)|Lion]]'' from 29 February 1964 to 28 May 1966 under various titles including ''Britain in Chains'' and ''The Battle for Britain'', where the hero was called Vic Gunn. The editorial staff of ''Smash'' took a decision to change the names of the leading characters from Gunn and Barrel (i.e. ''gun barrel''), to slightly less absurd ones; and so were born secret agent Simon Kane and his assistant Tubby. This had been a very long-running strip in ''Lion'', so much so that ''Smash'' actually ceased publication \u2014 in April 1971 \u2014 before it had reprinted the entire run from ''Lion'', and in the final issue created an (unconvincing) new ending for the serial.\n\n''Rebbels on the Run'' was another adventure serial, featuring three young brothers whose surname was Rebbel, who run away from an orphanage to avoid being split up. After a few months on the run, the strip took an amazing turn and \u2014 renamed ''The Rebbel Robot'' \u2014 became a science fiction serial, when the boys discovered that their late father's mind was preserved within the brain of a robot, which became their unofficial guardian. With it they embarked on a quest to track down a criminal known as The Genie, who had murdered their real father \u2014 who, in a further improbable turn of events, turned out to be a secret agent!\n\n''Eric the Viking'', a continuing serial featuring its eponymous Viking hero, and set in the Dark Ages, was another reprint from ''Lion'', where it had run under the title ''Karl the Viking'', as a set of 13 stories, from 29 October 1960 until 29 September 1964, written by Ken Bulmer.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\">Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p108</ref> The change of name to Eric probably reflects on the continuing fame (during the 1960s) of a real-life Viking leader in Dark Age Britain, Eric Bloodaxe, who history records was King in Viking York in the 10th Century. The strip is well remembered under its original title, as it was drawn by a famous comics artist, Don Lawrence.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Don Lawrence]</ref><ref>[http://www.donlawrence.co.uk/shop/index.php?hg=2&sg=35 Deluxe hardback collection of ''Karl the Viking'' strips] by Don Lawrence</ref> Eric (and Karl) fought a weird but impressive collection of legendary and fantasy monsters, in sword-and-sorcery epics which had some reflections in Lawrence's art for his contemporary work on the highly regarded all-colour science fiction strip ''[[The Trigan Empire]]'' then running in ''Look and Learn''. This was not even the first reprint: retitled ''Swords of the Sea Wolves'' it had initially been reprinted in ''Lion'', in part, between 1 October 1966 and 7 October 1967, with the lead character renamed Rolf the Viking.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\"/> And it would later be reprinted again, in the European version of ''Vulcan'': on that occasion translated into German and retitled 'Kobra'.\n\nTwo of the new IPC adventure strips \u2014 ''Sergeant Rock Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'' \u2014 were introduced five or six weeks early, in an attempt to conceal how few Odhams strips had actually survived, by making these appear to be existing strips although they were not. World War Two was the setting for the former, which, with occasional stories drawn by John Vernon,<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p88</ref> recounted the adventures of the 'Red Devils' of the Parachute Regiment. Initially, Sgt Rock was merely a narrator, introducing stories featuring other characters, so that it was actually tales-of-the-parachute-regiment, rather than tales of Sgt Rock himself. This was a device for reprinting old war stories from other comics: the strip had originally appeared in Fleetway's ''Hurricane'', from 4 July 1964 to 8 May 1965, entitled ''Paratrooper'', and continued in ''Tiger'' when that title absorbed ''Hurricane'' in the issue dated 15 May 1965. The reprints in ''Smash'' were reasonably successful, running for a year; and Sergeant Rock eventually featured as more than just narrator, with later editions sending him into action with the SAS, and marking the change by altering the title to ''Sergeant Rock - Special Air Service''. This change was noticeable, also, by a change of artist; seemingly \u2014 from the similarity of style \u2014 to the artist on the discontinued wartime strip, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''.\n\n''Bunsen's Burner'' was a short-lived strip, lasting just a few weeks.<ref>It was discontinued during the reshuffles of August 1969, when various changes were quietly made to the comic over the course of a month.</ref> This was an adventure yarn with humorous overtones \u2013 its humorous content being trailed in its title: a reference to an item familiar to most schoolboys from their Chemistry classes. Ben Bunsen was the owner of a vintage car, which was known as \"the Burner\" because it was so old it was steam-driven! Like an old-fashioned steam train it had a boiler which had to be stoked, as it ran on coal instead of petrol. Ben and his pal had to drive the Burner around the world, as a condition of Ben inheriting his uncle's fortune; but a rival claimant (shades of ''His Sporting Lordship''!) was secretly out to stop them.\n\nAnother adventure strip which had a sadly brief run, lasting only 47 weeks, but which is very well-remembered today, was ''Cursitor Doom''. In this spooky and atmospheric series,<ref>The strip had various artists during its one year run, but far and away the most effective of them was the talented Eric Bradbury, and it is mainly his serials from which the strip's enduring reputation derives</ref> Cursitor Doom, master investigator of the strange and mystic, who openly practiced sorcery in the strip, battled against the dark forces of evil, ably assisted by the pounding fists of his assistant, Angus McCraggan. Doom battled against genuine spirits and sorcerers, in tales including ''The Case of Kalak the Dwarf'', ''The Sorcerer's Talisman'' and ''The Dark Legion of Mardarax'', in the latter encountering a haunted (and unstoppable) Roman Legion brought back to \"life\" by the evil Mardarax. Doom's pet Raven, Scarab, who could write messages in the dust for Angus McCraggan, by scratching with his claw, was often of more help to Doom in these serials than was the perpetually baffled McCraggan.\n\nThe ''Cursitor Doom'' strip was drawn by Geoff Campion (including ''The Return of the Hunter''), and \u2013 more effectively \u2013 by [[Eric Bradbury]] (including the magnificently atmospheric ''Dark Legion of Mardarax'').\n\n===Changes in August 1969===\n\nAfter 22 weeks, in August&nbsp;1969, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' was dropped, and replaced from the 23rd&nbsp;issue by a more serious World War Two strip entitled ''Send For... Q-Squad'', which dealt with the adventures of a hand picked group of six specialists, who were assigned to unusual missions that required special expertise both in the air and on the ground. This, too, in keeping with the need to cut costs, was a reprint, originally published in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 7 March 1964 under the title ''Phantom Force 5''.<ref>[http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html ''Phantom Force Five''] in ''Buster''</ref><ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p36</ref>\n\nThis was another of those drawn, initially, by one of IPC's best British artists, [[Eric Bradbury]], at other times by the Spanish-based artist Luis Bermejo Rojo,<ref>[http://smashpages.net/2015/12/15/rip-luis-bermejo-rojo/ Career of Luis Bermejo] at SmashPages.net</ref> and in its final months mainly by Fred Holmes.<ref>Comics artist [http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html Fred Holmes] at BusterComic.com</ref> Because the strip had a regrettably short run in ''Smash'' (from 16 August 1969 to 30 January 1970 only), most of the run features art by Eric Bradbury.\n\nIt was marked out as a reprint by its unique style \u2014 which was both different from, and grimmer than, all the other strips. Whereas Sgt Rock emulated Lord Henry (and Janus Stark), by maintaining a huge and confident smile, regardless of how much trouble he was in, no one in ''Q-Squad'' ever stopped looking worried. Its reprint status was also signalled by the fact that Q-Squad was plainly ''not'' the original name of the team. Some panels showed evidence of the name having been inserted over a previous one: a change in the lettering style for the name 'Q-Squad' and any adjacent words \u2014 which used a different handwriting in a cruder style wherever the name appeared, but nowhere else.\n\nIn the same issue, a serious footballing serial entitled ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'' began, replacing the departed \u2014 and rather more humorous \u2014 ''World Wide Wanderers''. Hard-as-nails former prison sports instructor 'Toff' Morgan (so called for his habit of always wearing a top-hat) took over the management of ailing First Division side Haversham Hotspurs. Morgan began to rebuild the team by 'framing' ex-criminals who he'd known while working in various prisons, forcing them to sign on with the club in order to make use of their dishonest skills as footballing talents. These convicts became the 'handcuff hotspurs' of the title. The club's former manager, Reg Jessup, tried constantly to sabotage Morgan's efforts, in order to persuade the Directors to re-appoint him instead.\n\nSix months earlier, various humour strips had been introduced as replacements for the (far more surreal) humour of [[Ken Reid (comics)|Ken Reid]], whose strip ''The Nervs'' had so disturbed IPC's management. Now another was forthcoming, and one which reflected the pervasive sporting theme of the relaunched comic. ''The Touchline Tearaways'' (replacing ''Big 'Ead'') was another new football-themed strip, featuring three mad-keen supporters of Grimshot United: a totally useless Football League team, perpetually in danger of being relegated as it was made up entirely of ailing and decrepit players. Each week the Tearaways \u2014 Hairy, Lug'oles and Clever Dick \u2014 would execute some scheme from the touchline to help Grimshot win that week's fixture, usually involving a battle of wits with officials from the Ministry of Football, who, not unnaturally, tried to put a stop to the Tearaways well-intentioned cheating.\n\nThe name of the club, Grimshot United, was a humorous indication that the team was not very good (i.e. that the players were \"grim shots\"). Each strip featured a single match, with a plot based around helping the team overcome that week's opponent. Clever Dick masterminded all the ploys used in helping Grimshot, and apart from occasional words of congratulation or encouragement he was generally the only \"Tearaway\" who had dialogue in the strip. Hairy and Lug'oles tended to be merely a pair of walking visual gags: Hairy's features were perpetually invisible behind a vast mass of long black hair that covered his entire face and head, and Lug'oles had a pair of enormous ears.\n\nThese three new strips represented a minor change of emphasis, replacing two of the more whimsical offerings with two entirely serious strips \u2014 even though the third new entry (which was only a single-page) was simply one outright cartoon strip replacing another.\n\nThus, within six months, a number of the strips introduced in the relaunch had already bitten the dust. And more changes were looming.\n\n===The 2nd Relaunch : 1970===\n\nThe most obvious problem faced by the new-look ''Smash'' was the constant \"churn\": the incessant turnover of strips. Without its solidly popular superhero strips to rely on, the editorial staff seemed pathologically incapable of settling on a fixed line-up.<ref>Continual change of line-up was not a problem unique to ''Smash'', but was shared by all IPC's comics of this period. Editors struggled to find strips sufficiently popular to halt the decline in weekly sales; but making so many changes was self-defeating, because it harmed reader loyalty.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the changes made in August&nbsp;1969, further changes made at the start of 1970 left ''Smash'' looking very different from its appearance in the wake of the relaunch just 12&nbsp;months earlier. A vast number of new strips were added, in a second re-launch, such that only half of those introduced in March&nbsp;1969 now survived, although those which continued included ''Master of the Marsh'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'', ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''Battle of Britain'', ''Eric the Viking'', ''Wacker'', ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'', ''The Swots and the Blots'', and ''Percy's Pets'' \u2014 the latter two now being the only remaining Odhams strips.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\nDiscontinued were ''King of the Ring'' (last survivor of the serious strips from the Odhams era), ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service'', and ''Cursitor Doom''. Three of the strips only recently introduced were also dropped, namely the wartime ''Q-Squad'', British superhero ''Tri-Man'', and the humour strip ''The Touchline Tearaways''.\n\nThe first changes in 1970 occurred in the issue dated 24 January, when three new strips appeared, all reprints from ''Buster'': ''The Kid Commandos'', ''Consternation Street'', and ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' (originally titled ''Milkiway \u2013 The Man from Mars''). These were introduced as part of a relaunch of the comic: by once again bringing in some of the changes a few weeks ahead of the relaunch, as had been done in the Spring of 1969, the publisher hoped to disguise the true extent of the changes.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\n''The Kid Commandos'' was a war story about three cockney children stranded in occupied France in World War Two. Drawn by Tom Kerr, the Sparrow children \u2014 Tommy, Jan and Podge \u2014 were on the run from the Germans each week, in a single page strip set in 1940. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it appeared from 9 January to 24 July 1965, under the imaginative title ''The Sparrows Go To War''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref>\n\nIn the humour strip ''Consternation Street'' drawn by Reg Parlett (the title spoofed that of the popular British television soap opera, ''Coronation Street''), which was usually a one-page strip, a collection of unlikely neighbours rubbed shoulders in a very small street. Watched over by the dim-witted Constable Clott were the Snobbs and the Ardupps, Colonel Curry & Caesar (his dog), Miss Primm and her pets, Cutprice the Grocer, and Roger the Lodger. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it had originally run \u2013 under the same title \u2013 between 9 January and 23 October 1965.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p44</ref> Parlett was also known from his other humour strips in ''Buster'' including ''Rent-A-Ghost Ltd'', ''The Happy Family'' and ''Bonehead''.<ref>[http://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=1992 Reg Parlett's contributions to ''Valiant'' and ''Buster''] (including the long running ''Billy Bunter'' strip in ''Valiant'', which continued in ''Valiant and Smash'')</ref>\n\nThe half-page humour strip ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' recounted the misadventures of spaceman Monty Muddle (a name rather less convincing than the character's original name, ''Milkiway''). It originally ran in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 10 March 1962, with art credited to Nadal/Rafart.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/> He flew about in his small bubble-domed spacecraft trying to make friends with the Earth people. However, due to his misunderstanding of Earth customs, his every attempt at contact ended in disaster; and each strip would typically end with the catchphrase ''I'll try again next week!''\n\nThe 7 February issue then saw a full re-launch: with more free gifts, another new cover feature, and no less than eight new strips (making an astonishing eleven strips added since the beginning of the year).\n\nThe ''Warriors of the World'' covers had run into a problem, in that war stories were no longer a strong element of ''Smash'', which had dropped the humour strip ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' some time earlier. When it was decided to also drop ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Paratrooper'' (by then renamed ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service''), and ''Q&nbsp;Squad'', the cover feature had to go too. It was not practical to advertise war stories on the cover if there were no war stories inside!\n\nThe newly added ''Kid Commandos'' did not count as a war story in this context, since the three fugitive children did not do any conventional fighting. The strip was more like a souped-up version of the discontinued ''Rebbels on the Run''.\n\nAccordingly, after forty seven weeks<ref>46 issues featuring the ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature, and one Christmas issue</ref> the ''Warriors of the World'' series was ended. Instead, the issue dated 7 February 1970 began ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'', written by Angus Allan and drawn by the ever-popular Eric Bradbury.<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183036 ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'']</ref> Henceforth each week's cover featured a full-page splash advertising the task which adventurer Simon Test would undertake in a new strip on the inside pages. This strip proved so successful that when the original thirteen-week series was completed (featuring one task each week), Simon Test was given a new series of adventures, extending his hold on the cover indefinitely. He would prove particularly enduring, being one of the few strips to ultimately survive the merger with ''Valiant'' in 1971.\n\n''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'' saw him undertake a quest for immortality by attempting the thirteen tasks of the Pharaoh Thot, believing this to be the only way to save his life, having been deceived into believing he has only a few months to live. The sinister Jabez Coppenger secretly desired Test's death as a means of restoring his own youth. This serial introduced the mute servant Karka, who would ultimately become Test's friend and assistant.\n\nTest then went on to the more lengthy series of adventures entitled ''Simon Test and the Curse of the Conqueror'', where he battled the twenty servants of the evil Ezekiel Spar, the self-styled Conqueror. This pitted him against twenty athletes and champions, each of whom was under the hypnotic control of Spar, who implanted in them an in-built impulse to kill Simon Test.\n\nNew supporting strips introduced in the 7 February issue included ''Threat of the Toymaker'', ''The Pillater Peril'', ''Birdman of Baratoga'', ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'', and three humour strips with a common supernatural element: ''Sam's Spook'' (drawn by Leo Baxendale), ''The Haunts of Headless Harry'', and ''Ghost Ship''.\n\nIn ''Threat of the Toymaker'', drawn by Solano Lopez, a criminal scientist named Doctor Droll escaped from Garstone Prison with the aid of an army of remote controlled mechanical toys he had constructed, along the way taking the Prison Governor's children, Pam and Peter Keen, as hostages. Hampered by the children at every turn, Droll finds himself on the run, pursued by the Police wherever he goes. The idea of using radio controlled toys in the strip was scarcely original, since it was a straight lift from the ''House of Dolmann'', which was then running in ''Valiant'', as well as from the ''General Jumbo'' strip in ''The Beano''. The strip was scarcely original either: having been first published in ''Buster'', under the title ''The Toys of Doom'', between 27 February 1965 and 13 January 1968 (and in which it would be reprinted\u2014in part\u2014between 3 May and 6 September 1986, under the title ''The Terror Toys''), it was also reprinted in ''Eagle'', under its original title ''The Toys of Doom''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\"/>\n\n''The Pillater Peril'' saw David Pillater return to Pillater House, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast, which he is to inherit on his 21st&nbsp;birthday. Along with his four cousins and his Uncle Bernard, David is imperilled by Francis Pillater, an ancestor who has seemingly returned from the dead. Francis had an evil reputation for his misdeeds in the 16th century, but was thought to have perished in a shipwreck during a storm at sea. Blaming the family for his troubles, he sets out for revenge by kidnapping them one by one. The strip had only a short run, but when discontinued it did, unusually, seemingly come to a natural conclusion (rather than merely wrapping-up many continuing plot threads unconvincingly in the final panel).\n\n''Birdman from Baratoga'' was an adventure strip about a boy who grew up on a Pacific island with only the company of birds, and learned from them the secret of flight. By the use of a feather cape, he was able to glide through the air like an albatros. When an English sailor is castaway on the island, called Baratoga, they escape together on a raft and set out on a series of adventures in the Pacific, beginning by hunting down the desperado who has stolen the man's pearl-fishing yacht, ''Enterprise''. ''Birdman from Baratoga'' was perhaps loosely based on a humour strip which had run in ''Buster'' during 1968: ''Captain Swoop \u2013 He's Half Man, Half Bird, Half Wit''.\n\nIn a very atypical move, prompted by IPC's on-going financial problems (in the year in which they were taken over by the Reed Group), the editorial team now resurrected one of the old strips which had run in ''Wham'' under Odhams, drawn by Gordon Hogg. ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'' featured two young lads from Liverpool who fancied themselves as musicians, spoke in Liverpudlian slang (even the original title of the strip was derived from a slang Scouse term for a native of Liverpool: 'wacker'), sported Beatles-style haircuts, and always carried guitars. This was a reprint of ''The&nbsp;Wacks'', which had run in ''Wham'' during 1964, reprinted here with only the title and the names changed. Spoofing the pop group ''The Beatles'', it was an odd choice to run it a year ''after'' that group's demise. It was, though, a popular item: this 1964 strip had already been reprinted, under the title ''Birk 'n' 'Ed, the Mersey Dead-Beats'', from 30 January 1965 in Fleetway's ''Hurricane''.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p.89</ref><ref>Spoken quickly for comic effect, the names of the two characters were intended to sound like that of a district in Liverpool called Birkenhead</ref>\n\nA common supernatural theme linked the three new humour strips. In ''Sam's Spook'', drawn by the ubiquitous Leo Baxendale, Sam was a schoolboy with a ghostly pal called Spooky, who used his powers to humorous effect on Sam's behalf. The strip mostly consisted of Sam's school friends catching Spooky doing a bit of ghostly cheating in order to help Sam win at sports or football, and Sam doing a lot of running away to avoid a bashing.\n\n''The Haunts of Headless Harry'' featured the amiable ghost of a 16th-century soldier who had been beheaded. Harry's head and body led separate but related ghostly existences, with the body carrying the head around everywhere, and both of them were able to talk. Harry's humorous adventures invariably involved misplacing his head; such as going to the cinema and, on leaving, calling at the cloakroom to collect it (as though it was a hat), and being asked by the attendant to identify it among all the other ghostly heads left there during the film.\n\nThe other new humour strip was ''Ghost Ship'', in which the spirit of an ancient galleon, and the ghosts of its pirate crew, sailed the Seven Seas making mischief, but usually coming off worst.\n\nFurther changes followed: such that fully thirteen strips had been introduced since the start of 1970. In the issue dated 27 June 1970, a new humour strip began entitled ''Moonie's Magic Mate'', about a schoolboy, Barry Moon, who finds a Genie in a dusty old bottle. In the issue dated 29 August, a humour strip titled ''The Fighting Three'' began, featuring the misadventures of three men: globe-trotters McGinty, Hambone and Weasel are travelling the world, trying to raise enough money to start their own construction company, but get into fights \u2013 and jail! \u2013 wherever they go. Drawn by Carlos Cruz, this was another reprint from ''Buster'', where, under its original title ''Mighty McGinty'', the strip had run in 1964.<ref>Published 29 February to 17 October 1964: ''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref> And finally, in the last addition before the comic's closure, a strip entitled ''Tyler the Tamer'' was launched in early 1971, about the adventures of the greatest film stuntman in the world. Dropped to make room for these were ''Kid Commandos'', ''Threat of the Toymaker'' and ''The Pillater Peril'' (the ''Pillater'' saga seemingly reaching a natural conclusion, instead of merely being summarily abandoned).\n\n==Merger with ''Valiant''==\n\nIn mid-November 1970, production on ''Smash'' (and many other IPC titles, including ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'') came to a halt due to a printers' strike, and no editions were published for the next three months.<ref name=SP2010 /> By the time the strike was settled, in February of the following year, irreparable damage had been done to the comic's circulation, as its young readers had turned elsewhere in the intervening 11&nbsp;weeks. Similar harm had been suffered by ''Valiant''. In consequence of this latest financial disaster, after eight issues, in April&nbsp;1971 the two titles were merged in an attempt to combine their surviving circulation. For a brief time the merged comic was entitled ''Valiant and Smash'' (10 April to 18 September 1971<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/11/27/valiant-70s/|title=Valiant 70s|date=27 November 2018}}</ref>), before reverting to simply ''Valiant''.\n\nSome strips from ''Smash'' survived in the new comic, including ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'' and ''The Swots and the Blots'', but most were lost,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180805023305/http://26pigs.com/valiant/index.html Merger with ''Valiant''] - ''Valiant and Smash''</ref> although the ''Smash'' Annual continued to appear for many years afterwards (continuing, in fact, until the 1976 Annual, published in the autumn of 1975).

However, it was revived in the 1972 ''Smash'' Annual, published at Christmas&nbsp;1971, and returned year after year: becoming the regular cover feature of the Annuals.<ref name=\"British Comics website\"/>\n\nThe merged title was dominated by ''Valiant'', which contributed nine strips consisting of twenty pages; whereas ''Smash!'' was represented by only four strips, totalling a meager nine pages: ''Janus Stark'', ''The Swots & The Blots'', ''Simon Test'', and ''His Sporting Lordship''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kidr77.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-valiant-attempt-at-smashing.html|title=CRIVENS!

Annual, published mainly under the Fleetway imprint, continued to appear every year: the final Annual, cover-dated 1976, was published in the autumn of 1975.\n\nDuring 1967 and 1968 ''Smash!'' was part of Odhams' [[Power Comics]] line (from #44 to #143), absorbing its sister titles ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' on 14 September 1968 (issue&nbsp;137) and ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' on 2 November 1968 (issue&nbsp;144). As ''Pow!'' and ''Fantastic'' had themselves already merged with ''[[Wham!

The last of these, the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', ended in issue&nbsp;162.

The ''Power Comics'' logo, printed on the cover of each issue, was a gimmick dreamed up by Odhams to unify their five titles under a common banner. ''Smash'' remained part of that lineup for 100 issues; the logo was quietly dropped after #143 when the last of the other comics forming part of the lineup was cancelled (so that there was no longer a group of titles needing to be unified).\n\nThe other Power Comics were all ultimately absorbed into ''Smash'', which became the last survivor. On 14 September 1968, with issue 137, it merged with ''[[Pow! (comics)|Pow!]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Wham! (comics)|Wham]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow''. On 2 November 1968, with issue&nbsp;144, it merged with ''[[Fantastic (comics)|Fantastic]]'' (which had previously absorbed ''[[Terrific (comics)|Terrific]]''), becoming ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic''.<ref>[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=3 Covers Gallery for 1968] at the Grand Comics Database</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' ceased to be published by Odhams Press Ltd, and was thereafter published by IPC Magazines Ltd (an IPC subsidiary formed during 1968). On 15 March 1969 it was relaunched without its American superhero strips. Further changes followed during the course of 1969, and then a 2nd relaunch at the start of 1970.

Holiday Special in 1971.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1966, a companion to ''Wham!'' was conceived within the minds of Alf Wallace (Managing Editor of Odhams' juveniles \u2014 ''Eagle'', ''Swift'' and ''Boy's World'') and Albert Cosser.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984\">''British Comic World'', Issue #3 (June 1984)</ref> Leo Baxendale, who had created ''Wham!'' in 1964, was too heavily embroiled with on-going production on it, providing much of the art for each issue, so that he had little time for anything else. And he was then still working at long range from Dundee.<ref>DC Thompson Ltd, Baxendale's former employers, were based in Dundee, Scotland</ref>\n\nAccordingly, it was Alf Wallace and Albert Cosser (soon to be known to their young audience as Alf and Cos) who determined the original format of ''Smash!''. They also recruited the artists who would draw the early issues, since it was plain that Baxendale was fully occupied with the art for ''Wham!''. Baxendale's initial contribution to ''Smash'' was thus limited to providing a list of titles and situations for the humour strips, together with brief written scenarios (script ideas for the individual weekly issues), which he gave to Wallace to be farmed-out to other artists. ''The Swots and The Blots'' was one of these.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\">''British Comic World'', Issue #3 (June 1984),p.4-5</ref>\n\nBaxendale was asked only to create the ''Bad Penny'' strip, and to transfer ''Grimly Feendish'' (a character from his ''Eagle Eye, Junior Spy'' strip running in ''Wham!''), thereby giving ''Feendish'' a strip of his own. Wallace also had him draw the covers for the first three issues.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.4-5\"/>\n\n''Smash'' launched with the same format as the early issues of ''Wham'', namely 24 pages per issue, four of which were in colour, but printed on lower-quality paper than ''Wham''.\n\nThe initial line-up of strips mixed humour and adventure freely, with the comedic ''Ronnie Rich'' featuring on the cover of the first issue, inside which were adventure strips including the World War Two based ''Ghost Patrol'' \u2014 this latter a reprint strip, which lasted only until issue 25. ''Ghost Patrol'' proved symptomatic of the problem with adventure strips which plagued ''Smash'' during the Odhams years, which tended to be ''sloppy in presentation and possessed of little real character or emotion''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.6</ref>\n\nThe root of the problem was that ''Smash'' went through many changes in its early days \u2014 far too many. Particularly in its adventure strips: ''The Ghost Patrol'' came and went; ''The Legend Testers'' came and went; ''Moon Madness'' was particularly short-lived; and there were numerous others, equally forgettable. None proved popular enough to last.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.10</ref>\n\nThose readers old enough to have become emotionally attached to comics before Odhams introduced American superhero strips to their British readers tended to dislike those superhero strips.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984\"/> Whereas, according to the letters pages each week, those same Marvel and DC heroes were enormously popular among the younger age group, which had not been reading comics previously. Accordingly, ''Wham'' readers tended to resent the changes made in 1966, because British strips were cancelled in ''Wham'' and replaced with US superheroes, whereas ''Smash'' readers did not resent the superheroes, because in 1966 that comic had only just launched, so there were no real changes \u2014 ''Smash'' more or less teemed with American strips from the very beginning.\n\n==Odhams Years==\n===Superheroes===\nBlack-and-white reprints of [[Marvel Comics]] strips<ref>All the Marvel stories were written by Stan Lee</ref> were introduced into ''Smash'' with issue&nbsp;16, when the ''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' began.<ref>Issue 16 saw the first appearance of Marvel's ''[https://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/?page=1 Incredible Hulk]'' strip, drawn by [[Jack Kirby]]</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html|title=BLIMEY!

In July&nbsp;1967 ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]''<ref>Drawn at various times by Bill Everett, Wally Wood and Gene Colan</ref> replaced the Hulk, from issue&nbsp;76 onwards \u2014 ''Smash'' having exhausted all Hulk stories, from all sources, which had been published in the USA up to that time.\n\nIt's hard to overstate the significance of the introduction of ''The Hulk'', in the issue dated 21 May 1966. It was the first ''Marvel Comics'' strip featured by Odhams, the success of which led to the introduction of ''Fantastic Four'' into ''Wham'' on 6 August of that year, and to the launching of two entire comics entirely dedicated to Marvel superheroes \u2014 ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' \u2014 in 1967. The Hulk's initial appearance in ''Smash'' took up a massive 6 pages, one-quarter of each 24 page issue, pushing fully five existing strips out of that issue, and causing the permanent cancellation of \"Space Jinx\" and \"Brian's Brain\" (although the latter would be revived much later).<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.11</ref>\n\nPrior to this, [[DC Comics|DC]]'s ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]]'' had become the second American superhero to debut in ''Smash'', crashing onto the front cover of issue&nbsp;20 a month after the Hulk's debut, in re-edited reprints from American daily and Sunday newspaper strips: these were credited in-page to ''Batman'' creator Bob Kane, but were actually drawn by [[Al Plastino]] and ghost-written by [[Whitney Ellsworth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/issue/368494/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Smash! #75|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> This was a response to the sudden and enormous popularity of the ''Batman'' television series starring Adam West. The impact of this hit TV show led to the ''Batman'' strip retaining the front cover of ''Smash'', in colour, for better than a year and a half, entitled ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder''.\n\nInitially, this syndicated newspaper strip adopted the camp style of the Adam West television series, with appearances by humorous guest stars such as American funnyman [[Jack Benny]]. In the later part of the run (which featured serious, rather than camp, stories) Batgirl, too, appeared in the strip, a response to her addition to the TV show in its 3rd season: in the newspaper strip, Batman initially believed her to be a criminal rather than a crime fighter. Superman then co-starred in the strip, which was retitled ''Superman and Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'', as Batman and Robin attempt to save Superman from the diabolical Professor Zinkk who was secretly poisoning him with kryptonite.\n\nThe expansion of the American content, with the arrival of ''Batman'', meant the loss of two more of the initial British strips: the adventure strip ''The Ghost Patrol'', and the cartoon strip ''The Tellybugs''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.11\"/>\n\nIn September 1968 the ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' began a six-month run in ''Smash'', when it absorbed ''Pow'' (which had previously merged with ''Wham'', in which the strip had initially featured). As one of only a handful of ''Pow'' strips to survive the merger, it was used to lure ''Pow'' readers to the new comic. The strip was introduced to readers of ''Smash'' with the wedding of Reed and Sue from ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Their adventures continued with ''Defeated by the Frightful Four'', and ran through to ''Lo There Shall Be an Ending'', which was the final Marvel strip to appear in ''Smash''.\n\n''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' began a short run in November 1968 when ''Smash'' absorbed ''Fantastic''. The stories, continued from ''Fantastic'', began with ''The Ringmaster's Circus of Crime''. When the Marvel strips were discontinued the following spring, the final ''Thor'' reprint had a new ending substituted, in a rushed attempt to resolve a continuing sub-plot.\n\nThe financial crisis which overtook Odhams in 1968, resulting in the closure of all the other ''Power Comics'', also caused them to give up the expensive licence to reprint the Marvel superhero stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/m/marvuk.htm|title=Marvel UK|website=www.internationalhero.co.uk}}</ref> This decision took effect in March&nbsp;1969, when the licence came up for renewal; the final Marvel strips appeared in issue&nbsp;162. The expensive ''Batman'' newspaper strip had already been discontinued, ending in issue&nbsp;157.\n\n===Odhams Humour Strips===\nThere were typically a dozen British humour strips in each of the first 162 issues.\n\nThe initial line-up starred ''The Man From B.U.N.G.L.E.'', which usually occupied the front cover prior to issue&nbsp;20,<ref>''Smash'': [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2015/02/smash-first-20-covers.html The first 20 covers]</ref> supported by seven other long-running humour strips (''Charlie's Choice'',<ref name=\"Brian Lewis\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Brian Lewis]</ref> ''Bad Penny'',<ref name=\"Leo Baxendale\">Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Leo Baxendale]</ref> ''Percy's Pets'',<ref>Drawn by [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> ''The Nervs'',<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2016/01/50-year-flashback-smash-no1.html|title=BLIMEY!

It is unclear why Alf and Cos chose this deeply unfunny strip for what must have been considered the pride of place in the new comic. ''Space Jinx'' was primarily another ''Jonah'' (a strip by Ken Reid which had run in ''The Beano''), except that it could not hold its own against the brilliance of Reid's sea-faring twit. Where ''Jonah'' dealt with sinking ships of the sea, Brian Lewis's ''Space Jinx'' dealt with similar situations in outer space, but (in practice) without the necessary degree of humour.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\">British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.7</ref>\n\nKen Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' would last only slightly longer, at 43 issues. A masterpiece of comic artistry, telling the story of the ''Buoyant Queen'' and its two-man crew, Enoch and Bert, a pair of oafs with a love/hate relationship (mostly hate!), it was perhaps too intelligent for its target audience \u2014 its disappearance was a great loss to the comic.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> Many readers failed to understand, amongst many things in the strip that went clear over their heads, that the two main characters were drawn in the likeness of comedians [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Oliver Hardy]], and that the strip's humour was based on the movies of Laurel & Hardy.\n\nAfter only five months \u2013 foreshadowing many, many reshuffles to come \u2013 ''Smash!'' underwent its first major overhaul: from issue&nbsp;20 the ''Batman'' newspaper strip took over the front cover, whilst ''Grimly Feendish'' lost the colour back cover to Reid's ''Queen of the Seas'' (which shrank from its original two pages each week to only a single page \u2014 the loss of the extra page was a drawback, but was compensated for by the strip now having a more prestigious location in the comic, and of course by now being in colour).\n\nFurther cover changes would follow. When, after two years, the popularity of the ''Batman'' television series eventually faded, from issue&nbsp;114 onward Batman and Robin were moved to the inside pages, yielding the front cover to the long-running success ''The Swots and the Blots'', at this point still being drawn by Mike Lacey, a humour strip in which two rival gangs vied to outwit each other at Pond Road School, with \"Teach\" caught in the crossfire. Its origins lay in Baxendale's classroom-based strip ''The Tiddlers'', which had then been running for 2 years in ''Wham''<ref>In fact it was a direct continuation of ''[https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/wham/ The Tiddlers]'', with only a change of name. The characters (i.e. \"Teach\" and the Blots), school buildings, and situations, were all largely as they had been in ''The Tiddlers''. The only difference was the addition of the Swots, so that Teach now had an ally.</ref> (and which continued in ''Pow'' when ''Wham'' merged with it in 1968, where it was combined with ''The Dolls of St Dominics'' to become ''The Tiddlers and The Dolls'').\n\n''The Swots and the Blots'' was one of the few strips in ''Smash'' to survive all the changes of 1969 and 1970, reaching a new standard of excellence when [[Leo Baxendale]] began drawing it for the new-look ''Smash'' from March 1969, but even during the Odhams years it had wit and a sense of style. In Baxendale's hands it had notable similarities to his earlier classroom-based strip, ''The Bash Street Kids'', in ''[[The Beano]]''.<ref>Around 1968, Baxendale quit Odhams for the better paying ''Fleetway'' comics. One of the strips he produced there was ''[http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2017/07/leo-baxendales-big-chief-pow-wow.html Big Chief Pow Wow]'' for ''Buster''\u2014the strip ran from 14 September 1968 to 31 January 1970 (some issues were fill-ins by other artists).</ref>\n\n''The Man from BUNGLE'', spoofing the popular TV series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', was a spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye Junior Spy'' strip in ''Wham''. BUNGLE was a secret spy organisation in Britain, organised along more chaotic lines than UNCLE, featuring a secret agent who employed a wide variety of hugely unlikely gadgets in his fight against his humorous opponents. Baxendale himself drew the first few editions, which appeared as large single illustrations on some of the early covers of ''Smash'', after which Mike Lacey took over.\n\nThe second spin-off from Baxendale's ''Eagle-Eye'' strip was ''[[Grimly Feendish]]'' (subtitled ''The Rottenest Crook in the World''), which Leo Baxendale himself drew. Feendish had been the most popular character in the earlier strip, thanks to his ghoulish appearance, which was based on Uncle Fester in the American television series ''[[The Addams Family]]'' (and, presumably, on Charles Adams' illustrations from which the TV series was derived).<ref>Interestingly, the strip would probably have been ''banned'' if this had been an American comic, as the [[Comics Code Authority]] prohibited presentation of crime in comics if it tended to create sympathy for the criminal, and this strip appears to fall foul of that restriction.</ref> The new strip at one point occupied a prestigious position, as the full-colour back cover feature each week, and survived throughout the entire run of 162 issues published by Odhams (even though, after giving up its cover status, it was sometimes ignominiously reduced to only a quarter-page \"filler\").\n\n''Bad Penny'' was another memorable Baxendale creation. Its title logo featured a portrait of Penny herself, alongside the 'Bad Penny' caption, and an illustration of a giant pre-decimal One Penny coin (the coin suggesting the connection with the proverb from which the character's name originated).\n\nShe had some similarities with Baxendale's earlier Minnie the Minx character in ''The Beano''. When he had been drawing Minnie, he had concentrated on experimenting with facial expressions and character traits. By the time he began working on ''Bad Penny'' his drawing style had matured, with an equal concentration on developing a zany but tight storyline, less emphasis on close-ups of facial expressions, but retaining the essentials needed to put over a character's own personality traits.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.6\"/>\n\nBad Penny was so popular that she survived the changes of 1969, and continued to appear in the new ''Smash''. When the strip was eventually dropped, in 1970, Bad Penny herself still continued to appear, albeit infrequently, making occasional appearances in Baxendale's ''The Swots and the Blots'' as a new member of the Blots.\n\nAs had happened in ''Wham'', artists such as Mike Lacey were commissioned from time to time to \"ghost\" Baxendale's style. Baxendale was allowed to sign his early work on ''Smash'', so there is a way to distinguish which strips he personally drew during his time at Odhams.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075207/http://26pigs.com/wham/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Wham!|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref><ref>In practice, Baxendale signed very few of his strips, so it is quite difficult to tell which are his and which are other artists substituting for him.</ref> After he transferred to Fleetway, another IPC subsidiary, he still contributed strips to ''Smash'', but now worked \"undercover\", i.e. without signing them. He explained this in his autobiography, ''A Very Funny Business'' (Duckworth, 1978, page&nbsp;91): \"I was in a delightful situation. Working under my own name, a lot was expected of me. Publishers ''expected'' me to cram my drawings with funny detail. A double standard operated. Working undercover, I was able to reduce the layouts to the simplest terms. Backgrounds were minimal or non-existent \u2014 just a horizon line. And there was no ancillary comic detail \u2014 just the characters acting out the story line against an empty backdrop.\"\n\nThe most bizarre of the Odhams humour strips was ''The Nervs'', depicting a group of little characters inhabiting a schoolboy called Fatty: the strip showed them running Fatty like a group of workers running a factory. Allocated two pages, it followed the same formula as the strip ''Georgie's Germs'' from ''Wham!''. Fatty was aptly named, with the tiny Nervs battling to save the fat twerp's stomach from its numerous overloads, as a minute never passed which was free from him guzzling!\n\nDrawn for the majority of its run by Graham Allen,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> in its final months during 1968-69 [[Ken Reid (comics artist)|Ken Reid]]<ref>Comics artist [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Ken%20Reid Ken Reid]</ref> \u2014 previously of ''Queen of the Seas'', and who had earlier contributed the ''Dare-a-Day Davy''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/dadd.htm|title=Ken Reid's Dare A Day Davy|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> strip to ''Pow'' \u2014 drew this double-page feature.\n\nReid's career had begun at ''The Beano'' in the 1950s, but for Odhams he had already produced the long running success ''Frankie Stein'', in ''Wham!'', before taking on ''Queen of the Seas'' in the early issues of ''Smash!'' and the  ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip in ''Pow!''.<ref name=\"British Comic World 1984 p.7\"/> He turned ''The Nervs'' into an extremely surreal, even visceral, strip; achieving a rare level of hilarity and bawdiness, in a subversive presentation of comical horror \u2014 and in the process alarming IPC's management !<ref name=\"Career history of artist Ken Reid\"/>\n\nHe already had some degree of notoriety, as being the only Odhams artist whose work so disturbed the management that it was actually banned.<ref>[http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/weird1.html Review] of the banned ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' Frankenstein strip</ref><ref>''Dare-A-Day Davy'' [http://www.savoy.abel.co.uk/HTML/picts2.html Frankenstein strip], published in ''Weird Fantasy''&nbsp;#1 in 1969</ref> At the suggestion of Vance Gledhill of Blackpool, Davy was dared to dig up Frankenstein's monster (in the ''Dare-A-Day Davy'' strip) and bring him back to life \u2013 for which Reid decided to employ the \"kiss of life\"!

This was a device for featuring, as guest stars in the strip each week, an assortment of popular TV stars. The strip's debut appearance, for instance, featured Robert Vaughn and David McCallum, stars of top-rated secret agent show ''The Man From UNCLE'', maximising their appearance by splashing them across the front cover. It was hoped that by bringing popular television stars into its pages, this would make TV's growing popularity work ''for'' the comic \u2014 a not very subtle ploy to boost its circulation and sales.\n\n''Sammy Shrink'' (subtitled ''The Smallest Boy in the World'')<ref name=\"auto3\"/> was a humour strip about a boy who was only two inches tall. Sammy had the most successful \u2014 but also the most chequered \u2014 career of all the characters featured in ''Smash'', having originated in ''Wham'', then moved to ''Pow'' when they merged, arriving in ''Smash'' when it in turn absorbed ''Pow'', and would subsequently be revived in ''Knockout'', finally ending his career in ''Whizzer and Chips'' when it absorbed ''Knockout'' in June&nbsp;1973.\n\n''Ronnie Rich'' featured the richest kid in the world, who stands to inherit a fortune if only he can get rid of the money he's got. Drawn by Gordon Hogg,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> each week Ronnie spent his every last penny, in some reckless or extravagant way, only to have his scheme backfire and make him richer than ever. He never did get his hands on the fortune.\n\nOften a half-page feature, ''Percy's Pets'' drawn by Stan McMurtry (alias Mac)<ref>Comics artist [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1040731/Macs-secret-lady-Britains-cartoonist-reveals-hidden-images-wife.html Stan McMurtry]</ref> was popular enough to go on to make sporadic reappearances from time to time in the new ''Smash'' after March&nbsp;1969. Percy was a small plump schoolboy, who filled his family's home with his exotic collection of pets. These included (from time to time) an elephant, a giraffe, a hippopotamus, a snake, an ape \u2014 in fact almost every type of animal that might be found in a typical zoo \u2014 together with a parrot, a tortoise, a white mouse, and a hedgehog; thereby causing a predictable degree of comical chaos for his long suffering mum and dad.\n\nSome of the best-remembered strips were not included in all of the first 162 issues: a number of them were only acquired in #137, from the merger with ''Pow!'' (which had already absorbed the most popular strips running in ''Wham!'').\n\nOne such acquisition from ''Pow!'' was ''The Cloak''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.crazedchimp.co.uk/cloak.htm|title=Mike Higgs' The Cloak|website=www.crazedchimp.co.uk}}</ref> \u2014 like ''The Man From BUNGLE'', another humorous secret agent strip. The Cloak was the top agent for Britain's Special Squad, nominally a part of Scotland Yard; but he usually operated from his personal headquarters, known as the Secret Sanctum. His ingenuity and never-ending supply of gadgets and secret weapons gave him the edge over his somewhat odd enemies (some were ''very'' odd, including Deathshead and various other agents of G.H.O.U.L.).\n\nHe had some equally odd colleagues. Assisted initially by Mole (the tall one with the bald head, big nose and specs) and Shortstuff (the short squirt with the hairy nut and big eyeballs), he then began having adventures in which he found himself also alongside the sexy and flirtatious Lady Shady, the shady lady. The strip benefited from the unusual, idiosyncratic drawing style of Mike Higgs, whose overt inclusion of pop culture imagery made the strip seem extremely modern.\n\n''Wiz War'', drawn by Mike Brown, had also begun in ''Pow!'', and would be one of a handful of strips to survive the changes of 1969. Brown seems to have been unaware of the house rule banning artists from signing their work, as the strip often bore his name. The \"War\" in the title referred to a feud between two wizards, Wizard Prang and his enemy Demon Druid. Being a humour strip, the editorial staff allowed the hero the very silly name of Wizard Prang, a piece of RAF slang from the Second World War.\n\nOther than the fact that Prang was robed entirely in white, befitting his status as the good guy, and Demon Druid was always in black, being the villain of the piece, their costumes were quite similar - a flowing wizard's robe with stars on, and a pointed hat. They would fly around on broomsticks, zapping each other with spells: which turned the other into a toad, or something equally amusing. Wizard Prang was alternately helped and hindered by Englebert, his pet bird. The best feature of the strip was the sign above Wizard Prang's front door. This usually read \"Wizard Prang is... In\" (if he was at home) or \"Wizard Prang is... Out\" (if he was out and about); but if he'd had a bad time in the story, the sign would often make a humorous remark in the final panel, such as \"Wizard Prang is... All At Sea\".\n\nThe secret of Mike Brown, unacknowledged for many years, was that Leo Baxendale needed to earn money from Odhams without disclosing to Fleetway that he was now working for both companies. Accordingly, Baxendale now pencilled the drawings, and Brown, who was a cartoon film animator, inked them in. In this way, they turned out together large numbers of ''Bad Penny'' and ''Grimly Feendish'' strips, which they sold to Odhams under Brown's name \u2014 a situation Baxendale referred to, in his 1978 autobiography, as working ''undercover''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984),p.10</ref>\n\nLost in the merger with ''Pow'' were ''Charlie's Choice'', ''Ronnie Rich'' and ''The Man From BUNGLE''. Also lost in this merger, in effect, was Ken Reid's ''Dare-A-Day Davey'' strip, one of several established features in ''Pow'' which were dropped instead of transferring to ''Smash''.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.15</ref>\n\n===Odhams Adventure Strips===\n\nAs ''Smash'' was essentially a superhero and humour comic during the Odhams years, there were few traditional adventure strips in it; but a handful do bear special mention.\n\nThere were various well-remembered adventure strips in the first hundred issues, including some which were quite outstanding, such as ''Rubberman'', ''Experiment X'', ''The Legend Testers'', and ''The Python''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFrom issue 144 in November 1968 ''Smash'' was the only surviving ''Power Comic'', as this was the issue in which ''Smash and Pow'' (as it then was) merged with ''Fantastic''. Five British adventure serials were introduced in this issue, to plug the gap left by the loss of the withdrawn American superhero strips which had been major features of the four closed titles.\n\n''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' is an adventure strip in which a crime reporter on the Daily Globe newspaper is apparently killed while investigating a news story. The world believes newspaperman Jim Jordan is dead, but he still carries on his crusade against crime... calling himself The Spectre.\n\nHe is now fighting crime, rather than merely reporting it, using an array of gadgets which make it seem he is the ghost of the missing reporter. Hence his opponents are terrified to find that if they shoot him he doesn't die (a bullet-proof raincoat was the trick here). And he has a secret underground hideout beneath the statue erected in his memory, from which he would covertly and unexpectedly emerge, or disappear into, under cover of an artificial fog, to give the impression he was coming and going from the spirit world. His first case began in issue&nbsp;144, in which he tracks down Black Murdo, the racketeer who the world believes had murdered him.\n\n''Destination Danger'', a motor racing serial, also began in issue&nbsp;144. This strip was about a feud between a young English racing driver, Jeff Jackson, who was working for Puma Motors in the US, and his enemy Vic Stafford, the Puma team's chief driver, who has taken a bribe to throw a forthcoming race.\n\nAlthough new to ''Smash'', the old-fashioned artwork in the strips ''At Night Stalks... The Spectre'' and ''Destination Danger'' marked them out as reprints. The use of reprints was a cost-cutting measure, indicating the straightened financial circumstances of ''Smash'' at this point \u2013 if any evidence were needed beyond the closure of all four of the other ''Power Comics''.\n\n''Laird of the Apes'' was a science fiction strip, milking the popularity of the big budget Charlton Heston motion picture ''Planet of the Apes'' which was released earlier that year. In the strip, set in the 18th century, a young Scottish laird returns to the Highlands to aid his outlaw clansmen in their struggle with the English Redcoats, bringing with him a band of highly trained Apes.\n\nAn adventure strip with a sporting theme was the wrestling serial ''King of the Ring'', featuring Ken King, who was a champion of the grunt-'n'-grapple game (although in the earliest strips he had begun as a boxer). As was not exactly uncommon in the Odhams years, there was a tendency to give the characters very silly names. The most outrageous example in this strip was King's manager, who (in spite of ''not'' being Irish) was called Blarney Stone!\n\nBlarney's real name was originally Tim Stone, and Blarney was only a nickname; but this was soon forgotten. In order to fulfil Ken's ambition to travel, Blarney agrees to manage him on a world tour, if he'll agree to fight his way round the world!\n\nThe fifth adventure strip added was ''Brian's Brain'', drawn by Bert Vandeput,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> a serial with science fiction elements, continued from ''Pow''. This featured two schoolboys: the eponymous Brian and his friend Duffy Rolls. Brian Kingsley possessed an electronic Brain resembling a human skull, which he carried about in a box. It could communicate with him telepathically, glowing when active; and it could control the actions of animals if they were within a few yards, which was the limit of its brain-wave transmissions.\n\nAll five strips commenced in issue&nbsp;144; and all were serials, with cliff-hanger endings each week.\n\n===The Closure of the ''Power Comics''===\nWhat must always be born in mind is that, in the comics industry, the 1960s were not the 1930s. With the advent in Britain of commercial television, in 1955 \u2014 displacing the staid, old-fashioned children's television offered by the BBC up to that point \u2014 the ever-increasing competition from the ''boob-tube'' began a continuous (and accelerating) decline in comics circulation. Throughout the 1960s, in consequence, the circulation wars fought in the comics publishing industry were fought out against a backdrop of ever-declining circulation figures.\n\nFollowing the initial success of ''Wham'' in 1964, Odhams had launched four more [[Power Comics]] during 1966 and '67, including ''Smash'', only to close them in quick succession: merging each in turn into the survivors until by 1969 only ''Smash'' remained. Whereas 1968 began with all five ''Power Comics'' apparently flourishing, by the year's end only ''Smash'' was still being published.<ref name=\"The Power Comics: Wham!\"/> Even the sleepiest of readers began to notice that something was seriously wrong, as the increasingly frantic series of mergers resulted in ever more ludicrous titles, culminating in the astonishing ''Smash and Pow incorporating Fantastic'' (commonly spoofed as ''Smash, Pow, Wham, incorporating Fantastic and Terrific'').\n\nThe question is why, in a limited market such as the UK, they took such a big risk as to launch five titles (which in hindsight looks an unwise decision by the Odhams management), if it was so quickly obvious that the market could only support one? It has been suggested<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> that it was common practice for a publisher to quickly clone a successful title, in order to forestall its competitors from doing so. That does not seem to be the case here. The comic's only distinctive feature was its American superhero strips, so ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' (which most of the time contained ''only'' Marvel superhero strips) might loosely be described as clones of ''Smash'', even though they lacked any humour strips; but IPC had an ''exclusive'' licence from Marvel Comics to reprint Marvel's strips in the UK, which precluded anyone else from doing so.\n\nThe actual answer lies in the unexpected nature of the economic crisis of 1968 that hit the British economy, resulting in the devaluation of the Pound.<ref>In Britain, the devaluation crisis was major news due to certain ill-judged remarks by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who would be mocked for the rest of his career for his infamous falsehood, ''This will not affect the Pound in your pocket!''</ref> The economic chaos began with a Sterling crisis in Britain in 1967, leading to devaluation in the November. There then followed a crisis for the U.S. dollar in March&nbsp;1968 which had a cascade effect on the international economic system, sending first the French franc and then the West German deutschmark into devaluation, and culminating in a ''new'' Sterling crisis in Britain in November&nbsp;1968.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2170396 ''The Economic Crisis of 1968''] \u2013 published in ''American Historical Review''</ref><ref>Article, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/dec2005/mccar-d30.shtml ''Eugene McCarthy \u2013 pivotal role in 1968 Political Crisis'']</ref>\n\nThese repeated falls in the value of the Pound against the U.S. dollar significantly increased the cost of publishing the American strips, which had to be paid for in dollars, and raised the daunting spectre of further increases if the Pound fell in value yet again. Increasing the cover price of the ''Power Comics'' to compensate was impossible because of stiff competition (with sales on a sharp downward spiral, as circulation fell victim to the ever increasing popularity of television); so the fall in the value of Sterling made the American strips unaffordable.\n\nThe toughness of the competition is apparent from examining other contemporary titles.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/ British Comics] website</ref> The first issue of its stablemate ''Fantastic'', published in February 1967, cost 9d for 40 pages (due to its very high content of American superhero strips), a cover price which forced ''Fantastic'' to close within 18 months. ''Terrific'', having the same high content of American material, also had a high cover price of 9d, and closed even quicker.\n\nIn contrast, the comics ''Dandy'' and ''Beano'' published by the rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] organisation sold at a cover price of 3d. ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'' cost three times as much, which (even with double the number of pages compared to many DC Thomson titles) proved unsustainable. This is not surprising, given that ''Wham'' and ''Pow'' each peaked at a cover price of 7d, and even that proved unsustainable.\n\n''Smash'' had launched in February&nbsp;1966 with a cover price of 7d for 24&nbsp;pages. By March&nbsp;1969, although its cover price had not changed, circumstances had conspired to increase its page count, such that each issue now contained 36&nbsp;pages. In fact the page count jumped overnight from 24 pages to 36 pages (a fifty percent increase), with a consequent sharp rise in production costs, and so a marked decline in profit-per-copy.\n\nThe tipping point was issue 144, in which ''Smash'', ''Pow'' and ''Fantastic'' were merged into a single title. The recently created ''Smash and Pow'' lost its ''Daredevil'' and ''Spider-Man'' strips, which together had comprised a full third of each 24 page issue, but now had to accommodate both ''Thor'' and ''Fantastic Four'' from the discontinued titles, plus a whole slew of new British adventure strips (which were being added in preparation for the comic's impending transition to solely-British content).\n\nAll this could not be achieved within the standard ''Smash'' format of 24 pages. So IPC now \"bit the bullet\" and increased the page count, at a single bound, by fifty percent \u2014 a necessity if they were to achieve their intention of reproducing with ''Smash'' the successful formula which was buoying-up sales of their most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant'', both of which were 36-pagers (in effect, to produce another clone of them: an identical mix of adventure and humour, with an identical page count, at an identical price).\n\nOne fundamental difficulty for the ''Power Comics'', however, was always the stark economic truth that a kid could buy both ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'', at 3d each, and still have change left over, for what it cost to buy ''Smash!'', ''Wham!'' or ''Pow!'' at 7d each. However, the DC Thomson titles only had 16 pages, and this more than anything drove up the page count in ''Smash!'', from its original 24 pages to 36 pages, and eventually to 40 pages in 1970 (i.e. it might be more than double the price of a DC Thomson title but it was also more than double the size).<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.9</ref> The difficulty was that the much lower price of ''The Dandy'' and ''The Beano'' gave those titles a significant advantage, since a kid could choose to buy only one of them, at 3d \u2014 a winning competitive advantage which, as of 1966, would keep both of the DC Thomson titles afloat for more than 30 years to come.\n\nThe highly competitive nature of the UK's publishing industry meant margins were thin: a minimum number of sales each week were needed to reach break-even point, and the lower the cover price, the greater was the number of sales needed to reach that point; but the higher the cover price, the fewer were the number of sales that could actually be achieved.\n\nThe juvenile readers (or their parents) might be able to afford two or three comics a week, but by publishing five ''Power Comics'' IPC were pricing themselves out of the market. For the situation in Britain was not like that in America, where, with comics published just once a month, a child might afford five titles. In Britain, comics were published weekly.\n\nUnder those conditions the ''Power Comics'' were effectively competing with each other \u2014 a factor IPC were certainly aware of, as the letters pages in ''Smash'', in 1968, actually carried readers' complaints that they couldn't afford all five ''Power'' titles. The five together cost an astonishing three shillings and threpence a week (39d), to buy them all, far beyond the reach of the average child's weekly pocket money.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.13</ref>\n\nThe ''Power Comics'' were also competing with IPC's other titles, including [[Lion (comics)|Lion]], [[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]] and [[Buster (comics)|Buster]], potentially dragging the Group's entire line into bankruptcy. Rationalisation, by closing some of the titles, would produce an overall benefit, as it would dramatically cut IPC's production costs. Although it would mean fewer titles, as IPC's comics were actually competing against each other it ought to result in better sales for the survivors. In theory, there would be no overall loss of sales or revenue, provided readers switched from the closing titles to surviving IPC ones (rather than to rival [[D. C. Thomson & Co.|DC Thomson]] ones).\n\nAnother factor Odhams had not anticipated was the distribution of American comic books within the UK. Although this had always been a consideration, the volume of such comics arriving in Britain had traditionally been small, and their distribution haphazard. In 1968, distribution and quantity suddenly underwent a marked improvement: in America, Marvel Comics' owner, Martin Goodman, pulled off a business coup that overnight freed Marvel from a restrictive distribution agreement, which for a decade had limited it to publishing only 8 titles a month: Marvel was suddenly quadrupeling its monthly output, and dozens of new titles were flooding into Britain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://emagazinepdf.com/2017/05/marvel_comics_-_the_untold_story/|title=''Marvel Comics \u2014 The Untold Story'', Sean Howe (2012)}}</ref> Odhams' black-and-white [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] reprints in their ''Power Comics'' range suddenly faced much more extensive competition from four-colour Marvel originals, and this began to harm sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/03/40-year-flashback-smash-regenerates.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: 40 Year Flashback: SMASH! regenerates|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the turbulent economic conditions, any part of IPC's business which was loss-making had no future. Standard industry practice was to close a comic or magazine if its revenues dipped ''towards'' the break-even point; publishers did not wait for a title to actually incur losses.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/> Hence, merely to anticipate losses on the other four titles (''Pow'', ''Wham'', ''Fantastic'' and ''Terrific'') was enough to doom them. And the closures represented a major cost-cutting exercise, reducing the ongoing production costs on the ''Power Comics'' line by four-fifths.\n\nAs for actual losses incurred due to the sudden and unexpected nature of the problem, and the inability to quickly terminate the long-term contracts with the Americans, ''Smash'' as sole survivor couldn't hope to generate enough income on its own to meet these. In fact it didn't need to. The fortunate circumstance that the ''Power Comics'' were all published by Odhams Press Ltd, a subsidiary company with limited liability, meant that it was possible to ring-fence all debts on the Odhams publications within that one company, thus preventing any losses affecting the rest of the IPC Group (since IPC's other titles were all published by other IPC subsidiaries). Accordingly, with effect from 1 January 1969 ''Smash'' was transferred to IPC Magazines Ltd, a new IPC subsidiary formed during 1968,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comics.org/publisher/1946/|title=GCD :: Publisher :: IPC|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> leaving Odhams with no continuing titles, and ''Smash'' started again from scratch.<ref>[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk//companysearch?disp=1&frfsh=1414205283&#result Odhams Press Ltd] continued in being until 7 January 1998, when it changed its name to Formpart (No.11) Limited, which still exists today; currently a dormant private company.</ref>\n\nDespite being the longest survivor, and inheriting many popular strips from the other four titles, ''Smash'' was only a limited success. It was plainly on shakey ground: for, hard on the heels of the closure of the other titles, in the spring of 1969 IPC quickly made extensive changes to it, dropping the last remaining Marvel superhero strips, to shed the expense of the licensing fee for using them (having already dropped ''Batman''), and ending many other strips too.\n\nIn consequence of the decision to discontinue the American reprints, as each ''Power Comic'' closed its superhero strips were given up. Only in the case of ''Fantastic'', where the existing contract with Marvel had some months to run, were those strips transferred to its replacement, the merged ''Smash incorporating Fantastic'', until the contract expired in March&nbsp;1969.\n\n''Smash'' then introduced a new cover feature, new strips, and free gifts. In all but name it was a new comic. Even so, it required yet another major shakeup 12 months later, in the spring of 1970, when further changes of editorial policy were imposed by new owners Reed International, who had bought out IPC that year. This resulted, among other things, in the dropping of the newly introduced ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature in favour of a new lead serial: an adventure series entitled ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test''.\n\nWithin the British market, boys' comics for the age group which was too old for titles such as ''Beano'', ''Dandy'' and ''Sparky'' tended to focus around adventure, sport and war (in titles such as ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''), or humour (in titles such as ''Buster''). In abandoning its superheroes, ''Smash'' sought to attract readers of both types, by offering traditional adventure as well as humour.\n\nTo place these changes in context, the ''Power Comics'' were not the only casualties of the turmoil at IPC in 1969. Hulton's long-running adventure comic ''Eagle'' was also cancelled, merging with Fleetway's ''Lion'' from 2 May 1969. The merged comic was known briefly as ''Lion and Eagle'', but quickly reverted simply to ''Lion''. The humour comic, ''Giggle'', aimed at the slightly younger market dominated by Fleetway's ''Buster'', was also dropped, being merged into ''Buster'' in the spring of 1969 to form ''Buster and Giggle''. As ever, the name change lasted only long enough to absorb the discontinued comic's readership: the reference to ''Giggle'' failed to see out the year, and by December the title had reverted to simply ''Buster'' once more.<ref>''Buster'' [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/ cover gallery] at Wordpress.com</ref> And ''Buster'', like ''Smash'', also now became a publication of the Group's newest subsidiary, IPC Magazines Ltd.\n\nThe surviving titles at both Odhams and at Fleetway were now transferred to a merged operation, at New Year 1969, as merely a part of IPC's newest division, IPC Magazines Ltd, and were placed under the responsibility of Jack Legrand, formerly the Managing Editor of Fleetway's juvenile publications.<ref>British Comic World, Issue #3 (June 1984), p.17</ref>\n\nA notable feature of the Odhams years was how few advertisements the comic carried. There were occasional quarter-page inserts, mainly advertising foreign Postage Stamps for stamp collectors, or Subbuteo table-football; but they were few and far between, and their combined total didn't usually exceed one page per issue. Reflecting its financial problems, the relaunched comic under IPC Magazines carried a significantly greater amount of advertising. One obvious change was the back cover (the only in-colour page apart from the front cover), which gradually began to carry colourful full-page advertisements. On the inside pages, too, there was a much more noticeable quantity of adverts: each issue typically carried 4 full-page ads, plus two half-page ads. It was a noticeable feature of the relaunch that the comic now expanded to 40 pages, in order to cope with the need to carry an extra 4 pages of advertising in each issue.<ref>Cover galleries on the [https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ British Comics] website</ref>\n\nThis was a potentially significant new strategy, and a major change of policy. No longer did the profitability of the comic rest exclusively with the income derived from its sales figures. That sales income was now supplemented by advertising revenue, and without even having to sacrifice any significant amount of page space, nor cancel any strips, thanks to adding the additional pages.\n\n===Turmoil in 1967===\nThe events of 1968 were not even the first threat to the survival of the ''Power Comics''. Odhams had faced their first serious crisis in May 1967.\nThe editorial page warned readers in issue 68 that ''Smash'', initially printed by St Clements Press Ltd of London, had to find new printers within one month, or face closure. In the event, Odhams were able to sign a contract with Southernprint Ltd of Poole in Dorset in time to maintain publication.\n\n==''SMASH'' after Odhams==\n\nIn January 1969 Odhams ceased to exist as a publishing imprint, and ''Smash'' now became an IPC Magazines publication. Most of the consequences of the change didn't become apparent until the issue cover-dated 15 March, in which the comic changed dramatically. IPC had waited three months to relaunch ''Smash'', because, on the one hand, it needed some lead-time in which to ready new strips, and, on the other, in the publishing industry Spring was traditionally considered a good time to launch a new (in this case, a virtually new) comic.<ref name=\"lewstringer.blogspot.co.uk\"/>\n\nWith the re-launch, ''Smash'' became the last ever British comic to feature a variety mix of adventure, humour and sports themed stories. Subsequent boys' comics featured exclusively sports, or war, or humour; such as ''[[Scorcher (magazine)|Scorcher and Score]]'' and ''[[Shoot (football magazine)|Shoot]]'' (which featured only soccer), and ''[[Action (comics)|Action]]'' and ''[[Battle Picture Weekly|Battle]]'' (which featured only war stories).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817075250/http://26pigs.com/smash/index.html|title=26Pigs.com : UK Comics : Smash|date=17 August 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>  A hallmark of this policy was to be the even-handedness with which the editorial staff drew the multitude of reprint strips featured in the new ''Smash'' from both ''Lion'' and ''Buster'', in seeking to appeal to readers of both (i.e. mixing serious and humorous strips without discrimination).\n\nThe symbol of the change was the new cover feature, ''Warriors of the World''. This now replaced ''The Swots and Blots'', who, drawn by Mike Lacey, had occupied the cover during the final part of the Odhams years. Happily, ''The Swots and the Blots'' survived (and prospered) on the inside pages, now drawn by Leo Baxendale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html|title=BLIMEY! The Blog of British Comics: Christmas comics: Valiant 1971|first=Lew|last=Stringer|date=17 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nWith the first relaunch issue (No.163) bearing a cover feature entitled ''Warriors of the World No.1'', the former numbering was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/25870/ Smash! - Title Notes] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> To have maintained the original sequential numbering alongside the ''Warriors of the World'' series could only have caused confusion.\n\nThe revamped ''Smash'', now comprising 40 pages, featured all-British strips \u2014 adventure serials, humour strips, and sporting strips \u2014 many of which were reprints from ''Lion'', such as ''Eric the Viking'' (originally ''Karl the Viking''), ''The Battle of Britain'' (originally ''Britain in Chains''), and ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''; and others which were reprints from ''Buster'', such as ''Wacker'' (originally ''Elmer''), ''Monty Muddle - The Man from Mars'' (originally ''Milkiway - The Man from Mars''), and ''Consternation Street''; but strictly no American superheroes.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The number of reprint strips was another significant indicator of its troubled financial situation, reprints being significantly cheaper than commissioning new strips.\n\nOf the former Odhams strips, only a handful survived. Humour strips which continued were ''The Swots and the Blots'', ''Wiz War'' and ''Bad Penny''. Additionally, ''Percy's Pets'' made occasional appearances (but did not appear every week). Much mourned were the loss of ''The Cloak'' and ''The Man from BUNGLE'', dropped due to the waning popularity of spy spoofs (in 1968 the TV series ''The Man from UNCLE'' had been cancelled); and especially mourned was the loss of Ken Reid and ''The Nervs''.\n\nThe serious offerings fared even worse. For although the survivors appeared to include ''Sergeant Rock - Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'', in reality neither of these were genuinely from the Odhams era. Both had begun only a few weeks earlier, in issues 156 and 158 respectively. They were really a part of the relaunch, but were introduced slightly ahead of time to disguise that fact. The only genuine survivor from the adventure strips of the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', and even that had only begun with issue&nbsp;144, in November&nbsp;1968.\n\nAfter a few months, superheroes appeared to be making a comeback. The Editorial column admitted receiving complaints from readers about the loss of the Marvel strips; and, in the autumn of 1969, six months after the ''Fantastic Four'' and ''Thor'' had been dropped, an all-British superhero called Tri-Man appeared, debuting in the issue of 13 September, and the character also featured in the ''Smash'' Annual that Christmas. Some indication of the effort put into this character is the fact that he was given sole possession of the front cover of the Annual! The adventures of Johnny Meek featured a hero who had triple-superpowers, hence the name Tri-Man. He leaped about rooftops (shades of Spider-Man, from the long-vanished ''Pow''), and got his powers from a ray device once every 24 hours (shades of DC's ''Green Lantern''). But the strip did not prove popular, and quietly vanished in the reshuffles of 1970.\n\nIn the light of how few strips of any sort survived from the Odhams era, and given that none of the superhero strips survived at all (which, according to the Letters pages,<ref>It was a feature of the Odhams years that the comic included a page for readers' letters, like the American comics published by Marvel and DC on which it was based, but the Letters Page was dropped in March 1969 in favour of extra advertising space.</ref> were the most popular feature of the ''Power Comics''), it would be stretching the truth to say that ''Smash'' inherited the best of the Odhams strips. Stylistically, ''The Swots and the Blots'' was the most creative and sophisticated Odhams strip (save only ''The Nervs''), and it did survive. But it was only one strip. And ''The Nervs'', which was objectively a more sophisticated strip in 1968, did not.\n\nMoreover, the publisher was taking a significant risk by re-launching the former ''Power Comic'' as, in effect, a clone of IPC's most popular titles, ''Lion'' and ''Valiant''. The publisher hoped it could repeat the success of ''Valiant'' and ''Lion'' by copying their successful formula. Nevertheless, without its discontinued superheroes ''Smash'' had nothing unique about it that might attract new readers, compared to its stablemates \u2014 featuring as it did a mix of strips reprinted from (or based on the style of) ''Lion'' and ''Buster''.\n\n===IPC Humour Strips===\n\nAs under Odhams, humour continued to play a large part in the relaunched comic (in terms of the page count): not to the extent it did in ''Buster'', but at least as much as in ''Valiant'' or ''Lion''.\n\nWith the relaunch, ''The Swots and the Blots'' (one of the handful of surviving Odhams strips) moved from the prestigious front cover to the centre pages. Nevertheless, now drawn by Leo Baxendale it became a standard bearer for sophisticated artwork. Baxendale began a five-year run on the strip (beginning in ''Smash'' and continuing in its successor, ''Valiant and Smash'', with some fill-ins by Les Barton<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=2818|title=Smash! comic the swots and the blots- Leo Baxendale - Comics UK|website=comicsuk.co.uk}}</ref>), by adopting a new style, one which influenced many others in the comics field, just as his earlier ''Beano'' work had done; and in the process attaining a new, deliriously daft, high standard, one rarely approached by other strips.\n\nNew humour strips featured in the relaunch (new to ''Smash'' at any rate) included a half-page cartoon strip drawn by Nadal, entitled ''Big 'Ead'', detailing the humorous misadventures of a Mr&nbsp;Knowall character, summed up by the strip's catchphrase, continually bellowed at the lead character by his irate victims: \"''Have a care there, Big&nbsp;'Ead!''\" Reprinted from ''Buster'', where it had initially run \u2014 under the same title \u2014 from 28 May 1960 to 18 February 1961.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p43</ref>\n\n''Wacker'' was a single page cartoon strip, subtitled ''He's All at Sea''. Drawn at different times by Rafart and by Roy Wilson, it concerned the crazy antics in the Royal Navy of Mis-leading Seaman Wacker, who was forever driving the Captain of HMS Impossible toward a nervous breakdown. Despite the Liverpudlian overtones of his surname, Wacker seemed not to be a Scouser \u2013 which may have been because it was ''not'' his real name! The strip, although new to ''Smash'', had run in ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'' from 29 October 1960 to 17 October 1964 under its real title, ''Elmer''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/buster-60s/|title=Buster 60s|date=29 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/>\n\nAnother humour strip new to ''Smash'' was the World War Two spoof, ''Nutt and Bolt, the Men From W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' Set in 1940, this featured an English scientist named Professor Nutt, who was a boffin inventing eccentric secret weapons for a department of the War Office known as W.H.E.E.Z.E. (short for Weapon Handling Early Experimental and Zoning Establishment), who was kept out of trouble by his Army \"minder\", Sgt&nbsp;'Lightning' Bolt. Nutt and Bolt were perpetually clashing with a cunning Nazi scientist named Doktor Skull. This was another reprint strip, perhaps from ''Lion''. As its title implies, it was born out of the earlier popularity of the ''Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' television series. However, the strip had only a short run in ''Smash'', being replaced after just 22&nbsp;issues.\n\nYet it was not only in the plainly cartoon-style strips that humour flourished in the new ''Smash''. Many of the ostensibly more serious offerings were, in reality, humour strips: in particular, ''His Sporting Lordship'' and ''The World Wide Wanderers''; but there was also a strong humorous undercurrent in the new lead serial, ''Master of the Marsh''.\n\n===IPC Sporting Strips===\n\nSporting strips were now the order of the day. Reflecting this, the new lead, on page 3, was ''Master of the Marsh'', drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]],<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\">Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Solano Lopez]</ref> a sports serial about Patchman, a strange hermit who lived in the East Anglian fens. He was appointed as the new sports master at Marshside Secondary School, nicknamed 'The Marsh', because he was the only person who could control the kids \u2014 a group of hooligans known as 'the Monsters of the Marsh'. There was an association of ideas between fens and marsh, reinforced by the fact that Patchman camped in the inaccessible heart of the marshes. He was a burly woodsman who had always lived in the Fens, and could communicate after a fashion with the local wildlife, for whom he acted as protector.\n\nThe strip initially featured humorous stories about the attempts of Knocker Reeves \u2013 the worst of the 'monsters' \u2013 to get the better of the new teacher. But eventually it transpired that Patchman was secretly the guardian of a collection of relics left behind by [[Hereward the Wake]], a warlord who had fought the Norman invaders in the Fens during the 11th Century. In this respect, the strip had an occasional tendency to embrace science fiction overtones.\n\nOf the sports-based stories, the only survivor from the Odhams years was ''King of the Ring'', which continued to prosper. Possibly feeling the strip was suffering in the credibility stakes, the new editorial team made a decision to change the name of King's manager, who bore the remarkable name (actually a nickname) of Blarney Stone! They threw Blarney out of the series and substituted a new manager with a less silly name. ''Ballyhoo Barnes'' wasn't all that much less silly, but it's the thought that counts! Even so, Blarney reappeared after a few weeks, by popular demand.\n\nThe most successful of the new sports-based strips (certainly the most long-running) was ''His Sporting Lordship'', drawn by Douglas Maxted.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-comics-valiant-1971.html Douglas Maxted]</ref> This humorous hit proved so popular that it ultimately became one of the few to outlast ''Smash'' itself. Henry Nobbins had been a labourer on a building site until he inherited the title of Earl of Ranworth and five million pounds. Before he could touch the money, however, he had to become champion at a number of sports. He also had to evade the nefarious attentions of Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, who was a rival claimant to the fortune, and Parkinson's villainous henchman, Fred Bloggs.\n\nLord Henry, as he had now become, was more than ably assisted by his Butler, Jarvis, who he had inherited from the previous Earl. And Jarvis proved indispensable. Henry was never portrayed as anything other than an able athlete and a good natured bloke, leaving Jarvis to supply the cunning which was (frequently) needed to defeat the dastardly Mr&nbsp;Parkinson, and prevent Henry's ancestral home, Castle Plonkton, from being turned into a glue factory.\n\nThe relaunch included a short-lived football strip with humorous overtones, entitled ''The World-Wide Wanderers'', about a League football team composed of eleven players from eleven different countries \u2014 not such a funny joke today! Football manager Harry Kraft found himself a passenger on a ship passing through the Suez Canal; ships from all over the world called there, and the crews conducted impromptu soccer matches to while away the time in port. Some of the crews had been stranded there, and constant soccer practice (since there was nothing else to do) had caused them to develop fantastic footballing skills. Kraft shipped eleven of them, from as many different countries, back to England; and they used their highly unorthodox individual skills to play as a team in the old Fourth Division.\n\n===IPC Adventure Strips===\n\nThe other staple of the new ''Smash'' was adventure serials, and far and away the most successful of these was ''The Incredible Adventures of [[Janus Stark]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/search/label/Janus%2BStark|title=British Comic Art}}</ref> written by Tom Tully,<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183041 Janus Stark] at the Grand Comics Database</ref> featuring an escapologist in Victorian London who appeared to be simply an unusual act on the music-hall stage, but who privately used his extraordinary abilities to battle against injustice. Stark had an unusually flexible bone structure, enabling him to get out of an astonishing variety of tight situations, thanks to training received in childhood from his mentor, Blind Largo. Drawn by [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez (comics)|Solano Lopez]], there was more than a touch of Reed Richards, from the departed ''Fantastic Four'' strip, in Stark's uncanny abilities.<ref>Stark's flexible bone structure, which was the basis of his career as an escapologist in the theatres, was perhaps more akin to ''Rubberman'', a character who had featured in ''Smash'' in 1966</ref> Lopez's dark, moody artwork also gave the strip a perfect 19th Century setting.<ref name=\"Comics artist Solano Lopez\"/> The strip was one of the few to survive the merger of ''Smash'' into ''Valiant'' in 1971, and is still well remembered today. As a mark of its popularity, from week 30 it replaced ''Master of the Marsh'' as the lead serial on page 3 (swapping places with the latter, which was thus relegated to an inconspicuous location on pages 12 and 13).\n\nThis brings up the matter of economics once more. Solano Lopez was a foreign illustrator, born in the Argentine, who worked at a studio in Spain. For reasons of cost, IPC had taken a policy decision to source artwork from cheaper sources outside the UK.<ref name=\"blogs.birminghammail.net\"/> Along with the presence in the new ''Smash'' of reprint strips, which were much cheaper than commissioning new strips, this is yet another indicator of the financial pressure the comic was still under, and the absolute necessity of cutting production costs to the bone in order to make it financially viable.\n\nAnother long-running adventure strip was ''The Battle of Britain'', in which secret agent Simon Kane fought against Baron Rudolph, a usurper who had seized control of Britain using a secret weapon. The weapon emitted a sound wave which paralysed anyone who wasn't protected against it. Rudolph set up a police state, similar in emblems and uniforms to medieval England at the time of King John, and Kane led the resistance against him.\n\nIn spite of the title, the strip had no connection with the Second World War! Drawn for the initial 40 issues by Geoff Campion, and thereafter by [[John Stokes (comics)|John Stokes]],<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p109</ref> it was in fact a reprint; hence it, too, was an indication of the comic's troubled financial status (reprints being cheaper than new strips). It originally ran in ''[[Lion (comics)|Lion]]'' from 29 February 1964 to 28 May 1966 under various titles including ''Britain in Chains'' and ''The Battle for Britain'', where the hero was called Vic Gunn. The editorial staff of ''Smash'' took a decision to change the names of the leading characters from Gunn and Barrel (i.e. ''gun barrel''), to slightly less absurd ones; and so were born secret agent Simon Kane and his assistant Tubby. This had been a very long-running strip in ''Lion'', so much so that ''Smash'' actually ceased publication \u2014 in April 1971 \u2014 before it had reprinted the entire run from ''Lion'', and in the final issue created an (unconvincing) new ending for the serial.\n\n''Rebbels on the Run'' was another adventure serial, featuring three young brothers whose surname was Rebbel, who run away from an orphanage to avoid being split up. After a few months on the run, the strip took an amazing turn and \u2014 renamed ''The Rebbel Robot'' \u2014 became a science fiction serial, when the boys discovered that their late father's mind was preserved within the brain of a robot, which became their unofficial guardian. With it they embarked on a quest to track down a criminal known as The Genie, who had murdered their real father \u2014 who, in a further improbable turn of events, turned out to be a secret agent!\n\n''Eric the Viking'', a continuing serial featuring its eponymous Viking hero, and set in the Dark Ages, was another reprint from ''Lion'', where it had run under the title ''Karl the Viking'', as a set of 13 stories, from 29 October 1960 until 29 September 1964, written by Ken Bulmer.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\">Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p108</ref> The change of name to Eric probably reflects on the continuing fame (during the 1960s) of a real-life Viking leader in Dark Age Britain, Eric Bloodaxe, who history records was King in Viking York in the 10th Century. The strip is well remembered under its original title, as it was drawn by a famous comics artist, Don Lawrence.<ref>Comics artist [http://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2012/11/this-week-in-1970-smash-goes-on-hiatus.html Don Lawrence]</ref><ref>[http://www.donlawrence.co.uk/shop/index.php?hg=2&sg=35 Deluxe hardback collection of ''Karl the Viking'' strips] by Don Lawrence</ref> Eric (and Karl) fought a weird but impressive collection of legendary and fantasy monsters, in sword-and-sorcery epics which had some reflections in Lawrence's art for his contemporary work on the highly regarded all-colour science fiction strip ''[[The Trigan Empire]]'' then running in ''Look and Learn''. This was not even the first reprint: retitled ''Swords of the Sea Wolves'' it had initially been reprinted in ''Lion'', in part, between 1 October 1966 and 7 October 1967, with the lead character renamed Rolf the Viking.<ref name=\"Steve Holland p108\"/> And it would later be reprinted again, in the European version of ''Vulcan'': on that occasion translated into German and retitled 'Kobra'.\n\nTwo of the new IPC adventure strips \u2014 ''Sergeant Rock Paratrooper'' and ''Bunsen's Burner'' \u2014 were introduced five or six weeks early, in an attempt to conceal how few Odhams strips had actually survived, by making these appear to be existing strips although they were not. World War Two was the setting for the former, which, with occasional stories drawn by John Vernon,<ref>Fleetway Companion by Steve Holland, p88</ref> recounted the adventures of the 'Red Devils' of the Parachute Regiment. Initially, Sgt Rock was merely a narrator, introducing stories featuring other characters, so that it was actually tales-of-the-parachute-regiment, rather than tales of Sgt Rock himself. This was a device for reprinting old war stories from other comics: the strip had originally appeared in Fleetway's ''Hurricane'', from 4 July 1964 to 8 May 1965, entitled ''Paratrooper'', and continued in ''Tiger'' when that title absorbed ''Hurricane'' in the issue dated 15 May 1965. The reprints in ''Smash'' were reasonably successful, running for a year; and Sergeant Rock eventually featured as more than just narrator, with later editions sending him into action with the SAS, and marking the change by altering the title to ''Sergeant Rock - Special Air Service''. This change was noticeable, also, by a change of artist; seemingly \u2014 from the similarity of style \u2014 to the artist on the discontinued wartime strip, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.''.\n\n''Bunsen's Burner'' was a short-lived strip, lasting just a few weeks.<ref>It was discontinued during the reshuffles of August 1969, when various changes were quietly made to the comic over the course of a month.</ref> This was an adventure yarn with humorous overtones \u2013 its humorous content being trailed in its title: a reference to an item familiar to most schoolboys from their Chemistry classes. Ben Bunsen was the owner of a vintage car, which was known as \"the Burner\" because it was so old it was steam-driven! Like an old-fashioned steam train it had a boiler which had to be stoked, as it ran on coal instead of petrol. Ben and his pal had to drive the Burner around the world, as a condition of Ben inheriting his uncle's fortune; but a rival claimant (shades of ''His Sporting Lordship''!) was secretly out to stop them.\n\nAnother adventure strip which had a sadly brief run, lasting only 47 weeks, but which is very well-remembered today, was ''Cursitor Doom''. In this spooky and atmospheric series,<ref>The strip had various artists during its one year run, but far and away the most effective of them was the talented Eric Bradbury, and it is mainly his serials from which the strip's enduring reputation derives</ref> Cursitor Doom, master investigator of the strange and mystic, who openly practiced sorcery in the strip, battled against the dark forces of evil, ably assisted by the pounding fists of his assistant, Angus McCraggan. Doom battled against genuine spirits and sorcerers, in tales including ''The Case of Kalak the Dwarf'', ''The Sorcerer's Talisman'' and ''The Dark Legion of Mardarax'', in the latter encountering a haunted (and unstoppable) Roman Legion brought back to \"life\" by the evil Mardarax. Doom's pet Raven, Scarab, who could write messages in the dust for Angus McCraggan, by scratching with his claw, was often of more help to Doom in these serials than was the perpetually baffled McCraggan.\n\nThe ''Cursitor Doom'' strip was drawn by Geoff Campion (including ''The Return of the Hunter''), and \u2013 more effectively \u2013 by [[Eric Bradbury]] (including the magnificently atmospheric ''Dark Legion of Mardarax'').\n\n===Changes in August 1969===\n\nAfter 22 weeks, in August&nbsp;1969, ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' was dropped, and replaced from the 23rd&nbsp;issue by a more serious World War Two strip entitled ''Send For... Q-Squad'', which dealt with the adventures of a hand picked group of six specialists, who were assigned to unusual missions that required special expertise both in the air and on the ground. This, too, in keeping with the need to cut costs, was a reprint, originally published in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 7 March 1964 under the title ''Phantom Force 5''.<ref>[http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html ''Phantom Force Five''] in ''Buster''</ref><ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p36</ref>\n\nThis was another of those drawn, initially, by one of IPC's best British artists, [[Eric Bradbury]], at other times by the Spanish-based artist Luis Bermejo Rojo,<ref>[http://smashpages.net/2015/12/15/rip-luis-bermejo-rojo/ Career of Luis Bermejo] at SmashPages.net</ref> and in its final months mainly by Fred Holmes.<ref>Comics artist [http://www.bustercomic.com/phantomforcefive.html Fred Holmes] at BusterComic.com</ref> Because the strip had a regrettably short run in ''Smash'' (from 16 August 1969 to 30 January 1970 only), most of the run features art by Eric Bradbury.\n\nIt was marked out as a reprint by its unique style \u2014 which was both different from, and grimmer than, all the other strips. Whereas Sgt Rock emulated Lord Henry (and Janus Stark), by maintaining a huge and confident smile, regardless of how much trouble he was in, no one in ''Q-Squad'' ever stopped looking worried. Its reprint status was also signalled by the fact that Q-Squad was plainly ''not'' the original name of the team. Some panels showed evidence of the name having been inserted over a previous one: a change in the lettering style for the name 'Q-Squad' and any adjacent words \u2014 which used a different handwriting in a cruder style wherever the name appeared, but nowhere else.\n\nIn the same issue, a serious footballing serial entitled ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'' began, replacing the departed \u2014 and rather more humorous \u2014 ''World Wide Wanderers''. Hard-as-nails former prison sports instructor 'Toff' Morgan (so called for his habit of always wearing a top-hat) took over the management of ailing First Division side Haversham Hotspurs. Morgan began to rebuild the team by 'framing' ex-criminals who he'd known while working in various prisons, forcing them to sign on with the club in order to make use of their dishonest skills as footballing talents. These convicts became the 'handcuff hotspurs' of the title. The club's former manager, Reg Jessup, tried constantly to sabotage Morgan's efforts, in order to persuade the Directors to re-appoint him instead.\n\nSix months earlier, various humour strips had been introduced as replacements for the (far more surreal) humour of [[Ken Reid (comics)|Ken Reid]], whose strip ''The Nervs'' had so disturbed IPC's management. Now another was forthcoming, and one which reflected the pervasive sporting theme of the relaunched comic. ''The Touchline Tearaways'' (replacing ''Big 'Ead'') was another new football-themed strip, featuring three mad-keen supporters of Grimshot United: a totally useless Football League team, perpetually in danger of being relegated as it was made up entirely of ailing and decrepit players. Each week the Tearaways \u2014 Hairy, Lug'oles and Clever Dick \u2014 would execute some scheme from the touchline to help Grimshot win that week's fixture, usually involving a battle of wits with officials from the Ministry of Football, who, not unnaturally, tried to put a stop to the Tearaways well-intentioned cheating.\n\nThe name of the club, Grimshot United, was a humorous indication that the team was not very good (i.e. that the players were \"grim shots\"). Each strip featured a single match, with a plot based around helping the team overcome that week's opponent. Clever Dick masterminded all the ploys used in helping Grimshot, and apart from occasional words of congratulation or encouragement he was generally the only \"Tearaway\" who had dialogue in the strip. Hairy and Lug'oles tended to be merely a pair of walking visual gags: Hairy's features were perpetually invisible behind a vast mass of long black hair that covered his entire face and head, and Lug'oles had a pair of enormous ears.\n\nThese three new strips represented a minor change of emphasis, replacing two of the more whimsical offerings with two entirely serious strips \u2014 even though the third new entry (which was only a single-page) was simply one outright cartoon strip replacing another.\n\nThus, within six months, a number of the strips introduced in the relaunch had already bitten the dust. And more changes were looming.\n\n===The 2nd Relaunch : 1970===\n\nThe most obvious problem faced by the new-look ''Smash'' was the constant \"churn\": the incessant turnover of strips. Without its solidly popular superhero strips to rely on, the editorial staff seemed pathologically incapable of settling on a fixed line-up.<ref>Continual change of line-up was not a problem unique to ''Smash'', but was shared by all IPC's comics of this period. Editors struggled to find strips sufficiently popular to halt the decline in weekly sales; but making so many changes was self-defeating, because it harmed reader loyalty.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the changes made in August&nbsp;1969, further changes made at the start of 1970 left ''Smash'' looking very different from its appearance in the wake of the relaunch just 12&nbsp;months earlier. A vast number of new strips were added, in a second re-launch, such that only half of those introduced in March&nbsp;1969 now survived, although those which continued included ''Master of the Marsh'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'', ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''Battle of Britain'', ''Eric the Viking'', ''Wacker'', ''The Handcuff Hotspurs'', ''The Swots and the Blots'', and ''Percy's Pets'' \u2014 the latter two now being the only remaining Odhams strips.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\nDiscontinued were ''King of the Ring'' (last survivor of the serious strips from the Odhams era), ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service'', and ''Cursitor Doom''. Three of the strips only recently introduced were also dropped, namely the wartime ''Q-Squad'', British superhero ''Tri-Man'', and the humour strip ''The Touchline Tearaways''.\n\nThe first changes in 1970 occurred in the issue dated 24 January, when three new strips appeared, all reprints from ''Buster'': ''The Kid Commandos'', ''Consternation Street'', and ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' (originally titled ''Milkiway \u2013 The Man from Mars''). These were introduced as part of a relaunch of the comic: by once again bringing in some of the changes a few weeks ahead of the relaunch, as had been done in the Spring of 1969, the publisher hoped to disguise the true extent of the changes.<ref name=SP2010 />\n\n''The Kid Commandos'' was a war story about three cockney children stranded in occupied France in World War Two. Drawn by Tom Kerr, the Sparrow children \u2014 Tommy, Jan and Podge \u2014 were on the run from the Germans each week, in a single page strip set in 1940. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it appeared from 9 January to 24 July 1965, under the imaginative title ''The Sparrows Go To War''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\">''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref>\n\nIn the humour strip ''Consternation Street'' drawn by Reg Parlett (the title spoofed that of the popular British television soap opera, ''Coronation Street''), which was usually a one-page strip, a collection of unlikely neighbours rubbed shoulders in a very small street. Watched over by the dim-witted Constable Clott were the Snobbs and the Ardupps, Colonel Curry & Caesar (his dog), Miss Primm and her pets, Cutprice the Grocer, and Roger the Lodger. This was another reprint from ''Buster'', in which it had originally run \u2013 under the same title \u2013 between 9 January and 23 October 1965.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p44</ref> Parlett was also known from his other humour strips in ''Buster'' including ''Rent-A-Ghost Ltd'', ''The Happy Family'' and ''Bonehead''.<ref>[http://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=148&t=1992 Reg Parlett's contributions to ''Valiant'' and ''Buster''] (including the long running ''Billy Bunter'' strip in ''Valiant'', which continued in ''Valiant and Smash'')</ref>\n\nThe half-page humour strip ''Monty Muddle \u2013 The Man from Mars'' recounted the misadventures of spaceman Monty Muddle (a name rather less convincing than the character's original name, ''Milkiway''). It originally ran in ''Buster'' from 28 May 1960 to 10 March 1962, with art credited to Nadal/Rafart.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p43\"/> He flew about in his small bubble-domed spacecraft trying to make friends with the Earth people. However, due to his misunderstanding of Earth customs, his every attempt at contact ended in disaster; and each strip would typically end with the catchphrase ''I'll try again next week!''\n\nThe 7 February issue then saw a full re-launch: with more free gifts, another new cover feature, and no less than eight new strips (making an astonishing eleven strips added since the beginning of the year).\n\nThe ''Warriors of the World'' covers had run into a problem, in that war stories were no longer a strong element of ''Smash'', which had dropped the humour strip ''Nutt and Bolt the Men from W.H.E.E.Z.E.'' some time earlier. When it was decided to also drop ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Paratrooper'' (by then renamed ''Sergeant Rock \u2013 Special Air Service''), and ''Q&nbsp;Squad'', the cover feature had to go too. It was not practical to advertise war stories on the cover if there were no war stories inside!\n\nThe newly added ''Kid Commandos'' did not count as a war story in this context, since the three fugitive children did not do any conventional fighting. The strip was more like a souped-up version of the discontinued ''Rebbels on the Run''.\n\nAccordingly, after forty seven weeks<ref>46 issues featuring the ''Warriors of the World'' cover feature, and one Christmas issue</ref> the ''Warriors of the World'' series was ended. Instead, the issue dated 7 February 1970 began ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'', written by Angus Allan and drawn by the ever-popular Eric Bradbury.<ref>Credits for [https://www.comics.org/issue/1052666/#2183036 ''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'']</ref> Henceforth each week's cover featured a full-page splash advertising the task which adventurer Simon Test would undertake in a new strip on the inside pages. This strip proved so successful that when the original thirteen-week series was completed (featuring one task each week), Simon Test was given a new series of adventures, extending his hold on the cover indefinitely. He would prove particularly enduring, being one of the few strips to ultimately survive the merger with ''Valiant'' in 1971.\n\n''The Thirteen Tasks of Simon Test'' saw him undertake a quest for immortality by attempting the thirteen tasks of the Pharaoh Thot, believing this to be the only way to save his life, having been deceived into believing he has only a few months to live. The sinister Jabez Coppenger secretly desired Test's death as a means of restoring his own youth. This serial introduced the mute servant Karka, who would ultimately become Test's friend and assistant.\n\nTest then went on to the more lengthy series of adventures entitled ''Simon Test and the Curse of the Conqueror'', where he battled the twenty servants of the evil Ezekiel Spar, the self-styled Conqueror. This pitted him against twenty athletes and champions, each of whom was under the hypnotic control of Spar, who implanted in them an in-built impulse to kill Simon Test.\n\nNew supporting strips introduced in the 7 February issue included ''Threat of the Toymaker'', ''The Pillater Peril'', ''Birdman of Baratoga'', ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'', and three humour strips with a common supernatural element: ''Sam's Spook'' (drawn by Leo Baxendale), ''The Haunts of Headless Harry'', and ''Ghost Ship''.\n\nIn ''Threat of the Toymaker'', drawn by Solano Lopez, a criminal scientist named Doctor Droll escaped from Garstone Prison with the aid of an army of remote controlled mechanical toys he had constructed, along the way taking the Prison Governor's children, Pam and Peter Keen, as hostages. Hampered by the children at every turn, Droll finds himself on the run, pursued by the Police wherever he goes. The idea of using radio controlled toys in the strip was scarcely original, since it was a straight lift from the ''House of Dolmann'', which was then running in ''Valiant'', as well as from the ''General Jumbo'' strip in ''The Beano''. The strip was scarcely original either: having been first published in ''Buster'', under the title ''The Toys of Doom'', between 27 February 1965 and 13 January 1968 (and in which it would be reprinted\u2014in part\u2014between 3 May and 6 September 1986, under the title ''The Terror Toys''), it was also reprinted in ''Eagle'', under its original title ''The Toys of Doom''.<ref name=\"Fleetway Companion' p38\"/>\n\n''The Pillater Peril'' saw David Pillater return to Pillater House, his ancestral home on the Cornish coast, which he is to inherit on his 21st&nbsp;birthday. Along with his four cousins and his Uncle Bernard, David is imperilled by Francis Pillater, an ancestor who has seemingly returned from the dead. Francis had an evil reputation for his misdeeds in the 16th century, but was thought to have perished in a shipwreck during a storm at sea. Blaming the family for his troubles, he sets out for revenge by kidnapping them one by one. The strip had only a short run, but when discontinued it did, unusually, seemingly come to a natural conclusion (rather than merely wrapping-up many continuing plot threads unconvincingly in the final panel).\n\n''Birdman from Baratoga'' was an adventure strip about a boy who grew up on a Pacific island with only the company of birds, and learned from them the secret of flight. By the use of a feather cape, he was able to glide through the air like an albatros. When an English sailor is castaway on the island, called Baratoga, they escape together on a raft and set out on a series of adventures in the Pacific, beginning by hunting down the desperado who has stolen the man's pearl-fishing yacht, ''Enterprise''. ''Birdman from Baratoga'' was perhaps loosely based on a humour strip which had run in ''Buster'' during 1968: ''Captain Swoop \u2013 He's Half Man, Half Bird, Half Wit''.\n\nIn a very atypical move, prompted by IPC's on-going financial problems (in the year in which they were taken over by the Reed Group), the editorial team now resurrected one of the old strips which had run in ''Wham'' under Odhams, drawn by Gordon Hogg. ''Nick and Nat \u2013 The Beat Boys'' featured two young lads from Liverpool who fancied themselves as musicians, spoke in Liverpudlian slang (even the original title of the strip was derived from a slang Scouse term for a native of Liverpool: 'wacker'), sported Beatles-style haircuts, and always carried guitars. This was a reprint of ''The&nbsp;Wacks'', which had run in ''Wham'' during 1964, reprinted here with only the title and the names changed. Spoofing the pop group ''The Beatles'', it was an odd choice to run it a year ''after'' that group's demise. It was, though, a popular item: this 1964 strip had already been reprinted, under the title ''Birk 'n' 'Ed, the Mersey Dead-Beats'', from 30 January 1965 in Fleetway's ''Hurricane''.<ref>''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p.89</ref><ref>Spoken quickly for comic effect, the names of the two characters were intended to sound like that of a district in Liverpool called Birkenhead</ref>\n\nA common supernatural theme linked the three new humour strips. In ''Sam's Spook'', drawn by the ubiquitous Leo Baxendale, Sam was a schoolboy with a ghostly pal called Spooky, who used his powers to humorous effect on Sam's behalf. The strip mostly consisted of Sam's school friends catching Spooky doing a bit of ghostly cheating in order to help Sam win at sports or football, and Sam doing a lot of running away to avoid a bashing.\n\n''The Haunts of Headless Harry'' featured the amiable ghost of a 16th-century soldier who had been beheaded. Harry's head and body led separate but related ghostly existences, with the body carrying the head around everywhere, and both of them were able to talk. Harry's humorous adventures invariably involved misplacing his head; such as going to the cinema and, on leaving, calling at the cloakroom to collect it (as though it was a hat), and being asked by the attendant to identify it among all the other ghostly heads left there during the film.\n\nThe other new humour strip was ''Ghost Ship'', in which the spirit of an ancient galleon, and the ghosts of its pirate crew, sailed the Seven Seas making mischief, but usually coming off worst.\n\nFurther changes followed: such that fully thirteen strips had been introduced since the start of 1970. In the issue dated 27 June 1970, a new humour strip began entitled ''Moonie's Magic Mate'', about a schoolboy, Barry Moon, who finds a Genie in a dusty old bottle. In the issue dated 29 August, a humour strip titled ''The Fighting Three'' began, featuring the misadventures of three men: globe-trotters McGinty, Hambone and Weasel are travelling the world, trying to raise enough money to start their own construction company, but get into fights \u2013 and jail! \u2013 wherever they go. Drawn by Carlos Cruz, this was another reprint from ''Buster'', where, under its original title ''Mighty McGinty'', the strip had run in 1964.<ref>Published 29 February to 17 October 1964: ''Fleetway Companion'' by Steve Holland, p38</ref> And finally, in the last addition before the comic's closure, a strip entitled ''Tyler the Tamer'' was launched in early 1971, about the adventures of the greatest film stuntman in the world. Dropped to make room for these were ''Kid Commandos'', ''Threat of the Toymaker'' and ''The Pillater Peril'' (the ''Pillater'' saga seemingly reaching a natural conclusion, instead of merely being summarily abandoned).\n\n==Merger with ''Valiant''==\n\nIn mid-November 1970, production on ''Smash'' (and many other IPC titles, including ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'') came to a halt due to a printers' strike, and no editions were published for the next three months.<ref name=SP2010 /> By the time the strike was settled, in February of the following year, irreparable damage had been done to the comic's circulation, as its young readers had turned elsewhere in the intervening 11&nbsp;weeks. Similar harm had been suffered by ''Valiant''. In consequence of this latest financial disaster, after eight issues, in April&nbsp;1971 the two titles were merged in an attempt to combine their surviving circulation. For a brief time the merged comic was entitled ''Valiant and Smash'' (10 April to 18 September 1971<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2018/11/27/valiant-70s/|title=Valiant 70s|date=27 November 2018}}</ref>), before reverting to simply ''Valiant''.\n\nSome strips from ''Smash'' survived in the new comic, including ''His Sporting Lordship'', ''[[Janus Stark]]'' and ''The Swots and the Blots'', but most were lost,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180805023305/http://26pigs.com/valiant/index.html Merger with ''Valiant''] - ''Valiant and Smash''</ref> although the ''Smash'' Annual continued to appear for many years afterwards (continuing, in fact, until the 1976 Annual, published in the autumn of 1975). A lot of the strips thereby continued to appear each year, including many which had not even survived into ''Valiant'', long after ''Smash'' had ceased publication as a comic.<ref name=\"British Comics website\">{{Cite web|url=https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/|title=Smash!|date=13 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe sports themed ''His Sporting Lordship'' had enjoyed perhaps the greatest popularity, surviving the shake-ups of 1969 and 1970, and then surviving even the merger with ''Valiant'', though it was to last only a few months in its new home, finally ending in December&nbsp;1971. However, it was revived in the 1972 ''Smash'' Annual, published at Christmas&nbsp;1971, and returned year after year: becoming the regular cover feature of the Annuals.<ref name=\"British Comics website\"/>\n\nThe merged title was dominated by ''Valiant'', which contributed nine strips consisting of twenty pages; whereas ''Smash!'' was represented by only four strips, totalling a meager nine pages: ''Janus Stark'', ''The Swots & The Blots'', ''Simon Test'', and ''His Sporting Lordship''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kidr77.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-valiant-attempt-at-smashing.html|title=CRIVENS! COMICS & STUFF: A VALIANT ATTEMPT AT A SMASHING COMBINATION...|date=25 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite all of the changes, the new ''Smash'' had lasted only two years. Maybe it was only marginally profitable, but no title could have survived such a lengthy loss of production. Its demise was directly attributable to the strike.<ref name=SP2010>{{Cite web|url=https://stephenpoppitt.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/comics-010/|title=Smash! : The IPC Years \u2013 Part 5: Cancellation|date=16 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n''Smash'' was the last attempt in the UK market to publish a general boys comic, mixing adventure, sports and humour strips. Subsequent comics would survive only by ruthlessly focusing on narrow, sectional interests: such as all-sports, all-war, or all-humour;<ref>The most successful of these was ''Doctor Who Weekly'', which still exists today, although it had to become a monthly title in order to survive (and adopt a magazine format)</ref> just as the American market had already specialised into all-funnies, all-horror, and all-superhero titles. The writing was on the wall for non-niche comics in the UK, for, in the face of the competition from television, even IPC's flagship, ''Valiant'', ultimately could not survive.<ref>''Note'': One trend in British comics was to ride the coat-tails of the success of television, which was gradually killing off comics, by specialising in strips based on popular tv shows: titles which attempted to ride the back of the tiger in this fashion included ''[[TV Comic]]'', ''[[TV Century 21|TV21]]'', ''TV Tornado'', ''[[Lady Penelope (comic)|Lady Penelope]]'', ''Joe 90 Top Secret'', ''[[Countdown (Polystyle Publications)|Countdown]]'', ''[[TV Action]]'', and ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Weekly]]''.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.IPCmedia.com/about/companyhistory/ The history of IPC]\n* [https://BritishComics.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/smash/ ''Smash'' at the British Comics WordPress site]\n* [http://clitheroekid.ihostfull.com/links2.htm#comics 1960s British Comics review]\n* [http://BritishComicArt.blogspot.com/search/label/Smash/ ''Smash'' comic art]\n* [http://www.comicworldnews.com/crumpets/4/smash.jpg ''Smash'' #150 cover art]\n* [http://www.comics.org/series/25870/covers/ ''Smash'' cover art] at the Grand Comics Database\n* [http://britishcomicart.blogspot.com/2009/08/battle-for-britain.html ''The Battle For Britain'' - Art by John Stokes]\n* Comics UK Gallery - [http://www.comicsuk.co.uk/gallery.php ''Valiant and Smash'']\n* Baxendale, Leo - [https://www.google.com/images?hl=en&num=20&as_epq=Leo+Baxendale&as_oq=&as_eq=&lr=lang_en&cr=&as_ft=i&as_filetype=&as_qdr=all&as_occt=any&as_dt=i&as_sitesearch=&as_rights=&safe=images&q=%22Leo+Baxendale%22&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=kFJmTIazKsiOjAfkzZ3UBA&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=4&ved=0CCMQsAQwAw Images at Google.com]\n* Reid, Ken - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090304202443/http://www.comicsuk.co.uk/Interviews/KenReid/KenReidOverview.asp Comics UK biography of Ken Reid (1919-87)]\n* McMurtry, Stan - [http://www.cartoons.ac.uk/artists/stanmcmurtry/biography Biography: Stan McMurtry (a.k.a.

In 1544 the territory was placed under the administration of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. During the early years, Spain concentrated on exploring and colonizing the mainland, and the islands were hardly settled.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1630, [[England|English]] [[Puritan]]s arrived in Providence Island, under the aegis of the [[Providence Island Company]]. These Puritans decided to settle this promising tropical island rather than cold, rocky [[New England]], but the [[Providence Island colony]] did not succeed in the same way as the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. They established [[slave]]-worked plantations and engaged in [[privateering]], which led to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] taking over the colony in 1641.<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521352053 ''Providence Island, 1630\u20131641, The Other Puritan Colony''] - by [[Karen Ordahl Kupperman]], University of Connecticut</ref> In the 1640s, the Puritan-controlled Commonwealth government of England tried to regain the island, but without success. In 1670, English [[buccaneer]]s led by [[Henry Morgan]] took over the islands, which they affiliated with the British [[Mosquito Coast]] in present-day Nicaragua. The buccaneers and other pirates controlled the islands until 1689. Later Spain regained control of the archipelago, which it held until the independence of Colombia in 1822.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1775 Lieutenant Tom\u00e1s O'Neil, a Spaniard of Irish descent, was given military command of the islands and in 1790 named governor. He requested the transfer of the islands to the jurisdiction of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] which was granted in 1803. That year Spain assigned the islands together with the province of [[Veraguas]] (western [[Panama]] and the east coast of [[Nicaragua]]) to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. The territory was administered from the province of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. Soon, trade links with Cartagena were greater than those with Guatemala.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nOn 4 July 1818, French Corsair [[Louis-Michel Aury]], with 400 men and 14 ships flying the [[Argentine flag]], captured Old Providence and St. Catherine islands. The island was populated by white English-speaking Protestants and their slaves. Aury and his team used the islands as their new base from which to pursue Central American independence. However, his efforts to also support Bolivar in his fight for Venezuelan and Colombian independence were repeatedly turned down.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAfter the Spanish colonies became independent, the inhabitants of San Andr\u00e9s, Providence and St. Catherine voluntarily adhered to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]] in 1822, who placed them under the administration of the [[Magdalena Department]]. The [[First Mexican Empire]], which was succeeded by the [[United Provinces of Central America]] (UPCA), also claimed the islands. Gran Colombia in turn protested the UPCA's occupation of the eastern coast of Nicaragua. The UPCA broke up in 1838&ndash;1840, but Nicaragua carried on the dispute, as did Gran Colombia's successors, [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]] and Colombia. Colombia established a local administration (''intendencia'') in the islands in 1912.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1928, Colombia and Nicaragua signed the [[Esguerra-B\u00e1rcenas Treaty]], which gave control of the islands to Colombia. However, when the [[Sandinista]] government assumed power in the 1980s, Nicaragua repudiated the treaty. Colombia argues that the treaty's final ratification in 1930 (when U.S. forces were already on their way out) confirms its validity. Colombia and [[Honduras]] signed a [[maritime boundary]] treaty in 1999 which implicitly accepts Colombian sovereignty over the islands.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 2001 Nicaragua filed claims with the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) over the disputed maritime boundary, claiming {{convert|50000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} in the Caribbean, including the San Andr\u00e9s and Providencia archipelagoes. Colombia responded that the ICJ has no jurisdiction over the matter, and increased its naval and police presence in the islands. Colombia also defended its claim in the ICJ. On 13 December 2007 the ICJ ruled that the islands were Colombian territory, but left the maritime border dispute unresolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elespectador.com/search/elespectador%20Secciones%20Detalles.aspx|title=Contenido|website=ELESPECTADOR.COM|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> On 19 November 2012, the International Court of Justice decided that Colombia had sovereignty over the islands.\n\n=== United States claims ===\nIn the 19th century, the United States claimed several uninhabited locations in the area under the [[Guano Island Act]], including several now claimed by Colombia.<ref name=\"DOI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/acquisition_process.htm |title=Acquisition Process of Insular Areas |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Insular Affairs |accessdate=2008-01-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414172502/http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/acquisition_process.htm |archivedate=2012-04-14 }}</ref> In 1981 the U.S. ceded its claims to [[Serrana Bank]] and [[Roncador Bank]] to Colombia and abandoned its claim to [[Quita Sue\u00f1o Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/disputedpage.htm |title=FORMERLY DISPUTED ISLANDS |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Insular Affairs |accessdate=2008-01-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014736/http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/disputedpage.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30 }}</ref> The United States still maintains claims over [[Serranilla Bank]] and [[Bajo Nuevo Bank]] and considers them both to be unincorporated territories of the United States.<ref name=\"DOI\" />\n\n=== Declaration of Self Determination ===\n{{main|Raizal}}\nIn 1903 the local Raizal population rejected an offer from the US to separate from Colombia in the wake of [[Panama]]'s secession from Colombia.

The assimilation and immigration efforts were led largely by Catholic missionaries, which angered the native population, which was Protestant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etniasdecolombia.org/grupos_raizales.asp |title=Raizales |publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Hemera |language=Spanish |accessdate=2007-12-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013000210/http://www.etniasdecolombia.org/grupos_raizales.asp |archivedate=2007-10-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pasaportecolombiano.wordpress.com/2007/12/29/documento-acerca-de-los-raizales-de-san-andres/ |title=Los raizales sanandresanos: realidades \u00e9tnicas y discurso pol\u00edtico |date=2005-05-09 |author=Adelaida Cano Sch\u00fctz |publisher=pasaporte colombiano |language=Spanish |accessdate=2007-12-29 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080127114145/http://pasaportecolombiano.wordpress.com/2007/12/29/documento-acerca-de-los-raizales-de-san-andres/| archivedate= 27 January 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Local government and representation ==\n{{Update|section|date=October 2019}}\n=== 2007 elections ===\nA member of the departmental assembly for 15 years, Pedro Gallardo Forbes, of the [[Regional Integration Movement]] (MIR), won the [[Colombian regional election, 2007|28 October 2007 gubernatorial election]], with support from the [[Colombian Conservative Party]] and the [[Radical Change]] party.

This policy seems to be an answer to growing discontent within the Raizal community that could strengthen separatist movements; a raizal majority would in this case win a pro-independence referendum but this could be neutralized by outnumbering them with mainland Colombians.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nBy 2005, Raizals were only 30% of the 60,000 or more inhabitants of the islands, with the rest being mainland [[Colombian people|Colombian]]s and English-speaking whites of British descent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.verantwoordgroen.nl/files/urrea.html |author=Fernando Urrea Giraldo |title=La visibilidad estad\u00edstica de la poblaci\u00f3n negra o afrodescendiente en Colombia, 1993-2005: entre lo \u00e9tnico y lo racial |language=Spanish |date=2007-10-12 |publisher=12\u00ba Congreso de Antropolog\u00eda, Universidad Nacional de Colombia |accessdate=2007-12-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227200450/http://simposioraza.net/files/urrea.pdf |archivedate = 2008-02-27}}</ref> Raizals can speak both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Airports===\nThe airport serves the towns of San Andr\u00e9s and [[San Luis, San Andr\u00e9s|San Luis]], but also commercially serves the nearby island of [[Providencia Island]], all being major tourist and vacation spots for South and Central American tourists.\n[[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport]] is also known as Sesquicentenario International Airport.

In 1544 the territory was placed under the administration of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. During the early years, Spain concentrated on exploring and colonizing the mainland, and the islands were hardly settled.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1630, [[England|English]] [[Puritan]]s arrived in Providence Island, under the aegis of the [[Providence Island Company]]. These Puritans decided to settle this promising tropical island rather than cold, rocky [[New England]], but the [[Providence Island colony]] did not succeed in the same way as the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. They established [[slave]]-worked plantations and engaged in [[privateering]], which led to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] taking over the colony in 1641.<ref>[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521352053 ''Providence Island, 1630\u20131641, The Other Puritan Colony''] - by [[Karen Ordahl Kupperman]], University of Connecticut</ref> In the 1640s, the Puritan-controlled Commonwealth government of England tried to regain the island, but without success. In 1670, English [[buccaneer]]s led by [[Henry Morgan]] took over the islands, which they affiliated with the British [[Mosquito Coast]] in present-day Nicaragua. The buccaneers and other pirates controlled the islands until 1689. Later Spain regained control of the archipelago, which it held until the independence of Colombia in 1822.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1775 Lieutenant Tom\u00e1s O'Neil, a Spaniard of Irish descent, was given military command of the islands and in 1790 named governor. He requested the transfer of the islands to the jurisdiction of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] which was granted in 1803. That year Spain assigned the islands together with the province of [[Veraguas]] (western [[Panama]] and the east coast of [[Nicaragua]]) to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. The territory was administered from the province of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. Soon, trade links with Cartagena were greater than those with Guatemala.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nOn 4 July 1818, French Corsair [[Louis-Michel Aury]], with 400 men and 14 ships flying the [[Argentine flag]], captured Old Providence and St. Catherine islands. The island was populated by white English-speaking Protestants and their slaves. Aury and his team used the islands as their new base from which to pursue Central American independence. However, his efforts to also support Bolivar in his fight for Venezuelan and Colombian independence were repeatedly turned down.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nAfter the Spanish colonies became independent, the inhabitants of San Andr\u00e9s, Providence and St. Catherine voluntarily adhered to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]] in 1822, who placed them under the administration of the [[Magdalena Department]]. The [[First Mexican Empire]], which was succeeded by the [[United Provinces of Central America]] (UPCA), also claimed the islands. Gran Colombia in turn protested the UPCA's occupation of the eastern coast of Nicaragua. The UPCA broke up in 1838&ndash;1840, but Nicaragua carried on the dispute, as did Gran Colombia's successors, [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]] and Colombia. Colombia established a local administration (''intendencia'') in the islands in 1912.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1928, Colombia and Nicaragua signed the [[Esguerra-B\u00e1rcenas Treaty]], which gave control of the islands to Colombia. However, when the [[Sandinista]] government assumed power in the 1980s, Nicaragua repudiated the treaty. Colombia argues that the treaty's final ratification in 1930 (when U.S. forces were already on their way out) confirms its validity. Colombia and [[Honduras]] signed a [[maritime boundary]] treaty in 1999 which implicitly accepts Colombian sovereignty over the islands.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 2001 Nicaragua filed claims with the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) over the disputed maritime boundary, claiming {{convert|50000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} in the Caribbean, including the San Andr\u00e9s and Providencia archipelagoes. Colombia responded that the ICJ has no jurisdiction over the matter, and increased its naval and police presence in the islands. Colombia also defended its claim in the ICJ. On 13 December 2007 the ICJ ruled that the islands were Colombian territory, but left the maritime border dispute unresolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elespectador.com/search/elespectador%20Secciones%20Detalles.aspx|title=Contenido|website=ELESPECTADOR.COM|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> On 19 November 2012, the International Court of Justice decided that Colombia had sovereignty over the islands.\n\n=== United States claims ===\nIn the 19th century, the United States claimed several uninhabited locations in the area under the [[Guano Island Act]], including several now claimed by Colombia.<ref name=\"DOI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/acquisition_process.htm |title=Acquisition Process of Insular Areas |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Insular Affairs |accessdate=2008-01-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414172502/http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/acquisition_process.htm |archivedate=2012-04-14 }}</ref> In 1981 the U.S. ceded its claims to [[Serrana Bank]] and [[Roncador Bank]] to Colombia and abandoned its claim to [[Quita Sue\u00f1o Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/disputedpage.htm |title=FORMERLY DISPUTED ISLANDS |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Insular Affairs |accessdate=2008-01-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014736/http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/disputedpage.htm |archivedate=2007-09-30 }}</ref> The United States still maintains claims over [[Serranilla Bank]] and [[Bajo Nuevo Bank]] and considers them both to be unincorporated territories of the United States.<ref name=\"DOI\" />\n\n=== Declaration of Self Determination ===\n{{main|Raizal}}\nIn 1903 the local Raizal population rejected an offer from the US to separate from Colombia in the wake of [[Panama]]'s secession from Colombia.

There is a minority of white English-speaking Protestants of British descent. Colombia has promoted the migration of Spanish-speaking mainlanders, with [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] missions participating since 1947. This policy seems to be an answer to growing discontent within the Raizal community that could strengthen separatist movements; a raizal majority would in this case win a pro-independence referendum but this could be neutralized by outnumbering them with mainland Colombians.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nBy 2005, Raizals were only 30% of the 60,000 or more inhabitants of the islands, with the rest being mainland [[Colombian people|Colombian]]s and English-speaking whites of British descent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.verantwoordgroen.nl/files/urrea.html |author=Fernando Urrea Giraldo |title=La visibilidad estad\u00edstica de la poblaci\u00f3n negra o afrodescendiente en Colombia, 1993-2005: entre lo \u00e9tnico y lo racial |language=Spanish |date=2007-10-12 |publisher=12\u00ba Congreso de Antropolog\u00eda, Universidad Nacional de Colombia |accessdate=2007-12-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227200450/http://simposioraza.net/files/urrea.pdf |archivedate = 2008-02-27}}</ref> Raizals can speak both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[English language|English]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Airports===\nThe airport serves the towns of San Andr\u00e9s and [[San Luis, San Andr\u00e9s|San Luis]], but also commercially serves the nearby island of [[Providencia Island]], all being major tourist and vacation spots for South and Central American tourists.\n[[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport]] is also known as Sesquicentenario International Airport.  The airport is the 6th busiest airport in Colombia in terms of passengers, with 836,234 in 2006. Most of these passengers come from the continental part of the country, due to poor international direct service to the island. Many international tourists have to fly to one of Colombia's or Panama's largest airports (Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, Cali, Cartagena, Panama City) to be able to reach the islands.
