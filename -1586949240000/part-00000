Titor suggested that UFOs and [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] might be travelers from much further into the future than his own time, with superior time machines.\n\n=== Time machine ===\nTitor described his time machine on several occasions.

As such, his descriptions have been interpreted as predictions and compared with historical events since 2001.\n\nThe most immediate of Titor's predictions was of an [[Second American Civil War|upcoming civil war]] in the United States having to do with \"order and rights\".<ref name=\"John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25\">John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25</ref> He described it as beginning in 2004,<ref name=\"John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36\">John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36</ref> with [[civil unrest]] surrounding the [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election of that year]]. This civil conflict that he characterized as \"having a [[Waco Siege|Waco]] type event every month that steadily gets worse\"<ref name=\"John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36\" /> would be \"pretty much at everyone's doorstep\"<ref name=\"John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25\" /> and erupt by 2008.\n\nAs a result of the war, the United States would split into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives. This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense [[World War III]].\n\nTitor refers to the exchange as \"N Day\". [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida]] are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]] would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by \"border clashes and overpopulation\".<ref>John Titor, 2/8/01 9:40</ref> He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes a hypothetical World War III.\n\nTitor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.\n\nTitor claimed that the \"Everett\u2013Wheeler model of quantum physics\", better known as the [[many-worlds interpretation]], was correct. According to Titor, this caused a new timestream to form because of his time travel.  This gives his predictions the ability to stand up to scrutiny when they fail to pass, since believers can say that the events were averted by Titor's postings.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n\n== Criticism and discussion ==\n''[[The New Republic]]'' called Titor the most famous of several internet forum posters who claimed to be time travelers.<ref name=tnr/>\n\nAn Italian television program, ''Voyager \u2013 Ai confini della conoscenza'', aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008. Private investigator Mike Lynch found no registry evidence, past or present, of any individual named John Titor.  He did, however, identify the John Titor Foundation, a for-profit company formed on September 16, 2003, with no office or address other than a rented post box in [[Kissimmee, Florida]].

As such, his descriptions have been interpreted as predictions and compared with historical events since 2001.\n\nThe most immediate of Titor's predictions was of an [[Second American Civil War|upcoming civil war]] in the United States having to do with \"order and rights\".<ref name=\"John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25\">John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25</ref> He described it as beginning in 2004,<ref name=\"John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36\">John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36</ref> with [[civil unrest]] surrounding the [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election of that year]]. This civil conflict that he characterized as \"having a [[Waco Siege|Waco]] type event every month that steadily gets worse\"<ref name=\"John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36\" /> would be \"pretty much at everyone's doorstep\"<ref name=\"John Titor, 2/27/01 17:25\" /> and erupt by 2008.\n\nAs a result of the war, the United States would split into five regions based on various factors and differing military objectives. This civil war, according to Titor, would end in 2015 with a brief but intense [[World War III]].\n\nTitor refers to the exchange as \"N Day\". [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Jacksonville, Florida]] are specifically mentioned as being hit. After the war, [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska]] would be the new U.S. capital. Titor was vague as to the exact motivations and causes for World War III. At one point, he characterized the hostilities as being led by \"border clashes and overpopulation\".<ref>John Titor, 2/8/01 9:40</ref> He also pointed to the contemporary conflict between Arabs and Israel as not a cause, but rather a milestone that precedes a hypothetical World War III.\n\nTitor claimed that as a 13-year-old in 2011, he joined the Fighting Diamondbacks, a shotgun infantry unit in Florida, for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.\n\nTitor claimed that the \"Everett\u2013Wheeler model of quantum physics\", better known as the [[many-worlds interpretation]], was correct. According to Titor, this caused a new timestream to form because of his time travel.  This gives his predictions the ability to stand up to scrutiny when they fail to pass, since believers can say that the events were averted by Titor's postings.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n\n== Criticism and discussion ==\n''[[The New Republic]]'' called Titor the most famous of several internet forum posters who claimed to be time travelers.<ref name=tnr/>\n\nAn Italian television program, ''Voyager \u2013 Ai confini della conoscenza'', aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008.

{"title_page": "History of the Church\u2013Turing thesis", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}\nThe '''history of the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]]''' (\"thesis\") involves the [[history]] of the development of the study of the nature of functions whose values are effectively calculable; or, in more modern terms, functions whose values are algorithmically computable. It is an important topic in modern mathematical theory and computer science, particularly associated with the work of [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]].\n\nThe debate and discovery of the meaning of \"computation\" and \"recursion\" has been long and contentious.  This article provides detail of that debate and discovery from [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]] in 1889 through recent discussion of the meaning of \"[[axiom]]\".\n\n==Peano's nine axioms of arithmetic==\nIn 1889, [[Giuseppe Peano]] presented his ''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method'', based on the work of [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]]. [[Robert Soare|Soare]] proposes that the origination of \"primitive recursion\" began formally with the axioms of Peano, although\n:\"Well before the nineteenth century mathematicians used the principle of defining a function by induction. Dedekind 1888 proved, using accepted axioms, that such a definition defines a unique function, and he applied it to the definition of the functions m+n, m x n, and m<sup>n</sup>. Based on this work of Dedekind, Peano 1889 and 1891 wrote the familiar five [sic] axioms for the positive integers. As a companion to his fifth [sic] axiom, mathematical induction, Peano used definition by induction, which has been called ''primitive'' recursion (since [[R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter|P\u00e9ter]] 1934 and Kleene 1936) ... .\"<ref>Soare 1996:5</ref>\n\nObserve that ''in fact'' [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]] are ''9'' in number and axiom ''9'' is the recursion/induction axiom.<ref>cf: van Heijenoort 1976:94</ref>\n\n:\"Subsequently the 9 were reduced to 5 as \"Axioms 2, 3, 4 and 5 which deal with identity, belong to the underlying logic. This leaves the five axioms that have become universally known as \"the Peano axioms ... Peano acknowledges (1891b, p. 93) that his axioms come from Dedekind ... .\"<ref>van Heijenoort 1976:83</ref>\n\n==Hilbert and the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]==\nAt the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in 1900 in Paris the famous mathematician [[David Hilbert]] posed a set of problems \u2013 now known as [[Hilbert's problems]] \u2013 his beacon illuminating the way for mathematicians of the twentieth century. Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems introduced the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (the \"decision problem\"). In his 2nd problem he asked for a proof that \"arithmetic\" is \"[[consistent]]\". [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] would prove in 1931 that, within what he called \"P\" (nowadays called [[Peano Arithmetic]]), \"there exist undecidable sentences [propositions]\".<ref>G\u00f6del 1931a in (Davis 1965:6), 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:596)</ref> Because of this, \"the consistency of P is unprovable in P, provided P is consistent\".<ref>G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem IX, G\u00f6del 1931a in (Davis 1965:36)</ref>  While G\u00f6del\u2019s proof would display the tools necessary for [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] to resolve the Entscheidungsproblem, he himself would not answer it.\n\nIt is within Hilbert's [[Hilbert's tenth problem|10th problem]] where the question of an \"Entscheidungsproblem\" actually appears.   The heart of matter was the following question: \"What do we mean when we say that a function is 'effectively calculable'\"?  The answer would be something to this effect: \"When the function is calculated by a ''mechanical'' procedure (process, method).\"  Although stated easily nowadays, the question (and answer) would float about for almost 30 years before it was framed precisely.\n\nHilbert's original description of problem 10 begins as follows:\n:\"'''10. Determination of the solvability of a [[Diophantine equation]]'''.  Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and with [[Integer|rational integral]] [[coefficient]]s: To devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.<ref>This translation, and the original text in German, appears in (Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007:1-2)</ref>\"\n<!--:\"The Entscheidungsproblem [decision problem for [[First-order logic|first-order logic]]] is solved when we know a procedure that allows for any given [[logical expression]] to decide by finitely many operations its validity or satisfiability ... The Entscheidungsproblem must be considered the main problem of [[Mathematical logic|mathematical logic]]. ... The solution of the Entscheidungsproblem is of fundamental significance for the theory of all domains whose propositions could be developed on the basis of a finite number of [[Axiom|axioms]]\"-->\nBy 1922, the specific question of an \"Entscheidungsproblem\" applied to Diophantine equations had developed into the more general question about a \"decision method\" for ''any'' [[Formula|mathematical formula]]. <!--, and H. Behmann stated that\n:\"... most general form of the Entscheidungsproblem [is] as follows:\n::\"A quite definite generally applicable prescription is required which will allow one to decide in a finite number of steps the truth or falsity of a given purely logical assertion ...\"<ref>Gandy 1994:57 quoting Behmann</ref>\n\n:\"Behmann remarks that ... the general problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding which mathematical propositions are true.\" (Gandy 1994:57) -->\n[[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]] explains it this way: Suppose we are given a \"calculational procedure\" that consists of (1) a set of axioms and (2) a logical conclusion written in [[first-order logic]], that is\u2014written in what Davis calls \"[[Gottlob Frege|Frege's]] rules of deduction\" (or the modern equivalent of [[Boolean logic]]).  G\u00f6del\u2019s doctoral dissertation<ref>G\u00f6del 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:592ff)</ref> proved that Frege's rules were ''complete'' \"... in the sense that every valid formula is provable\".<ref>van Heijenoort 1967:582</ref>  Given that encouraging fact, could there be a generalized \"calculational procedure\" that would tell us whether a conclusion can be derived from its premises?  Davis calls such calculational procedures \"[[algorithm]]s\".  The Entscheidungsproblem would be an algorithm as well.  \"In principle, an algorithm for [the] Entscheidungsproblem would have reduced all human deductive reasoning to brute calculation\".<ref>Davis 2000:146</ref>\n\nIn other words: Is there an \"algorithm\" that can tell us if ''any'' formula is \"true\" (i.e. an algorithm that always correctly yields a judgment \"truth\" or \"falsehood\"?)\n:\" ... it seemed clear to Hilbert that with the solution of this problem, the Entscheidungsproblem, that it should be possible in principle to settle all mathematical questions in a purely mechanical manner.  Hence, given unsolvable problems at all, if Hilbert was correct, then the Entscheidungsproblem itself should be unsolvable\".<ref>Davis 1965:108</ref>\n\nIndeed: What about our Entscheidungsproblem algorithm itself?  Can it determine, in a finite number of steps, whether it, itself, is \u201csuccessful\u201d and \"truthful\" (that is, it does not get hung up in an endless \"circle\" or \"[[Control flow#Condition-controlled loops|loop]]\", and it correctly yields a judgment \"truth\" or \"falsehood\" about its own behavior and results)?\n\n==Three problems from Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems==\nAt the 1928 [[International Congress of Mathematicians|Congress]] [in [[Bologna|Bologna, Italy]]] [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] refines the question very carefully into three parts. The following is [[Stephen Hawking|Stephen Hawking's]] summary:\n*\"1. To prove that all true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the '''completeness''' of mathematics.\n*\"2. To prove that only true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the '''consistency''' of mathematics,\n*\"3. To prove the decidability of mathematics, that is, the existence of a '''decision procedure''' to decide the truth or falsity of any given mathematical proposition.\" <ref>Hawking 2005:1121</ref>\n\n==Simple arithmetic functions irreducible to primitive recursion==\n[[Gabriel Sudan]] (1927) and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] (1928) display [[Computable function|recursive functions]] that are not ''primitive'' recursive:\n\n:\"Are there [[recursion]]s that are not reducible to [[primitive recursion]]; and in particular can recursion be used to define a function which is not primitive recursive?\n\n:\"This question arose from a conjecture of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] in 1926 on the [[continuum problem]], and was answered [yes: there are recursions that are not primitive recursive] by Ackermann 1928.\"<ref>Kleene 1952:271</ref>\n\nIn subsequent years [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]<ref>cf. Kleene 1952:272-273</ref> observes that [[R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter]] (1935) simplified Ackermann's example (\"cf. also Hilbert-[[Bernays]] 1934\") and [[Raphael Robinson]] (1948). P\u00e9ter exhibited another example (1935) that employed [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]. P\u00e9ter (1950) and Ackermann (1940) also displayed \"[[transfinite recursion]]s\", and this led Kleene to wonder:\n:\"... whether we can characterize in any exact way the notion of any \"recursion\", or the class of all \"recursive functions.\"<ref>Kleene 1952:273</ref>\n\nKleene concludes<ref>cf. Kleene 1952:274</ref> that all \"recursions\" involve (i) the formal analysis he presents in his \u00a754 ''Formal calculations of [[primitive recursive function]]s'' and, (ii) the use of [[mathematical induction]]. He immediately goes on to state that indeed the G\u00f6del-Herbrand definition does indeed \"characterize all recursive functions\" \u2013 see the quote in [[#Kleene 1935|1934, below]].\n\n==G\u00f6del's proof==\nIn 1930, mathematicians gathered for a mathematics meeting and retirement event for [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]. As luck would have it,\n:\"at the very same meeting, a young Czech mathematician, [[Kurt G\u00f6del]], announced results which dealt it <nowiki>[</nowiki>Hilbert's opinion that all three answers were YES] a serious blow.\"<ref>Hodges 1983:92</ref>\n\nHe announced that the answer to the first two of Hilbert's three questions of 1928 was NO.\n\nSubsequently in 1931 G\u00f6del published his famous paper [http://www.research.ibm.com/people/h/hirzel/papers/canon00-goedel.pdf ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related {{nowrap|Systems I.}}''] In his preface to this paper Martin Davis delivers a caution:\n:\"The reader should be warned that [in this particular paper] what G\u00f6del calls ''recursive functions''  are now called ''[[primitive recursive functions]]''. (The revised terminology was introduced by [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]<ref>Kleene 1936 in (Davis 1965:237ff)</ref>).\"<ref>Davis 1965:4</ref>\n\n==G\u00f6del  expansion of \"effective calculation\"==\nTo quote [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] (1952), \"The characterization of all \"recursive functions\" was accomplished in the definition of 'general recursive function' by [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]] 1934, who built on a suggestion of [[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]\" (Kleene 1952:274). G\u00f6del delivered a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), Princeton NJ. In a preface written by [[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]]<ref>Davis 1965:39\u201340</ref> Davis observes that\n:\"Dr. G\u00f6del has stated in a letter that he was, at the time of these lectures, not at all convinced that his concept of recursion comprised all possible recursions ...\"<ref>Davis 1965:40</ref>\n\nDawson states that these lectures were meant to clarify concerns that the \"incompleteness theorems were somehow dependent on the particularities of formalization\":<ref>(Dawson 1997:101)</ref>\n\n:\"G\u00f6del mentioned [[Wilhelm Ackermann|Ackermann's]] example in the final section of his 1934 paper, as a way of motivating the concept of \"general recursive function\" that he defined there; but earlier in footnote 3, he had already conjectured (as \"a heuristic principle\") that all finitarily computable functions could be obtained through recursions of such more general sorts.\n\n:\"The conjecture has since elicited much comment. In particular, when Martin Davis undertook to publish G\u00f6del's 1934 lectures [in Davis 1965:41ff] he took it to be a variant of [[Church\u2013Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]]; but in a letter to Davis ...<ref>[246: \"KG to Martin Davis, 15 February 1965, Quoted in G\u00f6del 1986\u2013, vol. I, p. 341\"]</ref> G\u00f6del stated emphatically that that was \"not true\" because at the time of those lectures he was \"not at all convinced\" that his concept of recursion comprised \"all possible recursions.\" Rather, he said, \"The conjecture stated there only refers to the equivalence of 'finite (computation) procedure' and 'recursive procedure.'\" To clarify the issue G\u00f6del added a postscript to the lectures,<ref>G\u00f6del 1964 in (Davis 1965:247) also reprinted in (G\u00f6del 1986, vol. I:369\u2013371)</ref> in which he indicated that what had finally convinced him that the intuitively computable functions coincided with those that were general recursive was [[Alan Turing|Alan Turing's]] work {{Harv|Turing|1937}}.\n:\"G\u00f6del's reluctance to regard either general recursiveness or \u03bb-definability as adequate characterization of the informal notion of effective computability has been examined in detail by several authors [Footnote 248: \"See especially Davis 1982; Gandy 1980 and 1988; Sieg 1994\"]. There is a consensus that, in fact, neither G\u00f6del's nor [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] formalisms were so perspicuous or intrinsically persuasive as Alan Turing's analysis, and [[Wilfried Sieg]] has argued that the evidence in favor of Church's Thesis provided by the \"confluence of different notions\" (the fact that the systems proposed by Church, G\u00f6del, [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] and Alan Turing all turned out to have the same extension) is less compelling than has generally supposed. Hence, quite apart from G\u00f6del's innate caution there were good reasons for his skepticism. But what, then, ''was'' he attempting to achieve through his notion of general recursiveness? ...\n\n:\"Rather, G\u00f6del obtained his definition [of the class of general recursive functions] through modification of Herbrand's ideas ...; and Wilfried Sieg has argued that his real purpose in the final section of the 1934 paper [the lecture notes] was \"''to disassociate recursive functions from <nowiki>[</nowiki>Herbrand's] [[epistemological]]ly restricted notion of proof''\" by specifying \"''mechanical'' rules for deriving equations.\" What was more ''general'' about G\u00f6del's notion of \"general\" recursiveness was, Sieg suggests, that Herbrand had intended only to characterize those functions that could be ''proved'' to be recursive by ''finitary'' means [250].\"<ref>Italics in the original Dawson 1997:101\u2013102</ref>\n\n==Kleene==\n[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] and [[J.

In his paper ''General Recursive Functions of Natural Numbers''<ref>Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:236ff)</ref> Kleene states:\n\n:\"A definition of general recursive function of natural numbers was suggested by [[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]] to G\u00f6del, and was used by G\u00f6del with an important modification in a series of lectures at Princeton in 1934 ...<ref>Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:237)</ref>\n\n:\"A recursive function (relation) in the sense of G\u00f6del ... will now be called a [[primitive recursive function]] (relation).<ref>Kleene 1935 in (Davis 1965:239)</ref>\n\n==Church definition of \"effectively calculable\"==\n[[Alonzo Church|Church's]] paper ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936) proved that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] was undecidable within the \u03bb-calculus and G\u00f6del-Herbrand's general recursion; moreover Church cites two theorems of [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene's]] that proved that the functions defined in the \u03bb-calculus are identical to the functions defined by general recursion:\n:\"Theorem XVI. Every recursive function of positive integers is \u03bb-definable.<sup>16</sup>\n:\"Theorem XVII.

In the form here it was first obtained by Kleene... .\n::\"<sup>17</sup> This result was obtained independently by the present author and S. C. Kleene at about the same time.\n\nThe paper opens with a very long footnote, 3. Another footnote, 9, is also of interest. Martin Davis states that \"This paper is principally important for its explicit statement (since known as [[Church\u2013Turing thesis|Church's thesis]]) that the functions which can be computed by a finite algorithm are precisely the recursive functions, and for the consequence that an explicit unsolvable problem can be given\":<ref>Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:88)</ref>\n\n:\"<sup>3</sup> As will appear, this definition of effective calculability can be stated in either of two equivalent forms, (1) ... \u03bb-definable ... 2) ... recursive ... . The notion of \u03bb-definability is due jointly to the present author and S. C. Kleene, successive steps towards it having been taken by the present author in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'', vol. 34 (1933), p. 863, and Kleene in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'', vol. 57 (1935), p. 219. The notion of recursiveness in the sense of \u00a74 below is due jointly to [[Jacques Herbrand]] and [[Kurt G\u00f6del]], as is there explained. And the proof of equivalence of the two notions is due chiefly to Kleene, but also partly to the present author and to J. B. Rosser<!-- , as explained below --> ... . The proposal to identify these notions with the intuitive notion of effective calculability is first made in the present paper (but see the first footnote to \u00a77 below).\n\n:\"With the aid of the methods of Kleene (''American Journal of Mathematics'', 1935), the considerations of the present paper could, with comparatively slight modification be carried through entirely in terms of \u03bb-definability, without making use of the notion of recursiveness. On the other hand, since the results of the present paper were obtained, it has been shown by Kleene (see his forthcoming paper, \"General recursive functions of natural numbers\") that analogous results can be obtained entirely in terms of recursiveness, without making use of \u03bb-definability. The fact, however, that two such widely different and (in the opinion of the author) equally natural definitions of effective calculability turn out to be equivalent adds to the strength of the reasons adduced below for believing that they constitute as general a characterization of this notion as is consistent with the usual intuitive understanding of it.\"<ref>Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:90)</ref>\n\nFootnote 9 is in section ''\u00a74 Recursive functions'':\n:\" <sup>9</sup>This definition [of \"recursive\"] is closely related to, and was suggested by, a definition of recursive functions which was proposed by Kurt G\u00f6del, in lectures at Princeton, N. J., 1934, and credited by him in part to an unpublished suggestion of Jacques Herbrand. The principal features in which present definition of recursiveness differs from G\u00f6del's are due to S. C. Kleene.\n:\" In a forthcoming paper by Kleene to be entitled \"General recursive functions of natural numbers,\" ... it follows ... that every function recursive in the present sense is also recursive in the sense of G\u00f6del (1934) and conversely.\"<ref>Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:95)</ref>\n\nSome time prior to Church's paper ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936) a dialog occurred between G\u00f6del and Church as to whether or not \u03bb-definability was sufficient for the definition of the notion of \"algorithm\" and \"effective calculability\".\n\nIn Church (1936) we see, under the chapter \u00a77 ''The notion of effective calculability'', a footnote 18 which states the following:\n:\"<sup>18</sup>The question of the relationship between effective calculability and recursiveness (which it is here proposed to answer by identifying the two notions) was raised by G\u00f6del in conversation with the author.

The worker is equipped with \"a fixed ualterable set of directions\".<ref name=\"Post289\"/> Each instruction consists of three or four symbols: (1) an identifying label/number, (2) an operation, (3) next instruction j<sub>i</sub>; however, if the instruction is of type (e) and the determination is \"yes\" THEN instruction j<sub>i</sub>' ELSE if it is \"no\" instruction j<sub>i</sub>. The \"primitive acts\"<ref name=\"Post289\"/> are of only 1 of 5 types: (a) mark the paper in the box he's in (or over-mark a mark already there), (b) erase the mark (or over-erase), (c) move one room to the right, (d) move one room to the left, (e) determine if the paper is marked or blank. The worker starts at step 1 in the starting-room, and does what the instructions instruct them to do. (See more at [[Post\u2013Turing machine]].)\n\nThis matter, mentioned in the introduction about \"intuitive theories\" caused Post to take a potent poke at Church:\n:\"The writer expects the present formulation to turn out to be logically equivalent to recursiveness in the sense of the G\u00f6del-Church development.<sup>7</sup> Its purpose, however, is not only to present a system of a certain logical potency but also, in its restricted field, of psychological fidelity. In the latter sense wider and wider formulations are contemplated. On the other hand, our aim will be to show that all such are logically reducible to formulation 1. We offer this conclusion at the present moment as a ''working hypothesis''.

M. Turing's]] paper [http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/activities/ieg/e-library/sources/tp2-ie.pdf ''On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem''] was delivered to the London Mathematical Society in November 1936. Again the reader must bear in mind a caution: as used by Turing, the word \"computer\" is a human being, and the action of a \"computer\" he calls \"computing\"; for example, he states \"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper\" (p.&nbsp;135). ''But'' he uses the word \"computation\"<ref name=Turing118>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:118)</ref> in the context of his machine-definition, and his definition of \"computable\" numbers is as follows:\n:\"The \"computable\" numbers may be described briefly as the real numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means ... .According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine.\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:116)</ref>\n\nWhat is Turing's definition of his \"machine?\" Turing gives two definitions, the first a summary in ''\u00a71 Computing machines'' and another very similar in \u00a79.I derived from his more detailed analysis of the actions a human \"computer\". With regards to his definition \u00a71 he says that \"justification lies in the fact that the human memory is necessarily limited\",<ref name=Turing117>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:117)</ref> and he concludes \u00a71 with the bald assertion of his proposed machine with his use of the word \"all\"\n\n:\"It is my contention that these operations [write symbol on tape-square, erase symbol, shift ''one'' square left, shift ''one'' square right, scan square for symbol and change machine-configuration as a consequence of ''one'' scanned symbol] include all those which are used in the computation of a number.\"<ref name=\"Turing118\"/>\n\nThe emphasis of the word one in the above brackets is intentional. With regards to \u00a79.I he allows the machine to examine ''more'' squares; it is this more-square sort of behavior that he claims typifies the actions of a computer (person):\n:\"The machine scans B squares corresponding to the B squares observed by the computer. In any move the machine can change a symbol on a scanned square or can change any one of the scanned squares to another square distant not more than L squares from one of the other scanned squares ... The machines just described do not differ very essentially from computing machines as defined in \u00a72 [sic], and corresponding to any machine of this type a computing machine can be constructed to compute the same sequence, that is to say the sequence computed by the computer.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:138)</ref>\n\nTuring goes on to define a \"computing machine\" in \u00a72 is (i) \"a-machine\" (\"automatic machine\") as defined in \u00a71 with the added restriction (ii): (ii) It prints two kinds of symbols \u2013 figures 0 and 1 \u2013 and other symbols. The figures 0 and 1 will represent \"the sequence computed by the machine\".<ref name=\"Turing118\"/>\n\nFurthermore, to define the if the ''number'' is to be considered \"computable\", the machine must print an infinite number of 0's and 1's; if not it is considered to be \"circular\"; otherwise it is considered to be \"circle-free\":\n:\"A number is computable if it differs by an integer from the number computed by a circle-free machine.\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:119)</ref>\n\nAlthough he doesn't call it his \"thesis\", Turing proposes a proof that his \"computability\" is equivalent to [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] \"effective calculability\":\n:\"In a recent paper Alonzo Church has introduced an idea of \"effective calculability\", which is equivalent to my \"computability\", but is very differently defined ... The proof of equivalence between \"computability\" and \"effective calculability\" is outlined in an appendix to the present paper.\"<ref name=\"Turing117\"/>\n\nThe ''Appendix: Computability and effective calculability'' begins in the following manner; observe that he does ''not'' mention ''recursion'' here, and in fact his proof-sketch has his machine munch strings of symbols in the \u03bb-calculus and the calculus munch \"complete configurations\" of his machine, and nowhere is recursion mentioned. The proof of the equivalence of machine-computability and recursion must wait for [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] 1943 and 1952:\n:\"The theorem that all effectively calculable (\u03bb-definable) sequences are computable and its converse are proved below in outline.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:149)</ref>\n\nGandy (1960) seems to confuse this bold proof-sketch with [[Church\u2013Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]]; see 1960 and 1995 below. Moreover a careful reading of Turing's definitions leads the reader to observe that Turing was asserting that the \"operations\" of his proposed machine in \u00a71 are ''sufficient'' to compute ''any'' computable number, and the machine that imitates the action of a human \"computer\" as presented in \u00a79.I is a variety of this proposed machine. This point will be reiterated by Turing in 1939.\n\n==Turing identifies effective calculability with machine computation==\n[[Alan Turing|Alan Turing's]] massive Princeton PhD thesis (under [[Alonzo Church]]) appears as ''Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals''. In it he summarizes the quest for a definition of \"effectively calculable\". He proposes a '''definition''' as shown in the boldface type that specifically identifies (renders identical) the notions of \"machine computation\" and \"effectively calculable\".\n\n:\"A function is said to be \"effectively calculable\" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Although it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematically expressible definition. Such a definition was first given by [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]] at Princeton in 1934 ... . These functions are described as \"general recursive\" by G\u00f6del ... .  Another definition of effective calculability has been given by Church ... who identifies it with \u03bb-definability. The author has recently suggested a definition corresponding more closely to the intuitive idea (Turing [1], see also [[Emil Leon Post|Post's]] [1]). It was stated above that '''\"a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process\". We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine'''. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to '''the author's definition of a computable function''', and to '''an identification of computability \u2020 with effective calculability'''. It is not difficult, though somewhat laborious, to prove that these three definitions are equivalent.<ref>Kleene [3], Turing [2]</ref>\n::\"\u2020 We shall use the expression \"computable function\" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let \"effectively calculable\" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions. We do not restrict the values taken by a computable function to be natural numbers; we may for instance have computable [[propositional function]]s.\"<ref>boldface added, Turing 1939 in (Davis 1965:160)</ref>\n\nThis is a powerful expression. because \"identicality\" is actually an unequivocal statement of necessary and sufficient conditions, in other words there are no other contingencies to the identification\" except what interpretation is given to the words \"function\", \"machine\", \"computable\", and \"effectively calculable\":\n:: For all functions: IF \"this function is computable by machine\" THEN \"this function is effectively calculable\" AND IF \"this function is effectively calculable\" THEN \"this function is computable by a machine.\"\n\n==Rosser: recursion, \u03bb-calculus, and Turing-machine computation identity==\nJ. B. Rosser's paper ''An Informal Exposition of Proofs of G\u00f6del's Theorem and Church's Theorem''<ref>Rosser 1939 in (Davis 1967:223-230)</ref> states the following:\n\n:\"'Effective method' is here used in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely predetermined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date<sup>5</sup>. The simplest of these to state (due to [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] and [[Alan Turing|Turing]]) says essentially that an effective method of solving a certain set of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer. All three definitions are equivalent, so it does not matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one.\n\n::<sup>5</sup> One definition is given by [[Alonzo Church|Church]] in I [i.e. Church 1936 ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number theory''].

In the margin of the script, Hilbert added later: \"the a priori of the philosophers.\" He formulated this axiom as follows: \"I have the capacity to think of objects, and to denote them by means of simple symbols like ''a, b,..., x, y,...,'' so that they can be recognized unambiguously. My thought operates with these objects in a certain way according to certain rules, and my thinking is able to detect these rules by observation of myself, and completely to describe these rules\" [(Hilbert 1905,219); see also (Peckhaus 1990, 62f and 227)].\"<ref>brackets and references in original, Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:227)</ref>\n\nBreger further supports his argument with examples from [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) and [[Hermann Weyl]] (1930-1). He goes on to discuss the problem of then expression of an axiom-set in a particular language: i.e. a language known by the agent, e.g. German.<ref>Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228)</ref><ref>Indeed, Breger gives a potent example of this in his paper (Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228-118))</ref>\n\nSee more about this at [[Algorithm characterizations]], in particular [[John R. Searle|Searle]]'s opinion that outside any computation there must be an observer that gives meaning to the symbols used.\n\n==Sieg and axiomatic definitions==\nAt the \"Feferfest\" \u2013 [[Solomon Feferman|Solomon Feferman's]] 70th birthday \u2013 [[Wilfried Sieg]] first presents a paper written two years earlier titled \"Calculations By Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis\", reprinted in (Sieg et al. 2002:390\u2013409). Earlier Sieg published \"Mechanical Procedures and Mathematical Experience\"  (in George 1994, p.&nbsp;71ff) presenting a history of \"calculability\" beginning <!-- (approximately) --> with [[Richard Dedekind]] and ending in the 1950s <!-- (approximately) --> with the later papers of [[Alan Turing]] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene]].  The Feferfest paper distills the prior paper to its major points and dwells primarily on [[Robin Gandy]]'s paper of 1980. Sieg extends Turing's \"computability by string machine\" (human \"computor\") as reduced to mechanism \"computability by letter machine\"<ref>Turing's thesis \u2013 cf drawing p. 398</ref> to the ''parallel'' machines of Gandy.\n\nSieg cites more recent work including \"Kolmogorov and Uspensky's work on algorithms\" and (De Pisapia 2000), in particular, the [[Pointer machine|KU-pointer machine-model]]), and [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=Sieg399>Sieig 2002:399</ref> and asserts:\n:\"The separation of informal conceptual analysis and mathematical equivalence proof is essential for recognizing that the correctness of ''Turing's Thesis'' (taken generically) rests on two pillars; namely on the correctness of boundedness and locality conditions for computors, and on the correctness of the pertinent central thesis. The latter asserts explicitly that computations of a computor can be mimicked directly by a particular kind of machine. However satisfactory one may find this line of analytic argument, there are two weak spots: the looseness of the restrictive conditions (What are symbolic configurations? What changes can mechanical operations effect?) and the corresponding vagueness of the central thesis. We are, no matter how we turn ourselves, in a position that is methodologically still unsatisfactory ... .\"<ref name=Sieg399/>\n\nHe claims to \"step toward a more satisfactory stance ... [by] abstracting further away from particular types of configurations and operations ...\"<ref name=Sieg399/>\n:\"It has been claimed frequently that Turing analyzed computations of machines. That is historically and systematically inaccurate, as my exposition should have made quite clear. Only in 1980 did Turing's student, Robin Gandy, characterize machine computations.\"<ref name=Sieg399/>\n\nWhether the above statement is true or not is left to the reader to ponder. Sieg goes on to describe Gandy's analysis (see above 1980). In doing so he attempts to formalize what he calls \"[[Gandy machine]]s\" (with a detailed analysis in an Appendix). About the Gandy machines:\n:\"<!-- Let me bring out the central points for Gandy machines. First, --> ... the definition of a Gandy machine is an \"abstract\" mathematical definition that embodies <!-- generally accepted -->... properties of parallel computations<!-- <sup>29</sup> --> ... Second, Gandy machines share with groups and topological spaces the general feature of '''abstract axiomatic definitions''', namely, that they '''admit a wide variety of different interpretations'''. Third, <!-- the central fact, that -->... the computations of any Gandy machine can be simulated by a letter machine, [and] is best understood as a representation theorem for the axiomatic notion. [boldface added]\n\n<!-- ::\"<sup>29</sup>In (Lamport and Lynch) it is asserted that \"the theory of sequential computing rests upon fundamental concepts of computability that are independent of any particular computational model.\" In contrast, it is claimed, no such fundamental concepts underlying distributed computing have yet been developed. That is followed by some informal observations (p. 1166): \"Underlying almost all models of concurrent systems is the assumption that an execution consists of a set of discrete events, each affecting only part of the system's state. Events are grouped into processes, each process being a more or less completely sequenced set of events sharing some common locality in terms of what part of the state they affect. For a collection of autonomous processes to act as a coherent system, the processes must be synchronized ... .\n -->\n:\"The axiomatic approach captures the essential nature of computation processes in an abstract way. The difference between the two types of calculators I have been describing is reduced to the fact that Turing computors modify one bounded part of a state, whereas Gandy machines operate in parallel on arbitrarily many bounded parts. The representation theorems guarantee that models of the axioms are computationally equivalent to [[Turing machines]] in their letter variety.\"<ref>Sieg 2002:404</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*  [[Jon Barwise|Barwise, Jon]], [[Howard Jerome Keisler|H.

It is an important topic in modern mathematical theory and computer science, particularly associated with the work of [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]].\n\nThe debate and discovery of the meaning of \"computation\" and \"recursion\" has been long and contentious.  This article provides detail of that debate and discovery from [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]] in 1889 through recent discussion of the meaning of \"[[axiom]]\".\n\n==Peano's nine axioms of arithmetic==\nIn 1889, [[Giuseppe Peano]] presented his ''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method'', based on the work of [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]]. [[Robert Soare|Soare]] proposes that the origination of \"primitive recursion\" began formally with the axioms of Peano, although\n:\"Well before the nineteenth century mathematicians used the principle of defining a function by induction. Dedekind 1888 proved, using accepted axioms, that such a definition defines a unique function, and he applied it to the definition of the functions m+n, m x n, and m<sup>n</sup>. Based on this work of Dedekind, Peano 1889 and 1891 wrote the familiar five [sic] axioms for the positive integers. As a companion to his fifth [sic] axiom, mathematical induction, Peano used definition by induction, which has been called ''primitive'' recursion (since [[R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter|P\u00e9ter]] 1934 and Kleene 1936) ... .\"<ref>Soare 1996:5</ref>\n\nObserve that ''in fact'' [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]] are ''9'' in number and axiom ''9'' is the recursion/induction axiom.<ref>cf: van Heijenoort 1976:94</ref>\n\n:\"Subsequently the 9 were reduced to 5 as \"Axioms 2, 3, 4 and 5 which deal with identity, belong to the underlying logic. This leaves the five axioms that have become universally known as \"the Peano axioms ... Peano acknowledges (1891b, p. 93) that his axioms come from Dedekind ... .\"<ref>van Heijenoort 1976:83</ref>\n\n==Hilbert and the [[Entscheidungsproblem]]==\nAt the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] (ICM) in 1900 in Paris the famous mathematician [[David Hilbert]] posed a set of problems \u2013 now known as [[Hilbert's problems]] \u2013 his beacon illuminating the way for mathematicians of the twentieth century. Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems introduced the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (the \"decision problem\"). In his 2nd problem he asked for a proof that \"arithmetic\" is \"[[consistent]]\". [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] would prove in 1931 that, within what he called \"P\" (nowadays called [[Peano Arithmetic]]), \"there exist undecidable sentences [propositions]\".<ref>G\u00f6del 1931a in (Davis 1965:6), 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:596)</ref> Because of this, \"the consistency of P is unprovable in P, provided P is consistent\".<ref>G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem IX, G\u00f6del 1931a in (Davis 1965:36)</ref>  While G\u00f6del\u2019s proof would display the tools necessary for [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] to resolve the Entscheidungsproblem, he himself would not answer it.\n\nIt is within Hilbert's [[Hilbert's tenth problem|10th problem]] where the question of an \"Entscheidungsproblem\" actually appears.   The heart of matter was the following question: \"What do we mean when we say that a function is 'effectively calculable'\"?  The answer would be something to this effect: \"When the function is calculated by a ''mechanical'' procedure (process, method).\"  Although stated easily nowadays, the question (and answer) would float about for almost 30 years before it was framed precisely.\n\nHilbert's original description of problem 10 begins as follows:\n:\"'''10. Determination of the solvability of a [[Diophantine equation]]'''.  Given a Diophantine equation with any number of unknown quantities and with [[Integer|rational integral]] [[coefficient]]s: To devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.<ref>This translation, and the original text in German, appears in (Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007:1-2)</ref>\"\n<!--:\"The Entscheidungsproblem [decision problem for [[First-order logic|first-order logic]]] is solved when we know a procedure that allows for any given [[logical expression]] to decide by finitely many operations its validity or satisfiability ... The Entscheidungsproblem must be considered the main problem of [[Mathematical logic|mathematical logic]]. ... The solution of the Entscheidungsproblem is of fundamental significance for the theory of all domains whose propositions could be developed on the basis of a finite number of [[Axiom|axioms]]\"-->\nBy 1922, the specific question of an \"Entscheidungsproblem\" applied to Diophantine equations had developed into the more general question about a \"decision method\" for ''any'' [[Formula|mathematical formula]]. <!--, and H. Behmann stated that\n:\"... most general form of the Entscheidungsproblem [is] as follows:\n::\"A quite definite generally applicable prescription is required which will allow one to decide in a finite number of steps the truth or falsity of a given purely logical assertion ...\"<ref>Gandy 1994:57 quoting Behmann</ref>\n\n:\"Behmann remarks that ... the general problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding which mathematical propositions are true.\" (Gandy 1994:57) -->\n[[Martin Davis (mathematician)|Martin Davis]] explains it this way: Suppose we are given a \"calculational procedure\" that consists of (1) a set of axioms and (2) a logical conclusion written in [[first-order logic]], that is\u2014written in what Davis calls \"[[Gottlob Frege|Frege's]] rules of deduction\" (or the modern equivalent of [[Boolean logic]]).  G\u00f6del\u2019s doctoral dissertation<ref>G\u00f6del 1930 in (van Heijenoort 1967:592ff)</ref> proved that Frege's rules were ''complete'' \"... in the sense that every valid formula is provable\".<ref>van Heijenoort 1967:582</ref>  Given that encouraging fact, could there be a generalized \"calculational procedure\" that would tell us whether a conclusion can be derived from its premises?  Davis calls such calculational procedures \"[[algorithm]]s\".  The Entscheidungsproblem would be an algorithm as well.  \"In principle, an algorithm for [the] Entscheidungsproblem would have reduced all human deductive reasoning to brute calculation\".<ref>Davis 2000:146</ref>\n\nIn other words: Is there an \"algorithm\" that can tell us if ''any'' formula is \"true\" (i.e. an algorithm that always correctly yields a judgment \"truth\" or \"falsehood\"?)\n:\" ... it seemed clear to Hilbert that with the solution of this problem, the Entscheidungsproblem, that it should be possible in principle to settle all mathematical questions in a purely mechanical manner.  Hence, given unsolvable problems at all, if Hilbert was correct, then the Entscheidungsproblem itself should be unsolvable\".<ref>Davis 1965:108</ref>\n\nIndeed: What about our Entscheidungsproblem algorithm itself?  Can it determine, in a finite number of steps, whether it, itself, is \u201csuccessful\u201d and \"truthful\" (that is, it does not get hung up in an endless \"circle\" or \"[[Control flow#Condition-controlled loops|loop]]\", and it correctly yields a judgment \"truth\" or \"falsehood\" about its own behavior and results)?\n\n==Three problems from Hilbert's 2nd and 10th problems==\nAt the 1928 [[International Congress of Mathematicians|Congress]] [in [[Bologna|Bologna, Italy]]] [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] refines the question very carefully into three parts. The following is [[Stephen Hawking|Stephen Hawking's]] summary:\n*\"1. To prove that all true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the '''completeness''' of mathematics.\n*\"2. To prove that only true mathematical statements could be proven, that is, the '''consistency''' of mathematics,\n*\"3. To prove the decidability of mathematics, that is, the existence of a '''decision procedure''' to decide the truth or falsity of any given mathematical proposition.\" <ref>Hawking 2005:1121</ref>\n\n==Simple arithmetic functions irreducible to primitive recursion==\n[[Gabriel Sudan]] (1927) and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] (1928) display [[Computable function|recursive functions]] that are not ''primitive'' recursive:\n\n:\"Are there [[recursion]]s that are not reducible to [[primitive recursion]]; and in particular can recursion be used to define a function which is not primitive recursive?\n\n:\"This question arose from a conjecture of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] in 1926 on the [[continuum problem]], and was answered [yes: there are recursions that are not primitive recursive] by Ackermann 1928.\"<ref>Kleene 1952:271</ref>\n\nIn subsequent years [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]<ref>cf. Kleene 1952:272-273</ref> observes that [[R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter]] (1935) simplified Ackermann's example (\"cf. also Hilbert-[[Bernays]] 1934\") and [[Raphael Robinson]] (1948). P\u00e9ter exhibited another example (1935) that employed [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]. P\u00e9ter (1950) and Ackermann (1940) also displayed \"[[transfinite recursion]]s\", and this led Kleene to wonder:\n:\"... whether we can characterize in any exact way the notion of any \"recursion\", or the class of all \"recursive functions.\"<ref>Kleene 1952:273</ref>\n\nKleene concludes<ref>cf. Kleene 1952:274</ref> that all \"recursions\" involve (i) the formal analysis he presents in his \u00a754 ''Formal calculations of [[primitive recursive function]]s'' and, (ii) the use of [[mathematical induction]].

There is a consensus that, in fact, neither G\u00f6del's nor [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] formalisms were so perspicuous or intrinsically persuasive as Alan Turing's analysis, and [[Wilfried Sieg]] has argued that the evidence in favor of Church's Thesis provided by the \"confluence of different notions\" (the fact that the systems proposed by Church, G\u00f6del, [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] and Alan Turing all turned out to have the same extension) is less compelling than has generally supposed. Hence, quite apart from G\u00f6del's innate caution there were good reasons for his skepticism. But what, then, ''was'' he attempting to achieve through his notion of general recursiveness? ...\n\n:\"Rather, G\u00f6del obtained his definition [of the class of general recursive functions] through modification of Herbrand's ideas ...; and Wilfried Sieg has argued that his real purpose in the final section of the 1934 paper [the lecture notes] was \"''to disassociate recursive functions from <nowiki>[</nowiki>Herbrand's] [[epistemological]]ly restricted notion of proof''\" by specifying \"''mechanical'' rules for deriving equations.\" What was more ''general'' about G\u00f6del's notion of \"general\" recursiveness was, Sieg suggests, that Herbrand had intended only to characterize those functions that could be ''proved'' to be recursive by ''finitary'' means [250].\"<ref>Italics in the original Dawson 1997:101\u2013102</ref>\n\n==Kleene==\n[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] and [[J.

Martin Davis states that \"This paper is principally important for its explicit statement (since known as [[Church\u2013Turing thesis|Church's thesis]]) that the functions which can be computed by a finite algorithm are precisely the recursive functions, and for the consequence that an explicit unsolvable problem can be given\":<ref>Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:88)</ref>\n\n:\"<sup>3</sup> As will appear, this definition of effective calculability can be stated in either of two equivalent forms, (1) ... \u03bb-definable ... 2) ... recursive ... . The notion of \u03bb-definability is due jointly to the present author and S. C. Kleene, successive steps towards it having been taken by the present author in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'', vol. 34 (1933), p. 863, and Kleene in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'', vol. 57 (1935), p. 219. The notion of recursiveness in the sense of \u00a74 below is due jointly to [[Jacques Herbrand]] and [[Kurt G\u00f6del]], as is there explained. And the proof of equivalence of the two notions is due chiefly to Kleene, but also partly to the present author and to J. B. Rosser<!-- , as explained below --> ... . The proposal to identify these notions with the intuitive notion of effective calculability is first made in the present paper (but see the first footnote to \u00a77 below).\n\n:\"With the aid of the methods of Kleene (''American Journal of Mathematics'', 1935), the considerations of the present paper could, with comparatively slight modification be carried through entirely in terms of \u03bb-definability, without making use of the notion of recursiveness. On the other hand, since the results of the present paper were obtained, it has been shown by Kleene (see his forthcoming paper, \"General recursive functions of natural numbers\") that analogous results can be obtained entirely in terms of recursiveness, without making use of \u03bb-definability. The fact, however, that two such widely different and (in the opinion of the author) equally natural definitions of effective calculability turn out to be equivalent adds to the strength of the reasons adduced below for believing that they constitute as general a characterization of this notion as is consistent with the usual intuitive understanding of it.\"<ref>Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:90)</ref>\n\nFootnote 9 is in section ''\u00a74 Recursive functions'':\n:\" <sup>9</sup>This definition [of \"recursive\"] is closely related to, and was suggested by, a definition of recursive functions which was proposed by Kurt G\u00f6del, in lectures at Princeton, N. J., 1934, and credited by him in part to an unpublished suggestion of Jacques Herbrand. The principal features in which present definition of recursiveness differs from G\u00f6del's are due to S. C. Kleene.\n:\" In a forthcoming paper by Kleene to be entitled \"General recursive functions of natural numbers,\" ... it follows ... that every function recursive in the present sense is also recursive in the sense of G\u00f6del (1934) and conversely.\"<ref>Church 1936 in (Davis 1965:95)</ref>\n\nSome time prior to Church's paper ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936) a dialog occurred between G\u00f6del and Church as to whether or not \u03bb-definability was sufficient for the definition of the notion of \"algorithm\" and \"effective calculability\".\n\nIn Church (1936) we see, under the chapter \u00a77 ''The notion of effective calculability'', a footnote 18 which states the following:\n:\"<sup>18</sup>The question of the relationship between effective calculability and recursiveness (which it is here proposed to answer by identifying the two notions) was raised by G\u00f6del in conversation with the author.

The worker is equipped with \"a fixed ualterable set of directions\".<ref name=\"Post289\"/> Each instruction consists of three or four symbols: (1) an identifying label/number, (2) an operation, (3) next instruction j<sub>i</sub>; however, if the instruction is of type (e) and the determination is \"yes\" THEN instruction j<sub>i</sub>' ELSE if it is \"no\" instruction j<sub>i</sub>. The \"primitive acts\"<ref name=\"Post289\"/> are of only 1 of 5 types: (a) mark the paper in the box he's in (or over-mark a mark already there), (b) erase the mark (or over-erase), (c) move one room to the right, (d) move one room to the left, (e) determine if the paper is marked or blank. The worker starts at step 1 in the starting-room, and does what the instructions instruct them to do. (See more at [[Post\u2013Turing machine]].)\n\nThis matter, mentioned in the introduction about \"intuitive theories\" caused Post to take a potent poke at Church:\n:\"The writer expects the present formulation to turn out to be logically equivalent to recursiveness in the sense of the G\u00f6del-Church development.<sup>7</sup> Its purpose, however, is not only to present a system of a certain logical potency but also, in its restricted field, of psychological fidelity. In the latter sense wider and wider formulations are contemplated. On the other hand, our aim will be to show that all such are logically reducible to formulation 1. We offer this conclusion at the present moment as a ''working hypothesis''.

M. Turing's]] paper [http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/activities/ieg/e-library/sources/tp2-ie.pdf ''On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem''] was delivered to the London Mathematical Society in November 1936. Again the reader must bear in mind a caution: as used by Turing, the word \"computer\" is a human being, and the action of a \"computer\" he calls \"computing\"; for example, he states \"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper\" (p.&nbsp;135). ''But'' he uses the word \"computation\"<ref name=Turing118>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:118)</ref> in the context of his machine-definition, and his definition of \"computable\" numbers is as follows:\n:\"The \"computable\" numbers may be described briefly as the real numbers whose expressions as a decimal are calculable by finite means ... .According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine.\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:116)</ref>\n\nWhat is Turing's definition of his \"machine?\" Turing gives two definitions, the first a summary in ''\u00a71 Computing machines'' and another very similar in \u00a79.I derived from his more detailed analysis of the actions a human \"computer\". With regards to his definition \u00a71 he says that \"justification lies in the fact that the human memory is necessarily limited\",<ref name=Turing117>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:117)</ref> and he concludes \u00a71 with the bald assertion of his proposed machine with his use of the word \"all\"\n\n:\"It is my contention that these operations [write symbol on tape-square, erase symbol, shift ''one'' square left, shift ''one'' square right, scan square for symbol and change machine-configuration as a consequence of ''one'' scanned symbol] include all those which are used in the computation of a number.\"<ref name=\"Turing118\"/>\n\nThe emphasis of the word one in the above brackets is intentional. With regards to \u00a79.I he allows the machine to examine ''more'' squares; it is this more-square sort of behavior that he claims typifies the actions of a computer (person):\n:\"The machine scans B squares corresponding to the B squares observed by the computer. In any move the machine can change a symbol on a scanned square or can change any one of the scanned squares to another square distant not more than L squares from one of the other scanned squares ... The machines just described do not differ very essentially from computing machines as defined in \u00a72 [sic], and corresponding to any machine of this type a computing machine can be constructed to compute the same sequence, that is to say the sequence computed by the computer.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:138)</ref>\n\nTuring goes on to define a \"computing machine\" in \u00a72 is (i) \"a-machine\" (\"automatic machine\") as defined in \u00a71 with the added restriction (ii): (ii) It prints two kinds of symbols \u2013 figures 0 and 1 \u2013 and other symbols. The figures 0 and 1 will represent \"the sequence computed by the machine\".<ref name=\"Turing118\"/>\n\nFurthermore, to define the if the ''number'' is to be considered \"computable\", the machine must print an infinite number of 0's and 1's; if not it is considered to be \"circular\"; otherwise it is considered to be \"circle-free\":\n:\"A number is computable if it differs by an integer from the number computed by a circle-free machine.\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:119)</ref>\n\nAlthough he doesn't call it his \"thesis\", Turing proposes a proof that his \"computability\" is equivalent to [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] \"effective calculability\":\n:\"In a recent paper Alonzo Church has introduced an idea of \"effective calculability\", which is equivalent to my \"computability\", but is very differently defined ... The proof of equivalence between \"computability\" and \"effective calculability\" is outlined in an appendix to the present paper.\"<ref name=\"Turing117\"/>\n\nThe ''Appendix: Computability and effective calculability'' begins in the following manner; observe that he does ''not'' mention ''recursion'' here, and in fact his proof-sketch has his machine munch strings of symbols in the \u03bb-calculus and the calculus munch \"complete configurations\" of his machine, and nowhere is recursion mentioned. The proof of the equivalence of machine-computability and recursion must wait for [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] 1943 and 1952:\n:\"The theorem that all effectively calculable (\u03bb-definable) sequences are computable and its converse are proved below in outline.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}} in (Davis 1967:149)</ref>\n\nGandy (1960) seems to confuse this bold proof-sketch with [[Church\u2013Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]]; see 1960 and 1995 below. Moreover a careful reading of Turing's definitions leads the reader to observe that Turing was asserting that the \"operations\" of his proposed machine in \u00a71 are ''sufficient'' to compute ''any'' computable number, and the machine that imitates the action of a human \"computer\" as presented in \u00a79.I is a variety of this proposed machine. This point will be reiterated by Turing in 1939.\n\n==Turing identifies effective calculability with machine computation==\n[[Alan Turing|Alan Turing's]] massive Princeton PhD thesis (under [[Alonzo Church]]) appears as ''Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals''. In it he summarizes the quest for a definition of \"effectively calculable\". He proposes a '''definition''' as shown in the boldface type that specifically identifies (renders identical) the notions of \"machine computation\" and \"effectively calculable\".\n\n:\"A function is said to be \"effectively calculable\" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Although it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematically expressible definition. Such a definition was first given by [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del]] at Princeton in 1934 ... . These functions are described as \"general recursive\" by G\u00f6del ... .  Another definition of effective calculability has been given by Church ... who identifies it with \u03bb-definability. The author has recently suggested a definition corresponding more closely to the intuitive idea (Turing [1], see also [[Emil Leon Post|Post's]] [1]). It was stated above that '''\"a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process\". We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine'''. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to '''the author's definition of a computable function''', and to '''an identification of computability \u2020 with effective calculability'''. It is not difficult, though somewhat laborious, to prove that these three definitions are equivalent.<ref>Kleene [3], Turing [2]</ref>\n::\"\u2020 We shall use the expression \"computable function\" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let \"effectively calculable\" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions. We do not restrict the values taken by a computable function to be natural numbers; we may for instance have computable [[propositional function]]s.\"<ref>boldface added, Turing 1939 in (Davis 1965:160)</ref>\n\nThis is a powerful expression. because \"identicality\" is actually an unequivocal statement of necessary and sufficient conditions, in other words there are no other contingencies to the identification\" except what interpretation is given to the words \"function\", \"machine\", \"computable\", and \"effectively calculable\":\n:: For all functions: IF \"this function is computable by machine\" THEN \"this function is effectively calculable\" AND IF \"this function is effectively calculable\" THEN \"this function is computable by a machine.\"\n\n==Rosser: recursion, \u03bb-calculus, and Turing-machine computation identity==\nJ. B. Rosser's paper ''An Informal Exposition of Proofs of G\u00f6del's Theorem and Church's Theorem''<ref>Rosser 1939 in (Davis 1967:223-230)</ref> states the following:\n\n:\"'Effective method' is here used in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely predetermined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date<sup>5</sup>. The simplest of these to state (due to [[Emil Leon Post|Post]] and [[Alan Turing|Turing]]) says essentially that an effective method of solving a certain set of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer. All three definitions are equivalent, so it does not matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one.\n\n::<sup>5</sup> One definition is given by [[Alonzo Church|Church]] in I [i.e. Church 1936 ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number theory''].

He reiterates his opinions even more clearly in 1964 (see below):\n\n:\"''Note Added 28 August 1963''. In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact that due to [[Alan Turing|A. M. Turing's]] work<sup>69</sup> a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system<sup>70</sup> can now be given, a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible. That is, it can be proved rigorously that in every consistent formal system that contains a certain amount of finitary number theory there exist undecidable arithmetic propositions and that, moreover, the consistency of any such system cannot be proved in the system.\n\n::\"<sup>69</sup> See ''{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}'', p. 249.\n\n:::\"<sup>70</sup> In my opinion the term \"formal system\" or \"formalism\" should never be used for anything but this notion. In a lecture at Princeton (mentioned in ''Princeton University 1946'', p. 11 [see Davis 1965, pp. 84-88 [i.e. Davis p. 84-88] ]), I suggested certain transfinite generalizations of formalisms, but these are something radically different from formal systems in the proper sense of the term, whose characteristic property is that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices.\"<ref>G\u00f6del 1963 in (van Heijenoort 1976:616)</ref>\n\n'''G\u00f6del 1964''' \u2013 In G\u00f6del's ''Postscriptum'' to his lecture's notes of 1934 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study|IAS at Princeton]],<ref>Due to the language difference, G\u00f6del refers to the IAS as \"AIS\"</ref> he repeats, but reiterates in even more bold terms, his less-than-glowing opinion about the efficacy of computability as defined by [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] \u03bb-definability and recursion (we have to infer that both are denigrated because of his use of the plural \"definitions\" in the following). This was in a letter to Martin Davis (presumably as he was assembling ''The Undecidable''). The repeat of some of the phrasing is striking:\n\n:\"In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact, that, due to A. M. Turing's work, a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be given, the existence of undecidable arithmetical propositions and the non-demonstrability of the consistence of a system in the same system can now be proved rigorously for ''every'' consistent formal system containing a certain amount of finitary number theory.\n\n:\"Turing's work gives an analysis of the concept of \"mechanical procedure\" (alias \"algorithm\" or \"computation procedure\" or \"finite combinatorial procedure\"). This concept is shown to be equivalent to that of a \"[[Turing machine]]\".* A formal system can simply be defined to be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas ... the concept of formal system, whose essence it is that reasoning is completely replaced by mechanical operations on formulas. (Note that the question of whether there exist finite ''non-mechanical'' procedures ... not equivalent with any algorithm, has nothing whatsoever to do with the adequacy of the definition of \"formal system\" and of \"mechanical procedure.\n\n:\"... if \"finite procedure\" is understood to mean \"mechanical procedure\", the question raised in footnote 3 can be answered affirmatively for recursiveness as defined in \u00a79, which is equivalent to general recursiveness as defined today (see S.

Gandy starts off with an unlikely expression of [[Church\u2013Turing thesis|Church's Thesis]], framed as follows:\n\n:\"1. Introduction\n:\"Throughout this paper we shall use \"calculable\" to refer to some intuitively given notion and \"computable\" to mean \"computable by a [[Turing machine]]\"; of course many equivalent definitions of \"computable\" are now available.\n:\"''Church's Thesis. What is effectively calculable is computable.''\n:\" ... Both Church and Turing had in mind calculation by an abstract human being using some mechanical aids (such as paper and pencil)\"<ref>Gandy in (Barwise 1980:123)</ref>\n\n[[Robert Soare]] (1995, see below) had issues with this framing, considering [[Alonzo Church|Church's]] paper (1936) published prior to [[Alan Turing|Turing's]] \"Appendix proof\" (1937).\n\nGandy attempts to \"analyze mechanical processes and so to provide arguments for the following:\n:\"Thesis M. What can be calculated by a machine is computable.\" <ref>Gandy in (Barwise 1980:124</ref>\n\nGandy \"exclude[s] from consideration devices which are essentially analogue machines ... .The only physical presuppositions made about mechanical devices (Cf Principle IV below) are that there is a lower bound on the linear dimensions of every atomic part of the device and that there is an upper bound (the velocity of light) on the speed of propagation of change\".<ref name=Gandy126>Gandy in (Barwise 1980:126)</ref> But then he restricts his machines even more:\n:\"(2) Secondly we suppose that the progress of calculation by a mechanical device may be described in discrete terms, so that the devices considered are, in a loose sense, digital computers.\n:\"(3) Lasty we suppose that the device is deterministic: that is, the subsequent behavior of the device is uniquely determined once a complete description of its initial state is given.\"<ref name=\"Gandy126\"/>\n\nHe in fact makes an argument for this \"Thesis M\" that he calls his \"Theorem\", the most important \"Principle\" of which is \"Principle IV: Principle of local causation\":\n:\"Now we come to the most important of our principles. In Turing's analysis the requirement that the action depended only on a bounded portion of the record was based on a human limitation. We replace this by a physical limitation which we call the ''principle of local causation.'' Its justification lies in the finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals: contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance.\"<ref>Gandy in (Barwise 1980:135)</ref>\n\n==Soare==\n[[Robert Soare|Soare]]'s thorough examination of ''Computability and Recursion'' appears. He quotes [[Kurt G\u00f6del|G\u00f6del's]] 1964 opinion (above) with respect to the \"much less suitable\" definition of computability, and goes on to add:\n:\"[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] wrote [1981b, p. 49], \"[[Alan Turing|Turing's]] computability is intrinsically persuasive\" but \"\u03bb-definability is not intrinsically persuasive\" and \"general recursiveness scarcely so (its author G\u00f6del being at the time not at all persuaded) ... . Most people today accept Turing's Thesis\"<ref>Soare 1996:13</ref>\n\nSoare's footnote 7 (1995) also catches [[Robin Gandy|Gandy's]] \"confusion\", but apparently it continues into Gandy (1988). This confusion represents a serious error of research and/or thought and remains a cloud hovering over his whole program:\n:\"<sup>7</sup>Gandy actually wrote \"Church's thesis\" not \"Turing's thesis\" as written here, but surely Gandy meant the latter, at least intensionally, because Turing did not prove anything in 1936 or anywhere else about general recursive functions.\"<ref>Soare 1996:11</ref>\n\n==Breger and problem of tacit axioms==\nBreger points out a problem when one is approaching a notion \"axiomatically\", that is, an \"axiomatic system\" may have imbedded in it one or more ''tacit'' axioms that are unspoken when the axiom-set is presented.\n\nFor example, an active agent with knowledge (and capability) may be a (potential) fundamental axiom in any axiomatic system: \"the know-how of a human being is necessary \u2013 a know-how which is not formalized in the axioms. \u00b6 ... Mathematics as a purely formal system of symbols without a human being possessing the know-how with the symbols is impossible ...\"<ref>Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:221)</ref>\n\nHe quotes [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]:\n: \"In a university lecture given in 1905, Hilbert considered it \"absolutely necessary\" to have an \"axiom of thought\" or \"an axiom of the existence of an intelligence\" before stating the axioms in logic. In the margin of the script, Hilbert added later: \"the a priori of the philosophers.\" He formulated this axiom as follows: \"I have the capacity to think of objects, and to denote them by means of simple symbols like ''a, b,..., x, y,...,'' so that they can be recognized unambiguously. My thought operates with these objects in a certain way according to certain rules, and my thinking is able to detect these rules by observation of myself, and completely to describe these rules\" [(Hilbert 1905,219); see also (Peckhaus 1990, 62f and 227)].\"<ref>brackets and references in original, Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:227)</ref>\n\nBreger further supports his argument with examples from [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) and [[Hermann Weyl]] (1930-1). He goes on to discuss the problem of then expression of an axiom-set in a particular language: i.e. a language known by the agent, e.g. German.<ref>Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228)</ref><ref>Indeed, Breger gives a potent example of this in his paper (Breger in (Groshoz and Breger 2002:228-118))</ref>\n\nSee more about this at [[Algorithm characterizations]], in particular [[John R. Searle|Searle]]'s opinion that outside any computation there must be an observer that gives meaning to the symbols used.\n\n==Sieg and axiomatic definitions==\nAt the \"Feferfest\" \u2013 [[Solomon Feferman|Solomon Feferman's]] 70th birthday \u2013 [[Wilfried Sieg]] first presents a paper written two years earlier titled \"Calculations By Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis\", reprinted in (Sieg et al. 2002:390\u2013409). Earlier Sieg published \"Mechanical Procedures and Mathematical Experience\"  (in George 1994, p.&nbsp;71ff) presenting a history of \"calculability\" beginning <!-- (approximately) --> with [[Richard Dedekind]] and ending in the 1950s <!-- (approximately) --> with the later papers of [[Alan Turing]] and [[Stephen Cole Kleene]].  The Feferfest paper distills the prior paper to its major points and dwells primarily on [[Robin Gandy]]'s paper of 1980. Sieg extends Turing's \"computability by string machine\" (human \"computor\") as reduced to mechanism \"computability by letter machine\"<ref>Turing's thesis \u2013 cf drawing p. 398</ref> to the ''parallel'' machines of Gandy.\n\nSieg cites more recent work including \"Kolmogorov and Uspensky's work on algorithms\" and (De Pisapia 2000), in particular, the [[Pointer machine|KU-pointer machine-model]]), and [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=Sieg399>Sieig 2002:399</ref> and asserts:\n:\"The separation of informal conceptual analysis and mathematical equivalence proof is essential for recognizing that the correctness of ''Turing's Thesis'' (taken generically) rests on two pillars; namely on the correctness of boundedness and locality conditions for computors, and on the correctness of the pertinent central thesis. The latter asserts explicitly that computations of a computor can be mimicked directly by a particular kind of machine. However satisfactory one may find this line of analytic argument, there are two weak spots: the looseness of the restrictive conditions (What are symbolic configurations? What changes can mechanical operations effect?) and the corresponding vagueness of the central thesis. We are, no matter how we turn ourselves, in a position that is methodologically still unsatisfactory ... .\"<ref name=Sieg399/>\n\nHe claims to \"step toward a more satisfactory stance ... [by] abstracting further away from particular types of configurations and operations ...\"<ref name=Sieg399/>\n:\"It has been claimed frequently that Turing analyzed computations of machines. That is historically and systematically inaccurate, as my exposition should have made quite clear. Only in 1980 did Turing's student, Robin Gandy, characterize machine computations.\"<ref name=Sieg399/>\n\nWhether the above statement is true or not is left to the reader to ponder. Sieg goes on to describe Gandy's analysis (see above 1980). In doing so he attempts to formalize what he calls \"[[Gandy machine]]s\" (with a detailed analysis in an Appendix). About the Gandy machines:\n:\"<!-- Let me bring out the central points for Gandy machines. First, --> ... the definition of a Gandy machine is an \"abstract\" mathematical definition that embodies <!-- generally accepted -->... properties of parallel computations<!-- <sup>29</sup> --> ... Second, Gandy machines share with groups and topological spaces the general feature of '''abstract axiomatic definitions''', namely, that they '''admit a wide variety of different interpretations'''. Third, <!-- the central fact, that -->... the computations of any Gandy machine can be simulated by a letter machine, [and] is best understood as a representation theorem for the axiomatic notion. [boldface added]\n\n<!-- ::\"<sup>29</sup>In (Lamport and Lynch) it is asserted that \"the theory of sequential computing rests upon fundamental concepts of computability that are independent of any particular computational model.\" In contrast, it is claimed, no such fundamental concepts underlying distributed computing have yet been developed. That is followed by some informal observations (p. 1166): \"Underlying almost all models of concurrent systems is the assumption that an execution consists of a set of discrete events, each affecting only part of the system's state. Events are grouped into processes, each process being a more or less completely sequenced set of events sharing some common locality in terms of what part of the state they affect. For a collection of autonomous processes to act as a coherent system, the processes must be synchronized ... .\n -->\n:\"The axiomatic approach captures the essential nature of computation processes in an abstract way. The difference between the two types of calculators I have been describing is reduced to the fact that Turing computors modify one bounded part of a state, whereas Gandy machines operate in parallel on arbitrarily many bounded parts. The representation theorems guarantee that models of the axioms are computationally equivalent to [[Turing machines]] in their letter variety.\"<ref>Sieg 2002:404</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*  [[Jon Barwise|Barwise, Jon]], [[Howard Jerome Keisler|H.
