He is the former [[Member of Parliament (Canada)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Ottawa\u2014Orl\u00e9ans]] riding.  He was first elected in the [[2004 Canadian federal election]], representing the [[Liberal Party of Canada]].\n\nBorn in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Godbout has a master's degree in [[education]] from the [[University of Ottawa]].\n\nBefore entering politics, he worked as a high school history teacher. He has been Assistant Deputy Minister responsible for elementary and secondary education in Ontario and Director General and Secretary Treasurer of the Conseil des \u00e9coles catholiques de langue fran\u00e7aise du Centre-Est de l\u2019Ontario.\n\nHe entered federal politics by running for the Liberal nomination against sitting Liberal MP [[Eug\u00e8ne Bellemare]]. Bellemare, who held the riding for several elections, was removed. After his defeat in the nomination, Bellemare retired from politics.\n\nGodbout succeeded in beating the Conservative candidate Walter Robinson in the general election of 2004, by a slim majority. He campaigned on bringing more federal government jobs to the east end of Ottawa.\n\nIn the 2006 general election, Godbout ran on a platform of Liberal support for municipalities and infrastructure. After eighteen years of the riding being held by the Liberals, Godbout was defeated for re-election when the Conservative Party of Canada won the riding under [[Royal Galipeau]] in the federal election of January 23, 2006.\n\nGodbout, along with a number of former and present Ontario Liberal MPs endorsed party leadership candidate [[Gerard Kennedy]]. At the Liberal Party Convention in Montreal, Godbout supported [[Michael Ignatieff]] after Kennedy dropped off the ballot. At the final ballot, Ignatieff was defeated by [[St\u00e9phane Dion]].\n\nOn April 29, 2007, Godbout was nominated to run in the [[40th Canadian federal election]] in a re-match against Galipeau. In the [[2008 Canadian federal election]], Godbout lost for the second time in a row to Conservative incumbent Royal Galipeau, and this time by an increased majority. The re-election of Galipeau marks the first time a Conservative candidate has been re-elected in the Orl\u00e9ans riding since 1872.\n\nIn July 2009, Godbout announced that he would not make another run at reclaiming the riding in the next federal election. He said the decision was a professional one, as he wanted to focus on his business, a consulting firm, operating out of the east end.<ref>[http://www.emcorleans.ca/20090710/News/Godbout+will+not+join+Liberal+nomination+race \"Godbout will not join Liberal nomination race\"].

Art by [[Yuji Uekawa]].]]\nThe ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[video game franchise]] began in 1991 with the game ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]], which pitted a blue [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] hedgehog named [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] against a rotund male human villain named [[Doctor Eggman]] (or Doctor Ivo Robotnik). The sequel, ''[[Sonic 2]]'', gave Sonic a fox friend named [[Tails (character)|Tails]]. ''[[Sonic CD]]'' introduced [[Amy Rose]], a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic. ''[[Sonic 3]]'' introduced [[Knuckles the Echidna]], Sonic's rival and, later, friend. All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games.\n\nThe series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years. These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like [[Shadow the Hedgehog]] and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like [[Metal Sonic]] and [[E-123 Omega]], as well as human characters like Eggman's grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]]. The series features two fictional species: [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]], which have usually functioned as [[digital pet]]s and minor gameplay and plot elements, [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisps]], which have been used as [[power-up]]s.\n\nThe ''Sonic'' games keep a separate continuity from the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'' comics]] published by [[Archie Comics]] and other ''Sonic'' media and, as a result, feature a distinct yet overlapping array of characters.<!-- PLEASE READ: Please place future new characters at the bottom of the list. -->\n\n==Characters==\n===Sonic the Hedgehog===\n{{Main|Sonic the Hedgehog (character)}}\n\n{{nihongo foot|Sonic Ogilvie Maurice Wentworth the Hedgehog, known as just Sonic the Hedgehog in the videogame series,|\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30d8\u30c3\u30b8\u30db\u30c3\u30b0|Sonikku Za Hejjihoggu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} trademarked ''Sonic The Hedgehog'',<ref name=\"sonic's middle name\">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven L.

He first appears in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog CD]]''. He is given orders to go back in time and change the past so that Dr. Eggman can rule the future. Sonic must race him in Stardust Speedway to free Amy Rose. He is severely wounded when he crashes and falls, but is rejuvenated by Robotnik in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II]]'', only to be defeated again in a similar style. He returns in ''[[Knuckles' Chaotix]]'', where he attempts to obtain the Chaos Rings, but he is stopped by the Chaotix. Metal Sonic notably acted as the main antagonist in ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', appearing in a new form as Neo Metal Sonic before transforming into the game's final boss, the Metal Overlord. Upon being defeated by Super Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, he reverts to his traditional appearance. He appears as the main antagonist in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)]]'', where Eggman records Sonic's abilities and uploads them to Metal Sonic, who proceeds in attempting to destroy the world before being tossed into lava by Sonic. Metal Sonic appears as a bonus playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals]]'', reprogrammed to aid Eggman Nega in his attempt to take over the world. He returns as a playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals 2]]'', under orders from Eggman to aid Shadow in stopping Eggman Nega's plans. In ''[[Sonic Free Riders]]'', Metal Sonic is a playable character and the final opponent in the game's story mode. In ''[[Sonic Generations]]'', he appears in his classic form as a rival boss, battling Classic Sonic in Stardust Speedway before ultimately being destroyed. Metal Sonic returns as a boss character in ''[[Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric]]'' and ''[[Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal]]''. He appears in the ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' episode, \"It Wasn't Me, It Was the One-Armed Hedgehog\". Metal Sonic appears as a boss in the Sonic story mode of ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''.\n\nMetal Sonic appeared as a playable character in the multiplayer mode of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]]'', as well as ''[[Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing]]'', ''[[Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed]]'', and all the ''[[Mario & Sonic]]'' titles beginning with ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]''. Collecting all the emblems in ''[[Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut]]'' unlocks Metal Sonic as a bonus playable character in Sonic's stages, and purchasing both episodes of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I|Sonic the Hedgehog 4]]'' unlocks bonus levels in which Metal Sonic is playable.\n\nHe possesses great strength, including a [[Raygun|laser cannon]], a [[jet engine]] and a [[force shield|force field device]] he can use to protect himself from projectiles and certain attacks.

Art by [[Yuji Uekawa]].]]\nThe ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[video game franchise]] began in 1991 with the game ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]], which pitted a blue [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] hedgehog named [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] against a rotund male human villain named [[Doctor Eggman]] (or Doctor Ivo Robotnik). The sequel, ''[[Sonic 2]]'', gave Sonic a fox friend named [[Tails (character)|Tails]]. ''[[Sonic CD]]'' introduced [[Amy Rose]], a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic. ''[[Sonic 3]]'' introduced [[Knuckles the Echidna]], Sonic's rival and, later, friend. All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games.\n\nThe series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years. These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like [[Shadow the Hedgehog]] and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like [[Metal Sonic]] and [[E-123 Omega]], as well as human characters like Eggman's grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]]. The series features two fictional species: [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]], which have usually functioned as [[digital pet]]s and minor gameplay and plot elements, [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisps]], which have been used as [[power-up]]s.\n\nThe ''Sonic'' games keep a separate continuity from the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'' comics]] published by [[Archie Comics]] and other ''Sonic'' media and, as a result, feature a distinct yet overlapping array of characters.<!-- PLEASE READ: Please place future new characters at the bottom of the list. -->\n\n==Characters==\n===Sonic the Hedgehog===\n{{Main|Sonic the Hedgehog (character)}}\n\n{{nihongo foot|Sonic the Hedgehog,|\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30d8\u30c3\u30b8\u30db\u30c3\u30b0|Sonikku Za Hejjihoggu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} trademarked ''Sonic The Hedgehog'',<ref name=\"sonic's middle name\">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven L.

He first appears in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog CD]]''. He is given orders to go back in time and change the past so that Dr. Eggman can rule the future. Sonic must race him in Stardust Speedway to free Amy Rose. He is severely wounded when he crashes and falls, but is rejuvenated by Robotnik in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II]]'', only to be defeated again in a similar style. He returns in ''[[Knuckles' Chaotix]]'', where he attempts to obtain the Chaos Rings, but he is stopped by the Chaotix. Metal Sonic notably acted as the main antagonist in ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', appearing in a new form as Neo Metal Sonic before transforming into the game's final boss, the Metal Overlord. Upon being defeated by Super Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, he reverts to his traditional appearance. He appears as the main antagonist in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)]]'', where Eggman records Sonic's abilities and uploads them to Metal Sonic, who proceeds in attempting to destroy the world before being tossed into lava by Sonic. Metal Sonic appears as a bonus playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals]]'', reprogrammed to aid Eggman Nega in his attempt to take over the world. He returns as a playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals 2]]'', under orders from Eggman to aid Shadow in stopping Eggman Nega's plans. In ''[[Sonic Free Riders]]'', Metal Sonic is a playable character and the final opponent in the game's story mode. In ''[[Sonic Generations]]'', he appears in his classic form as a rival boss, battling Classic Sonic in Stardust Speedway before ultimately being destroyed. Metal Sonic returns as a boss character in ''[[Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric]]'' and ''[[Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal]]''. He appears in the ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' episode, \"It Wasn't Me, It Was the One-Armed Hedgehog\". Metal Sonic appears as a boss in the Sonic story mode of ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''.\n\nMetal Sonic appeared as a playable character in the multiplayer mode of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]]'', as well as ''[[Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing]]'', ''[[Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed]]'', and all the ''[[Mario & Sonic]]'' titles beginning with ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]''. Collecting all the emblems in ''[[Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut]]'' unlocks Metal Sonic as a bonus playable character in Sonic's stages, and purchasing both episodes of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I|Sonic the Hedgehog 4]]'' unlocks bonus levels in which Metal Sonic is playable.\n\nHe possesses great strength, including a [[Raygun|laser cannon]], a [[jet engine]] and a [[force shield|force field device]] he can use to protect himself from projectiles and certain attacks. He usually only communicates with a series of electronic noises. The only notable time Metal Sonic was able to talk was in ''Sonic Heroes'' in which he was voiced by [[Jun'ichi Kanemaru]] in Japanese and [[Ryan Drummond]] in English.\n\n[[GameDaily]] placed Metal Sonic 13th on their \"Top 25 Video Game Robots\" list, describing him as Dr. Robotnik's \"greatest creation\" and praising the strength of his abilities.<ref>Buffa, Chris (2009-02-06).

S|publisher=Lanham, MD: Scarecrow|year=2009}}</ref> an event which changed the history of the entire region. The oil discovery led to petrochemical industry development and also the establishment of industries that strongly depended on oil. On 14 April 1909, the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC) was incorporated as a subsidiary of [[Burmah Oil|Burmah Oil Company]]. Some of the shares were sold to the public.<ref name=Gasson/> The first chairman and minority shareholder of the company became [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Lord Strathcona]].<ref name=masjid/>\n\nImmediately after establishing the company, the British government asked [[Percy Cox]], British resident to [[Bushehr Province|Bushehr]], to negotiate an agreement with [[Khaz\u2019al Khan Ibn Haji Jabir Khan|Sheikh Khaz\u2019al Ibn Jabir]] of [[Emirate of Arabistan|Arabistan]] for APOC to obtain a site on [[Abadan, Iran|Abadan]] Island for a refinery, depot, storage tanks, and other operations. The refinery was built and began operating in 1912.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1913, the British government acquired a controlling interest (50.0025%) in the company and at the suggestion of [[Winston Churchill]], the British navy switched from coal to oil.<ref name=masjid/><ref name=bbc110898/><ref name=beale/> In 1914, APOC signed a 30-year contract with the [[British Admiralty]] for supplying oil for the [[Royal Navy]] at the fixed price.<ref name=\"Atabaki\"/> In 1915, APOC established its shipping subsidiary the [[British Tanker Company]] and in 1916 it acquired the British Petroleum Company which was a marketing arm of the German ''Europ\u00e4ische Petroleum Union'' in Britain.<ref name=masjid/> In 1919, the company became a [[shale oil|shale-oil]] producer by establishing a subsidiary named Scottish Oils which merged remaining Scottish [[oil shale industry|oil-shale industries]].<ref name=\"ferrier-shale\"/><ref name=marwick/><ref name=uphall/><ref name=museum/>\n\nAfter [[World War I]], APOC started marketing its products in Continental Europe and acquired stakes in the local marketing companies in several European countries. Refineries were built in [[Llandarcy]] in Wales (the first refinery in the United Kingdom) and [[Grangemouth Refinery|Grangemouth]] in Scotland.  It also acquired the controlling stake in the [[Courchelettes]] refinery in France and formed with the [[Government of Australia]] a partnership named [[Commonwealth Oil Refineries]], which built the Australian's first refinery in [[Laverton, Victoria]].<ref name=masjid/> In 1923, Burmah employed [[Winston Churchill]] as a paid consultant to lobby the British government to allow APOC have exclusive rights to [[Iran|Persian]] oil resources, which were subsequently granted by the Iranian monarchy.<ref name=independent030909/>\n\nAPOC and the Armenian businessman [[Calouste Gulbenkian]] were the driving forces behind the creation of [[Turkish Petroleum Company]] (TPC) in 1912 to explore oil in [[Mesopotamia]] (now Iraq); and by 1914, APOC held 50% of TPC shares.<ref name=MetzTPC/> In 1925, TPC received concession in the [[Oil reserves in Iraq|Mesopotamian oil resources]] from the [[Kingdom of Iraq (Mandate administration)|Iraqi government]] under British mandate. TPC finally struck oil in Iraq on 14 October 1927. By 1928, the APOC's shareholding in TPC, which by now was named [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), was reduced to 23.75%; as the result of the changing geopolitics post [[Ottoman empire]] break-up, and the [[Red Line Agreement]].<ref name=\"GT-DEX-1920-78\"/> Relations were generally cordial between the pro-west [[Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite Monarchy (1932\u201358)]] in Iraq and IPC, in spite of disputes centered on Iraq's wish for greater involvement and more royalties. During the 1928\u201368 time period, IPC monopolised oil exploration inside the [[Red Line Agreement|Red Line]]; excluding Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.<ref name=SH/><ref name=yergin/>\n\nIn 1927, Burmah Oil and [[Royal Dutch Shell]] formed the joint marketing company [[Burmah-Shell]].

IPC offered financial support to raise an armed force that would assist the Sultanate in occupying the interior region of Oman.

In Iran, the AIOC and the pro-western Iranian government led by Prime Minister [[Ali Razmara]] resisted nationalist calls to revise AIOC's concession terms in Iran's favour. In March 1951, Razmara was assassinated and [[Mohammed Mossadeq]], a nationalist, was elected as the new prime minister by the [[Majlis of Iran]] (parliament).<ref name=\"Ref-B-William1991\"/> In April 1951, the Iranian government [[Nationalization|nationalised]] the Iranian oil industry by unanimous vote, and the [[National Iranian Oil Company]] (NIOC) was formed, displacing the AIOC.<ref name=\"NYTRoots\"/><ref name=\"BPHistory\"/> The AIOC withdrew its management from Iran, and Britain organized an effective worldwide embargo of Iranian oil. The British government, which owned the AIOC, contested the nationalisation at the [[International Court of Justice]] at [[The Hague]], but its complaint was dismissed.<ref name=\"Sztucki\"/>\n\nPrime Minister Churchill asked President Eisenhower for help in overthrowing Mossadeq. The anti-Mossadeq plan was orchestrated under the code-name '[[Operation Ajax]]' by CIA, and 'Operation Boot' by [[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]] (MI6). The CIA and the British helped stage a coup in August 1953, the [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat]], which established pro-Western general [[Fazlollah Zahedi]] as the new PM, and greatly strengthened the political power of Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].

The government issued a Corrective Action Order to BP XA that addressed the pipeline's risks and ordered pipeline repair or replacement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had investigated the extent of the oil spills and oversaw BPXA's cleanup. When BP XA did not fully comply with the terms of the corrective action, a complaint was filed in March 2009 alleging violations of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Pipeline Safety Act.  In July 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska entered a consent decree between the United States and BPXA resolving the government's claims.  Under the consent decree, BPXA paid a $25 million civil penalty, the largest per-barrel penalty at that time for an oil spill, and agreed to take measures to significantly improve inspection and maintenance of its pipeline infrastructure on the North Slope to reduce the threat of additional oil spills.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/enrd/5812.htm|title=USDOJ: Environment and Natural Resources Division : U.S. v.

The oil discovery led to petrochemical industry development and also the establishment of industries that strongly depended on oil.

When the equipment malfunctioned and caught fire, BP workers shut it down and routed escaping gases to flares. Rather than shut down associated units while compressor repairs were made, BP chose to keep operating those other units, which led to unlawful release of contaminants for almost 40 days.

The government issued a Corrective Action Order to BP XA that addressed the pipeline's risks and ordered pipeline repair or replacement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had investigated the extent of the oil spills and oversaw BPXA's cleanup. When BP XA did not fully comply with the terms of the corrective action, a complaint was filed in March 2009 alleging violations of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Pipeline Safety Act.  In July 2011, the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska entered a consent decree between the United States and BPXA resolving the government's claims.  Under the consent decree, BPXA paid a $25 million civil penalty, the largest per-barrel penalty at that time for an oil spill, and agreed to take measures to significantly improve inspection and maintenance of its pipeline infrastructure on the North Slope to reduce the threat of additional oil spills.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/enrd/5812.htm|title=USDOJ: Environment and Natural Resources Division : U.S. v.
