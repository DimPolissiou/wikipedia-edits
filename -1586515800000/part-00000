The Scinde stamps became known as \"[[Scinde Dawk]]s\"; \"Dawk\" is the Anglicised spelling of the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''Dak'' or (\"post\").

The Post Office Act XIV introduced reforms by 1 May 1866 to correct some of the more obvious postal-system deficiencies and abuses. Postal-service efficiencies were also introduced. In 1863, lower rates were set for [[steamship|\"steamer\"]] mail to Europe at (six annas, eight pies for a {{1/2}}-ounce letter). Lower rates were also introduced for inland mail.\nNew regulations removed special postal privileges enjoyed by officials of the East India Company. Stamps for official use were prepared and carefully accounted for, to combat abuses by officials. In 1854 Spain had printed special stamps for official communications, but in 1866 India was the first country to adopt the expedient of [[overprint]]ing \"Service\" on postage stamps and \"Service Postage\" on revenue stamps. This innovation was later widely adopted by other countries.<ref name=\"Alan C. Campbell 1996\">Alan C.

Some \"Service Postage\" overprinted rarities resulted from abrupt changes in postal regulations. New designs for the four-anna and six-anna-eight-[[Indian pie|pie]] stamps were issued in 1866. Nevertheless, there was a shortage of stamps to meet the new rates. Provisional six-anna stamps were improvised by cutting the top and bottom from a current foreign-bill [[revenue stamp]] and overprinting \"Postage\".

Thereafter, the Indian Posts and Telegraph Department embarked on a broad-based policy for the issuance of stamps. On 21 November 1947 the first new stamp was issued by independent India. It depicts the [[Indian flag]] with the patriots' slogan, ''[[Jai Hind]]'' (\"long live India\"), at the top right-hand corner. The stamp was valued at three and one-half [[Indian anna|annas]]. A memorial to [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was issued 15 August 1948 on the first anniversary of independence. One year later a [[definitive series]] appeared, depicting India's broad cultural heritage (primarily [[Hindu]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Muslim]], [[Sikh]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] temples, sculptures, monuments and fortresses). A subsequent issue commemorated the beginning of the [[Republic of India]] on 26 January 1950. Definitives included a technology-and-development theme in 1955, a series depicting a map of India in 1957 (denominated in ''[[Paisa|naya paisa]]''\u2014decimal currency) and a 1965 series with a wide variety of images. The old inscription \"India Postage\" was replaced in 1962 with ''\"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 INDIA\"'', although three stamps (issued from December 1962 to January 1963) carried the earlier inscription.<ref>Saksena, V.

A primary feature of Army Postal Service systems is that normally they are subsidized to ensure that military mail posted between duty stations abroad and the home country (or vice versa) does not cost the sender any more than normal domestic mail traffic. In some cases, Indian military personnel in a combat zone may post letters and/or packages to the home country for free, while in others, senders located in a specific overseas area may send military mail to another military recipient, also located in the same overseas area, without charge.\n\n===Electronic Indian Postal Order===\nThe Electronic Indian Postal Order (e-IPO) was introduced on 22 March 2013, initially only for citizens living abroad.

The Scinde stamps became known as \"[[Scinde Dawk]]s\"; \"Dawk\" is the Anglicised spelling of the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''Dak'' or (\"post\"). These stamps, with a value of {{1/2}}-anna, were in use until June 1866.

The Post Office Act XIV introduced reforms by 1 May 1866 to correct some of the more obvious postal-system deficiencies and abuses. Postal-service efficiencies were also introduced. In 1863, lower rates were set for [[steamship|\"steamer\"]] mail to Europe at (six annas, eight pies for a {{1/2}}-ounce letter). Lower rates were also introduced for inland mail.\nNew regulations removed special postal privileges enjoyed by officials of the East India Company. Stamps for official use were prepared and carefully accounted for, to combat abuses by officials. In 1854 Spain had printed special stamps for official communications, but in 1866 India was the first country to adopt the expedient of [[overprint]]ing \"Service\" on postage stamps and \"Service Postage\" on revenue stamps. This innovation was later widely adopted by other countries.<ref name=\"Alan C. Campbell 1996\">Alan C.

Some \"Service Postage\" overprinted rarities resulted from abrupt changes in postal regulations. New designs for the four-anna and six-anna-eight-[[Indian pie|pie]] stamps were issued in 1866. Nevertheless, there was a shortage of stamps to meet the new rates. Provisional six-anna stamps were improvised by cutting the top and bottom from a current foreign-bill [[revenue stamp]] and overprinting \"Postage\".

Thereafter, the Indian Posts and Telegraph Department embarked on a broad-based policy for the issuance of stamps. On 21 November 1947 the first new stamp was issued by independent India. It depicts the [[Indian flag]] with the patriots' slogan, ''[[Jai Hind]]'' (\"long live India\"), at the top right-hand corner. The stamp was valued at three and one-half [[Indian anna|annas]]. A memorial to [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was issued 15 August 1948 on the first anniversary of independence. One year later a [[definitive series]] appeared, depicting India's broad cultural heritage (primarily [[Hindu]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Muslim]], [[Sikh]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] temples, sculptures, monuments and fortresses). A subsequent issue commemorated the beginning of the [[Republic of India]] on 26 January 1950. Definitives included a technology-and-development theme in 1955, a series depicting a map of India in 1957 (denominated in ''[[Paisa|naya paisa]]''\u2014decimal currency) and a 1965 series with a wide variety of images. The old inscription \"India Postage\" was replaced in 1962 with ''\"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 INDIA\"'', although three stamps (issued from December 1962 to January 1963) carried the earlier inscription.<ref>Saksena, V.

Most [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous plants]] are used, but people typically collect [[bedstraw]], [[cow wheat]], [[vetchling]] and [[clover]]. \n\nPlant material is used to decorate rooms, courtyards, yards, and woven into wreaths. Specific trees are also used as sources of material for decoration. Birch boughs and oak branches are commonly used, however aspen and alder are not as they are considered evil.<ref>B. Rieksti\u0146\u0161, \"Recreation\" 1932, 17. VI, 22.</ref> Some herbs were collected at noon, others on J\u0101\u0146i Eve, or on J\u0101\u0146i morning when covered in dew. In 1627, [[Paul Einhorn|P. Einhorn]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|J\u0101\u0146i Day is given the power and sanctity of the herbs and its daily gathering, and has great and excellent properties against fires, people's and livestock's evil plagues and diseases|Paul Einhorn. \"Idolatry and superstition refutation\"<ref>Paul Einhorn. \"Idolatry and superstition refutation\", 1627. Quoted from: [[P\u0113teris \u0160mits]]. Latvian folk beliefs. Riga, 1940\u20131941.</ref>}}\n\nDuring J\u0101\u0146i, foliage of [[rowan]], [[English oak|oak]], [[Tilia|linden]] and [[birch]] trees is collected and hung to decorate homes, [[barns]] and granaries, as well as tied to gates, doors and cars. Thorns, thistles and nettles are hung to repel evil spirits and witches. In past times, herbaceous plants were dried and fed to cows shortly after calving during winter and spring. On Z\u0101\u013cu Day, herbs were used to make a [[herbal tea|tea]] which was given to sick people and livestock. On J\u0101\u0146i Day, rowan twigs were tied together, dried and used for child's fumigation, to treat sickness, anxiety, or where a child was afflicted by an evil eye.\n\n====Wreath making====\n[[File:Ieva creating a crown from flowers, Midsummer festival, Latvia.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A girl weaving a flower wreath]]\n\nCircular wreaths made of flowers, grasses and oak leaves are woven and worn on the head. Different types of plants are used to make wreaths for males and females. Women and girls wear wreaths made from flowers, grasses and herbs. It is believed that wreaths braided with twenty seven flowers and herbs prevents disasters and diseases, and repels enemies. Men and boys wear wreaths made of oak leaves, symbolising the physical strength of the oak tree. Oak wreaths were also thought to promise the blessing of horses and bees. Together with J\u0101\u0146i cheese and fires, wreaths are also symbols of the sun.\n\n===Fire===\n\nDuring J\u0101\u0146i, fires (also known as p\u016bde\u013ca, punde\u013ca, J\u0101\u0146i candles, and witch burning) are lit and burned from sunset till next morning. This practice reflects the belief that light from the fires will transmit to the next solar year. It is believed that fires should be burned at a high point in the landscape, from which the light of the fire bestows power and fertility on the fields and people on which it shines. Leaping over the J\u0101\u0146i fire is said to bring good luck and health through the coming year.\n\nWhile fires are typically wood-fuelled, tar barrels or tarred wheels hoisted on poles are also burned.\n\n===Singing===\n\nSinging L\u012bgo songs or J\u0101\u0146i songs is associated with the promotion of fertility, acquisition of good fortune and prevention of calamity. Historically, the singing of L\u012bgo songs began two weeks before J\u0101\u0146i, reached its highest point on J\u0101\u0146i Eve and lasted until Peter or [[M\u0101ras|M\u0101ras Day]] (15 August)\u2014a period of around a month. After that, the singing of L\u012bgo songs ceased until the next year.<ref>D. Ozolins, Jaunroze. From: Peter Schmidt. Latvian folk beliefs. Riga, 1940\u20131941.</ref> Singing Ligo songs on J\u0101\u0146i night begins after dinner and continues throughout the night until the rising of the sun, either during jumping over Fire of J\u0101\u0146i, or while going from houses to houses. Singing visits on J\u0101\u0146i were called apl\u012bgo\u0161ana, servants visited their masters, maidens visited young men and vice versa.\n\nOn J\u0101\u0146i Day people drink [[beer]] and eat [[cheese]], believing that it will promote the growth of [[barley]] and production of cow milk in the next summer. Singing visitors from neighbouring houses are treated with cheese and beer.\n\n===Other traditions===\n\n====Witches====\n\nThere is a belief that on J\u0101\u0146i morning, milk witches were running on dew and shouted: \"Everything to me, everything to me!\" If anyone heard it, they must respond with: \"I butchered half of them!\" Then there would be no shortage of milk.<ref>A. Zalite, B\u0113rzpils. From: Peter Schmidt. Latvian folk beliefs. Riga, 1940\u20131941.</ref> Witches are believed to have disguised themselves as normal women by dressing in white robes and letting their hair loose. Once disguised, it is believed that they would set spells or curses on the fields and livestock of their enemies.\n\n====Fern flowers====\n\nIt was believed that whoever found a [[fern flower]] would gain wealth and happiness and learn the secrets of the past and future. \"Whoever acquires the fern flower will be happy, because it can make anything they want to come true. The flower is hindered by evil spirits and only a brave person can get it\".<ref>B. Rieksti\u0146\u0161, \"Recreation\", 1932, 17. VI, 22.</ref> \"On J\u0101\u0146i Night, jump eight times around eight while on a broom handle, which is hoisted from a ground. During this time do not talk and do not laugh. Once you have done so, then hop on the broom shaft astride to the nearest fern patch, but only on your own, then you will see the blossoming of a fern flower\".<ref>L. Aizupe, Irlava. From: Peter Schmidt. Latvian folk beliefs. Riga, 1940\u20131941.</ref>\n\n====Broad-mindedness====\nWomen and young maidens made wreaths on the heads and all sang together, danced, and went to play [[roundelay]]s. It is believed, that erotic activities can have positive impact on the creation of power.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Z\u0101\u013cu vakars R\u012bg\u0101 18. gadsimt\u0101.jpg|thumb|270px|Herbal Eve at the Daugavmalas in 18th century.]]\n[[File:Z\u0101\u013cu un vainagu tirgot\u0101ji Daugavmalas tirg\u016b 1920. gados.jpg|thumb|270px|Herbs and wreath traders at the Daugavmalas market in 1920.]]\n\n[[John the Baptist]] Day celebration during the summer solstice time was known throughout the Christian world. Since 1584, [[Balthasar Russow]] wrote in [[The Chronicle of Livonia|his Chronicle of Livonia]], that \"All over the great land by Fire of J\u0101\u0146i happened a great joyous dancing, singing and jumping\". \n\nIt is known, that at that time Riga's fishermen, mast selectors and ferries each year after solstice drove boats to [[P\u0101rdaugava]] or to some islands in the Daugava, where, together with families and guests burned ruddy, rejoicing until the morning dawn.\n\nWhen in 1759 [[Johann Steinhauer]], a rich Latvian mast selector, bought part of [[Zasumui\u017ea]], it began a Herbal Eve celebration tradition. Later, the celebration was moved to [[Hermeli\u0146a Manor]], then on the right bank of the Daugava by the castle. Around 1790, a tradition to hold festive fireworks on Daugava was introduced. In 1820, the [[Riga's Council]] ordered to transfer Daugavmalas Herbal Market to \u0160\u0101\u013cu Gate at the end of Sv\u0113rtuves Street. In 1832, a Latvian weekly newspaper \"[[Tas Latvie\u0161u \u013bau\u017eu Draugs]]\" gave the following description of the holiday:\n\n{{quote|These two days of J\u0101\u0146i for us, city dwellers, are annual real fun days. On first day's eve a large flower market opens at the edge of the Daugava. Then farmers, who were living in the vicinity, brought flowers, wreaths and various herbs, gardeners brought back their most nicest and most expensive goods, and the townsfolk came and bought \u2013 either wreaths for children's joy, or flowers for whichever loved one as a gift, or foals, or mint and other such herbs, that help against various diseases. Others come, wanting to see a large crowd, play gambling, and walk until it becomes dark.|\"[[Tas Latvie\u0161u \u013bau\u017eu Draugs]]\", 1832}}\n\nAfter the establishment of Latvian Republic, the celebration of Z\u0101\u013cu diena turned into a popular holiday. It was proposed, that 22, 23 and 24 June should be recognized as national holidays, on 22 June celebrating Heroes Day (remembering the victory in [[Battle of C\u0113sis (1919)|Battle of C\u0113sis]]), Z\u0101\u013cu diena on 23 June and J\u0101\u0146i Day on 24 June.<ref>{{cite web |title= First \"l\u012bgo\" cry sounds in Riga! |author= Anita Bormane |date= 22 June 2012 |publisher= [[Latvijas Av\u012bze]] | url= http://www.la.lv/pirmais-ligo-sauciens-atskan-riga%E2%80%A9-2/ |accessdate= June 26, 2015 |language= Latvian }}</ref>\n\n==Similar festive celebration traditions worldwide==\n{{Main|Midsummer}}\n[[File:Ligo post USSR.png|thumb|Postage stamp commemorating the Latvian L\u012bgo festival (USSR, 1991)]]\nCelebration of the summer solstice is an ancient European tradition. It was especially observed in [[Northern Europe|Northern European]] countries such as Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Russia, Ireland and in some parts of United Kingdom ([[Cornwall]]). \n\nIt was also observed by European settlers in Canada (especially in [[Quebec]]) and the US.

Riga, 1940\u20131941.</ref>}}\n\nDuring J\u0101\u0146i, foliage of [[rowan]], [[English oak|oak]], [[Tilia|linden]] and [[birch]] trees is collected and hung to decorate homes, [[barns]] and granaries, as well as tied to gates, doors and cars. Thorns, thistles and nettles are hung to repel evil spirits and witches. In past times, herbaceous plants were dried and fed to cows shortly after calving during winter and spring. On Z\u0101\u013cu Day, herbs were used to make a [[herbal tea|tea]] which was given to sick people and livestock. On J\u0101\u0146i Day, rowan twigs were tied together, dried and used for child's fumigation, to treat sickness, anxiety, or where a child was afflicted by an evil eye.\n\n====Wreath making====\n[[File:Ieva creating a crown from flowers, Midsummer festival, Latvia.jpg|220px|thumb|right|A girl weaving a flower wreath]]\n\nCircular wreaths made of flowers, grasses and oak leaves are woven and worn on the head. Different types of plants are used to make wreaths for males and females. Women and girls wear wreaths made from flowers, grasses and herbs. It is believed that wreaths braided with twenty seven flowers and herbs prevents disasters and diseases, and repels enemies. Men and boys wear wreaths made of oak leaves, symbolising the physical strength of the oak tree. Oak wreaths were also thought to promise the blessing of horses and bees. Together with J\u0101\u0146i cheese and fires, wreaths are also symbols of the sun.\n\n===Fire===\n\nDuring J\u0101\u0146i, fires (also known as p\u016bde\u013ca, punde\u013ca, J\u0101\u0146i candles, and witch burning) are lit and burned from sunset till next morning. This practice reflects the belief that light from the fires will transmit to the next solar year. It is believed that fires should be burned at a high point in the landscape, from which the light of the fire bestows power and fertility on the fields and people on which it shines. Leaping over the J\u0101\u0146i fire is said to bring good luck and health through the coming year.\n\nWhile fires are typically wood-fuelled, tar barrels or tarred wheels hoisted on poles are also burned.\n\n===Singing===\n\nSinging L\u012bgo songs or J\u0101\u0146i songs is associated with the promotion of fertility, acquisition of good fortune and prevention of calamity. Historically, the singing of L\u012bgo songs began two weeks before J\u0101\u0146i, reached its highest point on J\u0101\u0146i Eve and lasted until Peter or [[M\u0101ras|M\u0101ras Day]] (15 August)\u2014a period of around a month. After that, the singing of L\u012bgo songs ceased until the next year.<ref>D. Ozolins, Jaunroze. From: Peter Schmidt. Latvian folk beliefs. Riga, 1940\u20131941.</ref> Singing Ligo songs on J\u0101\u0146i night begins after dinner and continues throughout the night until the rising of the sun, either during jumping over Fire of J\u0101\u0146i, or while going from houses to houses. Singing visits on J\u0101\u0146i were called apl\u012bgo\u0161ana, servants visited their masters, maidens visited young men and vice versa.\n\nOn J\u0101\u0146i Day people drink [[beer]] and eat [[cheese]], believing that it will promote the growth of [[barley]] and production of cow milk in the next summer. Singing visitors from neighbouring houses are treated with cheese and beer.\n\n===Other traditions===\n\n====Witches====\n\nThere is a belief that on J\u0101\u0146i morning, milk witches were running on dew and shouted: \"Everything to me, everything to me!\" If anyone heard it, they must respond with: \"I butchered half of them!\" Then there would be no shortage of milk.<ref>A. Zalite, B\u0113rzpils. From: Peter Schmidt. Latvian folk beliefs. Riga, 1940\u20131941.</ref> Witches are believed to have disguised themselves as normal women by dressing in white robes and letting their hair loose. Once disguised, it is believed that they would set spells or curses on the fields and livestock of their enemies.\n\n====Fern flowers====\n\nIt was believed that whoever found a [[fern flower]] would gain wealth and happiness and learn the secrets of the past and future. \"Whoever acquires the fern flower will be happy, because it can make anything they want to come true. The flower is hindered by evil spirits and only a brave person can get it\".<ref>B. Rieksti\u0146\u0161, \"Recreation\", 1932, 17. VI, 22.</ref> \"On J\u0101\u0146i Night, jump eight times around eight while on a broom handle, which is hoisted from a ground. During this time do not talk and do not laugh. Once you have done so, then hop on the broom shaft astride to the nearest fern patch, but only on your own, then you will see the blossoming of a fern flower\".<ref>L. Aizupe, Irlava. From: Peter Schmidt. Latvian folk beliefs. Riga, 1940\u20131941.</ref>\n\n====Broad-mindedness====\nWomen and young maidens made wreaths on the heads and all sang together, danced, and went to play [[roundelay]]s. It is believed, that erotic activities can have positive impact on the creation of power.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Z\u0101\u013cu vakars R\u012bg\u0101 18. gadsimt\u0101.jpg|thumb|270px|Herbal Eve at the Daugavmalas in 18th century.]]\n[[File:Z\u0101\u013cu un vainagu tirgot\u0101ji Daugavmalas tirg\u016b 1920. gados.jpg|thumb|270px|Herbs and wreath traders at the Daugavmalas market in 1920.]]\n\n[[John the Baptist]] Day celebration during the summer solstice time was known throughout the Christian world. Since 1584, [[Balthasar Russow]] wrote in [[The Chronicle of Livonia|his Chronicle of Livonia]], that \"All over the great land by Fire of J\u0101\u0146i happened a great joyous dancing, singing and jumping\". It is known, that at that time Riga's fishermen, mast selectors and ferries each year after solstice drove boats to [[P\u0101rdaugava]] or to some islands in the Daugava, where, together with families and guests burned ruddy, rejoicing until the morning dawn.\n\nWhen in 1759 [[Johann Steinhauer]], a rich Latvian mast selector, bought part of [[Zasumui\u017ea]], it began a Herbal Eve celebration tradition. Later, the celebration was moved to [[Hermeli\u0146a Manor]], then on the right bank of the Daugava by the castle. Around 1790, a tradition to hold festive fireworks on Daugava was introduced. In 1820, the [[Riga's Council]] ordered to transfer Daugavmalas Herbal Market to \u0160\u0101\u013cu Gate at the end of Sv\u0113rtuves Street. In 1832, a Latvian weekly newspaper \"[[Tas Latvie\u0161u \u013bau\u017eu Draugs]]\" gave the following description of the holiday:\n\n{{quote|These two days of J\u0101\u0146i for us, city dwellers, are annual real fun days. On first day's eve a large flower market opens at the edge of the Daugava. Then farmers, who were living in the vicinity, brought flowers, wreaths and various herbs, gardeners brought back their most nicest and most expensive goods, and the townsfolk came and bought \u2013 either wreaths for children's joy, or flowers for whichever loved one as a gift, or foals, or mint and other such herbs, that help against various diseases. Others come, wanting to see a large crowd, play gambling, and walk until it becomes dark.|\"[[Tas Latvie\u0161u \u013bau\u017eu Draugs]]\", 1832}}\n\nAfter the establishment of Latvian Republic, the celebration of Z\u0101\u013cu diena turned into a popular holiday. It was proposed, that 22, 23 and 24 June should be recognized as national holidays, on 22 June celebrating Heroes Day (remembering the victory in [[Battle of C\u0113sis (1919)|Battle of C\u0113sis]]), Z\u0101\u013cu diena on 23 June and J\u0101\u0146i Day on 24 June.<ref>{{cite web |title= First \"l\u012bgo\" cry sounds in Riga! |author= Anita Bormane |date= 22 June 2012 |publisher= [[Latvijas Av\u012bze]] | url= http://www.la.lv/pirmais-ligo-sauciens-atskan-riga%E2%80%A9-2/ |accessdate= June 26, 2015 |language= Latvian }}</ref>\n\n==Similar festive celebration traditions worldwide==\n{{Main|Midsummer}}\n[[File:Ligo post USSR.png|thumb|Postage stamp commemorating the Latvian L\u012bgo festival (USSR, 1991)]]\nCelebration of the summer solstice is an ancient European tradition. It was especially observed in [[Northern Europe|Northern European]] countries such as Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Russia, Ireland and in some parts of United Kingdom ([[Cornwall]]). It was also observed by European settlers in Canada (especially in [[Quebec]]) and the US.

After qualifying as a teacher and working in London FE colleges, he moved into book publishing, first for literary publisher [[Marion Boyars]], moving on to Grafton Books (later subsumed into HarperCollins) as a paperback copywriter. In the mid-1980s he initiated the [[Paladin Poetry Series]]. Muckle was general editor of its flagship anthology ''[[The New British Poetry]]'' (Paladin, 1988), commissioning a number of other titles before he left. The poetry imprint was edited subsequently by writer [[Iain Sinclair]]. Muckle worked as a freelance copywriter for [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] before returning to teaching, for five years at Essex University, later in various other jobs. \n\n''The Cresta Run'', Muckle's first book, was reviewed enthusiastically by [[Norman Shrapnel]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'': \"An identifiable vernacular for this still measurable sector of the populace - working-class if not always working - is amply available and John Muckle's excellent stories prove it.

Born in London in 1955, he lived and worked in that capital until the early 1990s. An early influence was working alongside [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]] and [[Bob Cobbing]] at the Poetry Society printshop in London and the Writers Forum group of poets who met with regularity on the premises in Earls Court, such as Allen Fisher. In 1981 he was a co-founder of [[Chisenhale Dance Space]] and for much of that decade worked on diverse projects alongside musicians from the London Musicians Collective, choreographers and live artists. His music and sound collaborations include Slant (a trio with [[Philip Jeck]] and Sianed Jones). His radio program \"Music of Madagascar\" produced for BBC Radio 3 won a Sony Gold Specialist Award (now Radio Academy Awards) in 1995. Between 1994-2005 he and Sianed Jones were based in the most easterly English town of Lowestoft. He taught on the [[Performance Writing]] course from 1995 at [[Dartington College of Arts]] where he became a Research Fellow in interdisciplinary text (2000-2002). A large body of interdisciplinary performance writing was produced in collaboration with Kirsten Lavers under the author function Things Not Worth Keeping between 1999-2007. In 2005 he became a professor at Miami University in Ohio. He was Altman Fellow in The Humanities Center [[Miami University]] 2011-12, co-presenting the Networks and Power symposium and a conference on Network Archaeology from which an issue of the online journal [[Amodern]], co-edited with [[Nicole Starosielski]] and Braxton Soderman, was published.

Initially he helped [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]] and [[Bob Cobbing]] to produce in-house volumes of [[Poetry Review]] there under the editorship of [[Eric Mottram]] and became print shop manager in 1977. He is among a wave of poets in London following the lead of the [[British Poetry Revival]] whose poetry integrates spatial, sonic and semantic performative concerns. His early live performance work was in duet with [[Clive Fencott]] and then a trio with the addition of [[Lawrence Upton]] as JGJGJJGJG (as long as you can say it that's our name). They were on occasion joined by [[Bill Griffiths (poet)|Bill Griffiths]] and [[Jeremy Adler]]. He ran several little press imprints such as Bluff Books, Shabby Editions and the little worry interrupt as well as editing the short-lived magazine RAWZ. Through his work with Jacky Lansley and Fergus Early on their production I Giselle he became involved with X6 Dance Space and then [[Chisenhale Dance Space]] and subsequently made collaborations with influential New Dance choreographers such as Mary Prestidge, Kirstie Simson, Miranda Tufnell and Dennis Greenwood, Patricia Bardi, Michael Clark and Sue MacLennan between 1982-1986. In 1987 he and Sianed Jones traveled to Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania and Madagascar researching into social  forms of music and dance.\n\n==Recent life and works==\ncris cheek lived in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[Canning Town]] between 1981-1994.

Born in London in 1955, he lived and worked in that capital until the early 1990s. An early influence was working alongside [[Bill Griffiths]] and [[Bob Cobbing]] at the Poetry Society printshop in London and the Writers Forum group of poets who met with regularity on the premises in Earls Court, such as Allen Fisher. In 1981 he was a co-founder of [[Chisenhale Dance Space]] and for much of that decade worked on diverse projects alongside musicians from the London Musicians Collective, choreographers and live artists. His music and sound collaborations include Slant (a trio with [[Philip Jeck]] and Sianed Jones). His radio program \"Music of Madagascar\" produced for BBC Radio 3 won a Sony Gold Specialist Award (now Radio Academy Awards) in 1995. Between 1994-2005 he and Sianed Jones were based in the most easterly English town of Lowestoft. He taught on the [[Performance Writing]] course from 1995 at [[Dartington College of Arts]] where he became a Research Fellow in interdisciplinary text (2000-2002). A large body of interdisciplinary performance writing was produced in collaboration with Kirsten Lavers under the author function Things Not Worth Keeping between 1999-2007. In 2005 he became a professor at Miami University in Ohio. He was Altman Fellow in The Humanities Center [[Miami University]] 2011-12, co-presenting the Networks and Power symposium and a conference on Network Archaeology from which an issue of the online journal [[Amodern]], co-edited with [[Nicole Starosielski]] and Braxton Soderman, was published. He currently lives in Northside, Cincinnati with Dr. Erin Edwards.\n\n==Early life and work==\ncris cheek was born in Enfield, [[London]] and educated at [[Highgate School]], graduating in 1972. He worked at the printshop of the Consortium of London Presses in the basement of the Earls Court premises of the National Poetry Centre between 1975-77. Initially he helped [[Bill Griffiths]] and [[Bob Cobbing]] to produce in-house volumes of [[Poetry Review]] there under the editorship of [[Eric Mottram]] and became print shop manager in 1977. He is among a wave of poets in London following the lead of the [[British Poetry Revival]] whose poetry integrates spatial, sonic and semantic performative concerns. His early live performance work was in duet with [[Clive Fencott]] and then a trio with the addition of [[Lawrence Upton]] as JGJGJJGJG (as long as you can say it that's our name). They were on occasion joined by [[Bill Griffiths]] and [[Jeremy Adler]]. He ran several little press imprints such as Bluff Books, Shabby Editions and the little worry interrupt as well as editing the short-lived magazine RAWZ. Through his work with Jacky Lansley and Fergus Early on their production I Giselle he became involved with X6 Dance Space and then [[Chisenhale Dance Space]] and subsequently made collaborations with influential New Dance choreographers such as Mary Prestidge, Kirstie Simson, Miranda Tufnell and Dennis Greenwood, Patricia Bardi, Michael Clark and Sue MacLennan between 1982-1986. In 1987 he and Sianed Jones traveled to Egypt, Kenya, Tanzania and Madagascar researching into social  forms of music and dance.\n\n==Recent life and works==\ncris cheek lived in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[Canning Town]] between 1981-1994. Whilst working for dance and performance artists and improvising music groups, he began writing songs with Sianed Jones, performing and recording with [[Philip Jeck]] as Slant. Slant released 3 albums, Hive (These Records, 1989), Slant (Sound & Language, 1993) and The Canning Town Chronicle (Sound & Language, 1994). Jones and cheek moved to [[Lowestoft]] as global internet networks bloomed. He was very active in poetics e-list communities for the following twenty years. During this time, he taught [[Performance Writing]] at [[Dartington College of Arts]], working alongside [[Caroline Bergvall]] as well as many others. cheek also made contemporary vaudeville shows with folk musician [[Chris Foster (folk singer)|Chris Foster]] that toured to village halls and community centers around England.\n\nWhile working at Dartington cris began teaching with and subsequently working with Kirsten Lavers to produce a substantial web of projects under the author function Thinks Not Worth Keeping, shortened to TNWK.\n\n== Bibliography ==\ncheek's creative writing works include:\n*''a present.''
