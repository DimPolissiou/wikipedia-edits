Applications include [[sonar]] to locate submerged objects such as [[submarines]], underwater >\n\nAlthough the way in which sound interacts with its surroundings is often extremely complex, there are a few ideal sound wave behaviours that are fundamental to understanding acoustical design.  Complex sound wave behaviors include [[Absorption (acoustics)|absorption]], [[reverberation]], [[diffraction]], and [[refraction]]. Absorption is the loss of energy that occurs when a sound wave reflects off of a surface. Just as light waves reflect off of surfaces, sound waves also reflect off of surfaces, and every reflection results in a loss of energy.  Absorption refers both to the sound that transmits through and the energy that is dissipated by a material.<ref>Barron, 2002, ch. 7.1.</ref> Reverberation is the persistence of sound that is caused by repeated boundary reflections after the source of the sound stops. This principle is particularly important in enclosed spaces.  In addition to reflecting off of surfaces, sound waves also bend around surfaces in the path of the waves.  This bending is known as diffraction.  Refraction is another kind of sound wave bending.  This type of bending, however, is caused by changes in the medium through which the wave is passing and not the presence of obstacles in the path of a sound wave.  Temperature gradients, for example, cause bending in sound waves.<ref>Hemond, 1983, pp. 24\u201344.</ref> Acoustical engineers apply these fundamental concepts, along with complex mathematical analysis, to control sound for a variety of applications.\n\n\u2260 at conastant area of a atom of a lady od a men of a lady gaga which known as a \n<ref></ref>\n", "text_old": "'''Acoustical engineering''' (also known as '''acoustic engineering''') is the branch of [[engineering]] dealing with [[sound]] and [[oscillation|vibration]].

Complex sound wave behaviors include [[Absorption (acoustics)|absorption]], [[reverberation]], [[diffraction]], and [[refraction]]. Absorption is the loss of energy that occurs when a sound wave reflects off of a surface. Just as light waves reflect off of surfaces, sound waves also reflect off of surfaces, and every reflection results in a loss of energy.  Absorption refers both to the sound that transmits through and the energy that is dissipated by a material.<ref>Barron, 2002, ch. 7.1.</ref> Reverberation is the persistence of sound that is caused by repeated boundary reflections after the source of the sound stops. This principle is particularly important in enclosed spaces.  In addition to reflecting off of surfaces, sound waves also bend around surfaces in the path of the waves.  This bending is known as diffraction.  Refraction is another kind of sound wave bending.  This type of bending, however, is caused by changes in the medium through which the wave is passing and not the presence of obstacles in the path of a sound wave.  Temperature gradients, for example, cause bending in sound waves.<ref>Hemond, 1983, pp. 24\u201344.</ref> Acoustical engineers apply these fundamental concepts, along with complex mathematical analysis, to control sound for a variety of applications.\n\n== Associations ==\n\n*[https://tceaasa.org/ Acoustical Society of America Technical Committee on Engineering Acoustics]\n*[[Audio Engineering Society]]\n*[[Australian Acoustical Society]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acoustics.asn.au/joomla/|title=Australian Acoustical Society ABN 28 000 712 658 A.C.N. 000 712 658|author=|date=|website=www.acoustics.asn.au}}</ref>\n*[[Canadian Acoustical Association]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caa-aca.ca|title=Canadian Acoustics - Acoustique Canadienne|author=|date=|website=caa-aca.ca}}</ref>\n* [[Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences]]\n* [[Institute of Acoustics (United Kingdom)]]\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Audio Engineering]]\n*[[:Category:Acoustical engineers]]\n*[[:Category:Audio engineers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Barron, R.

Following his departure from the band in 1995, he fronted The Rub from 1998 to 2001, who played several low-key shows but split without releasing any material. \n\nAfter a long industry hiatus, he re-emerged on the music scene with the reformation of The Stone Roses in October 2011. After the band's apparent final show at Hampden Park in Glasgow, [[Scotland]], in June 2017 he has since returned to obscurity.\n\n==Early career==\nWren grew up in [[Denton, Greater Manchester|Denton]] with four siblings and attended [[Egerton Park Arts College]].\n\nHe taught himself drums in his youth as, due to his family situation, he was nearly always around musical instruments in a pub environment. He also plays the guitar, bass, and piano. [[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]], in his 1997 book ''The Stone Roses and the Resurrection of British Pop'', said that Wren could \"play guitar almost as well as he plays drums,\"<ref name=\"Robb\">{{cite book | authorlink = John Robb (musician) | first = John | last = Robb | title = The Stone Roses and the Resurrection of British Pop | isbn = 0-09-187887-X }}</ref><ref>The Story of the Drummer, narrated by Mark Radcliffe, BBC Radio One documentary.</ref> However, it was his drumming abilities that made him stand out. Whilst growing up, \"the local kids thought Reni was a freak because he was such an amazing drummer, a total natural. Reni didn't care. He was already jamming along to anything and anybody.\"<ref>Robb, P. 87</ref>\n\nAlready in two bands before he joined The Stone Roses, it was perhaps friend [[Simon Wright (musician)|Simon Wright]]'s successful audition for [[AC/DC]] in 1984 which prompted him towards more serious ambitions.\n\n==The Stone Roses==\nWren joined the Stone Roses in May 1984 after seeing an advertisement the band had placed in Manchester's A1 Music shop on New Wakefield Street (now the Soundcontrol music venue). He ripped it off the wall in order to make sure only he would get an audition which occurred in what was at the time Decibel Studios to the north of the city centre. This was a rehearsal studio and required the band to carry Wren's drum kit up three flights of stairs, before running through early songs \"Nowhere Fast\", \"All Stitched Up\" and \"Mission Impossible\". Andy Couzens, then the band's second guitarist, later recalled this first rehearsal with their new-found 20-year-old drummer: \"We never discussed it, we knew he was in! He was fucking amazing! What a drummer.\".\n\nThe band's first live show with Wren occurred at an anti-heroin gig in London, which was being hosted by [[Pete Townshend]]. This unexpected encounter concluded with [[The Who]] star asking the band whether he could use their drummer for his set - the band agreed, which led to Wren performing [[Pictures of Lily]] and other Who songs.<ref name=\"nme_townsend\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/photos/25-things-you-didn-t-know-about-the-stone-roses/124337/5/1|title=25 things you didn't know about the Stone Roses|work=NME |location=UK |date=9 July 2009|accessdate=13 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe band's first bassist, Pete Garner, noted in a 2012 interview for Simon Spence's biography ''The Stone Roses - War and Peace'': \"I stood on the side of the stage going 'Oh fuck, he\u2019s going to join the Who now. First gig and we\u2019ve lost him.' That was pretty surreal. I believe the previous gig Townshend had done was some massive stadium on The Who farewell tour... and then he\u2019d come back to do this charity gig.\"<ref name=\"Pete Garner interview\">[http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/War-and-Peace-Pete-Garner-pt1-transcript.pdf], Pete Garner \"War & Peace\" interview.</ref> Andy Couzens stated: \"At that time Reni was awe-inspiring. To play with him made us sound phenomenal; he was just this force. Just to watch him play was inspirational. That's what got Pete Townshend that night. He was inspired by what he'd seen.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite the band's fears, Wren turned down Townshend's offer to play on his solo albums in favour of continuing with the Stone Roses.\n\nHis first career with the band would go on to span over a decade, during which time he performed on the albums ''[[Garage Flower]]'' (the band's abandoned debut album from 1985), the much-celebrated [[The Stone Roses (album)|eponymous debut]] (1989), and ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'' (1994), as well as dozens of singles and unreleased songs.\n\n==Playing style==\nIn his early years with the band, whose songs at the time were inspired by punk and post-punk, Wren's drumming style was characterised by the energy from influences such as [[Keith Moon]] - Andy Couzens mentioned he was \"like ten Keith Moons in one.\" Due to his showmanship and natural flair, Manchester music scene regulars such as [[Martin Hannett]] noted many people were attending the band's early gigs just to see Wren play. Howard Jones, a director at [[Factory Records]], said of a performance on 15 November 1984: \"Reni was out of this world. The way he played, his facial expressions, his finishing, how he'd kill a cymbal once he'd hit it, he'd got total natural technique.\"<ref>Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Penguin Books, 2012, Page 49</ref>\n\nAs the band's music progressed, marked by the release of the second single [[Sally Cinnamon]] in 1987, his playing style made use of a three-piece kit and the additional complement of his backing vocals on the majority of new songs. His minimised kit consisted of \"a mixture of Ludwig, vintage, and a big expensive [[Sonor]] snare drum\",<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Page 138, Penguin Books, 2012</ref> which were all painted with Squire's [[Jackson Pollock]] inspired art style. Wren's use of a smaller kit did not limit his range, with a new focus on a jazz-tinged, but ultimately rock-based, playing style. His busy use of the high-hat, snare, and solitary tom-tom created a complex sound which helped to define the band's significant musical shift.\n\n[[Elephant Stone]], released in 1988 as the band's third single, was viewed as an ideal opportunity to highlight Wren's talent, as Brown later said: \"We wanted people to hear what he could do.\"<ref>Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Page 108, Penguin Books, 2012</ref> The drummer's focus on a propulsive tom-tom beat showcased his ability to create innovative drum rhythms, but was also in line with the burgeoning dance music scene of the day. [[Peter Hook]] of [[New Order (band)|New Order]] produced the song in [[Cheadle Hulme]], [[Stockport]] and has since said that Wren remains one of the best rock drummers he ever worked with: \"Reni's drumming lent such a character and identity to the songs. Ian and John had got it with the melodies and lyrics but they were lucky to get Reni because he took them from being a traditional, normal rock band into the stratosphere with other great groups.\"<ref>Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Page 109, Penguin Books, 2012</ref>\n\nBy the time of the Second Coming rehearsals, in the early 1990s, Wren adapted his style further. Guitarist John Squire, becoming increasingly inspired by [[Led Zeppelin]], led the band in a new musical direction, prompting Wren to adopt a blues-rock approach, adding in extra tom-toms for a style analogous to [[John Bonham]]. Ian Brown said of early studio time: \"When we started recording we had Reni playing the drums for 40 minutes and it was out of this world. I remember John Leckie turning around with a big beam on his face and saying, 'Can't this be the album?'\"<ref>Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Page 200, Penguin Books, 2012</ref> His playing on the songs [[Love Spreads]] and Daybreak were particularly praised for their high-quality and complexity, whilst his many long jamming sessions with Mani and Squire, plus several drum solos, also became available through bootlegs.\n\nFor the majority of his career, Wren has preferred the use of [[matched grip]], although around 1990, in live television performances of One Love and Fools Gold he used [[traditional grip]].{{fact|date=July 2019}} He can also be seen in rehearsal recordings following the band's reformation using the former and latter interchangeably.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nOf his drumming style, in 2004 Rhythm Magazine commented that Wren was \"funkier and more subtle than any drummer in the genre [indie] had ever been\" and he was, \"economical, soulful, and inventive\". Rhythm Magazine labelled him a drummer hero, stating: \"you know him best by his ability to always play it cooler than cool\".<ref name=\"Rhythm 2004, page 13\" />\n\n==Live performances==\nDuring the Stone Roses' live performances, Wren's energetic drumming ensured that his reputation grew rapidly and sparked regular praise from the music press, fans, and peers. [[The Charlatans (UK band)|The Charlatans]] supported the Stone Roses in the late 1980s and its drummer, Jon Brookes, had observed Wren's playing closely: \"He never pounded the drums, he used to caress them and get them to sing, he was that kind of drummer. It was great to just watch him, very poetic, beautiful motion, very light touch, at the same time very musical. And he was singing as well, these beautiful melodies, it was unbelievable.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe music press had also been documenting the drummer's appeal. A review of the band's famous 1989 [[Blackpool]] gig stated he was a \"spectacular, slipshod blur of energy\", whilst the NME noted of a [[Paris]]ian performance: \"Drummer Reni is magnificent. In [[Amsterdam]], I\u2019d watched him soundcheck for an hour on his own, slapping 17 shades of shining shite out of his kit for the sheer unbridled joy of playing.\"<ref>http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-stone-roses-in-1989-a-classic-nme-interview</ref>\n\nIn addition to his drumming, many fans also found his backing harmonies to be an integral part of the band's music. Described in John Robb's biography of the Stone Roses as \"the voice of an angel\",<ref name=\"Robb, John\"/> listening to their debut album, and live shows such as Blackpool's [[Empress Ballroom]] (1989), [[Glasgow Green]] (1990) and Manchester's [[Heaton Park]] (2012) overtly display his vocal range.\n\n==1995-2011: The Rub and industry hiatus==\n\nIn 1995, Wren was the first member of the classic Stone Roses line-up to leave the band, with much mystery surrounding his exit. In Simon Spence's The Stone Roses: War and Peace (2012), it was suggested arguments with Brown, and frustration with Squire's increasingly insular musical direction, angered the drummer. Wren began missing recording sessions to spend time with his family and often arrived in a dressing gown to the remaining sessions he did attend. A statement was published in NME on 5 April 1995, announcing his immediate departure. After his exit, the band continued with Robbie Maddix as drummer, but broke up in 1996.\n\nLittle was heard of Wren in the 16 years which followed. His drumming was long credited on the [[Ian Brown]] track \"Can't See Me\", although Brown later acknowledged the drum loop was a sample Roses bassist Mani had uncovered and not Wren.<ref>[[Can't See Me]]</ref>\n\nIn 1998, he formed the short-lived band [[The Rub]], its name inspired by a soliloquy from [[Hamlet]], with Casey Longdon (rhythm guitar), Neil Nisbet (bass) and Mick Grant (drums). Wren wrote the songs, sang lead vocals, and played bass and lead guitar. During the Rub's brief history, it enjoyed strong support from many Stone Roses fans and the press,{{fact|date=July 2019}} although ''The Guardian'' wrote that \"although it's good to have Wren back and clearly enjoying himself, it's a great pity that this world-class percussionist is not behind a drum stool.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/mar/20/artsfeatures4</ref> In 2001, the band split having released no material.\n\nIn 2005, Wren gave his first broadcast interview in 10 years to [[BBC GMR]], along with ex-Roses bassist [[Gary Mounfield|Mani]], on the Manchester Music Show whilst attending a concert by [[the Coral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/06/01/010606_reni_mani_feature.shtml |title=What the world is waiting for? \u2013 Reni and Mani interview for the BBC |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> It was reported in early 2007 that [[Fun Lovin Criminals]] had asked Reni to become their drummer.

In an exclusive book included with the collector's edition, whilst Ian Brown and Mani included extensive written accounts of their experiences in the Stone Roses, Wren supplied only a drawing and poem.\n\nPrior to the band's 2011 reunion, in 2009 those who worked with Wren had high praise for the drummer in interviews conducted for the 20th anniversary. Ian Brown said \"He\u2019d have been like [[Gene Krupa]] or [[Buddy Rich]].

These dates were part of a [[Reunion Tour (The Stone Roses)|Reunion Tour]].\n\n==2011 reunion to the present day==\nOn 23 May 2012, Wren played the drums in public for the first time in 17 years. This was at a secret gig in [[Warrington]], a warm-up show before the band's full world tour. For his second career with the band, his kit now consists of two bass drums (with an image of a lemon on each bass drum - a reference to the band's eponymous debut album), with a greater number of tom-toms and cymbals than during his original run with the band.\n\nThe Stone Roses completed 30 gigs across the world in 2012 and the band continued to tour in 2013. A documentary film (showcasing the band's reformation) directed by [[Shane Meadows]] premiered in Manchester's Victoria Warehouse on 30 May 2013.\n\nIn May and June 2016, following a brief hiatus, the Stone Roses released the new singles All For One and Beautiful Thing, marking Wren's first new contributions to music since 2001. The band also announced concerts at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] (Etihad Stadium), which was followed by a wider tour of the world. Media outlets such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' continued to praise the drummer. After the band's first performance at the Etihad Stadium, the broadsheet newspaper stated: \"The Stone Roses must not let Reni leave again\".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jun/17/stone-roses-what-we-learned-from-gigs</ref> On its music blog, the paper explained: \"On the face of it, the drummer is the most obviously replaceable component of a band but while fans are divided over the merits of a live Led Zeppelin without [[John Bonham]], or [[Black Sabbath]] minus [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]], the idea of a Reni-free Roses is untenable.\"\n\nIt added: \"The man Pete Townshend once hailed as 'the most natural drummer I\u2019ve seen since Keith Moon' has been the individual delight of the last week\u2019s gigs. With an extra bass drum, what look like new teeth and a grin that never leaves his face, Reni has regained his youthful pomp and is playing as well as ever. His backing singing and those trademark funky grooves are powering the band with a gusto that they haven\u2019t had in years.\"\n\nOnce again, the band briefly toured in early 2017 with the final show playing at Glasgow in June. During the gig, singer Brown made a comment which suggested the band will not be playing any further shows.{{fact|date=July 2019}} The band's biographer, John Robb, told the ''[[NME]]'': \"It\u2019s not official 100% confirmed that they\u2019ve stopped, but it looks like they have, doesn\u2019t it?\" Of Wren, he added: \"To me, the greatest tragedy is that if they have stopped, Reni will only have recorded a few albums in his life. I wanted a full documentation of his drumming. Those records are far more than anyone else is going to do, but I think it\u2019s kind of sad that he\u2019s not made a full record since \u2018The Second Coming\u2019 and may never do again. I'm sure he doesn't care, he's got all the money in the bank. I just don't like seeing good talent go to waste, because he's still one of the greatest drummers I\u2019ve ever seen.\"<ref>http://www.nme.com/news/music/stone-roses-biographer-john-robb-speaks-future-band-2139753</ref>\n\n==\"Reni Hats\"==\nWren habitually wore a [[bucket hat]] during his time with the Stone Roses. The nickname \"Reni hat\" for these hats is still in use, especially due to the band's 2011 reformation, particularly in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/oct/22/minutebyminute.sport|title=Spartak Moscow 1 \u2013 3 Liverpool|author=Scott Murray|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=22 October 2002|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/17/cycling.tourdefrance4|title=Stage 9 \u2013 as it happened|author=Barry Glendenning|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=17 July 2007|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thestoneroses.org/ The Stone Roses' official website]\n\n{{The Stone Roses}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reni}}\n[[Category:1964 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Alternative rock drummers]]\n[[Category:British alternative rock musicians]]\n[[Category:Madchester musicians]]\n[[Category:English rock drummers]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Manchester]]\n[[Category:The Stone Roses members]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=August 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Reni\n| image               = \n| caption             = Reni performing live in 2016\n| background          = solo_singer\n| birth_name          = Alan John Wren\n| alias               = Reni\n| birth_date          = {{Birth date and age|1964|4|10|df=yes}}\n|birth_place          = [[Manchester]], [[England]]\n| death_date          = \n| instrument          = [[Drum kit|Drums]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], [[Singing|vocals]]\n| genre               = [[Alternative rock]], [[Madchester]]\n| occupation          = Musician, songwriter\n| years_active        = 1984\u2013present\n| label               = [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone]], [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]\n| associated_acts     = [[The Stone Roses]], [[The Rub]]\n| website             = \n}}\n'''Alan John''' \"'''Reni'''\" '''Wren''' (born 10 April 1964 in [[Manchester]]<ref name=\"Larkin\">Larkin, Colin (ed.) (1998) ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Indie & New Wave'', Virgin Books, {{ISBN|0-7535-0231-3}}</ref>) is an English [[Rock and roll|rock]] drummer and member of [[The Stone Roses]].\n\nHis laid-back style of complex, off-beat rhythms was influential in bringing about the blend of indie and dance music which formed much of the [[Madchester]] sound centred on [[Manchester]].<ref name=\"Robb, John\">Robb, John.

Following his departure from the band in 1995, he fronted The Rub from 1998 to 2001, who played several low-key shows but split without releasing any material. \n\nAfter a long industry hiatus, he re-emerged on the music scene with the reformation of The Stone Roses in October 2011. After the band's apparent final show at Hampden Park in Glasgow, [[Scotland]], in June 2017 he has since returned to obscurity.\n\n==Early career==\nWren grew up in [[Denton, Greater Manchester|Denton]] with four siblings and attended [[Egerton Park Arts College]].\n\nHe taught himself drums in his youth as, due to his family situation, he was nearly always around musical instruments in a pub environment. He also plays the guitar, bass, and piano. [[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]], in his 1997 book ''The Stone Roses and the Resurrection of British Pop'', said that Wren could \"play guitar almost as well as he plays drums,\"<ref name=\"Robb\">{{cite book | authorlink = John Robb (musician) | first = John | last = Robb | title = The Stone Roses and the Resurrection of British Pop | isbn = 0-09-187887-X }}</ref><ref>The Story of the Drummer, narrated by Mark Radcliffe, BBC Radio One documentary.</ref> However, it was his drumming abilities that made him stand out. Whilst growing up, \"the local kids thought Reni was a freak because he was such an amazing drummer, a total natural. Reni didn't care. He was already jamming along to anything and anybody.\"<ref>Robb, P. 87</ref>\n\nAlready in two bands before he joined The Stone Roses, it was perhaps friend [[Simon Wright (musician)|Simon Wright]]'s successful audition for [[AC/DC]] in 1984 which prompted him towards more serious ambitions.\n\n==The Stone Roses==\nWren joined the Stone Roses in May 1984 after seeing an advertisement the band had placed in Manchester's A1 Music shop on New Wakefield Street (now the Soundcontrol music venue). He ripped it off the wall in order to make sure only he would get an audition which occurred in what was at the time Decibel Studios to the north of the city centre. This was a rehearsal studio and required the band to carry Wren's drum kit up three flights of stairs, before running through early songs \"Nowhere Fast\", \"All Stitched Up\" and \"Mission Impossible\". Andy Couzens, then the band's second guitarist, later recalled this first rehearsal with their new-found 20-year-old drummer: \"We never discussed it, we knew he was in! He was fucking amazing! What a drummer.\".\n\nThe band's first live show with Wren occurred at an anti-heroin gig in London, which was being hosted by [[Pete Townshend]]. This unexpected encounter concluded with [[The Who]] star asking the band whether he could use their drummer for his set - the band agreed, which led to Wren performing [[Pictures of Lily]] and other Who songs.<ref name=\"nme_townsend\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/photos/25-things-you-didn-t-know-about-the-stone-roses/124337/5/1|title=25 things you didn't know about the Stone Roses|work=NME |location=UK |date=9 July 2009|accessdate=13 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe band's first bassist, Pete Garner, noted in a 2012 interview for Simon Spence's biography ''The Stone Roses - War and Peace'': \"I stood on the side of the stage going 'Oh fuck, he\u2019s going to join the Who now. First gig and we\u2019ve lost him.' That was pretty surreal. I believe the previous gig Townshend had done was some massive stadium on The Who farewell tour... and then he\u2019d come back to do this charity gig.\"<ref name=\"Pete Garner interview\">[http://www.thestoneroses.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/War-and-Peace-Pete-Garner-pt1-transcript.pdf], Pete Garner \"War & Peace\" interview.</ref> Andy Couzens stated: \"At that time Reni was awe-inspiring. To play with him made us sound phenomenal; he was just this force. Just to watch him play was inspirational. That's what got Pete Townshend that night. He was inspired by what he'd seen.\" <ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite the band's fears, Wren turned down Townshend's offer to play on his solo albums in favour of continuing with the Stone Roses.\n\nHis first career with the band would go on to span over a decade, during which time he performed on the albums ''[[Garage Flower]]'' (the band's abandoned debut album from 1985), the much-celebrated [[The Stone Roses (album)|eponymous debut]] (1989), and ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'' (1994), as well as dozens of singles and unreleased songs.\n\n==Playing style==\nIn his early years with the band, whose songs at the time were inspired by punk and post-punk, Wren's drumming style was characterised by the energy from influences such as [[Keith Moon]] - Andy Couzens mentioned he was \"like ten Keith Moons in one.\" Due to his showmanship and natural flair, Manchester music scene regulars such as [[Martin Hannett]] noted many people were attending the band's early gigs just to see Wren play. Howard Jones, a director at [[Factory Records]], said of a performance on 15 November 1984: \"Reni was out of this world. The way he played, his facial expressions, his finishing, how he'd kill a cymbal once he'd hit it, he'd got total natural technique.\"<ref>Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Penguin Books, 2012, Page 49</ref>\n\nAs the band's music progressed, marked by the release of the second single [[Sally Cinnamon]] in 1987, his playing style made use of a three-piece kit and the additional complement of his backing vocals on the majority of new songs. His minimalised kit consisted of \"a mixture of Ludwig, vintage, and a big expensive [[Sonor]] snare drum\",<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Page 138, Penguin Books, 2012</ref> which were all painted with Squire's [[Jackson Pollock]] inspired art style. Wren's use of a smaller kit did not limit his range, with a new focus on a jazz-tinged, but ultimately rock-based, playing style. His busy use of the high-hat, snare, and solitary tom-tom created a complex sound which helped to define the band's significant musical shift.\n\n[[Elephant Stone]], released in 1988 as the band's third single, was viewed as an ideal opportunity to highlight Wren's talent, as Brown later said: \"We wanted people to hear what he could do.\"<ref>Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Page 108, Penguin Books, 2012</ref> The drummer's focus on a propulsive tom-tom beat showcased his ability to create innovative drum rhythms, but was also in line with the burgeoning dance music scene of the day. [[Peter Hook]] of [[New Order (band)|New Order]] produced the song in [[Cheadle Hulme]], [[Stockport]] and has since said that Wren remains one of the best rock drummers he ever worked with: \"Reni's drumming lent such a character and identity to the songs. Ian and John had got it with the melodies and lyrics but they were lucky to get Reni because he took them from being a traditional, normal rock band into the stratosphere with other great groups.\"<ref>Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Page 109, Penguin Books, 2012</ref>\n\nBy the time of the Second Coming rehearsals, in the early 1990s, Wren adapted his style further. Guitarist John Squire, becoming increasingly inspired by [[Led Zeppelin]], led the band in a new musical direction, prompting Wren to adopt a blues-rock approach, adding in extra tom-toms for a style analogous to [[John Bonham]]. Ian Brown said of early studio time: \"When we started recording we had Reni playing the drums for 40 minutes and it was out of this world. I remember John Leckie turning around with a big beam on his face and saying, 'Can't this be the album?'\"<ref>Spence, Simon - The Stone Roses: War and Peace, Page 200, Penguin Books, 2012</ref> His playing on the songs [[Love Spreads]] and Daybreak were particularly praised for their high-quality and complexity, whilst his many long jamming sessions with Mani and Squire, plus several drum solos, also became available through bootlegs.\n\nFor the majority of his career, Wren has preferred the use of [[matched grip]], although around 1990, in live television performances of One Love and Fools Gold he used [[traditional grip]].{{fact|date=July 2019}} He can also be seen in rehearsal recordings following the band's reformation using the former and latter interchangeably.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\nOf his drumming style, in 2004 Rhythm Magazine commented that Wren was \"funkier and more subtle than any drummer in the genre [indie] had ever been\" and he was, \"economical, soulful, and inventive\". Rhythm Magazine labelled him a drummer hero, stating: \"you know him best by his ability to always play it cooler than cool\".<ref name=\"Rhythm 2004, page 13\" />\n\n==Live performances==\nDuring the Stone Roses' live performances, Wren's energetic drumming ensured that his reputation grew rapidly and sparked regular praise from the music press, fans, and peers. [[The Charlatans (UK band)|The Charlatans]] supported the Stone Roses in the late 1980s and its drummer, Jon Brookes, had observed Wren's playing closely: \"He never pounded the drums, he used to caress them and get them to sing, he was that kind of drummer. It was great to just watch him, very poetic, beautiful motion, very light touch, at the same time very musical. And he was singing as well, these beautiful melodies, it was unbelievable.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe music press had also been documenting the drummer's appeal. A review of the band's famous 1989 [[Blackpool]] gig stated he was a \"spectacular, slipshod blur of energy\", whilst the NME noted of a [[Paris]]ian performance: \"Drummer Reni is magnificent. In [[Amsterdam]], I\u2019d watched him soundcheck for an hour on his own, slapping 17 shades of shining shite out of his kit for the sheer unbridled joy of playing.\"<ref>http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/the-stone-roses-in-1989-a-classic-nme-interview</ref>\n\nIn addition to his drumming, many fans also found his backing harmonies to be an integral part of the band's music. Described in John Robb's biography of the Stone Roses as \"the voice of an angel\",<ref name=\"Robb, John\"/> listening to their debut album, and live shows such as Blackpool's [[Empress Ballroom]] (1989), [[Glasgow Green]] (1990) and Manchester's [[Heaton Park]] (2012) overtly display his vocal range.\n\n==1995-2011: The Rub and industry hiatus==\n\nIn 1995, Wren was the first member of the classic Stone Roses line-up to leave the band, with much mystery surrounding his exit. In Simon Spence's The Stone Roses: War and Peace (2012), it was suggested arguments with Brown, and frustration with Squire's increasingly insular musical direction, angered the drummer. Wren began missing recording sessions to spend time with his family and often arrived in a dressing gown to the remaining sessions he did attend. A statement was published in NME on 5 April 1995, announcing his immediate departure. After his exit, the band continued with Robbie Maddix as drummer, but broke up in 1996.\n\nLittle was heard of Wren in the 16 years which followed. His drumming was long credited on the [[Ian Brown]] track \"Can't See Me\", although Brown later acknowledged the drum loop was a sample Roses bassist Mani had uncovered and not Wren.<ref>[[Can't See Me]]</ref>\n\nIn 1998, he formed the short-lived band [[The Rub]], its name inspired by a soliloquy from [[Hamlet]], with Casey Longdon (rhythm guitar), Neil Nisbet (bass) and Mick Grant (drums). Wren wrote the songs, sang lead vocals, and played bass and lead guitar. During the Rub's brief history, it enjoyed strong support from many Stone Roses fans and the press,{{fact|date=July 2019}} although ''The Guardian'' wrote that \"although it's good to have Wren back and clearly enjoying himself, it's a great pity that this world-class percussionist is not behind a drum stool.\"<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/mar/20/artsfeatures4</ref> In 2001, the band split having released no material.\n\nIn 2005, Wren gave his first broadcast interview in 10 years to [[BBC GMR]], along with ex-Roses bassist [[Gary Mounfield|Mani]], on the Manchester Music Show whilst attending a concert by [[the Coral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/06/01/010606_reni_mani_feature.shtml |title=What the world is waiting for? \u2013 Reni and Mani interview for the BBC |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}</ref> It was reported in early 2007 that [[Fun Lovin Criminals]] had asked Reni to become their drummer.

These dates were part of a [[Reunion Tour (The Stone Roses)|Reunion Tour]].\n\n==2011 reunion to the present day==\nOn 23 May 2012, Wren played the drums in public for the first time in 17 years. This was at a secret gig in [[Warrington]], a warm-up show before the band's full world tour. For his second career with the band, his kit now consists of two bass drums (with an image of a lemon on each bass drum - a reference to the band's eponymous debut album), with a greater number of tom-toms and cymbals than during his original run with the band.\n\nThe Stone Roses completed 30 gigs across the world in 2012 and the band continued to tour in 2013. A documentary film (showcasing the band's reformation) directed by [[Shane Meadows]] premiered in Manchester's Victoria Warehouse on 30 May 2013.\n\nIn May and June 2016, following a brief hiatus, the Stone Roses released the new singles All For One and Beautiful Thing, marking Wren's first new contributions to music since 2001. The band also announced concerts at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] (Etihad Stadium), which was followed by a wider tour of the world. Media outlets such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' continued to praise the drummer. After the band's first performance at the Etihad Stadium, the broadsheet newspaper stated: \"The Stone Roses must not let Reni leave again\".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jun/17/stone-roses-what-we-learned-from-gigs</ref> On its music blog, the paper explained: \"On the face of it, the drummer is the most obviously replaceable component of a band but while fans are divided over the merits of a live Led Zeppelin without [[John Bonham]], or [[Black Sabbath]] minus [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]], the idea of a Reni-free Roses is untenable.\"\n\nIt added: \"The man Pete Townshend once hailed as 'the most natural drummer I\u2019ve seen since Keith Moon' has been the individual delight of the last week\u2019s gigs. With an extra bass drum, what look like new teeth and a grin that never leaves his face, Reni has regained his youthful pomp and is playing as well as ever. His backing singing and those trademark funky grooves are powering the band with a gusto that they haven\u2019t had in years.\"\n\nOnce again, the band briefly toured in early 2017 with the final show playing at Glasgow in June. During the gig, singer Brown made a comment which suggested the band will not be playing any further shows.{{fact|date=July 2019}} The band's biographer, John Robb, told the ''[[NME]]'': \"It\u2019s not official 100% confirmed that they\u2019ve stopped, but it looks like they have, doesn\u2019t it?\" Of Wren, he added: \"To me, the greatest tragedy is that if they have stopped, Reni will only have recorded a few albums in his life. I wanted a full documentation of his drumming. Those records are far more than anyone else is going to do, but I think it\u2019s kind of sad that he\u2019s not made a full record since \u2018The Second Coming\u2019 and may never do again. I'm sure he doesn't care, he's got all the money in the bank. I just don't like seeing good talent go to waste, because he's still one of the greatest drummers I\u2019ve ever seen.\"<ref>http://www.nme.com/news/music/stone-roses-biographer-john-robb-speaks-future-band-2139753</ref>\n\n==\"Reni Hats\"==\nWren habitually wore a [[bucket hat]] during his time with the Stone Roses. The nickname \"Reni hat\" for these hats is still in use, especially due to the band's 2011 reformation, particularly in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/oct/22/minutebyminute.sport|title=Spartak Moscow 1 \u2013 3 Liverpool|author=Scott Murray|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=22 October 2002|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/17/cycling.tourdefrance4|title=Stage 9 \u2013 as it happened|author=Barry Glendenning|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=17 July 2007|accessdate=29 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thestoneroses.org/ The Stone Roses' official website]\n\n{{The Stone Roses}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reni}}\n[[Category:1964 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Alternative rock drummers]]\n[[Category:British alternative rock musicians]]\n[[Category:Madchester musicians]]\n[[Category:English rock drummers]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Manchester]]\n[[Category:The Stone Roses members]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reni_(musician)"}

It also held that as a [[political question]], it was up to Congress to determine if an amendment with no time limit for ratification was still viable after an extended lapse of time based on \"the political, social and economic conditions which have prevailed during the period since the submission of the amendment\".\n\nWhen Watson began his campaign in early 1982, he was aware of ratification by only six states and he erroneously believed that Virginia's 1791 approval was the last action taken by the states.

Although the term historically related only to carriage by sea, a bill of lading may today be used for any type of carriage of goods.<ref>[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(2)b</ref>\n[https://chirpybrains.com/bill-of-lading/ A comprehensive article on Bill of Lading]\nBills of lading are one of three crucial documents used in [[international trade]] to ensure that [[export]]ers receive payment and [[import]]ers receive the merchandise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/c4isl6rev1_en.pdf|title=UNCTAD|last=|first=|date=|website=unctad|publisher=unctad|access-date=}}</ref> The other two documents are a [[insurance policy|policy of insurance]] and an [[invoice]].<ref>In a [[Cost, Insurance and Freight|CIF]] contract, the buyer is essentially buying three documents, all of which grant rights over the cargo</ref> Whereas a bill of lading is negotiable, both a policy and an invoice are [[assignment (law)|assignable]]. In international trade outside the United States, bills of lading are distinct from [[waybill]]s in that the latter are not transferable and do not confer title. Nevertheless, the UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] grants \"all rights of suit under the contract of carriage\" to the lawful holder of a bill of lading, or to the consignee under a sea waybill or a ship's delivery order.\n\nA bill of lading must be transferable,<ref>[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(2)</ref><ref>If a so-called \"bill of lading\" is NOT transferable, it will be merely a sea-waybill or a ship's delivery order</ref> and serves three main functions:\n*  it is a conclusive receipt,<ref>[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.4</ref> i.e. an acknowledgement that the goods have been loaded;<ref>... or received for shipment</ref> and\n* it contains or evidences<ref>\"Evidences\": the contract may already have been made informally by say, booking cargo space on board.</ref> the terms of the contract of carriage; and\n* it serves as a document of title to the goods,<ref name=\"Levi 2005\">{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 4th Edition | author = Levi, Maurice D. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-41-530900-4}}</ref> subject to the ''[[nemo dat quod non habet|nemo dat]]'' rule.\n\nTypical export transaction use [[Incoterms]] terms such as [[Cost, Insurance and Freight|CIF]], [[FOB (shipping)|FOB]] or [[Free Alongside Ship|FAS]], requiring the exporter/shipper to deliver the goods to the ship, whether onboard or alongside. Nevertheless, the loading itself will usually be done by the carrier himself or by a third party [[stevedore]].\n\n==Description==\nA bill of lading is a standard-form document that is transferable by endorsement (or by lawful transfer of possession).<ref name=\"B.L. Mathur and Raman K. Dave\">{{cite book|last=Bohra|first=Harsh|title=International Trade and Finance|publisher=Wide Vision}}</ref> Most shipments by sea are covered by the [[Hague Rules]], the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] or the [[Hamburg Rules]], which require the carrier to issue the shipper a bill of lading identifying the nature, quantity, quality and leading marks<ref>that is, the identification marks and numbers.</ref> of the goods.\n\nIn the case of ''Coventry v Gladstone'', Lord Justice Blackburn defined a bill of lading as \"A writing signed on behalf of the owner of ship in which goods are embarked, acknowledging the receipt of the Goods, and undertaking to deliver them at the end of the voyage, subject to such conditions as may be mentioned in the bill of lading.\" Therefore, it can be stated that the bill of lading was introduced to provide a receipt to the shipper in the absence of the owners.\n\nAlthough the term \"bill of lading\" is well known and well understood, it may become obsolete.  Articles 1:15 & 1:16 of the [[Rotterdam Rules]] create the new term \"transport document\"; but (assuming the Rules come into force) it remains to be seen whether shippers, carriers and \"maritime performing parties\" (another new Rotterdam Rules coinage) will abandon the long-established and familiar term, \"bill of lading\".\n\n==History==\nWhile there is evidence of the existence of receipts for goods loaded aboard merchant vessels stretching back as far as Roman times,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/3629/Du%20Toit%208%20December%202005.pdf?sequence=1|pages=2\u20133|title=THE EVOLUTION OF THE BILL OF LADING SF du Toit (University of Johannesburg)}}</ref> and the practice of recording cargo aboard ship in the ship's log is almost as long-lived as shipping itself, the modern bill of lading only came into use with the growth of international trade in the medieval world.\n\nThe growth of mercantilism (which produced other financial innovations such as the [[charterparty]] (once ''carta partita''), the [[bill of exchange]] and the [[insurance policy]]<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://maritimeknowhow.com/wp-content/uploads/image/Bills%20of%20lading/B-L%20split/B-L%208-10%20Hist%20Intro.pdf \n |title=BILL OF LADING \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530164039/http://maritimeknowhow.com/wp-content/uploads/image/Bills%20of%20lading/B-L%20split/B-L%208-10%20Hist%20Intro.pdf \n |archivedate=2014-05-30 \n}}</ref>) produced a requirement for a title document that could be traded in much the same way as the goods themselves. It was this new avenue of trade that produced the bill of lading in much the same form as we know today.\n\n==Roles and purposes of bill of lading==\n\n===As cargo receipt===\nThe principal use of the bill of lading is as a receipt issued by the carrier once the goods have been loaded onto the vessel. This receipt can be used as proof of shipment for customs and insurance purposes, and also as commercial proof of completing a contractual obligation,<ref>Qais Ali Mahafzah, ''The Legal Effectiveness of the Both-to-Blame Collision Clause under Bills of Lading and Charterparties'', 41 Journal of Maritime Law & Commerce 263 (2010).</ref> especially under [[Incoterms|INCOTERMS]] such as CFR<ref>CFR - formerly known as C&F</ref> (cost and freight) and [[FOB (shipping)|FOB (free on board)]].\n\nAlthough the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] provide that a bill of lading is only ''prima facie'' evidence of receipt, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 s.4 declares a BoL \"conclusive evidence of receipt\".<ref>s.4 thereby overrules the decision in ''Grant v Norway'' 1851 10 CB 665</ref><ref>Law Commission report into \"Rights of Suit in respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea\", LAW COM No 196 1991</ref>\n<ref name=\"Pearson\">{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Ray August; with revisions by Don|last2=Bixby|first2=Michael|title=International business law : text, cases, and readings|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Harlow [etc.]|isbn=0273768611|edition=6th ed., international}}</ref>\n\n* A \"clean bill of lading\" (aka \"on-board bill of lading\") is used when there is full compliance with no discrepancies between the description filed by shipper and the actual goods shipped. A clean bill of lading indicates that the goods have been properly loaded on board the carrier's ship in accordance with the contract.\n* A \"dirty bill of lading\" (aka \"claused bill of lading\") will be issued if the goods to be shipped differ in quality or quantity from the contract description, or if freight has yet to be paid. The buyer's bank is entitled to reject a dirty bill of lading, but will often accept it after an agreed reduction in price.<ref name=\"Buckley 2004\" />\n* \"STC\": if the cargo cannot be effectively examined, such as goods in a sealed [[Intermodal container|container]]), the carrier will issue a bill of lading describing the goods as \"container (identified by number) '''said to contain'''\"  the contracted cargo. If the cargo within the container does not comply with description, the consignee will take action against the seller, and the carrier will not be involved.\n\n===As evidence of the contract of carriage===\nThe bill of lading from carrier to  the shipper can be used as an evidence of the contract of carriage by the fact that carrier has received the goods and upon the receipt the carrier would deliver the goods. In this case, the bill of lading would be used as a contract of carriage. In this case, the bill of lading can be used if shipper does not properly ship the goods then the shipper cannot receive the bill of lading from the carrier. Eventually, the shipper would have to deliver the bill of lading to the seller. In this case, the bill of lading is used as a contract of carriage between seller and carrier. However, when the bill of lading is negotiated to a [[bona fide]] third party then the bill of lading becomes a conclusive evidence where no contradictory evidence can be introduced. It is because the third party cannot examine the actual shipment and can only pay attention to the document itself, not survey or examination of the shipment itself.<ref name=\"Pearson\"/> However, the bill of lading will rarely be the contract itself, since the cargo space will have been booked previously, perhaps by telephone, email or letter. The preliminary contract will be acknowledged by both the shipper and carrier to incorporate the carrier's standard terms of business. If the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] apply, then all of the Rules will be automatically annexed to the bill of lading, thus forming a statutory contract.\n\n===As title===\nWhen the Ocean bill of lading is used as a document of documentary title that gives the holder a legal right of possession but not necessarily ownership\" it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, bill of lading in this case performs as document to physical collect and hold the goods. Only payment of the commercial invoice transfers the \"full legal title of ownership to the goods from the Seller to the Buyer\"<ref name=\"NZ Maritime Import Export International Trade Documentation Notes\">{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Allyson |title=Ms |date=Feb 2009 |publisher=Manukau Institute of Technology School of Logistics |location=Auckland New Zealand |page=45 |edition=2}}</ref>  \nThere are two types of bill of lading that can perform as document of title. They are straight bill of lading and \"To order bill of lading. Straight bill of lading is a bill of lading issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, the bill of lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the bill of lading. \"To Order\" bill of lading is the opposite from a straight bill of lading and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, a 'To Order bill of lading can be transferred to a third party. This is important where the shipment, is sold in-transit to a third party, as the original Ocean Bill of Lading must be surrendered to the shipping company or shipping agent, in exchange for the goods. \n\nSimply, the bill of lading confers ''prima facie'' title over the goods to the named consignee or lawful holder. Under the \"''nemo dat quod non habet\"'' rule (\"no one gives what he doesn't have\"), a seller cannot pass better title than he himself has; so if the goods are subject to an encumbrance (such as a mortgage, charge or hypothec), or even stolen, the bill of lading will not grant full title to the holder.<ref name=\"NZ Maritime International Trade Documentation\">{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Allyson |title=Ms |date=Feb 2009 |publisher=Manukau Institute of Technology School of Logistics |pages=45 |edition=2}}</ref>\n\n==Types of bills of lading==\nBills of lading may take various forms, such as on-board and received-for-shipment.<ref>The [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(2) provides that a bill of lading may be a \"received for shipment bill of lading\"</ref>\n* An on-board bill of lading denotes that merchandise has been physically loaded onto a shipping vessel, such as a freighter or cargo plane.\n* A received-for-shipment bill of lading denotes that merchandise has been received, but is not guaranteed to have already been loaded onto a shipping vessel.(Typically, it will be issued by a freight-forwarder at a port or depot). Such bills can be converted upon being loaded.<ref>... but there is no legal advantage to this exercise.</ref>\n[[File:Charter-party Bill of lading.png|alt= Charter-party bill of lading|thumb|Charter-party bill of lading, for a sulfuric acid bulk cargo]]\n* A straight bill of lading is used when payment has been made in advance of shipment and requires a carrier to deliver the merchandise to the appropriate party.\n* An order bill of lading is used when shipping merchandise prior to payment, requiring a carrier to deliver the merchandise to the importer, and at the endorsement of the exporter the carrier may transfer title to the importer. Endorsed order bills of lading can be traded as a [[security (finance)|security]] or serve as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] against [[debt]] obligations.<ref name=\"Buckley 2004\">{{Cite book | title = Multinational Finance | author = Buckley, Adrian | year = 2004 | publisher = Pearson Education Limited | location = Harlow, UK | isbn = 978-0-27-368209-7}}</ref>\n\n==Bills of lading and charterparties compared==\nA charterparty is the contract governing the relationship between the shipowner and the charterer. The bill of lading governs the relationship between the shipper and the carrier (who will be either a shipowner or a demise charterer). If the exporter (the shipper) is shipping a small amount of cargo, he will arrange for a carrier to carry the goods for him, using a bill of lading. If the exporter needs the whole (or a very substantial part) of the ship's cargo capacity, the exporter may need to charter the vessel, and he will enter into a charterparty agreement with the shipowner.\n\nIf the charter party is a time or voyage charterparty, the shipowner will still have control of the ship and its crew. If there is a demise (or \"bareboat\") charterparty, the charterer will effectively have a long lease and will have full control of the vessel. When the master (captain) issues a B/L to a shipper, he will be acting as an agent for the carrier, who will be either the shipowner (time or voyage) or the charterer (demise).\n\nIn a time-charterparty or voyage-charterparty, if the charterer is shipping his own cargo (rather than the cargo of a third party) he will receive a bill of lading from the master, acting as agent of the shipowner; but that B/L will serve solely as a receipt and document of title, and its terms will (subject to contrary intent) be secondary to the terms of the charterparty, which remains the dominant contract.<ref>see: ''Sandeman v Scurr'' (1866) L.R. 2 Q.B. 86,  ''Manchester Trust v Furness'' [1895] 2 QB 282 & [1895] 2 QB 539, & ''The Draupner'' [1910] AC 450</ref>\n\n==Sea waybills and electronic data interchange (EDI)==\nUnder Art. III of the Hague-Visby Rules, a carrier must, on demand, provide the shipper with a bill of lading; but if the shipper agrees, a lesser document such as a  \"[[waybill|sea waybill]]\" may be issued instead. In recent years, the use of bills of lading has declined, and they have tended to be replaced with the sea waybill. (If a so-called bill of lading is declared to be \"non-negotiable\", then it is not a true B/L,<ref>s.1 Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992</ref> and instead will be treated as a sea waybill.) Sea waybills can also be referred to as House Bills of Lading or in the Freight Forwarding sector, an Express release bill. \n\nThe main difference between these two documents is that the waybill gives the bearer the right to '''possession''' of the cargo, but does not confer '''legal title in the goods'''. The Consignee or Buyer of the shipment must be named on the Sea Waybill, as a sea waybill cannot be made \"To Order\". The named party in the waybill can take delivery of goods merely by confirming that they are the party named in the document, or they are the party's agent can confirm they are authorised to collect the goods. Hence, a Sea waybill is generally not used for Letter of Credit (L/C) or documentary collections, commonly called Drafts.<ref name=\"NZ Maritime International Trade Documentation\">{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Allyson |title=Ms |date=Feb 2009 |publisher=Manukau Institute of Technology School of Logistics |page=57 |edition=2}}</ref>\nAs a result, there is no need for the physical document to be presented for the goods to be released. The carrier will automatically release the goods to the consignee once the import formalities have been completed. This results in a much smoother flow of trade, and has allowed shipping lines to move towards [[electronic data interchange]] which may greatly ease the flow of global trade.\n\nFor some time, it has been the case that the cargo may arrive at the destination before the bill of lading; and a practice has arisen for the shipper (having sent the bill of lading to the banks for checking) to send to the consignee a '''letter of indemnity''' (LOI) which can be presented to the carrier in exchange for the cargo. The LOI indemnifies the carrier against any cargo claim, but the document is not transferable and has no established legal status. For [[letter of credit]] and [[documentary collection]] transactions, it is important to retain title to the goods until the transaction is complete. This means that the bill of lading still remains a vital document within international trade.\n\nAlternatively, to overcome the possibility of the goods reaching the destination ahead of the cargo, majority of the Shipping Lines offer an \u201cExpress release\u201d service (formerly known as \u201cTelex release\u201d).\nBy surrendering the full set of bills of lading issues at the port of loading, the shipping line can instruct the port of discharge to release the cargo without the physical presentation of bills of lading at destination.\n\n===Electronic bills of lading===\nFor many years, the industry has sought a solution to the difficulties, costs and inefficiencies associated with paper bills of lading. One answer is to make the bill an electronic document.<ref>Section 1(5) of the UK's [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] empowers the minister to make such provisions.</ref>  An electronic bill of lading (or '''eB/L''') is the legal and functional equivalent of a paper bill of lading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukpandi.com/knowledge/article/paperless-trading-electronic-bills-of-lading-frequently-asked-questions-faqs-6167/ |title=PAPERLESS TRADING (ELECTRONIC BILLS OF LADING) \u2010Frequently asked questions (\"FAQs\") - UK P&I |publisher=Ukpandi.com |date=2013-07-30 |accessdate=2014-07-31}}</ref> An electronic bill of lading must replicate the core functions of a paper bill of lading, namely its functions as a receipt, as evidence of or containing the contract of carriage and as a document of title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essdocs.com/resources/electronic-bill-of-lading |title=Electronic Bills of Lading (eB/Ls) |publisher=Essdocs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}</ref>\n\nThe UK [[Carriage of Goods Act 1992]] s.1(5) enables the trade minister to make [[statutory instrument|regulations]] for electronic transactions. As yet, no such regulations have been made, as electronic interchange is already lawful. Electronic \"clubs\" such as BOLERO<ref>[http://www.bolero.net/home/electronic-bills-lading/ BOLERO]</ref> have been quite successful, but the maritime trade community is traditional and loath to move away from paper transactions, so progress has been very slow.

Although the term historically related only to carriage by sea, a bill of lading may today be used for any type of carriage of goods.<ref>[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(2)b</ref>\n[https://chirpybrains.com/bill-of-lading/ A comprehensive article on Bill of Lading]\nBills of lading are one of three crucial documents used in [[international trade]] to ensure that [[export]]ers receive payment and [[import]]ers receive the merchandise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/c4isl6rev1_en.pdf|title=UNCTAD|last=|first=|date=|website=unctad|publisher=unctad|access-date=}}</ref> The other two documents are a [[insurance policy|policy of insurance]] and an [[invoice]].<ref>In a [[Cost, Insurance and Freight|CIF]] contract, the buyer is essentially buying three documents, all of which grant rights over the cargo</ref> Whereas a bill of lading is negotiable, both a policy and an invoice are [[assignment (law)|assignable]]. In international trade outside the United States, bills of lading are distinct from [[waybill]]s in that the latter are not transferable and do not confer title. Nevertheless, the UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] grants \"all rights of suit under the contract of carriage\" to the lawful holder of a bill of lading, or to the consignee under a sea waybill or a ship's delivery order.\n\nA bill of lading must be transferable,<ref>[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(2)</ref><ref>If a so-called \"bill of lading\" is NOT transferable, it will be merely a sea-waybill or a ship's delivery order</ref> and serves three main functions:\n*  it is a conclusive receipt,<ref>[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.4</ref> i.e. an acknowledgement that the goods have been loaded;<ref>... or received for shipment</ref> and\n* it contains or evidences<ref>\"Evidences\": the contract may already have been made informally by say, booking cargo space on board.</ref> the terms of the contract of carriage; and\n* it serves as a document of title to the goods,<ref name=\"Levi 2005\">{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 4th Edition | author = Levi, Maurice D. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-41-530900-4}}</ref> subject to the ''[[nemo dat quod non habet|nemo dat]]'' rule.\n\nTypical export transaction use [[Incoterms]] terms such as [[Cost, Insurance and Freight|CIF]], [[FOB (shipping)|FOB]] or [[Free Alongside Ship|FAS]], requiring the exporter/shipper to deliver the goods to the ship, whether onboard or alongside. Nevertheless, the loading itself will usually be done by the carrier himself or by a third party [[stevedore]].\n\n==Description==\nA bill of lading is a standard-form document that is transferable by endorsement (or by lawful transfer of possession).<ref name=\"B.L. Mathur and Raman K. Dave\">{{cite book|last=Bohra|first=Harsh|title=International Trade and Finance|publisher=Wide Vision}}</ref> Most shipments by sea are covered by the [[Hague Rules]], the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] or the [[Hamburg Rules]], which require the carrier to issue the shipper a bill of lading identifying the nature, quantity, quality and leading marks<ref>that is, the identification marks and numbers.</ref> of the goods.\n\nIn the case of ''Coventry v Gladstone'', Lord Justice Blackburn defined a bill of lading as \"A writing signed on behalf of the owner of ship in which goods are embarked, acknowledging the receipt of the Goods, and undertaking to deliver them at the end of the voyage, subject to such conditions as may be mentioned in the bill of lading.\" Therefore, it can be stated that the bill of lading was introduced to provide a receipt to the shipper in the absence of the owners.\n\nAlthough the term \"bill of lading\" is well known and well understood, it may become obsolete.  Articles 1:15 & 1:16 of the [[Rotterdam Rules]] create the new term \"transport document\"; but (assuming the Rules come into force) it remains to be seen whether shippers, carriers and \"maritime performing parties\" (another new Rotterdam Rules coinage) will abandon the long-established and familiar term, \"bill of lading\".\n\n==History==\nWhile there is evidence of the existence of receipts for goods loaded aboard merchant vessels stretching back as far as Roman times,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/3629/Du%20Toit%208%20December%202005.pdf?sequence=1|pages=2\u20133|title=THE EVOLUTION OF THE BILL OF LADING SF du Toit (University of Johannesburg)}}</ref> and the practice of recording cargo aboard ship in the ship's log is almost as long-lived as shipping itself, the modern bill of lading only came into use with the growth of international trade in the medieval world.\n\nThe growth of mercantilism (which produced other financial innovations such as the [[charterparty]] (once ''carta partita''), the [[bill of exchange]] and the [[insurance policy]]<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://maritimeknowhow.com/wp-content/uploads/image/Bills%20of%20lading/B-L%20split/B-L%208-10%20Hist%20Intro.pdf \n |title=BILL OF LADING \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530164039/http://maritimeknowhow.com/wp-content/uploads/image/Bills%20of%20lading/B-L%20split/B-L%208-10%20Hist%20Intro.pdf \n |archivedate=2014-05-30 \n}}</ref>) produced a requirement for a title document that could be traded in much the same way as the goods themselves. It was this new avenue of trade that produced the bill of lading in much the same form as we know today.\n\n==Roles and purposes of bill of lading==\n\n===As cargo receipt===\nThe principal use of the bill of lading is as a receipt issued by the carrier once the goods have been loaded onto the vessel. This receipt can be used as proof of shipment for customs and insurance purposes, and also as commercial proof of completing a contractual obligation,<ref>Qais Ali Mahafzah, ''The Legal Effectiveness of the Both-to-Blame Collision Clause under Bills of Lading and Charterparties'', 41 Journal of Maritime Law & Commerce 263 (2010).</ref> especially under [[Incoterms|INCOTERMS]] such as CFR<ref>CFR - formerly known as C&F</ref> (cost and freight) and [[FOB (shipping)|FOB (free on board)]].\n\nAlthough the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] provide that a bill of lading is only ''prima facie'' evidence of receipt, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 s.4 declares a BoL \"conclusive evidence of receipt\".<ref>s.4 thereby overrules the decision in ''Grant v Norway'' 1851 10 CB 665</ref><ref>Law Commission report into \"Rights of Suit in respect of Carriage of Goods by Sea\", LAW COM No 196 1991</ref>\n<ref name=\"Pearson\">{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Ray August; with revisions by Don|last2=Bixby|first2=Michael|title=International business law : text, cases, and readings|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=Harlow [etc.]|isbn=0273768611|edition=6th ed., international}}</ref>\n\n* A \"clean bill of lading\" (aka \"on-board bill of lading\") is used when there is full compliance with no discrepancies between the description filed by shipper and the actual goods shipped. A clean bill of lading indicates that the goods have been properly loaded on board the carrier's ship in accordance with the contract.\n* A \"dirty bill of lading\" (aka \"claused bill of lading\") will be issued if the goods to be shipped differ in quality or quantity from the contract description, or if freight has yet to be paid. The buyer's bank is entitled to reject a dirty bill of lading, but will often accept it after an agreed reduction in price.<ref name=\"Buckley 2004\" />\n* \"STC\": if the cargo cannot be effectively examined, such as goods in a sealed [[Intermodal container|container]]), the carrier will issue a bill of lading describing the goods as \"container (identified by number) '''said to contain'''\"  the contracted cargo. If the cargo within the container does not comply with description, the consignee will take action against the seller, and the carrier will not be involved.\n\n===As evidence of the contract of carriage===\nThe bill of lading from carrier to  the shipper can be used as an evidence of the contract of carriage by the fact that carrier has received the goods and upon the receipt the carrier would deliver the goods. In this case, the bill of lading would be used as a contract of carriage. In this case, the bill of lading can be used if shipper does not properly ship the goods then the shipper cannot receive the bill of lading from the carrier. Eventually, the shipper would have to deliver the bill of lading to the seller. In this case, the bill of lading is used as a contract of carriage between seller and carrier. However, when the bill of lading is negotiated to a [[bona fide]] third party then the bill of lading becomes a conclusive evidence where no contradictory evidence can be introduced. It is because the third party cannot examine the actual shipment and can only pay attention to the document itself, not survey or examination of the shipment itself.<ref name=\"Pearson\"/> However, the bill of lading will rarely be the contract itself, since the cargo space will have been booked previously, perhaps by telephone, email or letter. The preliminary contract will be acknowledged by both the shipper and carrier to incorporate the carrier's standard terms of business. If the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] apply, then all of the Rules will be automatically annexed to the bill of lading, thus forming a statutory contract.\n\n===As title===\nWhen the bill of lading is used as a document of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, bill of lading in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types of bill of lading that can perform as document of title. They are straight bill of lading and order bill of lading. Straight bill of lading is a bill of lading issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, the bill of lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the bill of lading. Order bill of lading is the opposite from a straight bill of lading and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, an order bill of lading can be negotiated to a third party.\n\nSimply, the bill of lading confers ''prima facie'' title over the goods to the named consignee or lawful holder. Under the \"''nemo dat quod non habet\"'' rule (\"no one gives what he doesn't have\"), a seller cannot pass better title than he himself has; so if the goods are subject to an encumbrance (such as a mortgage, charge or hypothec), or even stolen, the bill of lading will not grant full title to the holder.\n\n==Types of bills of lading==\nBills of lading may take various forms, such as on-board and received-for-shipment.<ref>The [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] s.1(2) provides that a bill of lading may be a \"received for shipment bill of lading\"</ref>\n* An on-board bill of lading denotes that merchandise has been physically loaded onto a shipping vessel, such as a freighter or cargo plane.\n* A received-for-shipment bill of lading denotes that merchandise has been received, but is not guaranteed to have already been loaded onto a shipping vessel.(Typically, it will be issued by a freight-forwarder at a port or depot). Such bills can be converted upon being loaded.<ref>... but there is no legal advantage to this exercise.</ref>\n[[File:Charter-party Bill of lading.png|alt= Charter-party bill of lading|thumb|Charter-party bill of lading, for a sulfuric acid bulk cargo]]\n* A straight bill of lading is used when payment has been made in advance of shipment and requires a carrier to deliver the merchandise to the appropriate party.\n* An order bill of lading is used when shipping merchandise prior to payment, requiring a carrier to deliver the merchandise to the importer, and at the endorsement of the exporter the carrier may transfer title to the importer. Endorsed order bills of lading can be traded as a [[security (finance)|security]] or serve as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] against [[debt]] obligations.<ref name=\"Buckley 2004\">{{Cite book | title = Multinational Finance | author = Buckley, Adrian | year = 2004 | publisher = Pearson Education Limited | location = Harlow, UK | isbn = 978-0-27-368209-7}}</ref>\n\n==Bills of lading and charterparties compared==\nA charterparty is the contract governing the relationship between the shipowner and the charterer. The bill of lading governs the relationship between the shipper and the carrier (who will be either a shipowner or a demise charterer). If the exporter (the shipper) is shipping a small amount of cargo, he will arrange for a carrier to carry the goods for him, using a bill of lading. If the exporter needs the whole (or a very substantial part) of the ship's cargo capacity, the exporter may need to charter the vessel, and he will enter into a charterparty agreement with the shipowner.\n\nIf the charter party is a time or voyage charterparty, the shipowner will still have control of the ship and its crew. If there is a demise (or \"bareboat\") charterparty, the charterer will effectively have a long lease and will have full control of the vessel. When the master (captain) issues a B/L to a shipper, he will be acting as an agent for the carrier, who will be either the shipowner (time or voyage) or the charterer (demise).\n\nIn a time-charterparty or voyage-charterparty, if the charterer is shipping his own cargo (rather than the cargo of a third party) he will receive a bill of lading from the master, acting as agent of the shipowner; but that B/L will serve solely as a receipt and document of title, and its terms will (subject to contrary intent) be secondary to the terms of the charterparty, which remains the dominant contract.<ref>see: ''Sandeman v Scurr'' (1866) L.R. 2 Q.B. 86,  ''Manchester Trust v Furness'' [1895] 2 QB 282 & [1895] 2 QB 539, & ''The Draupner'' [1910] AC 450</ref>\n\n==Sea waybills and electronic data interchange (EDI)==\nUnder Art. III of the Hague-Visby Rules, a carrier must, on demand, provide the shipper with a bill of lading; but if the shipper agrees, a lesser document such as a  \"[[waybill|sea waybill]]\" may be issued instead. In recent years, the use of bills of lading has declined, and they have tended to be replaced with the sea waybill. (If a so-called bill of lading is declared to be \"non-negotiable\", then it is not a true B/L,<ref>s.1 Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992</ref> and instead will be treated as a sea waybill.)\n\nThe main difference between these two documents is that the waybill gives the bearer the right to '''possession''' of the cargo, but does not confer '''title in the goods'''. As a result, there is no need for the physical document to be presented for the goods to be released. The carrier will automatically release the goods to the consignee once the import formalities have been completed. This results in a much smoother flow of trade, and has allowed shipping lines to move towards [[electronic data interchange]] which may greatly ease the flow of global trade.\n\nFor some time, it has been the case that the cargo may arrive at the destination before the bill of lading; and a practice has arisen for the shipper (having sent the bill of lading to the banks for checking) to send to the consignee a '''letter of indemnity''' (LOI) which can be presented to the carrier in exchange for the cargo. The LOI indemnifies the carrier against any cargo claim, but the document is not transferable and has no established legal status. For [[letter of credit]] and [[documentary collection]] transactions, it is important to retain title to the goods until the transaction is complete. This means that the bill of lading still remains a vital document within international trade.\n\nAlternatively, to overcome the possibility of the goods reaching the destination ahead of the cargo, majority of the Shipping Lines offer an \u201cExpress release\u201d service (formerly known as \u201cTelex release\u201d).\nBy surrendering the full set of bills of lading issues at the port of loading, the shipping line can instruct the port of discharge to release the cargo without the physical presentation of bills of lading at destination.\n\n===Electronic bills of lading===\nFor many years, the industry has sought a solution to the difficulties, costs and inefficiencies associated with paper bills of lading. One answer is to make the bill an electronic document.<ref>Section 1(5) of the UK's [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]] empowers the minister to make such provisions.</ref>  An electronic bill of lading (or '''eB/L''') is the legal and functional equivalent of a paper bill of lading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukpandi.com/knowledge/article/paperless-trading-electronic-bills-of-lading-frequently-asked-questions-faqs-6167/ |title=PAPERLESS TRADING (ELECTRONIC BILLS OF LADING) \u2010Frequently asked questions (\"FAQs\") - UK P&I |publisher=Ukpandi.com |date=2013-07-30 |accessdate=2014-07-31}}</ref> An electronic bill of lading must replicate the core functions of a paper bill of lading, namely its functions as a receipt, as evidence of or containing the contract of carriage and as a document of title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essdocs.com/resources/electronic-bill-of-lading |title=Electronic Bills of Lading (eB/Ls) |publisher=Essdocs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}</ref>\n\nThe UK [[Carriage of Goods Act 1992]] s.1(5) enables the trade minister to make [[statutory instrument|regulations]] for electronic transactions. As yet, no such regulations have been made, as electronic interchange is already lawful. Electronic \"clubs\" such as BOLERO<ref>[http://www.bolero.net/home/electronic-bills-lading/ BOLERO]</ref> have been quite successful, but the maritime trade community is traditional and loath to move away from paper transactions, so progress has been very slow. However, in recent times, it has been proposed that '''[[Blockchain]]''' technology may be the answer to cover the myriad steps in an export trade transaction, thereby enabling electronic transactions and information transfer that is both speedy and reliable.\n\n==Name==\nThe word \"lading\" means \"loading\", both words being derived from the Old English word ''hladan''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=lade&allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> \"Lading\" specifically refers to the loading of cargo aboard a ship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/lading |title=Definition of lading in English |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=2015-09-12}}</ref> The Dutch word \"lading\" has exactly the same meaning (freight, cargo, an amount of transportable goods) as it has in the English \"bill of lading\", but is not restricted to shipping.\n\nUnder English law, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 provides that the term \"bill of lading\" includes a \"received-for-shipment\" bill of lading issued by, say, a [[freight forwarder]] or a storage depot/warehouse.
