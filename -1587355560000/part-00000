He is often considered one of the most important rulers in Wallachian history and a national hero of Romania.\n\nHe was the second son of [[Vlad Dracul]], who became the ruler of [[Wallachia]] in 1436. Vlad and his younger brother, [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]], were held as hostages in the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1442 to secure their father's loyalty. Vlad's father and eldest brother, [[Mircea II of Wallachia|Mircea]], were murdered after [[John Hunyadi]], regent-governor of Hungary, invaded Wallachia in 1447. Hunyadi installed Vlad's second cousin, [[Vladislav II of Wallachia|Vladislav{{nbsp}}II]], as the new voivode. Hunyadi launched a military campaign against the Ottomans in the autumn of 1448, and Vladislav accompanied him. Vlad broke into Wallachia with Ottoman support in October, but Vladislav returned and Vlad sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year. Vlad went to [[Moldavia]] in 1449 or 1450, and later to Hungary.\n\nRelations between Hungary and Vladislav later deteriorated, and in 1456 Vlad invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support. Vladislav died fighting against him. Vlad began a purge among the [[Wallachian boyars]] to strengthen his position. He came into conflict with the [[Transylvanian Saxons]], who supported his opponents, [[Dan III of Wallachia|Dan]] and [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n|Basarab Laiot\u0103]] (who were Vladislav's brothers), and Vlad's [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] half-brother, [[Vlad the Monk]]. Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia where he had them [[Impalement|impaled]] (which inspired his [[cognomen]]). Peace was restored in 1460.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Sultan]], [[Mehmed II]], ordered Vlad to pay homage to him personally, but Vlad had the Sultan's two envoys captured and impaled. In February 1462, he attacked Ottoman territory, massacring tens of thousands of Turks and Bulgarians. Mehmed launched a campaign against Wallachia to replace Vlad with Vlad's younger brother, Radu. Vlad [[The Night Attack of T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte|attempted to capture the sultan]] at [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]] during the night of 16{{ndash}}17{{nbsp}}June 1462. The sultan and the main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad went to Transylvania to seek assistance from [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]], in late 1462, but Corvinus had him imprisoned.\n\nVlad was held in captivity in [[Visegr\u00e1d]] from 1463 to 1475. During this period, anecdotes about his cruelty started to spread in Germany and Italy. He was released at the request of [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] in the summer of 1475. He fought in Corvinus's army against the Ottomans in [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] in early 1476. Hungarian and Moldavian troops helped him to force Basarab Laiot\u0103 (who had dethroned Vlad's brother, Radu) to flee from Wallachia in November. Basarab returned with Ottoman support before the end of the year. Vlad was killed in battle before 10{{nbsp}}January 1477. Books describing Vlad's cruel acts were among the first bestsellers in the German-speaking territories. In Russia, popular stories suggested that Vlad was able to strengthen central government only through applying brutal punishments, and a similar view was adopted by most Romanian historians in the 19th century. Vlad's reputation for cruelty and his [[patronymic]] inspired the name of the [[vampire]] [[Count Dracula]], for whom, however, he did not serve as the general inspiration, in [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]''.\n\n== Name ==\n\n{{further|House of Dr\u0103cule\u0219ti}}\n\n[[File:Vlad Dracul.jpg|thumb|right|Vlad's father, [[Vlad Dracul]]]]\n\nThe expression ''Dracula'', which is now primarily known as the name of a fictional [[vampire]], was for centuries known as the [[sobriquet]] of Vlad{{nbsp}}III.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=228}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=16}} Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as ''Dracula'', ''Dracuglia'', or ''Drakula'' already in the 15th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=228}} He himself signed his two letters as \"Dragulya\" or \"Drakulya\" in the late 1470s.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=229}} His name had its origin in the sobriquet of his father, [[Vlad Dracul]] (\"Vlad the Dragon\" in [[Romanian language#Early history|medieval Romanian]]), who received it after he became a member of the [[Order of the Dragon]].{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=231}} Dracula is the [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of Dracul, meaning \"[the son] of Dracul (or the Dragon)\".{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=231}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} In modern Romanian, ''dracul'' means \"the devil\", which contributed to Vlad's reputation.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}}\n\nVlad III is known as ''Vlad \u021aepe\u0219'' (or Vlad the Impaler) in Romanian historiography.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} This sobriquet is connected to the [[impalement]] that was his favorite method of execution.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} The Ottoman writer [[Tursun Beg]] referred to him as ''{{lang|ota-Latn|Kaz\u0131kl\u0131 [[Voivode|Voyvoda]]}}'' (Impaler Lord) around 1500.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} [[Mircea the Shepherd]], Voivode of Wallachia, used this sobriquet when referring to Vlad III in a letter of grant on 1{{nbsp}}April 1551.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=189}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\nVlad was the second legitimate son of [[Vlad II Dracul]], who was an illegitimate son of [[Mircea I of Wallachia]].

He is often considered one of the most important rulers in Wallachian history and a national hero of Romania.\n\nHe was the second son of [[Vlad Dracul]], who became the ruler of [[Wallachia]] in 1436. Vlad and his younger brother, [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]], were held as hostages in the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1442 to secure their father's loyalty. Vlad's father and eldest brother, [[Mircea II of Wallachia|Mircea]], were murdered after [[John Hunyadi]], regent-governor of Hungary, invaded Wallachia in 1447. Hunyadi installed Vlad's second cousin, [[Vladislav II of Wallachia|Vladislav{{nbsp}}II]], as the new voivode. Hunyadi launched a military campaign against the Ottomans in the autumn of 1448, and Vladislav accompanied him. Vlad broke into Wallachia with Ottoman support in October, but Vladislav returned and Vlad sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire before the end of the year. Vlad went to [[Moldavia]] in 1449 or 1450, and later to Hungary.\n\nRelations between Hungary and Vladislav later deteriorated, and in 1456 Vlad invaded Wallachia with Hungarian support. Vladislav died fighting against him. Vlad began a purge among the [[Wallachian boyars]] to strengthen his position. He came into conflict with the [[Transylvanian Saxons]], who supported his opponents, [[Dan III of Wallachia|Dan]] and [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n|Basarab Laiot\u0103]] (who were Vladislav's brothers), and Vlad's [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] half-brother, [[Vlad the Monk]]. Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia where he had them [[Impalement|impaled]] (which inspired his [[cognomen]]). Peace was restored in 1460.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Sultan]], [[Mehmed II]], ordered Vlad to pay homage to him personally, but Vlad had the Sultan's two envoys captured and impaled. In February 1462, he attacked Ottoman territory, massacring tens of thousands of Turks and Bulgarians. Mehmed launched a campaign against Wallachia to replace Vlad with Vlad's younger brother, Radu. Vlad [[The Night Attack of T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte|attempted to capture the sultan]] at [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]] during the night of 16{{ndash}}17{{nbsp}}June 1462. The sultan and the main Ottoman army left Wallachia, but more and more Wallachians deserted to Radu. Vlad went to Transylvania to seek assistance from [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]], in late 1462, but Corvinus had him imprisoned.\n\nVlad was held in captivity in [[Visegr\u00e1d]] from 1463 to 1475. During this period, anecdotes about his cruelty started to spread in Germany and Italy. He was released at the request of [[Stephen III of Moldavia]] in the summer of 1475. He fought in Corvinus's army against the Ottomans in [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] in early 1476. Hungarian and Moldavian troops helped him to force Basarab Laiot\u0103 (who had dethroned Vlad's brother, Radu) to flee from Wallachia in November. Basarab returned with Ottoman support before the end of the year. Vlad was killed in battle before 10{{nbsp}}January 1477. Books describing Vlad's cruel acts were among the first bestsellers in the German-speaking territories. In Russia, popular stories suggested that Vlad was able to strengthen central government only through applying brutal punishments, and a similar view was adopted by most Romanian historians in the 19th century. Vlad's reputation for cruelty and his [[patronymic]] inspired the name of the [[vampire]] [[Count Dracula]], for whom, however, he did not serve as the general inspiration, in [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]''.\n\n== Name ==\n\n{{further|House of Dr\u0103cule\u0219ti}}\n\n[[File:Vlad Dracul.jpg|thumb|right|Vlad's father, [[Vlad Dracul]]]]\n\nThe expression ''Dracula'', which is now primarily known as the name of a fictional [[vampire]], was for centuries known as the [[sobriquet]] of Vlad{{nbsp}}III.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=228}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=16}} Diplomatic reports and popular stories referred to him as ''Dracula'', ''Dracuglia'', or ''Drakula'' already in the 15th{{nbsp}}century.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=228}} He himself signed his two letters as \"Dragulya\" or \"Drakulya\" in the late 1470s.{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=229}} His name had its origin in the sobriquet of his father, [[Vlad Dracul]] (\"Vlad the Dragon\" in [[Romanian language#Early history|medieval Romanian]]), who received it after he became a member of the [[Order of the Dragon]].{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=231}} Dracula is the [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] [[Genitive case|genitive form]] of Dracul, meaning \"[the son] of Dracul (or the Dragon)\".{{sfn|Nandri\u0219|1991|p=231}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} In modern Romanian, ''dracul'' means \"the devil\", which contributed to Vlad's reputation.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}}\n\nVlad III is known as ''Vlad \u021aepe\u0219'' (or Vlad the Impaler) in Romanian historiography.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} This sobriquet is connected to the [[impalement]] that was his favorite method of execution.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} The Ottoman writer [[Tursun Beg]] referred to him as ''{{lang|ota-Latn|Kaz\u0131kl\u0131 [[Voivode|Voyvoda]]}}'' (Impaler Lord) around 1500.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=10}} [[Mircea the Shepherd]], Voivode of Wallachia, used this sobriquet when referring to Vlad III in a letter of grant on 1{{nbsp}}April 1551.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=189}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\nVlad was the second legitimate son of [[Vlad II Dracul]], who was an illegitimate son of [[Mircea I of Wallachia]].

After years of desultory opposition to Democrats during the post-Reconstruction years of the [[Solid South]], Republicans vigorously contested the race by nominating businessman and party activist [[Homa J. Porter|Jack Porter]], who waged an aggressive campaign.  Johnson won his first term in the Senate, but by a closer margin than usual for Texas Democrats.\n\n==Background==\nLike other Southern states in the period between Reconstruction and the 1960s, Texas was a one party state, with the white population solidly voting Democratic as a legacy of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.596</ref> Disputes within the Texas Democratic Party were far more important than disputes between Democrats and Republicans. Starting with the 1944 election, the Democratic Party had been split between the Texas Loyalists who supported the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and the [[Texas Regulars]] who were opposed.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.596\"/> Though the Texas Regulars had officially disbanded after the 1944 election, the split remained. Stevenson, a former governor of Texas had supported the Texas Regulars in 1944, and in 1948 flirted with supporting the [[Dixiecrat]] candidacy of South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\">Baum & Haily 1994 p.597</ref> Johnson by contrast was a member of the Texas Loyalist faction.<ref name=\"Baum & Haily 1994 p.597\"/> The acrimonious split in the Texas Democrats ensured an unusually bitter primary battle between Johnson and Stevenson.<ref>Baum & Haily 1994 p.596-597</ref>\n\nThe area around the Rio Grande valley was popularly known in Texas as \"the Valley\"; in a political sense the Valley also included several counties to the north.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181</ref> The majority of the people in the Valley were Chicanos (Mexican Americans), and the Valley was often described as feeling more like Mexico than the United States as Spanish was more widely spoken than English, the culture was predominantly Mexican and the majority of the houses were built in the same style as those found just across the border in Mexico.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 181-182</ref> The Valley had the lowest literacy rate in the entire United States with the majority of its people being unable to read and write in Spanish, let alone English.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\">Caro 1990 p. 182</ref> The dominant element in the Valley were Anglos (white Texans- in Texas, the term '{{linktext|Anglo}}' did not necessarily imply English ancestry).<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Anglos tended to be ranch owners, and the majority of the Mexican Americans continued the custom originating in Mexico of accepting leadership from a ''patr\u00f3n'' (\"patron\") or ''jefe'' (\"boss\").<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The Valley was characterized by a feudal political culture where the Mexican American tenant farmers and ranch workers were like serfs, and the \"bosses\" were like feudal barons.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> In Texas, to vote required paying a [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]]. It was common for the wealthy ''patr\u00f3nes'' to pay the tax for the Mexican Americans, then order them to vote for the candidate the bosses supported.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/> The most noteworthy aspect of the Valley's political culture was extensive corruption and voting fraud.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 182-183</ref> To back up their rule, the ''jefes'' often appointed their ''pistoleros'' (gunmen) as deputy sheriffs who ensured that farmers and workers voted the \"right\" way by handing out ballots that had already been marked, which they would then place in the ballot boxes.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 182\"/>\n\nThe most powerful of the Valley's bosses was [[George Berham Parr|George Parr]], whom the press called \"the Duke of Duval\".<ref>Caro 1990 p. 184-186</ref> Locally, Parr was known to the Anglos as \"George B\" and to the Chicanos as ''Tacuacha'' (\"sly possum\").<ref>Caro 1990 p. 186</ref>  Parr owned much of the land and many of the businesses in the Valley; for instance, the only company allowed to sell beer in Duval county was owned by Parr.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 185-187</ref> Besides Duval county, Parr's influence extended to Jim Wells, Zapata, Webb, La Salle and Starr counties.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\">Caro 1990 p. 187</ref> One of Parr's  ''pistoleros'' was Luis Salas, known as ''Indio'' (Indian-a reference to his Tepehu\u00e1n descent and dark complexion), a man from Durango, Mexico who fled to the United States after killing a man in a bar brawl.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> Salas, a burly 6'1 man known for his great physical strength, ferocious temper and love of violence was in charge of elections in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 187\"/> As Parr was the first Anglo to treat Salas with respect and paid him well for his services, Salas was extremely loyal.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 188\">Caro 1990 p. 188</ref>\n\nParr was also a friend of Johnson's, as Frank B. Lloyd, the District Attorney (DA) in Alice, Texas recalled: \"George and Lyndon were very close. He [Johnson] didn't make public spectacles [of trips to Alice] like some of the politicians did. But there was the telephone\".<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\">Caro 1990 p. 191</ref> When Johnson first ran for the Senate in the [[United States Senate special election in Texas, 1941|1941]], he paid a large sum of money to Parr to obtain the Valley vote.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\">Caro 1990 p. 189</ref> Parr had supported Stevenson during his runs for Governor, but in 1944, the two had a falling out.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> The commander of a training base for the Army Air Force in Laredo complained to Stevenson that half of his men had been infected with venereal diseases after visiting brothels run by Parr, and asked that the governor appoint an honest district attorney who would crack down on prostitution.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 189\"/> Over the objections of Parr, who wanted a family friend of one of his cronies appointed as DA, Stevenson appointed a DA who implemented a crackdown on prostitution; Parr never forgave Stevenson.<ref>Caro 1990 p. 190</ref> As a congressman Johnson had long lobbied for a presidential pardon for Parr, who had been convicted of tax evasion in 1932.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> In February 1946, the newly appointed [[United States Attorney General]], Texan [[Tom C. Clark]], recommended a pardon to President Truman, who granted it on 20 February.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/> Parr believed Johnson's lobbying had ensured his pardon, which cemented their friendship.<ref name=\"Caro 1990 p. 191\"/>\n\nIn Texas, the general rule was \"The lead in the runoff always wins\".<ref name=\"Caro p.309\">Caro p.309</ref> In Texas Democratic primaries, major candidates would \"hold out\", delaying reporting their final tallies so they could add additional votes if needed.<ref>Caro p.310</ref> This practice favored the side that initially led the runoff, because it was difficult for the other side to plausibly add enough votes to win without sparking accusations of fraud.<ref name=\"Caro p.309\"/> One of the few exceptions to the rule was the 1941 special election for U.S. Senate.

Assume that the dishonest man had secured a pledge of support from the bosses of the Valley, as he probably would. If the race were close, and the honest man was ahead by only a few thousand votes with all of the returns in except from the Valley...the election could easily be 'stolen' by having the Valley counties send in just enough votes to put the dishonest man in office. Thus the will of the people of the State would be denied by less than a dozen men, all political feudal lords of the Valley.\" Shelton wrote that as of 1946, \"This has probably not happened yet.\"<ref name=\"Caro p.321\">Caro p.321</ref>{{better source needed|date=April 2020|reason=This is an incredibly significant piece of information.
