It is the opening track and [[lead single]] from their self-titled fifth album, ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'', released in 1991. The music was written by [[Kirk Hammett]], [[James Hetfield]] and [[Lars Ulrich]]. Vocalist and rhythm guitarist Hetfield wrote the lyrics, which deal with the concept of a child's nightmares.\n\nThe single achieved platinum certification for more than 1,000,000 copies shipped in the United States, spurring sales of over 30&nbsp;million copies for ''Metallica'' and propelling Metallica to worldwide popularity. Acclaimed by critics, the song is featured in all of Metallica's live albums and DVDs released after 1991 and has been played live at award ceremonies and benefit concerts.\n\n==Writing and recording==\n\"Enter Sandman\" was the first song Metallica had written for their 1991 eponymous album, ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]''.<ref name=\"ulrichca\">{{cite video|people=[[Lars Ulrich]]|title=Classic Albums: Metallica \u2013 Metallica|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Eagle Rock Entertainment]]|year=2001}}</ref> Metallica's songwriting at that time was done mainly by rhythm guitarist [[James Hetfield]] and drummer [[Lars Ulrich]], after they gathered tapes of song ideas and concepts from the other members of the band, lead guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] and bassist [[Jason Newsted]].

It is the opening track and [[lead single]] from their self-titled fifth album, ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'', released in 1991. The music was written by [[Kirk Hammett]], [[James Hetfield]] and [[Lars Ulrich]]. Vocalist and rhythm guitarist Hetfield wrote the lyrics, which deal with the concept of a child's nightmares.\n\nThe single achieved platinum certification for more than 1,000,000 copies shipped in the United States, spurring sales of over 30&nbsp;million copies for ''Metallica'' and propelling Metallica to worldwide popularity. Acclaimed by critics, the song is featured in all of Metallica's live albums and DVDs released after 1991 and has been played live at award ceremonies and benefit concerts.\n\n==Writing and recording==\n\"Enter Sandman\" was the first song Metallica had written for their 1991 eponymous album, ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]''.<ref name=\"ulrichca\">{{cite video|people=[[Lars Ulrich]]|title=Classic Albums: Metallica \u2013 Metallica|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Eagle Rock Entertainment]]|year=2001}}</ref> Metallica's songwriting at that time was done mainly by rhythm guitarist [[James Hetfield]] and drummer [[Lars Ulrich]], after they gathered tapes of song ideas and concepts from the other members of the band, lead guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] and bassist [[Jason Newsted]].

The +4 initially used the {{convert|2088|cc|abbr=on}} [[Standard Vanguard]] engine and at introduction sold for \u00a3625 (two-seater) or \u00a3723 (coup\u00e9).<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nThe +4 used [[Triumph TR2]] (in 1953),<ref name=\"auto7\">Boddy, p.1418.</ref> [[Triumph TR3|TR3]] (1956),<ref name=\"auto7\"/> or [[Triumph TR4A|TR4A]] engines (until 1969). Plus 4 production was suspended in 1969 but brought back in 1985 with a Fiat engine (1985\u20131988) and then a 4-cylinder Rover engine (1988\u20132000). Production was again suspended and the Plus 4 returned once more in 2004 with a {{convert|155|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Ford 4-cylinder.\n\nFrom October 1965 to April 1967 Morgan produced the two-seat +4 Competition, of which only 42 were built, about 11 of which survive.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nA limited edition Plus 4 was re-introduced in 2014 as the [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]] Super Sports. Only 60 cars were made available, all right-hand-drive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==== Morgan +4+ ====\n{{main|Morgan +4+}}\nA version of the +4, the +4+, was made from 1964 to 1967 with a fibreglass coup\u00e9 body. The light weight and reduced drag improved the performance of the +4+ over the standard +4 in every aspect. However, traditional Morgan enthusiasts did not embrace this departure from Morgan custom, and mainstream enthusiasts did not embrace the seemingly archaic +4 chassis. Fifty were planned, but only 26 were built.<ref>Boddy, p.1416 caption.</ref>\n\n=== Morgan 4/4 ===\n[[File:Morgan 4 4 1974.jpg|thumb|right|1974 Morgan 4/4]]\n[[File:Morgan---Ystad-2019.jpg|thumb| Morgans in [[Ystad]] 2019.]]\n{{main|Morgan 4/4}}\n\nProduction of the 4-4 was halted during World War II but resumed afterwards as the 4/4. Production halted again in 1950 when the Standard engine ceased to be available, but resumed in 1955 when a suitable replacement, the side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was found, and has continued ever since.\n\nThe 4/4 now uses the +8 chassis and a Ford engine.\n\n=== Morgan +8 ===\n{{main|Morgan Plus 8}}\nFaced with the decreasing availability of large four-cylinder engines for use in their +4 models, Morgan began to install the recently available [[Rover V8 engine]] in their cars in 1968, giving these cars the model designation \"+8\".\n\nThe engine displacement jumped from the 2.3&nbsp;L of the Triumph TR4 engine to 3.5&nbsp;L, then 3.9&nbsp;L (1990), 4.0 (1998\u20132004) with an optional 4.6L (1996\u20132000) all based on the same Land Rover block. However, this V-8 was no heavier than the Triumph engine. These features made the +8 accelerate much more quickly than the early +4 and also improved its road-holding capability.\n\nHorsepower (143\u2013204&nbsp;bhp), weight and performance varied with emission and structural laws through its history. Thus powered, the car could accelerate from 0\u201360 mph in 5.6 seconds. In its final form, the GEMS Land Rover V8 produced {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:2006 SAG - Morgan roadster - 05.jpg|thumb|Roadster at 76e international Motorshow Geneva 2006]]\n\n=== Roadster ===\n{{main|Morgan Roadster}}\nIn 2004, Morgan came out with a traditional styled model to replace the departing Plus 8. The Mk I Roadsters with the Ford UK Mondeo V6 produced 223&nbsp;bhp (166&nbsp;kW, 226 PS) at 6150 rev/min. It had a [[Magna PT|Getrag]] gearbox with direct drive in 5th with a 3.08 axle ratio. Later Marks had a Ford gearbox with direct drive in 4th with a 3.73 axle ratio. The overall gearing is virtually the same. The later Roadsters were powered by a Ford UK Mondeo V6 producing {{convert|204|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 2007, the Mondeo engine was replaced by a US-specification version of the same engine in the Roadster II. In 2011\u201312, the engine was replaced by the 3.7 Duratec Cyclone engine and output increased to {{convert|280|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The company calls this latest model the Roadster 3.7.\n\n=== Morgan Aero 8 (Series I-V) ===\n[[File:Morgan Aero 8.jpg|thumb|A Modern Morgan Aero 8 at the [[Scarsdale Concours]]]]\n{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}\nIn 2000, the Morgan Aero 8 was introduced and, as always, the wooden body substructure was [[Ash tree|ash]]. (Contrary to popular myth, however, the [[chassis]] is metal; [[aluminium]] for the Aero 8.) The Aero 8, with a [[BMW]] [[V8 engine]] in a car weighing less than a [[BMW Z4]] and considerably less than a [[BMW M3]], (though more than traditional Morgans) is even faster than the Plus 8, delivering what ''[[Autoweek]]'' magazine termed [[supercar]] performance. The newest Aero 8 (series V), presented in March 2015, puts out {{convert|367|hp|abbr=on}} at 6100 rpm with the company suggesting a top speed of over {{convert|170|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Due to the Aero 8's light weight it can do 0\u201362&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in 4.5 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2006-Morgan-Aeromax.htm |title=2006 Morgan Aeromax |publisher=Seriouswheels.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring its customer production lifetime (2002\u20132009), the Aero was configured in five official versions, (I, II, III, IV, the Aero America and V) with mild variations in styling, engines, transmissions, braking and suspension. The company canceled the model in 2009 but relaunched it in 2015 for 2016 deliveries. The year of highest production for any Aero variation was 2002.\n\n=== Morgan AeroMax ===\n[[File:Morgan-Aeromax-rear.jpg|thumb|Morgan AeroMax, showing distinct boat tail rear]]\n{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}\nThe Aero was followed by the Aeromax, a limited edition of 100 units produced between 2008 and early 2010.

Shown at Pebble Beach in clay in 2010 and expected to go on sale in 2012, deposits have been taken since 2010.

This vehicle was driven across the States, from New York to Los Angeles by Charles Morgan and his wife, covering 3000 miles, in the [[Gumball 3000]]. At the end of the seven-day drive, the Morgan 3 Wheeler was awarded the \"Spirit of Gumball\" prize.\n\n== General characteristics ==\n[[File:MorganSuspension.jpg|thumb|Traditional Morgan [[sliding pillar suspension]]]]\nIn spite of their traditional design, Morgans have always had sporting or \"sports car\" performance, due to their extremely low weight.\n\nAmong their enthusiasts, Morgans are affectionately known as \"Moggies\".\n\n=== Suspension ===\nH.F.S. Morgan's 1909 runabout used [[sliding pillar suspension]], an [[independent front suspension]] system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide up and down a fixed pillar that also acts as the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tyre and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.\n\nMorgan used developments of this suspension system throughout its existence, and it is still used on Morgan's \"classic\" line, although not on the Aero 8 or its derivatives. It has been cancelled, along with all the Morgan Classic line, in 2019. However, some \"classics\", shipped in parts to avoid the need for normal compliancy, will be shipped to the USA, and assembled there for an indefinite period.\n\n== Models ==\n* 1909 Runabout\n* 1911\u20131939 [[V-Twin 3-wheeler]]\n* 1932\u20131952 [[F-Series 3-wheeler]]\n* 1936\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4|4/4 Two-Seater and Four-Seater]]\n* 1950\u20131969 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 1964\u20131967 [[Morgan +4+|Plus 4 Plus]]\n* 1965-1967 [[Morgan +4#Competition use|Morgan +4 Competition two seater]]\n* 1968\u20132004 (and 2012\u201319) [[Morgan Plus 8|Plus 8]]\n* 1985\u20132000 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2001\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero 8]]\n* 2004\u20132012 [[Morgan Roadster|V6 Roadster]]\n* 2005\u2013present [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2006\u2013pending [[Morgan LIFEcar]]\n* 2008\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|AeroMax]]\n* 2009\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4 Sport]]\n* 2010\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero SuperSports]]\n* 2010\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Eva GT]]\n* 2011\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Plus E]]\n* 2011\u20132012 [[Morgan Plus 4 Supersports]]\n* 2011\u2013present [[Morgan Anniversary 4/4]]\n* 2012\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero Coupe]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan 3-Wheeler]]\n* 2012\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan Roadster|Roadster 3.7]]\n* 2015\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2018 Morgan EV3<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/ev3/|title=EV3|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n* 2019\u2013present [[Morgan Plus Six]]\n* 2020-present [[Morgan Plus Four]]\n\n== Motorsports ==\nMorgan cars can be found in many areas of motorsport, from club and historic racing to more prominent examples, including the Le Mans 24hr race.

The +4 initially used the {{convert|2088|cc|abbr=on}} [[Standard Vanguard]] engine and at introduction sold for \u00a3625 (two-seater) or \u00a3723 (coup\u00e9).<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\nThe +4 used [[Triumph TR2]] (in 1953),<ref name=\"auto7\">Boddy, p.1418.</ref> [[Triumph TR3|TR3]] (1956),<ref name=\"auto7\"/> or [[Triumph TR4A|TR4A]] engines (until 1969). Plus 4 production was suspended in 1969 but brought back in 1985 with a Fiat engine (1985\u20131988) and then a 4-cylinder Rover engine (1988\u20132000). Production was again suspended and the Plus 4 returned once more in 2004 with a {{convert|155|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Ford 4-cylinder.\n\nFrom October 1965 to April 1967 Morgan produced the two-seat +4 Competition, of which only 42 were built, about 11 of which survive.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nA limited edition Plus 4 was re-introduced in 2014 as the [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]] Super Sports. Only 60 cars were made available, all right-hand-drive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n==== Morgan +4+ ====\n{{main|Morgan +4+}}\nA version of the +4, the +4+, was made from 1964 to 1967 with a fibreglass coup\u00e9 body. The light weight and reduced drag improved the performance of the +4+ over the standard +4 in every aspect. However, traditional Morgan enthusiasts did not embrace this departure from Morgan custom, and mainstream enthusiasts did not embrace the seemingly archaic +4 chassis. Fifty were planned, but only 26 were built.<ref>Boddy, p.1416 caption.</ref>\n\n=== Morgan 4/4 ===\n[[File:Morgan 4 4 1974.jpg|thumb|right|1974 Morgan 4/4]]\n[[File:Morgan---Ystad-2019.jpg|thumb| Morgans in [[Ystad]] 2019.]]\n{{main|Morgan 4/4}}\n\nProduction of the 4-4 was halted during World War II but resumed afterwards as the 4/4. Production halted again in 1950 when the Standard engine ceased to be available, but resumed in 1955 when a suitable replacement, the side-valve 1,172 cc Ford 100E engine was found, and has continued ever since.\n\nThe 4/4 now uses the +8 chassis and a Ford engine.\n\n=== Morgan +8 ===\n{{main|Morgan Plus 8}}\nFaced with the decreasing availability of large four-cylinder engines for use in their +4 models, Morgan began to install the recently available [[Rover V8 engine]] in their cars in 1968, giving these cars the model designation \"+8\".\n\nThe engine displacement jumped from the 2.3&nbsp;L of the Triumph TR4 engine to 3.5&nbsp;L, then 3.9&nbsp;L (1990), 4.0 (1998\u20132004) with an optional 4.6L (1996\u20132000) all based on the same Land Rover block. However, this V-8 was no heavier than the Triumph engine. These features made the +8 accelerate much more quickly than the early +4 and also improved its road-holding capability.\n\nHorsepower (143\u2013204&nbsp;bhp), weight and performance varied with emission and structural laws through its history. Thus powered, the car could accelerate from 0\u201360 mph in 5.6 seconds. In its final form, the GEMS Land Rover V8 produced {{convert|190|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:2006 SAG - Morgan roadster - 05.jpg|thumb|Roadster at 76e international Motorshow Geneva 2006]]\n\n=== Roadster ===\n{{main|Morgan Roadster}}\nIn 2004, Morgan came out with a traditional styled model to replace the departing Plus 8. The Mk I Roadsters with the Ford UK Mondeo V6 produced 223&nbsp;bhp (166&nbsp;kW, 226 PS) at 6150 rev/min. It had a [[Magna PT|Getrag]] gearbox with direct drive in 5th with a 3.08 axle ratio. Later Marks had a Ford gearbox with direct drive in 4th with a 3.73 axle ratio. The overall gearing is virtually the same. The later Roadsters were powered by a Ford UK Mondeo V6 producing {{convert|204|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 2007, the Mondeo engine was replaced by a US-specification version of the same engine in the Roadster II. In 2011\u201312, the engine was replaced by the 3.7 Duratec Cyclone engine and output increased to {{convert|280|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The company calls this latest model the Roadster 3.7.\n\n=== Morgan Aero 8 (Series I-V) ===\n[[File:Morgan Aero 8.jpg|thumb|A Modern Morgan Aero 8 at the [[Scarsdale Concours]]]]\n{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}\nIn 2000, the Morgan Aero 8 was introduced and, as always, the wooden body substructure was [[Ash tree|ash]]. (Contrary to popular myth, however, the [[chassis]] is metal; [[aluminium]] for the Aero 8.) The Aero 8, with a [[BMW]] [[V8 engine]] in a car weighing less than a [[BMW Z4]] and considerably less than a [[BMW M3]], (though more than traditional Morgans) is even faster than the Plus 8, delivering what ''[[Autoweek]]'' magazine termed [[supercar]] performance. The newest Aero 8 (series V), presented in March 2015, puts out {{convert|367|hp|abbr=on}} at 6100 rpm with the company suggesting a top speed of over {{convert|170|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Due to the Aero 8's light weight it can do 0\u201362&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) in 4.5 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2006-Morgan-Aeromax.htm |title=2006 Morgan Aeromax |publisher=Seriouswheels.com |date= |accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring its customer production lifetime (2002\u20132009), the Aero was configured in five official versions, (I, II, III, IV, the Aero America and V) with mild variations in styling, engines, transmissions, braking and suspension. The company canceled the model in 2009 but relaunched it in 2015 for 2016 deliveries. The year of highest production for any Aero variation was 2002.\n\n=== Morgan AeroMax ===\n[[File:Morgan-Aeromax-rear.jpg|thumb|Morgan AeroMax, showing distinct boat tail rear]]\n{{main|Morgan Aero 8}}\nThe Aero was followed by the Aeromax, a limited edition of 100 units produced between 2008 and early 2010.

Instead of the traditional Morgan ladder frame and sliding-pillar suspension, it has a new bonded aluminium chassis and all-independent suspension design, with double wishbones at the front and a multi-link system for the rear. The Plus Six is powered by a [[BMW]] B58 turbocharged in-line six-cylinder petrol engine, producing 335 bhp, coupled to an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission.<ref name=\"autocar-plus6\">{{cite web |last1=Cropley |first1=Steve |title=Morgan Plus Six is marque's first all-new model in 19 years |url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-goodwood-festival-speed/morgan-plus-six-marques-first-all-new-model-19-years |website=Autocar |accessdate=29 December 2019 |date=4 July 2019}}</ref>\n=== Morgan Plus Four ===\n{{main|Morgan Plus Four}}\nThe Morgan Plus Four was revealed online in March 2020. Like, the Plus Six, it uses a \"CX-Generation\" bonded aluminium chassis and all-independent suspension design. The Plus Four is powered by a [[BMW]] B48 turbocharged in-line four-cylinder petrol engine producing 255 bhp, with either a six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed automatic transmission.\n\n== Availability in the United States ==\n[[File:Morgan door.jpg|thumb|Morgan Motor factory, main entrance]]\nFor part of the 1950s and 1960s, the United States provided the company with its largest market worldwide, taking up to 85% of all production.<ref>Laban, Brian. ''Morgan: First and Last of the Real Sports Cars.'' London: Virgin Books, 2000, page number not cited.</ref> This ended with the first wave of US safety and emission regulations in 1971. For many years (1974 to 1992), all Morgans imported into the United States were converted to run on propane as fuel to pass the US [[emission standard|emissions regulations]]. However, this conversion, along with bringing the cars into compliance with US vehicle safety legislation, was carried out by the dealership, and not by the factory, making the cars [[grey import vehicles|grey market vehicles]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.morgancars-usa.com/candd1.html | title=Reprint of Car & Driver article, January 1977 | website=Morgancars-usa.com | date= | accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, when the [[Rover Group]] re-certified their V8 engine for use in the [[Range Rover]] [[Sport utility vehicle|4x4]] sold in the US, Morgan was able to use the same engine for a fully US-compliant stock Morgan from 1992 to 1996,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} and again from 1998 to 2004.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 2005, the engine was replaced with the US-version of another traditionally shaped model (with a V6), called the Roadster.\n\nIn 2002, Morgan centralised its international compliancy development and regulatory interaction in-house.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 2005, its right to import its classic models ceased when supplies of its necessary airbag were exhausted and no replacement was developed. In 2006, a request for an airbag exemption to the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] was refused, and the import of classic Morgans ceased.<ref>http://frwebgate5.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=959721101393+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the new Morgan Aero 8 model (versions 2 and 3) received a three-year exemption from rear impact non-compliance,<ref>http://frwebgate4.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=959367106968+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> along with a separate exemption for compliance with \"advanced airbag requirements\".<ref>http://frwebgate4.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=959366106946+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The rear-impact exemption lapsed in May 2008 without further application. Morgan has indicated to its US dealers that it plans to re-apply for US certification for some model at as yet an undetermined date in the future.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn April 2012, the new Morgan 3-Wheeler was showcased at the New York International Auto Show, at the Jacob Javits Center, by Bobby Singh and Gideon Lang-Laddie of Manhattan Motorsports. This was the first time in 10 years that Morgan had had a presence at the largest of the American car shows and was the first US specification Morgan 3-Wheeler in the United States. The Morgan 3 Wheeler was voted one of the \"Hottest Cars Of The Show\" by G4TV.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hardiman|first=Paul |website=Hagerty.com |title=The New Morgan Three Wheeler|url=http://www.hagerty.com/articles-videos/Articles/2012/11/12/TheNew-2012-Morgan|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, Manhattan Motorsports took delivery of Charles Morgan's Superdry edition Morgan 3-Wheeler and prepared it for its first major American trial. This vehicle was driven across the States, from New York to Los Angeles by Charles Morgan and his wife, covering 3000 miles, in the [[Gumball 3000]]. At the end of the seven-day drive, the Morgan 3 Wheeler was awarded the \"Spirit of Gumball\" prize.\n\n== General characteristics ==\n[[File:MorganSuspension.jpg|thumb|Traditional Morgan [[sliding pillar suspension]]]]\nIn spite of their traditional design, Morgans have always had sporting or \"sports car\" performance, due to their extremely low weight.\n\nAmong their enthusiasts, Morgans are affectionately known as \"Moggies\".\n\n=== Suspension ===\nH.F.S. Morgan's 1909 runabout used [[sliding pillar suspension]], an [[independent front suspension]] system with each front wheel mounted on a stub axle able to slide up and down a fixed pillar that also acts as the [[kingpin (automotive part)|kingpin]] and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tyre and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.\n\nMorgan used developments of this suspension system throughout its existence, and it is still used on Morgan's \"classic\" line, although not on the Aero 8 or its derivatives. It has been cancelled, along with all the Morgan Classic line, in 2019. However, some \"classics\", shipped in parts to avoid the need for normal compliancy, will be shipped to the USA, and assembled there for an indefinite period.\n\n== Models ==\n* 1909 Runabout\n* 1911\u20131939 [[V-Twin 3-wheeler]]\n* 1932\u20131952 [[F-Series 3-wheeler]]\n* 1936\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4|4/4 Two-Seater and Four-Seater]]\n* 1950\u20131969 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 1964\u20131967 [[Morgan +4+|Plus 4 Plus]]\n* 1965-1967 [[Morgan +4#Competition use|Morgan +4 Competition two seater]]\n* 1968\u20132004 (and 2012\u201319) [[Morgan Plus 8|Plus 8]]\n* 1985\u20132000 [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2001\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero 8]]\n* 2004\u20132012 [[Morgan Roadster|V6 Roadster]]\n* 2005\u2013present [[Morgan +4|Plus 4]]\n* 2006\u2013pending [[Morgan LIFEcar]]\n* 2008\u20132009 [[Morgan Aero 8|AeroMax]]\n* 2009\u2013present [[Morgan 4/4 Sport]]\n* 2010\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero SuperSports]]\n* 2010\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Eva GT]]\n* 2011\u2013cancelled [[Morgan Plus E]]\n* 2011\u20132012 [[Morgan Plus 4 Supersports]]\n* 2011\u2013present [[Morgan Anniversary 4/4]]\n* 2012\u20132015 [[Morgan Aero 8|Aero Coupe]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan 3-Wheeler]]\n* 2012\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2012\u2013present [[Morgan Roadster|Roadster 3.7]]\n* 2015\u201319 [[Morgan Aero 8]]\n* 2018 Morgan EV3<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.morgan-motor.co.uk/ev3/|title=EV3|publisher=|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n* 2019\u2013present [[Morgan Plus Six]]\n* 2020-present [[Morgan Plus Four]]\n\n== Motorsports ==\nMorgan cars can be found in many areas of motorsport, from club and historic racing to more prominent examples, including the Le Mans 24hr race.
