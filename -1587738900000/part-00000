The pigskin heads were tacked to the wooden shells with metal tacks. Through close collaboration with [[Gene Krupa]]'s concept of fully tunable toms, the Slingerland drum and banjo company were the first, in 1936, to begin offering fully tuneable tom-toms (top and bottom heads) with metal or wooden rims, tension rods, and lugs. Most Chinese toms were 10 to 14 inches in diameter, but the American drum companies were eventually producing a wider range of diameters and depths. These drums were usually clamped to the bass drum rims or sat in cradles as floor stand drums. The sizes that Krupa chose became the \"standard\" for many decades and they were 9 X 13\" (mounted) and 16 X 16\" (floor). Later, mounted on three (or, if larger than 16 X 16, four) legs were attached to the floor tom designs. Together with a snare drum and a bass drum of varying size, the combination of the four drums became a \"set\". (The term \"kit\" did not appear until the mid 1960s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Rob |title=The Slingerland Book |date=2004 |publisher=Rebeats Press |isbn=1888408103}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Rob |title=The Complete History of the Leedy Drum Company |date=1993 |publisher=Centerstream Publications |isbn=0931759749}}</ref>)\n\nLater,{{when|date=December 2017}} the mounted toms, known as ''hanging toms'' or ''rack toms'', were deepened by one inch each, these sizes being called ''power toms''.

This \"classic\" configuration is still popular.Concerts came in the early 70s.   With Ludwig producing single headed toms in 6x5.5,8x5.5,10x6.5,12x8,13x9,14x10, 15x12 16x14 mounted in pairs on a stand.\n\n\"FAST\" sizes are 10\u00d78, 12\u00d79, 13\u00d710, etc., a marketing term used by DW, although not unique to DW,  but with all drum manufacturers.\nThe \"New standard\" sizes  - 10\u00d79, 12\u00d710, 13\u00d711, etc. are 2\" deeper than what was considered \"standard\" in the 1950s. \n\"Power\" toms are one inch deeper than standard, with sizes of 10\u00d79 or 10\u00d710, 12\u00d711, 13\u00d712, which overtook the classic setup in popularity during the 1980s.\nSquare - 10\u00d710, 12\u00d712, 13\u00d713, etc., have been common in the 1980s and 1990s. Hyperdrive are shallow depths made popular initially by Tama: 10\u00d76.5, 12\u00d77, 13\u00d77.5, etc.\n\n== Variations ==\n\n=== Single-headed ===\n[[File:Van halen drum.jpg|thumb|In the 1970s, [[Alex Van Halen]] simply removed the bottom heads from his hanging toms to create concert toms]]\nSingle-headed tom-toms, also known as concert toms, have also been used in drum kits, though their use has fallen off in popularity since the 1970s. ''Concert toms'' have a single head and a shell slightly shallower than the corresponding double-headed tom. [[Phil Collins]] still uses four single-headed rack-mount toms and two floor toms (Gretsch) in his setup. They are generally easier to tune as they have no bottom head to adjust.\n\nThe term ''concert tom'' has also been used to describe double- or single-headed tom-tom drums designed for use in a [[concert band]] rather than in a drum kit.<ref>http://www.pearldrum.com/Products/Concert/Concert-Toms/PTA-Concert-Toms.aspx retrieved 28 February 2012 ''Pearl's Philharmonic Series Concert Toms... Double-headed and single-headed configurations available...''Pearldrum.com</ref>\n\n=== Rototoms ===\n\n[[Rototom]]s have no shell at all, just a single head and a steel frame. Unlike most other drums, they have a variable definite [[pitch (music)|pitch]] and some composers write for them as a tuned instrument, demanding specific notes. They can be tuned quickly by rotating the head. Since the head rotates on a thread, this raises or lowers the head relative to the rim of the drum and so increases or decreases the tension in the head.\n\n=== Gong bass drum ===\nA [[gong bass drum]] (also known as \"gong drum\"), is a large, single-headed tom often sized at {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} or {{convert|22|in|cm|abbr=on}}, with the drumhead being {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}} larger than the shell. The sound produced is similar to a [[bass drum]], though it is more open and has longer sustain. They can be mounted with standard floor tom legs, though many drummers mount them at an angle next to the floor tom(s). Notable users include [[Neil Peart]], [[Stewart Copeland]], [[Bill Bruford]], [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]], [[Jason Bittner]], [[Mike Portnoy]] and [[Dominic Howard|Dom Howard]].\n\n=== Floor tom ===\nA [[floor tom]] is a double-skin drum, most often but not always as deep as its diameter, traditionally mounted on three legs and to the drummer's right for a right-handed drummer. It is normally the deepest-toned drum played by sticks in the kit, above the bass drum but below all others, and the most resonant, more so than even the bass drum.\n\n==Construction and manufacture==\nTypically, a tom consists of a shell, chromed or plated metal hardware and [[Drumhead|head]]. Shell depth standards vary according to the era of manufacture and the drum style. Tom-toms are typically made in diameters of: {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|13|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} and  {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}}, with heads to fit.\n\nTom-toms can be fitted with an adjustable mounting for a floor stand, or attachment to a [[bass drum]] or marching rig. They can be single- or double-headed.\n\n===Shell===\nA crucial factor in achieving superior tone quality and insuring durability, especially with wood, is the creation of perfectly round shells and much research and development has been put into this manufacturing technology.\n\nShells are often constructed of 6\u20138 wood plies (often using different woods e. g. mahogany and falkata \u2014 birch or maple are commonly used for single-wood plies), solid wood (turned) or man-made materials (e. g. fibreglass, pressed steel, [[acrylic glass]], resin-composite). Wood or composite shells can be finished by laminating in plastic in a large variety of colours and effects (e. g. sparkle or polychromatic); natural wood may be stained or left natural and painted with clear lacquer. Steel is usually chromed, fibreglass self-coloured and [[acrylic glass]] tinted or clear.\n\n===Hardware===\n[[Image:Mh 8313 tommount.jpg|thumbnail|200px|A shell-mounted clamp attached to ball-head floor stand.]]\n\nFor [[Drum hardware]] one or two cast or pressed metal rims attach by threaded tension rods or lugs to nut boxes bolted onto the shell and hold the heads onto the bearing edges of the shell. The tension rod assembly needs to be precision-machined, cast and fitted to enable predictable and secure tuning without inhibiting resonance or introducing extra vibration. All components will be placed under great tension and experience added stresses from playing.\n\nMounting systems vary greatly, from a simple cast block on the shell which accepts and clamps to a rod attached to a clamp or holder to much more sophisticated arrangements where there is no attachment to the shell, instead a frame clamps to the tuning lugs.\n\nAnother sort of rod clamp system allows attachment of the drum to the tom holder without the need of a hole in the drum shell for the rod to pass through. The clamp is attached to the shell at the nodal point with two bolts so as to allow the shell to vibrate freely without degrading the shell's dynamic range and sustain. The nodal point is the location on a shell with the least amount of vibration allowing for the mount to have minimal effect on the resonance of the shell.\n\nSome drummers use a snare stand to hold and to make it easier to position the tom.\n\n==Sound==\n[[File:Tom-tom notation.png|325px|right|thumb|Standard [[drum notation]] for (up to six) toms.{{Audio|Tom-tom notation.mid|play}}]]\n\n<!-- _________________Table________________________. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" summary=\"Audio samples\"\n|+ Audio samples\n|-\n!

It is normally the deepest-toned drum played by sticks in the kit, above the bass drum but below all others, and the most resonant, more so than even the bass drum.\n\n==Construction and manufacture==\nTypically, a tom consists of a shell, chromed or plated metal hardware and [[Drumhead|head]]. Shell depth standards vary according to the era of manufacture and the drum style. Tom-toms are typically made in diameters of: {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|13|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}},  {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} and  {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}}, with heads to fit.\n\nTom-toms can be fitted with an adjustable mounting for a floor stand, or attachment to a [[bass drum]] or marching rig. They can be single- or double-headed.\n\n===Shell===\nA crucial factor in achieving superior tone quality and insuring durability, especially with wood, is the creation of perfectly round shells and much research and development has been put into this manufacturing technology.\n\nShells are often constructed of 6\u20138 wood plies (often using different woods e. g. mahogany and falkata \u2014 birch or maple are commonly used for single-wood plies), solid wood (turned) or man-made materials (e. g. fibreglass, pressed steel, [[acrylic glass]], resin-composite). Wood or composite shells can be finished by laminating in plastic in a large variety of colours and effects (e. g. sparkle or polychromatic); natural wood may be stained or left natural and painted with clear lacquer. Steel is usually chromed, fibreglass self-coloured and [[acrylic glass]] tinted or clear.\n\n===Hardware===\n[[Image:Mh 8313 tommount.jpg|thumbnail|200px|A shell-mounted clamp attached to ball-head floor stand.]]\n\nFor [[Drum hardware]] one or two cast or pressed metal rims attach by threaded tension rods or lugs to nut boxes bolted onto the shell and hold the heads onto the bearing edges of the shell. The tension rod assembly needs to be precision-machined, cast and fitted to enable predictable and secure tuning without inhibiting resonance or introducing extra vibration. All components will be placed under great tension and experience added stresses from playing.\n\nMounting systems vary greatly, from a simple cast block on the shell which accepts and clamps to a rod attached to a clamp or holder to much more sophisticated arrangements where there is no attachment to the shell, instead a frame clamps to the tuning lugs.\n\nAnother sort of rod clamp system allows attachment of the drum to the tom holder without the need of a hole in the drum shell for the rod to pass through. The clamp is attached to the shell at the nodal point with two bolts so as to allow the shell to vibrate freely without degrading the shell's dynamic range and sustain. The nodal point is the location on a shell with the least amount of vibration allowing for the mount to have minimal effect on the resonance of the shell.\n\nSome drummers use a snare stand to hold and to make it easier to position the tom.\n\n==Sound==\n[[File:Tom-tom notation.png|325px|right|thumb|Standard [[drum notation]] for (up to six) toms.{{Audio|Tom-tom notation.mid|play}}]]\n\n<!-- _________________Table________________________. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" summary=\"Audio samples\"\n|+ Audio samples\n|-\n!

The [[World Health Organization]] says that jurisdictions should aim to test every suspected case of COVID-19<ref name=\"auto1\"> {{Cite web| url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331509/WHO-COVID-19-lab_testing-2020.1-eng.pdf| title=Laboratory testing strategy recommendations for COVID-19, Interim Guidance 21 March 2020}}</ref>. Before beginning to reopen the economy, researchers have advised the United States to aim for ''at least'' 152 tests per 100,000 people each day <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html| first=Keith |last=Collins |title=Coronavirus Testing Needs to Triple Before the U.S. Can Reopen, Experts Say| newspaper=The New York Times | date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>. In late April, Ontario was testing just under 10,000 people per day, equal to a testing rate of about 70 tests per 100,000 people per day.\n \n=== Types of tests ===\n==== Virus-RNA tests ====\nAs of April 2020, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 in Ontario is conducted using a method called [[RT-PCR]]. A carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose. The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres across Ontario. At the centres, highly-skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time. The test mixes the sample with a test kit containing chemicals designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2. The sample is cycled between two temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature. This leads to processing times that range from 12 to 24 hours.\n\nIn early April, Ontario has contracted Spartan Bioscience Inc. from Ottawa to supply it with virus-RNA testing systems that process a single swab sample in 30 to 60 minutes <ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/13/ontario-orders-close-to-one-million-spartan-bioscience-portable-covid-19-test-kits.html|title=Ontario orders close to one million Spartan Bioscience portable COVID-19 test kits|date=April 13, 2020}} </ref>. The contract was for 900,000 swab test kits, whereas the number of machines has not been disclosed. While these machines cannot process many samples in total, they have the advantage of being small and easy to use. Thus, they can be used to provide rapid results at the point-of-care. They are expected to be useful at border crossings, isolated communities, prisons, and care homes.\n\n==== Serology tests ====\nOntario is performing experiments testing the performance of blood tests that look for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus <ref> {{cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2020/04/20/covid-19-community-spread-in-ontario-has-likely-reached-its-peak-new-modelling-shows/|title=COVID-19 community spread in Ontario has likely reached its peak, new modelling shows|date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>. Antibodies do not form immediately upon infection, so these tests are not well-suited for detecting a current infection. However, they can potentially identify those who have been infected in the past.\n\n=== Testing facilities ===\n\nPublic Health Ontario has six testing laboratories to which samples can be sent. The main laboratory is the top four floors of the MaRS Centre in downtown Toronto <ref> {{cite web| url=https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/canada/2020/04/10/a-virtual-tour-of-a-public-health-ontario-lab-ramping-up-its-covid-19-testing.html?fbclid=IwAR09umcjbDihhlDeBgrtnnU9lD5ts73VIcN0N6_55XSC4Cwv5M6Nb0QAREU| title=A virtual tour of a Public Health Ontario lab ramping up its COVID-19 testing}} </ref>.

In addition to the six public health labs, this includes 10 hospital networks and three private lab networks, including Dynacare and LifeLabs <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/04/how-ontario-turned-the-tide-on-a-huge-backlog-of-covid-19-tests.html|title=How Ontario turned the tide on a huge backlog of COVID-19 tests|date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>.\n\n=== Testing access ===\nAccess to testing is set by Public Health Ontario who publishes a guidance document that defines the conditions for an individual to be tested <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/coronavirus/docs/2019_covid_testing_guidance.pdf|title=Ontario Public Health 2019 COVID testing guidance}}</ref>. Conditions have included close contact with a test-confirmed case, recent travel, admission to hospital for serious symptoms, healthcare worker, longterm care home resident, etc.  The set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from January to April 2020, at times reducing access and at other times increasing access to testing <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw| title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada |first=Emily |last=Chung |date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>. Starting in March, the public health units across the province have opened over 70 assessment centres, which members of the public can visit if directed by a health professional ([https://www.ontariohealthcoalition.ca/index.php/resources-list-of-ontario-covid-19-assessment-centres-their-individual-criteria List of Ontario COVID-19 Assessment Centres & Their Individual Criteria]). These range from mobile units, to walk-up locations, to drive-through locations. This diverts potentially infected people from hospitals and doctors' offices.  If warranted, the centre will collect a swab from a visitor for testing. Swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public health officials, for example, at longterm care homes.\n\nSince many cases are not tested, the number of test-confirmed cases, which are the infection numbers reported by the Ontario government, should not be misconstrued as the actual number of infections, which have been estimated to be a factor of 20 to 100 higher \n<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/stay-home-covid-19-spreading-in-community-100s-could-be-infected-says-ottawas-medical-officer-of-health/|title=STAY HOME: COVID-19 spreading in the community, 100s could be infected, says Ottawa's medical officer of health}}</ref>.

This 10% limit was exceeded on multiple days in early April. Since a relatively limited number of cases are tested, the actual number of cases will be much higher than the test-confirmed numbers.\n\nIn late March and April, Ontario was performing the lowest number of tests per capita of all the provinces<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crawley |first1=Mike |title=Wait list for COVID-19 test results balloons to 11,000 in Ontario |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid19-test-ontario-waiting-lab-results-coronavirus-1.5510644 |website=CBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw|title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada|work=CBC|first=Emily |last=Chung}} </ref> but had high testing numbers compared to most western countries (see [[Template:COVID-19 testing by country subdivision]]).\n\nOn April 15, polling firms, Forum Research and Mainstreet Research, released results of a survey conducted on April 11 and 12 about COVID-19 prevalence and testing.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/one-fifth-of-ontario-households-have-one-or-more-symptoms-of-covid-19/ |title= COVID-19 Symptom Study - Ontario}}</ref> Of the 5,045 respondents, 19% of households contained someone who had at least one symptom and in 8% of households someone had a key symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath). Only 2% of households contained someone who had been tested.\n\n=== Testing capacity ===\nSince January 2020, Ontario has been increasing its capacity to perform testing based on RT-PCR. Various factors have impeded this increase, including shortages of [[reagent]] chemicals for the RT-PCR machines and shortages of validated swabs. To tackle these challenges, labs have adapted. In particular, RT-PCR machines from multiple manufactures have been obtained, each of which takes different sets of chemicals.  New suppliers of swabs have been found but each must be tested and validated to perform properly. Returning tests results to individuals is automated with an online portal <ref> {{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6773258/coronavirus-ontario-online-test-results-covid-19/|title=Coronavirus: Ontario announces online portal to check COVID-19 test results}}</ref>.\n\n==== Testing capacity projections ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[World Health Organization]] says that jurisdictions should aim to test every suspected case of COVID-19<ref name=\"auto1\"> {{Cite web| url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331509/WHO-COVID-19-lab_testing-2020.1-eng.pdf| title=Laboratory testing strategy recommendations for COVID-19, Interim Guidance 21 March 2020}}</ref>. Before beginning to reopen the economy, researchers have advised the United States to aim for ''at least'' 152 tests per 100,000 people each day <ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html| first=Keith |last=Collins |title=Coronavirus Testing Needs to Triple Before the U.S. Can Reopen, Experts Say| newspaper=The New York Times | date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>. In late April, Ontario was testing just under 10,000 people per day, equal to a testing rate of about 70 tests per 100,000 people per day.\n \n=== Types of tests ===\n==== Virus-RNA tests ====\nAs of April 2020, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 in Ontario is conducted using a method called [[RT-PCR]]. A carefully produced and validated swab is used to collect a sample from a person's throat, back of the nose, or front of the nose. The swab is put inside a sealed container containing a medium that preserves the virus, which is sent to test-processing centres across Ontario. At the centres, highly-skilled technicians use large commercial machines from a variety of manufactures to process batches of tens to hundreds of samples at a time. The test mixes the sample with a test kit containing chemicals designed to detect RNA signatures of SARS-CoV-2. The sample is cycled between two temperatures to amplify the chemical RNA signature. This leads to processing times that range from 12 to 24 hours.\n\nIn early April, Ontario has contracted Spartan Bioscience Inc. from Ottawa to supply it with virus-RNA testing systems that process a single swab sample in 30 to 60 minutes <ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/04/13/ontario-orders-close-to-one-million-spartan-bioscience-portable-covid-19-test-kits.html|title=Ontario orders close to one million Spartan Bioscience portable COVID-19 test kits|date=April 13, 2020}} </ref>. The contract was for 900,000 swab test kits, whereas the number of machines has not been disclosed. While these machines cannot process many samples in total, they have the advantage of being small and easy to use. Thus, they can be used to provide rapid results at the point-of-care. They are expected to be useful at border crossings, isolated communities, prisons, and care homes.\n\n==== Serology tests ====\nOntario is performing experiments testing the performance of blood tests that look for antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus <ref> {{cite web|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2020/04/20/covid-19-community-spread-in-ontario-has-likely-reached-its-peak-new-modelling-shows/|title=COVID-19 community spread in Ontario has likely reached its peak, new modelling shows|date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>. Antibodies do not form immediately upon infection, so these tests are not well-suited for detecting a current infection. However, they can potentially identify those who have been infected in the past.\n\n=== Testing facilities ===\n\nPublic Health Ontario has six testing laboratories to which samples can be sent. The main laboratory is the top four floors of the MaRS Centre in downtown Toronto <ref> {{cite web| url=https://www.thestar.com/amp/news/canada/2020/04/10/a-virtual-tour-of-a-public-health-ontario-lab-ramping-up-its-covid-19-testing.html?fbclid=IwAR09umcjbDihhlDeBgrtnnU9lD5ts73VIcN0N6_55XSC4Cwv5M6Nb0QAREU| title=A virtual tour of a Public Health Ontario lab ramping up its COVID-19 testing}} </ref>.

Conditions have included close contact with a test-confirmed case, recent travel, admission to hospital for serious symptoms, healthcare worker, longterm care home resident, etc.  The set of conditions has been updated repeatedly from January to April 2020, at times reducing access and at other times increasing access to testing <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw| title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada |first=Emily |last=Chung |date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>. Starting in March, the public health units across the province have opened over 70 assessment centres, which members of the public can visit if directed by a health professional ([https://www.ontariohealthcoalition.ca/index.php/resources-list-of-ontario-covid-19-assessment-centres-their-individual-criteria List of Ontario COVID-19 Assessment Centres & Their Individual Criteria]). These range from mobile units, to walk-up locations, to drive-through locations. This diverts potentially infected people from hospitals and doctors' offices.  If warranted, the centre will collect a swab from a visitor for testing. Swabs are also collected at hospitals and by public health officials, for example, at longterm care homes.\n\nSince many cases are not tested, the number of test-confirmed cases, which are the infection numbers reported by the Ontario government, should not be misconstrued as the actual number of infections, which have been estimated to be a factor of 20 to 100 higher \n<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/stay-home-covid-19-spreading-in-community-100s-could-be-infected-says-ottawas-medical-officer-of-health/|title=STAY HOME: COVID-19 spreading in the community, 100s could be infected, says Ottawa's medical officer of health}}</ref>.

Since a relatively limited number of cases are tested, the actual number of cases will be much higher than the test-confirmed numbers.\n\nIn late March and April, Ontario was performing the lowest number of tests per capita of all the provinces<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crawley |first1=Mike |title=Wait list for COVID-19 test results balloons to 11,000 in Ontario |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid19-test-ontario-waiting-lab-results-coronavirus-1.5510644 |website=CBC |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/covid-19-testing-variations-1.5520812?fbclid=IwAR2TSyDyl5J8cK-N8hJ2hBLnvN36-5VU1E9CaKRPM7plfi_xC0mVrD2gTZw|title=Why COVID-19 testing varies so much across Canada|work=CBC|first=Emily |last=Chung}} </ref> but had high testing numbers compared to most western countries (see [[Template:COVID-19 testing by country subdivision]]).\n\nOn April 15, polling firms, Forum Research and Mainstreet Research, released results of a survey conducted on April 11 and 12 about COVID-19 prevalence and testing.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.mainstreetresearch.ca/one-fifth-of-ontario-households-have-one-or-more-symptoms-of-covid-19/ |title= COVID-19 Symptom Study - Ontario}}</ref> Of the 5,045 respondents, 19% of households contained someone who had at least one symptom and in 8% of households someone had a key symptom (fever, cough, shortness of breath). Only 2% of households contained someone who had been tested.\n\n=== Testing capacity ===\nSince January 2020, Ontario has been increasing its capacity to perform testing based on RT-PCR. Various factors have impeded this increase, including shortages of [[reagent]] chemicals for the RT-PCR machines and shortages of validated swabs. To tackle these challenges, labs have adapted. In particular, RT-PCR machines from multiple manufactures have been obtained, each of which takes different sets of chemicals.  New suppliers of swabs have been found but each must be tested and validated to perform properly. Returning tests results to individuals is automated with an online portal <ref> {{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6773258/coronavirus-ontario-online-test-results-covid-19/|title=Coronavirus: Ontario announces online portal to check COVID-19 test results}}</ref>.\n\n==== Testing capacity projections ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

(Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\".

It is the 279th overall episode of the show and the 24th episode of the eleventh and final season which aired on [[CBS]] on Wednesday, March 29, 1978 from 8:00 to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. EST.\n\nThe episode, directed by [[Dave Powers (director)|Dave Powers]] and written by a large number of collaborators, was videotaped in front of a live audience on [[Saint Patrick's Day]], March 17, 1978 on Stage 33 at [[CBS Television City]] in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19780325&id=lPROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6386,2976506&hl=en \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at [[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n[[Carol Burnett]], [[Tim Conway]] and [[Vicki Lawrence]] reminisce about past shows and introduce excerpts spanning eleven seasons of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which include the following highlights: Burnett does her [[Tarzan yell]] and performs in duets with such guests as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]; in comic skits, [[Burt Reynolds]] sings \"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\"; [[Harvey Korman]] sings \"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\"; and Burnett sings \"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]],\" \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]],\" and \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\"; movie parodies include ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' and ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]''.\n\nAdditional highlights include Lawrence singing \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" and a spoof of a country-and-western song; Bing Crosby and [[Bob Hope]] appear in a restaurant skit; Conway performs the role of a sports commentator in his very first sketch on the series; a ''[[Columbo]]'' parody is featured and [[Dick Van Dyke]] appears in a comic sketch; a series of bloopers and outtakes are included from previous shows featuring the regular cast.\n\nAlso featured is a final sketch of \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" with Burnett and Lawrence as Eunice and Mama where Eunice consults a psychiatrist (played by [[Craig Richard Nelson]]) trying to figure out what went wrong with her life, as well as a final sketch of \"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" with Burnett and Conway as Mrs. Wiggins and Mr. Tudball in which Mr. Tudball is moving his office to a new location and has a flashback to when he first met and interviewed Mrs. Wiggins. (Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years. And I'm frankly speaking for all the millions of people\".\n\nIn the final moments of the show, Burnett, as the Charwoman, is backstage and waves goodbye to the show's staff and celebrities from the audience as they silently walk by to wish her farewell. Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre.
