To date their only success in the top-tier competition came in 2007, winning the [[BBL Trophy]], though the team has reached a further three Trophy and [[BBL Cup]] Finals since.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and early years (1983\u20131996)===\nPlymouth Raiders' origins can be traced back to the mid-1970s with the original National League team Plymouth Panasonic, coached by future Raiders co-founder Frank Pocock ( age 82 of 2020 ) who entered national competition for the first and only time in 1979. Panasonic achieved a respectable 7th-place finish in Division Two before withdrawing during the close season due to a lack of finances, after which they were renamed Plymouth Kanaries and entered into the regional leagues in 1980. Deciding to have another attempt at establishing a National League club, Pocock along with local basketball figures Bob Karruck, Keith Mollard and businessman Les Palmer (of the [[Wrigley's]] company) formed a consortium in 1983 and merged the Kanaries with local rivals Plympton to form a new club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Mollard-helped-create-original-blueprint-Raiders/story-16052012-detail/story.html|title=Mollard helped create original blueprint for Raiders to follow|publisher=[[The Herald (Plymouth)|The Herald]]|accessdate=29 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930233816/http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Mollard-helped-create-original-blueprint-Raiders/story-16052012-detail/story.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A sponsorship deal was arranged with pharmaceutical producer Glucodin and the team adopted their brand colours of red and yellow for their inaugural season in National League Division 2. Raiders played their first game on 1 October 1983 at the [[Mayflower Centre]], losing by one point, 75\u201376 to the visiting Merseyside Mustangs. After an inconsistent start to the campaign, coach Graham Nicholls stepped down from his position and was replaced by his assistant Karruck who led the team to lowly 10th-placed finished in their rookie season. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n[[Gary Stronach]] became player/coach in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2006/07/06/plymouth_raiders_news_july_2006.shtml|title=Stronach considers switch|date=22 June 2006|work=Plymouth Raiders news archive: June to September 2006|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe club endured a barren spell throughout the early 1990s and were forced to leave their Mayflower Centre in 1991 due to a leak in the roof. The team underwent a brief nomadic period using venues such as the John Kitto Centre, China Fleet Centre, Ivybridge Community College and even Torbay Leisure Centre, 30 miles away in [[Paignton]], to host home games. The Raiders returned to the Mayflower Centre, now with a brand new roof, in January 1992 and made a brief return to the Play-offs before bowing out to League Runners-up [[Bury Lobos]] in the Semi-final. By late 1992, with no major sponsor in place, the Raiders faced more financial troubles and an uncertain future. Following the help of a local newspaper campaign in the [[Evening Herald]], Wolferstan's Solicitors came forward with a sponsorship offer and investment that enabled the club to survive its second financial crisis in six years.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn the summer of 1993, head coach Bob Karruck announced his retirement and was replaced by his assistant Vic Flemming, who led the team to the 1994 National Trophy Final. Raiders were pitted against [[Sheffield Forgers (basketball)|Sheffield Forgers]] at their home [[Sheffield Arena]] and, despite a spirited performance, they lost by 60\u201362 to a Sheffield team who would be crowned as Carlsberg League champions the following year.

The addition of local players [[Roderick Wellington]], Deng Deng (brother of [[Luol Deng]]), Canadian Peter Knechtel and [[Wales|Welsh]] international Nathan Hayes, bolstered an impressive roster and with eight straight victories to open the season, the Raiders were on course to claim the newly rebranded NBL Conference title.

Progress through the National Cup provided interest early in the season, and the Final was reached with Teesside Mohawks providing the opposition at the [[English Institute of Sport - Sheffield|EIS Sheffield]], however it was Raiders who walked away with the George Williams Trophy after a close 89\u201382 victory. The National Trophy was once more unattainable following a surprise defeat to Sutton in the semi-final, but Raiders domination in the league secured another trophy, finishing first with just two defeats to [[London United (basketball)|London United]] and Reading, who finished in second place.

To date their only success in the top-tier competition came in 2007, winning the [[BBL Trophy]], though the team has reached a further three Trophy and [[BBL Cup]] Finals since.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and early years (1983\u20131996)===\nPlymouth Raiders' origins can be traced back to the mid-1970s with the original National League team Plymouth Panasonic, coached by future Raiders co-founder Frank Pocock ( age 82 of 2020 ) who entered national competition for the first and only time in 1979. Panasonic achieved a respectable 7th-place finish in Division Two before withdrawing during the close season due to a lack of finances, after which they were renamed Plymouth Kanaries and entered into the regional leagues in 1980. Deciding to have another attempt at establishing a National League club, Pocock along with local basketball figures Bob Karruck, Keith Mollard and businessman Les Palmer (of the [[Wrigley's]] company) formed a consortium in 1983 and merged the Kanaries with local rivals Plympton to form a new club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Mollard-helped-create-original-blueprint-Raiders/story-16052012-detail/story.html|title=Mollard helped create original blueprint for Raiders to follow|publisher=[[The Herald (Plymouth)|The Herald]]|accessdate=29 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930233816/http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Mollard-helped-create-original-blueprint-Raiders/story-16052012-detail/story.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A sponsorship deal was arranged with pharmaceutical producer Glucodin and the team adopted their brand colours of red and yellow for their inaugural season in National League Division 2. Raiders played their first game on 1 October 1983 at the [[Mayflower Centre]], losing by one point, 75\u201376 to the visiting Merseyside Mustangs. After an inconsistent start to the campaign, coach Graham Nicholls stepped down from his position and was replaced by his assistant Karruck who led the team to lowly 10th-placed finished in their rookie season. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n[[Gary Stronach]] became player/coach in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2006/07/06/plymouth_raiders_news_july_2006.shtml|title=Stronach considers switch|date=22 June 2006|work=Plymouth Raiders news archive: June to September 2006|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe club endured a barren spell throughout the early 1990s and were forced to leave their Mayflower Centre in 1991 due to a leak in the roof. The team underwent a brief nomadic period using venues such as the John Kitto Centre, China Fleet Centre, Ivybridge Community College and even Torbay Leisure Centre, 30 miles away in [[Paignton]], to host home games. The Raiders returned to the Mayflower Centre, now with a brand new roof, in January 1992 and made a brief return to the Play-offs before bowing out to League Runners-up [[Bury Lobos]] in the Semi-final. By late 1992, with no major sponsor in place, the Raiders faced more financial troubles and an uncertain future. Following the help of a local newspaper campaign in the [[Evening Herald]], Wolferstan's Solicitors came forward with a sponsorship offer and investment that enabled the club to survive its second financial crisis in six years.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn the summer of 1993, head coach Bob Karruck announced his retirement and was replaced by his assistant Vic Flemming, who led the team to the 1994 National Trophy Final. Raiders were pitted against [[Sheffield Forgers (basketball)|Sheffield Forgers]] at their home [[Sheffield Arena]] and, despite a spirited performance, they lost by 60\u201362 to a Sheffield team who would be crowned as Carlsberg League champions the following year. Flemming's tenure lasted only a season and that summer he was replaced by long-serving player Gary Stronach, who assumed the role of player/coach.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Golden era (1996\u20132004)===\n[[File:PlymouthRaidersLogo.png|right|thumb|Plymouth Raiders Logo (used until 2012)]]\n\nIn 1998 the Raiders lost the league, trophy and NBL Final to [[Richmond Jaguars]].<ref>{{cite web| author = Mark Woods | title = Jaguars end era on high | url = http://www.britball.com/archive98/basketfest98_NBLMD1.html| year = | accessdate = 27 August 2016 | publisher = BritBall  }}</ref>\n\nThe 1998\u201399 season saw the Raiders and [[Solent Stars]] finishing the regular season on equal 21\u20135 records, the title was ultimately decided by a two-point aggregate differential in the head-to-head between the two teams.<ref>{{cite web| author = Mark Woods | title = Solent shoot for Stars with Div. 1 title | url = http://www.britball.com/archive99/solent-title99.htm | year = 1999 | accessdate = 2009-12-06 | publisher = BritBall  }}</ref> Raiders rallied a superb Play-off run and following the defeats of Cardiff Clippers, 111\u2013101, and Guilford Pumas, 93\u201375, they edged out familiar foes Teesside in the Final at [[Guildford Spectrum]], 71\u201366, securing the Play-off crown for the second time.<ref>{{cite web| author = Mark Woods | title = Stronach\u2019s men in Championship raid | url = http://www.britball.com/archive99/nblm1-final99.htm | year = 1999 | accessdate = 2009-12-06 | publisher = BritBall  }}</ref>\n\nThe 2000\u20132001 season saw Stronach recruit arguable the strongest roster the franchise had ever seen, bringing in [[Todd Cetnar]] and [[Terrence Durham]], two American imports straight out of [[University at Albany, SUNY|Albany]] and [[St. Bonaventure University]]\u2019s respectively. The addition of local players [[Roderick Wellington]], Deng Deng (brother of [[Luol Deng]]), Canadian Peter Knechtel and [[Wales|Welsh]] international Nathan Hayes, bolstered an impressive roster and with eight straight victories to open the season, the Raiders were on course to claim the newly rebranded NBL Conference title. The first defeat of the campaign came in the Trophy Semi-final to a [[Worthing Thunder]] team that inflicted two further defeats upon Plymouth throughout the season and matched the Raiders all the way in the hunt for silverware. However it was Raiders who came out on top with a 19\u20132 record and the Conference crown for the first time in the franchise's history. The season was completed with an excellent run in the Play-offs sweeping aside Sutton (98\u201368) and [[Manchester Magic]] (162\u2013155 over two games), before commanding an 83\u201377 defeat on Worthing at [[Wembley Arena]] and claiming the Championship double.<ref>{{cite web| author = Mark Woods | title = Plymouth delight Wembley hoardes | url = http://www.britball.com/2001/NBLMen-01-conffinal.html | year = 2001 | accessdate = 2009-12-06 | publisher = BritBall  }}</ref>\n\nAfter two seasons in Portugal, Terrence Durham's return was the only adjustment in a largely unchanged roster for the 2003\u20132004 season which saw the club accept an invitation to appear in the BBL Trophy for a second time, adding to a tough schedule including the league (now reverted to [[English Basketball League|EBL Division 1]]), the National Trophy and the National Cup, which for the first time in history didn't feature any BBL teams. Progress though the National Cup provided interest early in the season, and the Final was reached with Teesside Mohawks providing the opposition at the [[English Institute of Sport - Sheffield|EIS Sheffield]], however it was Raiders who walked away with the George Williams Trophy after a close 89\u201382 victory. The National Trophy was once more unattainable following a surprise defeat to Sutton in the semi-final, but Raiders domination in the league secured another trophy, finishing first with just two defeats to [[London United (basketball)|London United]] and Reading, who finished in second place. The Play-off Final was reached again, but Raiders were unable to add a third title to the season's haul as Teesside, exacting their National Cup defeat revenge, came out on top with an 80\u201375 win. {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Move to the BBL and recent years (2004\u20132016)===\nHaving firmly established themselves as the dominant force in Division 1, the Plymouth board sought new challenges for the team and to expand the Raiders brand and during the summer of 2004 announced that they had been admitted into the top-tier BBL.<ref>{{cite news| author = Richard Taylor | title = Basketball season tips-off on positive note | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/basketball-season-tips-off-on-positive-note-550634.html | accessdate = 2009-12-08 | publisher = The Independent | location=London | date=2 October 2004}}</ref>\n\nDuring  the [[British Basketball League 2006-07|2006\u201307 season]] they won eight games in a row and by December found themselves joint top of the BBL.<ref>{{cite news| author = | title = Plymouth make it eight in a row | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/basketball/6178167.stm| accessdate = 2 May 2015 | publisher = BBC Sport | date=13 December 2006}}</ref> In the BBL Trophy final, at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]\u2019s [[MetroRadio Arena]] on 4 March 2007, Raiders defeated [[Newcastle Eagles]] 74\u201365 to win their first top-flight title.<ref>{{cite news| author = Rob Dugdale | title = Raiders lift BBL Trophy | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/basketball/6412079.stm | accessdate = 2 May 2015 | publisher = BBC Sport | date=4 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the league, Raiders constantly held a Play-off position for the majority of the season and though qualifying with ease, just missed out on home advantage with a 5th place finish.

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"[[Good Company (Queen song)|Good Company]]\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

Some of his popular singles include \"Mon c\u0153ur balance\", \"Je vous emmerde\", and \"Louxor j'adore\".\n\nAt the beginning of his career, his musical style was sometimes assimilated to the [[Easy listening|easy-listening]] movement by offering music with [[bossa nova]] accents accompanied by texts often morbid or anguished and tinged with humor, all sometimes interspersed with audio collages. He also turned to [[Rock music|rock]], a little bit of [[electronic music]] without ever setting aside to be part of the quirky French song. In 2010, he attracted people\u2019s attention as an actor by lending his features to [[Boris Vian]] in the biopic [[Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life|Gainsbourg, A Heroic Life]], from Joann Sfar. The following year, he was put forward with being the headliner in the offbeat comedy, ''I am a No Man's Land''. In 2015, he played head of state in ''Gaz de France''.\n\nAt the same time, he essentially became known as a quirky second role from French comedies: ''[[La Tour 2 contr\u00f4le infernale]]'' (2016), by [[\u00c9ric Judor]], ''Hibou'' (2016), by [[Ramzy Bedia]], ''[[We Are Family (2016 film)|We Are Family]]'' (2016), by Gabriel Julien-Laferri\u00e8re, ''[[Le Petit Spirou]]'' (2017), by Nicolas Bary, ''[[Sink or Swim (2018 film)|Sink or Swim]]'' (2018), by [[Gilles Lellouche]], and ''[[The World Is Yours (film)|The World is Yours]]'' (2018), by [[Romain Gavras]].\n\nAt the [[44th C\u00e9sar Awards]], he received the [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in ''[[Sink or Swim (2018 film)|Sink or Swim]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe has two sons, Billy (born 16 June 2011) and Alfred (born 8 August 2012), with [[Julie Depardieu]].\n\n==Success as singer-songwriter in the 1990s==\nIn November 1991, Katerine began his career. In 1992, he released Les Mariages Chinois, a first re-released album with an additional title, under the title Les Mariages chinois et la Relecture. Anxious and very unsure of his work, Katerine composes and records almost alone at home.\n \nIn 1994, he released the album L\u2019Education anglaise on which his sister (under the pseudonym Bruno) and his girlfriend Anne are singing. He begins to be recognized, out of the commercial circuit.\n \nIn 1995, he worked on his third album and had an important evolution during a year. He opens to other musicians and sings his own lyrics. The album Mes mauvaises fr\u00e9quentations comes out in 1996 and takes on a bigger dimension thanks to a richer orchestration and several voices. The album, which is very well received by the public and critics, is followed by a tour. He also works on the album of Mercedes Audras that will be released in 1996 and for which he is, for the first time, a director.\n \nIn 1997, he composed an album for two Anglo-Japanese singers, the Winchester Sisters and also participated in a disc where he met the [[jazz]] musicians of the group The Recyclers, with which he will work thereafter. He composes in parallel L\u2019homme \u00e0 trois mains and Les cr\u00e9atures. The first is interpreted and recorded as usual, only at home with derisory means, while the second is with the Recyclers, in more \"conventional\" conditions. The two albums are edited together and mark a real turning point in the career of Philippe Katerine.\n \nHe then plays the game of media and promotion, and the title Je vous emmerde is broadcast on the radio. The Recyclers who come from a different world fascinate him by their way of working and their relationship to improvisation. Katerine believes that this collaboration has allowed him to integrate new ways of working, and to integrate improvisation into his work method.\n\nIn 1999, he composed Une histoire d\u2019amour for [[Anna Karina]].

Some of his popular singles include \"Mon c\u0153ur balance\", \"Je vous emmerde\", and \"Louxor j'adore\".\n\nAt the beginning of his career, his musical style was sometimes assimilated to the [[Easy listening|easy-listening]] movement by offering music with [[bossa nova]] accents accompanied by texts often morbid or anguished and tinged with humor, all sometimes interspersed with audio collages. He also turned to [[Rock music|rock]], a little bit of [[electronic music]] without ever setting aside to be part of the quirky French song. In 2010, he attracted people\u2019s attention as an actor by lending his features to [[Boris Vian]] in the biopic [[Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life|Gainsbourg, A Heroic Life]], from Joann Sfar. The following year, he was put forward with being the headliner in the offbeat comedy, ''I am a No Man's Land''. In 2015, he played head of state in ''Gaz de France''.\n\nAt the same time, he essentially became known as a quirky second role from French comedies: ''[[La Tour 2 contr\u00f4le infernale]]'' (2016), by [[\u00c9ric Judor]], ''Hibou'' (2016), by [[Ramzy Bedia]], ''[[We Are Family (2016 film)|We Are Family]]'' (2016), by Gabriel Julien-Laferri\u00e8re, ''[[Le Petit Spirou]]'' (2017), by Nicolas Bary, ''[[Sink or Swim (2018 film)|Sink or Swim]]'' (2018), by [[Gilles Lellouche]], and ''[[The World Is Yours (film)|The World is Yours]]'' (2018), by [[Romain Gavras]].\n\nAt the [[44th C\u00e9sar Awards]], he received the [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in ''[[Sink or Swim (2018 film)|Sink or Swim]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe has two sons, Billy (born 16 June 2011) and Alfred (born 8 August 2012), with [[Julie Depardieu]].\n\n==Success as singer-songwriter in the 90\u2019s==\nIn November 1991, Katerine began his career. In 1992, he released Les Mariages Chinois, a first re-released album with an additional title, under the title Les Mariages chinois et la Relecture. Anxious and very unsure of his work, Katerine composes and records almost alone at home.\n \nIn 1994, he released the album L\u2019Education anglaise on which his sister (under the pseudonym Bruno) and his girlfriend Anne are singing. He begins to be recognized, out of the commercial circuit.\n \nIn 1995, he worked on his third album and had an important evolution during a year. He opens to other musicians and sings his own lyrics. The album Mes mauvaises fr\u00e9quentations comes out in 1996 and takes on a bigger dimension thanks to a richer orchestration and several voices. The album, which is very well received by the public and critics, is followed by a tour. He also works on the album of Mercedes Audras that will be released in 1996 and for which he is, for the first time, a director.\n \nIn 1997, he composed an album for two Anglo-Japanese singers, the Winchester Sisters and also participated in a disc where he met the [[jazz]] musicians of the group The Recyclers, with which he will work thereafter. He composes in parallel L\u2019homme \u00e0 trois mains and Les cr\u00e9atures. The first is interpreted and recorded as usual, only at home with derisory means, while the second is with the Recyclers, in more \"conventional\" conditions. The two albums are edited together and mark a real turning point in the career of Philippe Katerine.\n \nHe then plays the game of media and promotion, and the title Je vous emmerde is broadcast on the radio. The Recyclers who come from a different world fascinate him by their way of working and their relationship to improvisation. Katerine believes that this collaboration has allowed him to integrate new ways of working, and to integrate improvisation into his work method.\n\nIn 1999, he composed Une histoire d\u2019amour for [[Anna Karina]]. A triumphal tour follows with his favorite actress, a tour during which a tribute evening to Anna Karina is organized by the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que de Vend\u00e9e in La Roche-sur-Yon, with the presence of the actress and the Vend\u00e9e singer. The two artists then give a mini-concert before watching with the public the films [[Pierrot le Fou|Pierrot le fou]] of Jean-Luc Godard and [[Vivre ensemble]] of Anna Karina. He satiated his passion for cinema by participating in several films.\n\n==Discography==\n[[Image:Philippe katerine.jpg|thumb|Philippe Katerine]]\n\n===Studio albums===\n* ''Les mariages chinois'' (1991)\n* ''Les mariages chinois et la relecture'' (1993)\n* ''L'\u00e9ducation anglaise'' (1994)\n* ''Mes mauvaises fr\u00e9quentations'' (1996)\n* ''Les Cr\u00e9atures'' (1999)\n* ''L'homme \u00e0 trois mains'' (1999)\n* ''8\u00e8me ciel'' (2002)\n* ''Robots apr\u00e8s tout'' (2005)\n* ''Philippe Katerine'' (2010)\n* ''52 reprises dans l'espace'' (2010)<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/katerine-mn0000362216/discography |title=Katerine &#124; Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}</ref>\n* ''Magnum'' (2013)\n* ''Le film'' (2016)\n\n===Live albums===\n* ''Border Live + Studio Live'' (2007)\n* ''Floril\u00e8ge'' (2018)\n\n===Notable singles===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''Comme Jeannie Longo'' (1993)\n* ''Un apr\u00e8s-midi \u00e0 Paris'' (1994)\n* ''Le manteau de fourrure'' (1995)\n* ''Entre nous'' (1996)\n* ''Je vous emmerde'' (1999)\n* ''L'homme \u00e0 3 mains'' (1999)\n* ''J\u00e9sus Christ mon amour'' (2000)\n* ''Des \u00e9toiles'' (2002)\n* ''Mort \u00e0 la po\u00e9sie'' (2003)\n* ''1 Rue Jacquemot'' (2004)\n* ''Euro 04'' (Katerine & [[Helena Noguerra]]) (2004)\n* ''Louxor j'adore'' (2006)\n* ''100% VIP'' (2006)\n* ''78-2008'' (2007)\n* ''Le grand sommeil'' ([[\u00c9tienne Daho]] & Katerine) (2009)\n* ''Extra Terrestre'' ([[Arielle Dombasle]] & Katerine) (2009)\n* ''La banane'' (2010)\n* ''T\u00e9-l\u00e9-phone'' (remixes by [[Stromae]] & [[The Shoes (French band)|The Shoes]]) (2010)\n* ''Sexy Cool'' (2013)\n* ''Eff\u00e9min\u00e9'' (2014)\n* ''Moment parfait'' (2016)\n* ''Compliqu\u00e9'' (2016)\n* ''Y'a d'la rhumba dans l'air'' (2017)\n* ''85 Rouge et noir'' (Katerine & MC Circulaire) (2018)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Filmography==\n\n=== Actor ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
