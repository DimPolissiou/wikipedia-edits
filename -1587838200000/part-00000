Dewey gave his famous command, \"You may fire when you are ready, Gridley\".<ref name=\"DANFS\" /> At the conclusion of the battle, Gridley was not in a condition to celebrate, suffering from dysentery and what appears to have been liver cancer. The heat and stress of the conning tower further weakened him. Dewey would have relieved him of command had not Gridley protested.\n\n===Last days===\nSeveral weeks later, he was sent home. On May 25, Gridley was to begin his journey home. One crewman recorded the event as follows:\n<blockquote>\nHe came up out of his cabin dressed in civilian clothes and was met by the rear admiral [Dewey] who extended him a most cordial hand. A look of troubled disappointment flitted across the captain's brow, but vanished when he stepped to the head of the gangway and, looking, over saw, not the launch, but a twelve-oared cutter manned entirely by officers of the ''Olympia''. There were men in the boat who has not pulled a stroke for a quarter of a century. Old Glory was at the stern and a captain's silken coach-whip at the bow; and when Captain Gridley, beloved alike by officers and men, entered the boat, it was up oars, and all that, just as though they were common sailors who were to row him over to the Zafiro. When he sat down upon the handsome boat-cloth that was spread for him, he bowed his head, and his hands hid his face as First-Lieutenant Reese, acting coxswain, ordered, 'Shove off; out oars; give away!' Later in the day the lookout on the bridge reported, 'Zafiro under way sir,' and the deck officer passed on the word until a little twitter from Pat Murray's pipe brought all the other bo's'ns around him, and in concert they sang out, 'Stand by to man the rigging!' Not the ''Olympia'' alone, but every other ship in the squadron dressed and manned, and the last we ever saw of our dear captain he was sitting on a chair out on the Zafiro's quarter-deck, apparently listening to the [''Olympia's''] old band play.\n</blockquote>\n\nGridley was physically spent, and his health began to sink even faster once he was finally released from the strain of command. He was transferred from the ''Zafiro'' to the commercial steamer ''[[SS Coptic (1881)|Coptic]]'' on May 27, but he had to be taken aboard on a stretcher. He knew that his condition was grave and wrote simply, \"I think I am done for it, personally.\"\n\n===Death and burial===\nAboard the ''Coptic'', on June 5, 1898, Gridley died while the vessel was in Kobe, Japan.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nHis body was cremated and sent home.

The book was first published in 1555 and has rarely been out of print since his death.\n\nNostradamus's family was originally [[Judaism|Jewish]], but had converted to [[Catholic Christianity]] before he was born. He studied at the [[University of Avignon]], but was forced to leave after just over a year when the university closed due to an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. He worked as an [[apothecary]] for several years before entering the [[University of Montpellier]], hoping to earn a [[doctorate]], but was almost immediately [[Expulsion (education)|expelled]] after his work as an apothecary (a manual trade forbidden by university statutes) was discovered. He first married in 1531, but his wife and two children died in 1534 during another plague outbreak. He fought alongside doctors against the plague before remarrying to Anne Ponsarde, with whom he had six children. He wrote an [[almanac]] for 1550 and, as a result of its success, continued writing them for future years as he began working as an [[Astrology|astrologer]] for various wealthy patrons. [[Catherine de' Medici]] became one of his foremost supporters. His ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'', published in 1555, relied heavily on historical and literary [[precedent]], and initially received mixed reception. He did not suffer from gout because it didn't exist. He suffered from severe [[gout]] toward the end of his life, which eventually developed into [[edema]]. He died on 2 July 1566. Many popular authors have retold [[apocrypha]]l legends about his life.\n\nIn the years since the publication of his ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'', Nostradamus has attracted many supporters, who, along with much of the [[Mass media|popular press]], credit him with having accurately predicted many major world events.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010}}{{sfn|Benazra|1990}} Most academic sources reject the notion that Nostradamus had any genuine supernatural prophetic abilities and maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate).{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=150-2}} These academics argue that Nostradamus's predictions are characteristically vague, meaning they could be applied to virtually anything, and are useless for determining whether their author had any real prophetic powers. They also point out that English translations of his quatrains are almost always of extremely poor quality, based on later manuscripts, produced by authors with little knowledge of [[Middle French|sixteenth-century French]], and often deliberately mistranslated to make the prophecies fit whatever events the translator believed they were supposed to have predicted.\n\n( This is not a good source)\n\n==Life==\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Nostradamus birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Nostradamus's claimed birthplace before its recent renovation, [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]]]]\n[[File:Nostradamus-plaque.gif|thumb|Municipal plaque on the claimed birthplace of Nostradamus in St-R\u00e9my, France, describing him as an 'astrologer' and giving his birth-date as 14 December 1503 (Julian Calendar)]]\n\nNostradamus was born on either 14 or 21 December 1503 in [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]], [[Provence]], France,{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} where his claimed birthplace still exists, and baptized Michel.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} He was one of at least nine children of notary Jaume (or Jacques) de Nostredame and Reyni\u00e8re, granddaughter of Pierre de Saint-R\u00e9my who worked as a [[physician]] in Saint-R\u00e9my.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} Jaume's family had originally been [[Jewish people|Jewish]], but his father, Cresquas, a grain and money dealer based in [[Avignon]], had converted to Catholicism around 1459\u201360, taking the Christian name \"Pierre\" and the surname \"Nostredame\" (Our Lady), the saint on whose day his conversion was solemnised.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} The earliest ancestor who can be identified on the paternal side is Astruge of [[Carcassonne]], who died about 1420. Michel's known siblings included Delphine, Jean (c. 1507\u201377), Pierre, Hector, Louis, Bertrand, Jean II (born 1522) and Antoine (born 1523).{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=143\u2013146}}{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=32\u201351}}{{sfn|Lemesurier|1999|p=24\u201325}}\nLittle else is known about his childhood, although there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. R\u00e9my<ref name = \"ref4\">De Chavigny, J. A.: ''La premi\u00e8re face du Janus fran\u00e7ois'' (Lyon, 1594)</ref> \u2014 a tradition which is somewhat undermined by the fact that the latter disappears from the historical record after 1504, when the child was only one year old.{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=545}}\n\n===Student years===\nAt the age of 14{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010}} Nostradamus entered the [[University of Avignon]] to study for his baccalaureate. After little more than a year (when he would have studied the regular [[trivium (education)|trivium]] of [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] rather than the later [[quadrivium]] of [[geometry]], [[arithmetic]], music, and [[astronomy]]/[[astrology]]), he was forced to leave Avignon when the university closed its doors during an outbreak of the plague. After leaving Avignon, Nostradamus, by his own account, traveled the countryside for eight years from 1521 researching herbal remedies. In 1529, after some years as an [[apothecary]], he entered the [[University of Montpellier]] to study for a doctorate in medicine. He was expelled shortly afterwards by the student ''procurator'', [[Guillaume Rondelet]], when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a \"manual trade\" expressly banned by the university statutes, and had been slandering doctors.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=48\u201349}} The expulsion document, ''BIU Montpellier, Register S 2 folio 87'', still exists in the faculty library.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=2}} However, some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him \"Doctor\". After his expulsion, Nostradamus continued working, presumably still as an [[apothecary]], and became famous for creating a \"rose pill\" that purportedly protected against the plague.<ref name = \"ref6\">Nostradamus, Michel, ''Traite des fardemens et des confitures'', 1555, 1556, 1557</ref>\n\n===Marriage and healing work===\n[[File:Nostradamuss house at Salon-de-Provence.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Nostradamus's house at [[Salon-de-Provence]], as reconstructed after the [[1909 Provence earthquake]]]]\n\nIn 1531 Nostradamus was invited by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Jules-C\u00e9sar Scaliger]], a leading [[Polymath|Renaissance scholar]], to come to [[Agen]].{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=60\u201391}} There he married a woman of uncertain name (possibly Henriette d'Encausse), who bore him two children.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=61}} In 1534 his wife and children died, presumably from the plague. After their deaths, he continued to travel, passing through France and possibly [[Italy]].{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=62\u201371}}\n\nOn his return in 1545, he assisted the prominent physician [[Louis Serre (physician)|Louis Serre]] in his fight against a major plague outbreak in [[Marseille]], and then tackled further outbreaks of disease on his own in [[Salon-de-Provence]] and in the regional capital, [[Aix-en-Provence]]. Finally, in 1547, he settled in Salon-de-Provence in the house which exists today, where he married a rich widow named Anne Ponsarde, with whom he had six children\u2014three daughters and three sons.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=110\u2013133}}  Between 1556 and 1567 he and his wife acquired a one-thirteenth share in a huge canal project, organised by [[Adam de Craponne]], to create the [[Canal de Craponne]] to irrigate the largely waterless [[Salon-de-Provence]] and the nearby D\u00e9sert de la [[Crau]] from the river [[Durance]].{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=130, 132, 369}}\n\n===Occultism===\nAfter another visit to Italy, Nostradamus began to move away from medicine and toward the \"occult\", although evidence suggests that he remained a Catholic and was opposed to the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]].{{sfn|''Nostradamus for Dummies'' 2005, pp. 66\u201368}} But it seems he could have dabbled in [[horoscopes]], [[necromancy]], [[scrying]], and good luck [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]] such as the hawthorn rod.{{sfn|''Lives of the Necromancers'' 1835, pp. 251\u2013252}}{{sfn|''Nostradamus: The Good News'' 2007, pp. 17\u201318}} Following popular trends, he wrote an [[almanac]] for 1550, for the first time in print Latinising his name to Nostradamus. He was so encouraged by the almanac's success that he decided to write one or more annually. Taken together, they are known to have contained at least 6,338 prophecies,{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=23\u201325}}{{sfn|Chevignard|1999}} as well as at least eleven annual calendars, all of them starting on 1 January and not, as is sometimes supposed, in March. It was mainly in response to the almanacs that the nobility and other prominent persons from far away soon started asking for horoscopes and \"psychic\" advice from him, though he generally expected his clients to supply the birth charts on which these would be based, rather than calculating them himself as a professional astrologer would have done. When obliged to attempt this himself on the basis of the published tables of the day, he frequently made errors and failed to adjust the figures for his clients' place or time of birth.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=59\u201364}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=326\u2013399}}{{efn|Refer to the analysis of these charts by Brind'Amour, 1993, and compare Gruber's comprehensive critique of Nostradamus's horoscope for Crown Prince Rudolph Maximilian.}}{{sfn|Gruber|2003}}\n\nHe then began his project of writing a book of one thousand mainly French quatrains, which constitute the largely undated prophecies for which he is most famous today. Feeling vulnerable to opposition on religious grounds,{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=125}} however, he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using \"[[Virgil]]ianised\" syntax, word games and a mixture of other languages such as [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], Italian, [[Latin]], and [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]].{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=99\u2013100}} For technical reasons connected with their publication in three installments (the publisher of the third and last installment seems to have been unwilling to start it in the middle of a \"Century,\" or book of 100 verses), the last fifty-eight quatrains of the seventh \"Century\" have not survived in any extant edition.\n\n[[File:Nostradamus CI 1.jpg|thumb|Century I, Quatrain 1 in the 1555 Lyon Bonhomme edition]]\n\nThe quatrains, published in a book titled ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'' (The Prophecies), received a mixed reaction when they were published. Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil, a fake, or insane, while many of the elite evidently thought otherwise. [[Catherine de' Medici]], wife of King [[Henry II of France]], was one of Nostradamus's greatest admirers. After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain them and to draw up horoscopes for her children. At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded,{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=83}} but by the time of his death in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King [[Charles IX of France]].\n\nSome accounts of Nostradamus's life state that he was afraid of being persecuted for [[Christian heresy|heresy]] by the [[Inquisition]], but neither [[prophecy]] nor [[astrology]] fell in this bracket, and he would have been in danger only if he had practised [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for anti-Catholic views.<ref name=\"Wilson2014\">{{cite book|author=Ian Wilson|title=Nostradamus: The Man Behind the Prophecies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqvcAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT62|date=1 April 2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-6737-6|pages=62 ff}}</ref> His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=124}}\n\n===Final years and death===\n[[File:Nostradamus epitaph.jpg|thumb|Nostradamus's current tomb in the [[Salon-de-Provence#Coll.C3.A9giale Saint Laurent|Coll\u00e9giale Saint-Laurent]] in [[Salon-de-Provence]] in the south of France, into which his scattered remains were transferred after 1789.]]\n\n[[File:140609-Salon-Nostradamus.jpg|thumb|Nostradamus statue in Salon-de-Provence]]\nBy 1566, Nostradamus's [[gout]], which had plagued him painfully for many years and made movement very difficult, turned into [[edema]]. In late June he summoned his lawyer to draw up an extensive will bequeathing his property plus 3,444 crowns (around US$300,000 today), minus a few debts, to his wife pending her remarriage, in trust for her sons pending their twenty-fifth birthdays and her daughters pending their marriages. This was followed by a much shorter [[codicil (will)|codicil]].{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=102\u2013106}} On the evening of 1 July, he is alleged to have told his secretary Jean de Chavigny, \"You will not find me alive at sunrise.\" The next morning he was reportedly found dead, lying on the floor next to his bed and a bench (Presage 141 [originally 152] ''for November 1567'', as posthumously edited by Chavigny to fit what happened).{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=137}}{{sfn|Chevignard|1999}} He was buried in the local Franciscan chapel in Salon (part of it now incorporated into the restaurant ''La Brocherie'') but re-interred during the [[French Revolution]] in the Coll\u00e9giale Saint-Laurent, where his tomb remains to this day.{{sfn|Leroy|1993}}\n\n==Works== <!-- Courtesy note per [{WP:RSECT]]: [[The Prophecies]] redirects here. -->\n[[File:Nostradamus prophecies.jpg|thumb|right|Copy of [[Theophilus de Garenci\u00e8res|Garenci\u00e8res]]' 1672 English translation of the ''Prophecies'', located in The P.I. Nixon Medical History Library of The [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]].]]\n\nIn ''The Prophecies'' Nostradamus compiled his collection of major, long-term predictions. The first installment was published in 1555 and contained 353 [[quatrain]]s. The third edition, with three hundred new quatrains, was reportedly printed in 1558, but now survives as only part of the omnibus edition that was published after his death in 1568. This version contains one unrhymed and 941 rhymed [[quatrain]]s, grouped into nine sets of 100 and one of 42, called \"Centuries\".\n\nGiven printing practices at the time (which included type-setting from dictation), no two editions turned out to be identical, and it is relatively rare to find even two copies that are exactly the same. Certainly there is no warrant for assuming\u2014as would-be \"code-breakers\" are prone to do\u2014that either the spellings or the punctuation of any edition are Nostradamus's originals.{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=14, 435}}\n\nThe ''Almanacs'', by far the most popular of his works,{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=22-33}} were published annually from 1550 until his death. He often published two or three in a year, entitled either ''Almanachs'' (detailed predictions), ''Prognostications'' or ''Presages'' (more generalised predictions).\n\nNostradamus was not only a diviner, but a professional healer. It is known that he wrote at least two books on medical science. One was an extremely free translation (or rather a paraphrase) of ''The Protreptic'' of [[Galen]] (''Paraphrase de C. GALIEN, sus l'Exhortation de Menodote aux estudes des bonnes Artz, mesmement Medicine''), and in his so-called ''[[Trait\u00e9 des fardemens]]'' (basically a medical cookbook containing, once again, materials borrowed mainly from others), he included a description of the methods he used to treat the plague, including bloodletting, none of which apparently worked.{{sfn|Nostradamus|1555/6/7|p=11}} The same book also describes the preparation of cosmetics.\n\nA manuscript normally known as the ''[[Orus Apollo]]'' also exists in the [[Lyon]] municipal library, where upwards of 2,000 original documents relating to Nostradamus are stored under the aegis of Michel Chomarat. It is a purported translation of an ancient Greek work on [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] based on later Latin versions, all of them unfortunately ignorant of the true meanings of the ancient Egyptian script, which was not correctly deciphered until [[Champollion]] in the 19th century.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=183}}\n\nSince his death, only the ''Prophecies'' have continued to be popular, but in this case they have been quite extraordinarily so. Over two hundred editions of them have appeared in that time, together with over 2,000 commentaries. Their [[Nostradamus in popular culture|persistence in popular culture]] seems to be partly because their vagueness and lack of dating make it easy to quote them selectively after every major dramatic event and retrospectively claim them as \"hits\".{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144-5}}\n\n==Origins of ''The Prophecies''==\n[[File:Dr. Garenci\u00e8res, the Translator of Nostradamus (Robert Chambers, p.12, 1832) - Copy.jpg|thumb|[[Theophilus de Garenci\u00e8res]], the first English translator of the ''Prophecies''<ref name=Chambers>{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=Robert|title=The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar, Including Anecdote, Biography, & History, Curiosities of Literature and Oddities of Human Life and Character, Volume 2|date=1832|publisher=W. & R.

Hence the many predictions involving ancient figures such as [[Sulla]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Nero]], and others, as well as his descriptions of \"battles in the clouds\" and \"frogs falling from the sky\".{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003b|loc=''passim''}} Astrology itself is mentioned only twice in Nostradamus's ''Preface'' and 41 times in the ''Centuries'' themselves, but more frequently in his dedicatory ''[[Letter to King Henry II]]''. In the last quatrain of his sixth ''century'' he specifically attacks astrologers.\n\nHis historical sources include easily identifiable passages from [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]]' ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Plutarch]] and other classical historians, as well as from medieval chroniclers such as [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] and [[Jean Froissart]]. Many of his astrological references are taken almost word for word from [[Richard Roussat]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Livre de l'estat et mutations des temps}}'' of 1549\u201350.\n\nOne of his major prophetic sources was evidently the ''[[Mirabilis Liber]]'' of 1522, which contained a range of prophecies by [[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius|Pseudo-Methodius]], the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]], [[Joachim of Fiore]], [[Savonarola]] and others (his ''Preface'' contains 24 biblical quotations, all but two in the order used by Savonarola). This book had enjoyed considerable success in the 1520s, when it went through half a dozen editions, but did not sustain its influence, perhaps owing to its mostly Latin text, Gothic script and many difficult abbreviations. Nostradamus was one of the first to re-paraphrase these prophecies in French, which may explain why they are credited to him. Modern views of plagiarism did not apply in the 16th century; authors frequently copied and paraphrased passages without acknowledgement, especially from the classics.

Roberts]]' ''The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus'' of 1947, reprinted at least seven times during the next forty years, which contained both transcriptions and translations, with brief commentaries. This was followed in 1961 (reprinted in 1982) by Edgar Leoni's ''Nostradamus and His Prophecies''. After that came [[Erika Cheetham]]'s ''The Prophecies of Nostradamus'', incorporating a reprint of the posthumous 1568 edition, which was reprinted, revised and republished several times from 1973 onwards, latterly as ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus''. This served as the basis for the documentary ''[[The Man Who Saw Tomorrow]]'' and both did indeed mention possible generalised future attacks on New York (via [[nuclear weapon]]s), though not specifically on the World Trade Center or on any particular date.<ref>See, for example, Cheetham, Erika, ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus'', Futura, 1990, p.373</ref>\n\nA two-part translation of Jean-Charles de Fontbrune's ''Nostradamus: historien et proph\u00e8te'' was published in 1980, and John Hogue has published a number of books on Nostradamus from about 1987, including ''Nostradamus and the Millennium: Predictions of the Future'', ''Nostradamus: The Complete Prophecies'' (1999) and ''Nostradamus: A Life and Myth'' (2003). In 1992 one commentator who claimed to be able to contact Nostradamus under hypnosis even had him \"interpreting\" his own verse X.6 (a prediction specifically about floods in southern France around the city of N\u00eemes and people taking refuge in its ''collosse'', or Colosseum, a Roman amphitheatre now known as the ''Ar\u00e8nes'') as a prediction of an undated ''attack on the Pentagon'', despite the historical seer's clear statement in his dedicatory letter to King Henri II that his prophecies were about Europe, North Africa and part of Asia Minor.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=145|Phophecy Location Map=http://www.secret-vault.co.uk/nostradamus/locations.html}}\n\nWith the exception of Roberts, these books and their many popular imitators were almost unanimous not merely about Nostradamus's powers of prophecy but also in inventing intriguing aspects of his purported biography: that he had been a descendant of the Israelite tribe of [[Issachar]]; he had been educated by his grandfathers, who had both been physicians to the court of [[Rene I of Naples|Good King Ren\u00e9]] of [[Provence]]; he had attended [[Montpellier]] University in 1525 to gain his first degree; after returning there in 1529, he had successfully taken his medical doctorate; he had gone on to lecture in the Medical Faculty there, until his views became too unpopular; he had supported the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the universe; he had travelled to the Habsburg Netherlands, where he had composed prophecies at the abbey of Orval; in the course of his travels, he had performed a variety of prodigies, including identifying future Pope, [[Sixtus V]], who was then only a seminary monk. He is credited with having successfully cured the [[Bubonic plague|Plague]] at [[Aix-en-Provence]] and elsewhere; he had engaged in [[scrying]], using either a magic mirror or a bowl of water; he had been joined by his secretary Chavigny at Easter 1554; having published the first installment of his ''Proph\u00e9ties'', he had been summoned by Queen [[Catherine de' Medici]] to Paris in 1556 to discuss with her his prophecy at quatrain I.35 that her husband [[King Henri II]] would be killed in a duel; he had examined the royal children at [[Blois]]; he had bequeathed to his son a \"lost book\" of his own prophetic paintings;{{efn|Actually the 13th\u201314th century ''[[Vaticinia de Summis Pontificibus]]'' in a misascribed version sometimes referred to as the ''[[Vaticinia Nostradami]]''}} he had been buried standing up; and he had been found, when dug up at the French Revolution, to be wearing a medallion bearing the exact date of his disinterment.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=26\u201345}} This was first recorded by [[Samuel Pepys]] as early as 1667, long before the [[French Revolution]].

The publication in 1983 of Nostradamus's private correspondence{{sfn|Dup\u00e8be|1983}} and, during succeeding years, of the original editions of 1555 and 1557 discovered by Chomarat and Benazra, together with the unearthing of much original archival material{{sfn|Leroy|1993}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993}} revealed that much that was claimed about Nostradamus did not fit the documented facts.

Most of them had evidently been based on unsourced rumours relayed as fact by much later commentators, such as Jaubert (1656), Guynaud (1693) and Bareste (1840), on modern misunderstandings of the 16th-century French texts, or on pure invention. Even the often-advanced suggestion that quatrain I.35 had successfully prophesied King Henry II's death did not actually appear in print for the first time until 1614, 55 years after the event.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=28\u201330}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=267}}\n\nSkeptics such as [[James Randi]] suggest that his reputation as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as \"retroactive clairvoyance\" ([[postdiction]]). No Nostradamus quatrain is known to have been interpreted as predicting a specific event before it occurred, other than in vague, general terms that could equally apply to any number of other events.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=23}} This even applies to quatrains that contain specific dates, such as III.77, which predicts \"in 1727, in October, the king of Persia [shall be] captured by those of Egypt\"\u2014a prophecy that has, as ever, been interpreted retrospectively in the light of later events, in this case as though it presaged the known peace treaty between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Persia]] of that year;<ref>See, for example, Cheetham, Erika, ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus'', Futura, 1990, pp. 208\u2013209</ref> Egypt was also an important [[Egypt Eyalet|Ottoman territory]] at this time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HxKs-NHRgUoC&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=nostradamus+1727+ottoman+empire#v=onepage&q=nostradamus%201727%20ottoman%20empire&f=false|title=Nostradamus and Prophecies of the Next Millennium|isbn=9788171820146|last1=Sharma|first1=A.

Even Leoni accepted on page 115 that he had never seen an original edition, and on earlier pages he indicated that much of his biographical material was unsourced.{{sfn|Leoni|1961|p=115}}\n\nNone of this research and criticism was originally known to most of the English-language commentators, by dint of the dates when they were writing and, to some extent, the language in which it was written.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=144\u2013148}} Hogue was in a position to take advantage of it, but it was only in 2003 that he accepted that some of his earlier biographical material had in fact been apocryphal. Meanwhile, some of the more recent sources listed (Lemesurier, Gruber, Wilson) have been particularly scathing about later attempts by some lesser-known authors and Internet enthusiasts to extract alleged hidden meanings from the texts, whether with the aid of anagrams, numerical codes, graphs or otherwise.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144\u2013148}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Nostradamus in popular culture}}\n\nThe prophecies retold and expanded by Nostradamus  figured largely in [[popular culture]] in the 20th and 21st centuries. As well as being the subject of hundreds of books (both fiction and nonfiction), Nostradamus's life has been depicted in several films and videos, and his life and writings continue to be a subject of media interest.\n\nThere have also been several well-known Internet [[hoax]]es, where quatrains in the style of Nostradamus have been circulated by e-mail as the real thing.

The book was first published in 1555 and has rarely been out of print since his death.\n\nNostradamus's family was originally [[Judaism|Jewish]], but had converted to [[Catholic Christianity]] before he was born. He studied at the [[University of Avignon]], but was forced to leave after just over a year when the university closed due to an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. He worked as an [[apothecary]] for several years before entering the [[University of Montpellier]], hoping to earn a [[doctorate]], but was almost immediately [[Expulsion (education)|expelled]] after his work as an apothecary (a manual trade forbidden by university statutes) was discovered. He first married in 1531, but his wife and two children died in 1534 during another plague outbreak. He fought alongside doctors against the plague before remarrying to Anne Ponsarde, with whom he had six children. He wrote an [[almanac]] for 1550 and, as a result of its success, continued writing them for future years as he began working as an [[Astrology|astrologer]] for various wealthy patrons. [[Catherine de' Medici]] became one of his foremost supporters. His ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'', published in 1555, relied heavily on historical and literary [[precedent]], and initially received mixed reception. He suffered from severe [[gout]] toward the end of his life, which eventually developed into [[edema]]. He died on 2 July 1566. Many popular authors have retold [[apocrypha]]l legends about his life.\n\nIn the years since the publication of his ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'', Nostradamus has attracted many supporters, who, along with much of the [[Mass media|popular press]], credit him with having accurately predicted many major world events.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010}}{{sfn|Benazra|1990}} Most academic sources reject the notion that Nostradamus had any genuine supernatural prophetic abilities and maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate).{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=150-2}} These academics argue that Nostradamus's predictions are characteristically vague, meaning they could be applied to virtually anything, and are useless for determining whether their author had any real prophetic powers. They also point out that English translations of his quatrains are almost always of extremely poor quality, based on later manuscripts, produced by authors with little knowledge of [[Middle French|sixteenth-century French]], and often deliberately mistranslated to make the prophecies fit whatever events the translator believed they were supposed to have predicted.\n\n==Life==\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Nostradamus birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Nostradamus's claimed birthplace before its recent renovation, [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]]]]\n[[File:Nostradamus-plaque.gif|thumb|Municipal plaque on the claimed birthplace of Nostradamus in St-R\u00e9my, France, describing him as an 'astrologer' and giving his birth-date as 14 December 1503 (Julian Calendar)]]\n\nNostradamus was born on either 14 or 21 December 1503 in [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]], [[Provence]], France,{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} where his claimed birthplace still exists, and baptized Michel.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} He was one of at least nine children of notary Jaume (or Jacques) de Nostredame and Reyni\u00e8re, granddaughter of Pierre de Saint-R\u00e9my who worked as a [[physician]] in Saint-R\u00e9my.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} Jaume's family had originally been [[Jewish people|Jewish]], but his father, Cresquas, a grain and money dealer based in [[Avignon]], had converted to Catholicism around 1459\u201360, taking the Christian name \"Pierre\" and the surname \"Nostredame\" (Our Lady), the saint on whose day his conversion was solemnised.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} The earliest ancestor who can be identified on the paternal side is Astruge of [[Carcassonne]], who died about 1420. Michel's known siblings included Delphine, Jean (c. 1507\u201377), Pierre, Hector, Louis, Bertrand, Jean II (born 1522) and Antoine (born 1523).{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=143\u2013146}}{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=32\u201351}}{{sfn|Lemesurier|1999|p=24\u201325}}\nLittle else is known about his childhood, although there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. R\u00e9my<ref name = \"ref4\">De Chavigny, J.

After little more than a year (when he would have studied the regular [[trivium (education)|trivium]] of [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] rather than the later [[quadrivium]] of [[geometry]], [[arithmetic]], music, and [[astronomy]]/[[astrology]]), he was forced to leave Avignon when the university closed its doors during an outbreak of the plague. After leaving Avignon, Nostradamus, by his own account, traveled the countryside for eight years from 1521 researching herbal remedies. In 1529, after some years as an [[apothecary]], he entered the [[University of Montpellier]] to study for a doctorate in medicine. He was expelled shortly afterwards by the student ''procurator'', [[Guillaume Rondelet]], when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a \"manual trade\" expressly banned by the university statutes, and had been slandering doctors.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=48\u201349}} The expulsion document, ''BIU Montpellier, Register S 2 folio 87'', still exists in the faculty library.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=2}} However, some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him \"Doctor\". After his expulsion, Nostradamus continued working, presumably still as an [[apothecary]], and became famous for creating a \"rose pill\" that purportedly protected against the plague.<ref name = \"ref6\">Nostradamus, Michel, ''Traite des fardemens et des confitures'', 1555, 1556, 1557</ref>\n\n===Marriage and healing work===\n[[File:Nostradamuss house at Salon-de-Provence.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Nostradamus's house at [[Salon-de-Provence]], as reconstructed after the [[1909 Provence earthquake]]]]\n\nIn 1531 Nostradamus was invited by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Jules-C\u00e9sar Scaliger]], a leading [[Polymath|Renaissance scholar]], to come to [[Agen]].{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=60\u201391}} There he married a woman of uncertain name (possibly Henriette d'Encausse), who bore him two children.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=61}} In 1534 his wife and children died, presumably from the plague. After their deaths, he continued to travel, passing through France and possibly [[Italy]].{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=62\u201371}}\n\nOn his return in 1545, he assisted the prominent physician [[Louis Serre (physician)|Louis Serre]] in his fight against a major plague outbreak in [[Marseille]], and then tackled further outbreaks of disease on his own in [[Salon-de-Provence]] and in the regional capital, [[Aix-en-Provence]]. Finally, in 1547, he settled in Salon-de-Provence in the house which exists today, where he married a rich widow named Anne Ponsarde, with whom he had six children\u2014three daughters and three sons.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=110\u2013133}}  Between 1556 and 1567 he and his wife acquired a one-thirteenth share in a huge canal project, organised by [[Adam de Craponne]], to create the [[Canal de Craponne]] to irrigate the largely waterless [[Salon-de-Provence]] and the nearby D\u00e9sert de la [[Crau]] from the river [[Durance]].{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=130, 132, 369}}\n\n===Occultism===\nAfter another visit to Italy, Nostradamus began to move away from medicine and toward the \"occult\", although evidence suggests that he remained a Catholic and was opposed to the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]].{{sfn|''Nostradamus for Dummies'' 2005, pp. 66\u201368}} But it seems he could have dabbled in [[horoscopes]], [[necromancy]], [[scrying]], and good luck [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]] such as the hawthorn rod.{{sfn|''Lives of the Necromancers'' 1835, pp. 251\u2013252}}{{sfn|''Nostradamus: The Good News'' 2007, pp. 17\u201318}} Following popular trends, he wrote an [[almanac]] for 1550, for the first time in print Latinising his name to Nostradamus. He was so encouraged by the almanac's success that he decided to write one or more annually. Taken together, they are known to have contained at least 6,338 prophecies,{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=23\u201325}}{{sfn|Chevignard|1999}} as well as at least eleven annual calendars, all of them starting on 1 January and not, as is sometimes supposed, in March. It was mainly in response to the almanacs that the nobility and other prominent persons from far away soon started asking for horoscopes and \"psychic\" advice from him, though he generally expected his clients to supply the birth charts on which these would be based, rather than calculating them himself as a professional astrologer would have done. When obliged to attempt this himself on the basis of the published tables of the day, he frequently made errors and failed to adjust the figures for his clients' place or time of birth.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=59\u201364}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=326\u2013399}}{{efn|Refer to the analysis of these charts by Brind'Amour, 1993, and compare Gruber's comprehensive critique of Nostradamus's horoscope for Crown Prince Rudolph Maximilian.}}{{sfn|Gruber|2003}}\n\nHe then began his project of writing a book of one thousand mainly French quatrains, which constitute the largely undated prophecies for which he is most famous today. Feeling vulnerable to opposition on religious grounds,{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=125}} however, he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using \"[[Virgil]]ianised\" syntax, word games and a mixture of other languages such as [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], Italian, [[Latin]], and [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]].{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=99\u2013100}} For technical reasons connected with their publication in three installments (the publisher of the third and last installment seems to have been unwilling to start it in the middle of a \"Century,\" or book of 100 verses), the last fifty-eight quatrains of the seventh \"Century\" have not survived in any extant edition.\n\n[[File:Nostradamus CI 1.jpg|thumb|Century I, Quatrain 1 in the 1555 Lyon Bonhomme edition]]\n\nThe quatrains, published in a book titled ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'' (The Prophecies), received a mixed reaction when they were published. Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil, a fake, or insane, while many of the elite evidently thought otherwise. [[Catherine de' Medici]], wife of King [[Henry II of France]], was one of Nostradamus's greatest admirers. After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain them and to draw up horoscopes for her children. At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded,{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=83}} but by the time of his death in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King [[Charles IX of France]].\n\nSome accounts of Nostradamus's life state that he was afraid of being persecuted for [[Christian heresy|heresy]] by the [[Inquisition]], but neither [[prophecy]] nor [[astrology]] fell in this bracket, and he would have been in danger only if he had practised [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for anti-Catholic views.<ref name=\"Wilson2014\">{{cite book|author=Ian Wilson|title=Nostradamus: The Man Behind the Prophecies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqvcAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT62|date=1 April 2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-6737-6|pages=62 ff}}</ref> His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=124}}\n\n===Final years and death===\n[[File:Nostradamus epitaph.jpg|thumb|Nostradamus's current tomb in the [[Salon-de-Provence#Coll.C3.A9giale Saint Laurent|Coll\u00e9giale Saint-Laurent]] in [[Salon-de-Provence]] in the south of France, into which his scattered remains were transferred after 1789.]]\n\n[[File:140609-Salon-Nostradamus.jpg|thumb|Nostradamus statue in Salon-de-Provence]]\nBy 1566, Nostradamus's [[gout]], which had plagued him painfully for many years and made movement very difficult, turned into [[edema]]. In late June he summoned his lawyer to draw up an extensive will bequeathing his property plus 3,444 crowns (around US$300,000 today), minus a few debts, to his wife pending her remarriage, in trust for her sons pending their twenty-fifth birthdays and her daughters pending their marriages.

This version contains one unrhymed and 941 rhymed [[quatrain]]s, grouped into nine sets of 100 and one of 42, called \"Centuries\".\n\nGiven printing practices at the time (which included type-setting from dictation), no two editions turned out to be identical, and it is relatively rare to find even two copies that are exactly the same. Certainly there is no warrant for assuming\u2014as would-be \"code-breakers\" are prone to do\u2014that either the spellings or the punctuation of any edition are Nostradamus's originals.{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=14, 435}}\n\nThe ''Almanacs'', by far the most popular of his works,{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=22-33}} were published annually from 1550 until his death. He often published two or three in a year, entitled either ''Almanachs'' (detailed predictions), ''Prognostications'' or ''Presages'' (more generalised predictions).\n\nNostradamus was not only a diviner, but a professional healer. It is known that he wrote at least two books on medical science. One was an extremely free translation (or rather a paraphrase) of ''The Protreptic'' of [[Galen]] (''Paraphrase de C. GALIEN, sus l'Exhortation de Menodote aux estudes des bonnes Artz, mesmement Medicine''), and in his so-called ''[[Trait\u00e9 des fardemens]]'' (basically a medical cookbook containing, once again, materials borrowed mainly from others), he included a description of the methods he used to treat the plague, including bloodletting, none of which apparently worked.{{sfn|Nostradamus|1555/6/7|p=11}} The same book also describes the preparation of cosmetics.\n\nA manuscript normally known as the ''[[Orus Apollo]]'' also exists in the [[Lyon]] municipal library, where upwards of 2,000 original documents relating to Nostradamus are stored under the aegis of Michel Chomarat. It is a purported translation of an ancient Greek work on [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] based on later Latin versions, all of them unfortunately ignorant of the true meanings of the ancient Egyptian script, which was not correctly deciphered until [[Champollion]] in the 19th century.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=183}}\n\nSince his death, only the ''Prophecies'' have continued to be popular, but in this case they have been quite extraordinarily so. Over two hundred editions of them have appeared in that time, together with over 2,000 commentaries. Their [[Nostradamus in popular culture|persistence in popular culture]] seems to be partly because their vagueness and lack of dating make it easy to quote them selectively after every major dramatic event and retrospectively claim them as \"hits\".{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144-5}}\n\n==Origins of ''The Prophecies''==\n[[File:Dr. Garenci\u00e8res, the Translator of Nostradamus (Robert Chambers, p.12, 1832) - Copy.jpg|thumb|[[Theophilus de Garenci\u00e8res]], the first English translator of the ''Prophecies''<ref name=Chambers>{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=Robert|title=The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar, Including Anecdote, Biography, & History, Curiosities of Literature and Oddities of Human Life and Character, Volume 2|date=1832|publisher=W. & R.

Hence the many predictions involving ancient figures such as [[Sulla]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Nero]], and others, as well as his descriptions of \"battles in the clouds\" and \"frogs falling from the sky\".{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003b|loc=''passim''}} Astrology itself is mentioned only twice in Nostradamus's ''Preface'' and 41 times in the ''Centuries'' themselves, but more frequently in his dedicatory ''[[Letter to King Henry II]]''. In the last quatrain of his sixth ''century'' he specifically attacks astrologers.\n\nHis historical sources include easily identifiable passages from [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]]' ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Plutarch]] and other classical historians, as well as from medieval chroniclers such as [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] and [[Jean Froissart]]. Many of his astrological references are taken almost word for word from [[Richard Roussat]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Livre de l'estat et mutations des temps}}'' of 1549\u201350.\n\nOne of his major prophetic sources was evidently the ''[[Mirabilis Liber]]'' of 1522, which contained a range of prophecies by [[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius|Pseudo-Methodius]], the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]], [[Joachim of Fiore]], [[Savonarola]] and others (his ''Preface'' contains 24 biblical quotations, all but two in the order used by Savonarola). This book had enjoyed considerable success in the 1520s, when it went through half a dozen editions, but did not sustain its influence, perhaps owing to its mostly Latin text, Gothic script and many difficult abbreviations. Nostradamus was one of the first to re-paraphrase these prophecies in French, which may explain why they are credited to him. Modern views of plagiarism did not apply in the 16th century; authors frequently copied and paraphrased passages without acknowledgement, especially from the classics. The latest research suggests that he may in fact have used [[bibliomancy]] for this\u2014randomly selecting a book of history or prophecy and taking his cue from whatever page it happened to fall open at.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010}}\n\nFurther material was gleaned from the ''De honesta disciplina'' of 1504 by [[Petrus Crinitus]],{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=100, 233\u2013235}} which included extracts from [[Michael Psellos]]'s ''De daemonibus'', and the ''[[De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum]]'' (''Concerning the mysteries of Egypt''), a book on [[Chaldea]]n and [[Assyria]]n magic by [[Iamblichus]], a 4th-century [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonist]]. Latin versions of both had recently been published in [[Lyon]], and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) in his first two verses, the first of which is appended to this article. While it is true that Nostradamus claimed in 1555 to have burned all of the occult works in his library, no one can say exactly what books were destroyed in this fire.\n\nOnly in the 17th century did people start to notice his reliance on earlier, mainly classical sources.{{efn|Anonymous letters to the ''Mercure de France'' in August and November 1724 drew specific public attention to the fact (Anonyme) Lettre critique sur la personne et sur les \u00e9crits de Michel Nostradamus, Mercure de France, ao\u00fbt et novembre 1724.}}\n\nNostradamus's reliance on historical precedent is reflected in the fact that he explicitly rejected the label \"prophet\" (i.e. a person having prophetic powers of his own) on several occasions:{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=109}}\n\n{{quote|Although, my son, I have used the word ''prophet'', I would not attribute to myself a title of such lofty sublimity.|''Preface to C\u00e9sar'', 1555<ref name=\"prefces\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26:preface-to-cesar&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |title=Preface to C\u00e9sar |publisher=Nostradamus-repository.org |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928090730/http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26:preface-to-cesar&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n{{quote|Not that I would attribute to myself either the name or the role of a prophet.|''Preface to C\u00e9sar'', 1555<ref name = \"prefces\"/>}}\n{{quote|[S]ome of [the prophets] predicted great and marvelous things to come: [though] for me, I in no way attribute to myself such a title here.|''Letter to King Henry II'', 1558<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27:letter-to-henri-ii&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |title=Letter to Henri II |publisher=Nostradamus-repository.org |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727130736/http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27:letter-to-henri-ii&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n{{quote|Not that I am foolish enough to claim to be a prophet.|Open letter to Privy Councillor (later Chancellor) Birague, 15 June 1566{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=109}}}}\n\n[[File:npix4.jpg|thumb|right|Detail from title-page of the original 1555 (Albi) edition of Nostradamus's ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'']]\n\nGiven this reliance on literary sources, it is unlikely that Nostradamus used any particular methods for entering a [[altered state of consciousness|trance state]], other than [[contemplation]], [[meditation]] and [[Incubation (ritual)|incubation]].{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=98}} His sole description of this process is contained in ''letter 41'' of his collected Latin correspondence.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=41, 225\u2013229}} The popular legend that he attempted the ancient methods of flame gazing, water gazing or both simultaneously is based on a naive reading of his first two verses, which merely liken his efforts to those of the [[Oracle of Delphi|Delphic]] and [[Didyma|Branchidic]] [[oracle]]s. The first of these is reproduced at the bottom of this article and the second can be seen by visiting the relevant facsimile site (see External Links).

This was followed in 1961 (reprinted in 1982) by Edgar Leoni's ''Nostradamus and His Prophecies''. After that came [[Erika Cheetham]]'s ''The Prophecies of Nostradamus'', incorporating a reprint of the posthumous 1568 edition, which was reprinted, revised and republished several times from 1973 onwards, latterly as ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus''. This served as the basis for the documentary ''[[The Man Who Saw Tomorrow]]'' and both did indeed mention possible generalised future attacks on New York (via [[nuclear weapon]]s), though not specifically on the World Trade Center or on any particular date.<ref>See, for example, Cheetham, Erika, ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus'', Futura, 1990, p.373</ref>\n\nA two-part translation of Jean-Charles de Fontbrune's ''Nostradamus: historien et proph\u00e8te'' was published in 1980, and John Hogue has published a number of books on Nostradamus from about 1987, including ''Nostradamus and the Millennium: Predictions of the Future'', ''Nostradamus: The Complete Prophecies'' (1999) and ''Nostradamus: A Life and Myth'' (2003). In 1992 one commentator who claimed to be able to contact Nostradamus under hypnosis even had him \"interpreting\" his own verse X.6 (a prediction specifically about floods in southern France around the city of N\u00eemes and people taking refuge in its ''collosse'', or Colosseum, a Roman amphitheatre now known as the ''Ar\u00e8nes'') as a prediction of an undated ''attack on the Pentagon'', despite the historical seer's clear statement in his dedicatory letter to King Henri II that his prophecies were about Europe, North Africa and part of Asia Minor.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=145|Phophecy Location Map=http://www.secret-vault.co.uk/nostradamus/locations.html}}\n\nWith the exception of Roberts, these books and their many popular imitators were almost unanimous not merely about Nostradamus's powers of prophecy but also in inventing intriguing aspects of his purported biography: that he had been a descendant of the Israelite tribe of [[Issachar]]; he had been educated by his grandfathers, who had both been physicians to the court of [[Rene I of Naples|Good King Ren\u00e9]] of [[Provence]]; he had attended [[Montpellier]] University in 1525 to gain his first degree; after returning there in 1529, he had successfully taken his medical doctorate; he had gone on to lecture in the Medical Faculty there, until his views became too unpopular; he had supported the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the universe; he had travelled to the Habsburg Netherlands, where he had composed prophecies at the abbey of Orval; in the course of his travels, he had performed a variety of prodigies, including identifying future Pope, [[Sixtus V]], who was then only a seminary monk. He is credited with having successfully cured the [[Bubonic plague|Plague]] at [[Aix-en-Provence]] and elsewhere; he had engaged in [[scrying]], using either a magic mirror or a bowl of water; he had been joined by his secretary Chavigny at Easter 1554; having published the first installment of his ''Proph\u00e9ties'', he had been summoned by Queen [[Catherine de' Medici]] to Paris in 1556 to discuss with her his prophecy at quatrain I.35 that her husband [[King Henri II]] would be killed in a duel; he had examined the royal children at [[Blois]]; he had bequeathed to his son a \"lost book\" of his own prophetic paintings;{{efn|Actually the 13th\u201314th century ''[[Vaticinia de Summis Pontificibus]]'' in a misascribed version sometimes referred to as the ''[[Vaticinia Nostradami]]''}} he had been buried standing up; and he had been found, when dug up at the French Revolution, to be wearing a medallion bearing the exact date of his disinterment.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=26\u201345}} This was first recorded by [[Samuel Pepys]] as early as 1667, long before the [[French Revolution]].

Most of them had evidently been based on unsourced rumours relayed as fact by much later commentators, such as Jaubert (1656), Guynaud (1693) and Bareste (1840), on modern misunderstandings of the 16th-century French texts, or on pure invention. Even the often-advanced suggestion that quatrain I.35 had successfully prophesied King Henry II's death did not actually appear in print for the first time until 1614, 55 years after the event.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=28\u201330}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=267}}\n\nSkeptics such as [[James Randi]] suggest that his reputation as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as \"retroactive clairvoyance\" ([[postdiction]]).

Meanwhile, some of the more recent sources listed (Lemesurier, Gruber, Wilson) have been particularly scathing about later attempts by some lesser-known authors and Internet enthusiasts to extract alleged hidden meanings from the texts, whether with the aid of anagrams, numerical codes, graphs or otherwise.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144\u2013148}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Nostradamus in popular culture}}\n\nThe prophecies retold and expanded by Nostradamus  figured largely in [[popular culture]] in the 20th and 21st centuries. As well as being the subject of hundreds of books (both fiction and nonfiction), Nostradamus's life has been depicted in several films and videos, and his life and writings continue to be a subject of media interest.\n\nThere have also been several well-known Internet [[hoax]]es, where quatrains in the style of Nostradamus have been circulated by e-mail as the real thing.

Because far more applicants claim Hawaiian ancestry than the schools can admit, virtually all students have some Native Hawaiian ancestry. Non-Hawaiians have attended, but this is extremely rare. In 2002, Kamehameha admitted one non-Hawaiian student, Kalani Rosell, to its Maui campus, for the first time in 40&nbsp;years. Rosell was admitted after all qualified Hawaiian applicants had been admitted. This decision sparked alumni protest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Kamehameha's admissions policy was the focus of two federal lawsuits, which contended that preferring Native Hawaiians is a race-based exclusion that violates U.S. civil rights law. Both lawsuits have since been settled and the admission policy stands today.\n\n=== Mohica-Cummings lawsuit ===\nIn August 2003, Brayden Gay Mohica-Cummings was a seventh-grader admitted to Kap\u0101lama Heights after his mother, who is the ''[[h\u0101nai]]'' (adopted) daughter of a Hawaiian family,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Viotti|first1=Vicki|last2=Gordon|first2=Mike|title=Kamehameha settlement OK'd|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2003/Dec/05/ln/ln20a.html|accessdate=17 December 2014|agency=Honolulu Advertiser|date=December 5, 2003}}</ref> said he was Hawaiian.

The dissent stated that civil rights law \"prohibits a [https://www.privateschoolreview.com/ private school] from denying admission to prospective students because of their race.\" It was very skeptical of the majority interpretation, stating, \"The fact that Congress has passed some measures promoting Native Hawaiian education says nothing about whether Congress intended to exempt Native Hawaiian schools from \u00a7 1981 [civil rights law]\".\n\nFollowing the decision, attorneys appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. However, before the Supreme Court decided whether to hear the case, ''Doe v. Kamehameha'' was also settled.

The dissent stated that civil rights law \"prohibits a [https://www.privateschoolreview.com/ private school] from denying admission to prospective students because of their race.\" It was very skeptical of the majority interpretation, stating, \"The fact that Congress has passed some measures promoting Native Hawaiian education says nothing about whether Congress intended to exempt Native Hawaiian schools from \u00a7 1981 [civil rights law]\".\n\nFollowing the decision, attorneys appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]].

He did additional graduate work at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]], where he studied under chemist [[Wilhelm Ostwald]]. Buckingham received a PhD from Leipzig University in 1893.  He worked  at the USDA Bureau of Soils from 1902 to 1906 as a soil physicist. He worked at the (US) National Bureau of Standards (now the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], or NIST) 1906-1937. His fields of expertise included [[soil physics]], gas properties, [[acoustics]], [[fluid mechanics]], and [[blackbody radiation]].  He is also the originator of the [[Buckingham \u03c0 theorem]] in the field of dimensional analysis.\n\nIn 1923, Buckingham published a report<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930091225_1993091225.pdf</ref> which voiced skepticism that jet propulsion would be economically competitive with prop driven aircraft at low altitudes and at the speeds of that period.\n\nBuckingham's first work on [[soil physics]] is on soil aeration, particularly the loss of carbon dioxide from the soil and its subsequent replacement by oxygen. From his experiments he found that the rate of [[soil gas|gas diffusion in soil]] was not dependent significantly on the [[soil structure]], [[bulk density|compactness]] or [[water content]] of the soil. Using an empirical formula based on his data, Buckingham was able to give the diffusion coefficient as a function of air content. This relation is still commonly cited in many modern textbooks and used in modern research. The outcomes of his research on gas transport were to conclude that the exchange of gases in soil aeration takes place by diffusion and is ''sensibly independent of the variations of the outside barometric pressure''.\n\nBuckingham then worked on soil water, research for which he is now renowned. Buckingham's work on soil water is published in Bulletin 38 USDA Bureau of Soils: ''Studies on the movement of [[soil moisture]]'', which was released in 1907. This document contained three sections, the first of which looked at [[evaporation]] of water from below a layer of soil. He found that soils of various textures could strongly inhibit evaporation, particularly where capillary flow through the uppermost layers was prevented. The second section of ''Bulletin 38'' looked at the drying of soils under arid and humid conditions. Buckingham found evaporative losses were initially higher from the arid soil, then after three days the evaporation under arid conditions became less than under humid conditions, with the total loss ending up greater from the humid soil. Buckingham believed this occurred due to the self-mulching behaviour (he referred to it as the soil forming a natural mulch) exhibited by the soil under arid conditions.\n\nThe third section of ''Bulletin 38'' contains the work on unsaturated flow and [[capillary action]] for which Buckingham is famous. He firstly recognized the importance of the potential of the forces arising from interactions between soil and water. He called this the capillary potential, this is now known as the moisture or [[water potential]] (matric potential). He combined [[capillary]] theory and an energy potential in soil physics theory, and was the first to expound the dependence of soil hydraulic conductivity on capillary potential. This dependence later came to be known as relative permeability in petroleum engineering. He also applied a formula equivalent to [[Darcy's law]] to unsaturated flow.\n\n== Life and achievements ==\n {{Citation needed|reason=Most of these statements are made without reference and are not well-known facts.|date=February 2019}}\n* 1867 - Born in Philadelphia, PA on the 8th July\n* 1887 - Graduated from Harvard with a degree in physics\n* 1893 - Received a Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig\n* 1893 - Began teaching physical chemistry and physics at Bryn Mawr College\n* 1897-1899 - Wrote a textbook on thermodynamics<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hall, Edwin H.|authorlink=Edwin Hall|title=Review: ''Theory of Thermodynamics'', by Edgar Buckingham|journal=Bull.

Pepe the Frog is an [[Internet meme]] which has been appropriated by the alt-right as a symbol of the movement.</ref>).]]\n\nThe '''alt-right''', an abbreviation of '''alternative right''', is a loosely connected [[Far-right politics|far-right]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] movement based in the United States. A largely [[Internet activism|online phenomenon]], the alt-right originated in the U.S. during the 2010s, although it has since established a presence in various other countries. The term is ill-defined, having been used in different ways by various self-described \"alt-rightists\", media commentators, and academics. Groups which have been identified as alt-right also espouse [[white supremacism]], [[white separatism]], [[anti-immigration|severe immigration restrictions]], and [[antisemitism]].\n\nIn 2010, the American white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] launched ''The Alternative Right'' [[webzine]]. Spencer's \"alternative right\" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, as well as [[paleoconservatism]], the [[Dark Enlightenment]], and the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. His term was shortened to \"alt-right\" and popularised by far-right participants of [[/pol/]], the politics board of web forum [[4chan]]. It came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups, including Andrew Anglin's ''[[Daily Stormer]]'', Brad Griffin's ''Occidental Dissent'', and Matthew Heimbach's [[Traditionalist Worker Party]]. Following the 2014 [[Gamergate controversy]], the alt-right made increasing use of [[trolling]] and [[online harassment]] to raise its profile. In 2015, it attracted broader attention\u2014particularly through coverage on [[Steve Bannon]]'s [[Breitbart News]]\u2014due to alt-right support for [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. On [[2016 United States presidential election|being elected]], Trump renounced the movement. Attempting to move from a web-based to a street-based movement, Spencer and other alt-rightists organised the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Virginia, which faced significant [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] opposition. After this, the movement began to decline.\n\nThe alt-right is a [[Scientific racism|biologically racist]] movement promoting a form of far-right [[identity politics]] for [[European Americans]]. Part of its membership supports [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrationist]] policies to ensure a continued white majority in the United States. Others call for the breakup of the country to form a [[white separatism|white separatist]] [[ethno-state]] in [[North America]]. Some alt-rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable in the U.S., while others\u2014known as the \"[[Fourteen Words|1488]]\" scene\u2014adopt openly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] stances. Some alt-rightists are [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]], promoting a [[conspiracy theory]] that there is [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|a Jewish plot]] to bring about [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]]; other alt-rightists view most Jews as members of the white race. The alt-right is [[anti-feminism|anti-feminist]], advocates for a more [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], and intersects with the [[men's rights movement]] and other sectors of the online [[manosphere]]. Alt-rightists generally support [[Anti-interventionism|anti-interventionist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]] [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] alongside [[Protectionism|economic protectionism]]. Individuals aligned with many of the alt-right's ideas but not its white nationalism have been termed \"[[alt-lite]]\".\n\nThe alt-right distinguished itself from earlier forms of white nationalism through its largely online presence and its heavy use of irony and humor, particularly through the promotion of [[Internet memes]] like [[Pepe the Frog]]. Membership was overwhelmingly white and male, with academic and anti-fascist observers linking its growth to deteriorating living standards and prospects, anxieties about the place of white masculinity, and anger at increasingly visible [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] movements such as [[Black Lives Matter]].

At that point, he argued, the government would deport all undocumented migrants from the country and then introduce measures to encourage all other non-whites to emigrate from the country.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=16}} Other alt-rightists are critical of the idea of breaking up the United States into ethno-states, arguing that this would mean breaking up the country that their Euro-American ancestors fought to build.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} They instead argue for restrictive immigration policies to ensure that the U.S. continues to be a white-majority state.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\nRather than seeking independent white ethno-states, some alt-rightists promote a pan-white empire spanning Europe and North America.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=172}} Spencer noted that he did not want his proposed white ethno-state to be small, and that he wanted it to eventually form part of \"a global empire... something on a very large scale. And that is a homeland for all white people, whether you're German or Celtic or Slavic or English.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=24\u201325}} He described this as \"one big [[Roman Empire]]\" and suggested that it should engage in imperial expansion into the [[Near East]], focusing on conquering [[Istanbul]]; in Spencer's words, Istanbul was \"such a profoundly symbolic city. Retaking it, that would be a statement to the world.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=25}} He added that its present [[Turkish people|Turkish]] inhabitants would be made to leave, for they could go to \"the Middle East or something.

Heimbach for instance has addressed meetings of the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] in Greece and the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}} Various U.S.-based alt-rightists used social media to encourage support for the [[Alternative for Germany]] party in that country's [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]].{{sfn|Morstatter|Galstyan|Shao|Karunasekera|2018|p=621}}\n\n== Tactics ==\nAlt-rightists often make reference to [[freedom of speech]] when calling for their views to be heard in public discourse.{{sfn|Hofmann-Kuroda|2017|p=369}} A recurrent tactic of alt-rightists is to present themselves\u2014as white men\u2014as victims of oppression and prejudice; this subverts many leftist arguments about other social groupings being victims and is designed to infuriate leftist opponents.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=73}}\n\nThe alt-right also make heavy use of imagery drawn from popular culture for its own purposes.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=256\u2013257}} For instance, the American singer [[Taylor Swift]] is often held up as an idealised example of \"Aryan\" beauty.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=257}} When describing their own conversion to the movement, alt-rightists refer to themselves as having been \"getting red pilled\", a reference to a scene in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'' in which Neo, the protagonist, chooses to discover the truth behind reality by consuming a red pill.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=83|2a1=Kelly|2y=2017|2p=74|3a1=Niewert|3y=2017|3p=257}} On alt-right blogs and message boards, members often discuss how they were \"red-pilled\" originally.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=83\u201384}} Alt-rightists have also adopted [[milk]] as a symbol of their views; various members have used the words \"Heil Milk\" in their online posts while Spencer included an [[emoji]] of a glass of milk on his Twitter profile along with the statement that he was \"very tolerant... lactose tolerant!\"{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|p=104}} The [[animal studies]] scholar Vasile St\u0103nescu suggested that this notion drew upon the 19th century pseudoscientific idea that Northern Europeans had become biologically superior to many other human populations because they consumed high quantities of milk and meat products.{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n=== Use of humor and irony ===\n\nThe alt-right makes strong use of humor and irony in its rhetoric.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=20|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=256}} As noted by Nagle, the alt-right's use of humor renders it difficult to tell \"what political views were genuinely held and what were merely, as they used to say, for the lulz.\"{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=2}} The alt-right presented an image which was much less threatening than that of earlier white nationalist groups, and thus was able to attract people who would be willing to visit alt-right websites who would not have considered attending neo-Nazi or KKK events.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=25}} As noted by Hawley, \"whereas older white nationalists came across as bitter, reactionary, and antisocial, much of the Alt-Right comes across as youthful, light-hearted, and jovial\u2014even as it says the most abhorrent things about racial and religious minorities.\"{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Members of the alt-right sometimes made fun of the earnestness and seriousness of earlier white nationalists such as William Pierce.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=76}}\n\nAnother of the tactics employed online by alt-rightists is to parody their leftist opponents. One teenaged American alt-rightist for instance created a Twitter account for a fictional individual whom they described as an \"LGBTQ+ pansexual nonbinary POC transwoman\" who was a \"Journalist for BLM. Always stayin [[woke]]\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=49\u201350}} Alt-rightists also orchestrated pranks, again to cause alarm among opponents. For instance, during the 2016 presidential campaign alt-rightists presented claims that they were plotting to send representatives posing as officials to voting booths where they would suppress ethnic minority turnout. There was no such plot, but press sources like ''[[Politico]]'' picked up on the claims and presented them as fact.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=75\u201376}} Such incidents reflected the alt-right's willingness to lie to advance their interests.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=75}} This tendency toward trolling renders it difficult for journalists to learn more about the alt-right because those members they talked to were willing to deceive them for their amusement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=74}}\n\nNagle suggested that the alt-right's use of such tactics made it strongly transgressive and thus part of a tradition that she traced back to the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=28\u201329}} She argued that it was with the alt-right that \"the transgressive anti-moral style\" reached \"its final detachment from any egalitarian philosophy of the left or Christian morality of the right\".{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=39}}\n\n===Use of memes===\n[[File:Feels good

In contrast, he thought, older white nationalists were keener to retain links to patriotic American imagery because they nostalgically recalled a period of U.S. history when segregation and overt white dominance were a part of life and believed that this system could be reinstated.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nWendling believed that a large portion of the alt-right were university students or recent graduates, many bearing a particular grudge against political correctness.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=8}} The alt-right ideologue Greg Johnson suggested that the alt-right was drawing in better educated people than previous white nationalist movements because the career prospects for college-educated European Americans had declined by the late 2000s. Whereas a college degree was previously perceived as a guaranteed ticket to a middle-class lifestyle, he noted that this was no longer the case and that many college and university educated people felt resentful and, due to unemployment or underemployment, had growing amounts of time on their hands which they could spend on the Internet.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nYiannopoulos claimed that some \"young rebels\" are drawn to the alt-right not for deeply political reasons, but \"because it promises fun, transgression, and a challenge to social norms\". According to ''The New Yorker'', \"testing the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politics-of what can be said, and how directly\" is a major component of alt-right identity. The beliefs that make the alt-right perceptible as a movement \"are in their essence not matters of substance but of style\" and the alt-right's tone may just be concealing \"a more familiar politics\".<ref>{{cite article |last=Wallace-Wells |first=Benjamin |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/is-the-alt-right-for-real |title=Is the Alt-Right for Real? |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA research study of 447 self-identified alt-right members found higher levels of dark triad traits compared to the general population; and that members of the alt-right were more likely to express prejudice against black people and admit to engaging in aggressive behavior.

In her view, much of the \"groundwork\" for this discourse was set forth by the conservative movement in the years following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=69}} Hawley concurred that American conservatism was \"at least somewhat responsible for the rise of the Alt-Right\" because some individuals within the conservative movement, such as [[Ann Coulter]], had \"effectively delegitimized complaints about hate speech and racism\" as part of their attacks on political correctness in the years before the alt-right's appearance.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=44}} This is something acknowledged by some conservatives, like columnist [[Matt K. Lewis]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nCommentator [[Angela Nagle]] said that a mainstream \"alt-light\" more interested in performance than political goals helped the alt-right in its rise, saying that should the alt-right grow to generate great violence, those on the right who helped to make the alt-right look attractive, such as Yiannopoulos, \"will have to take responsibility for having played their role\" in enabling its growth.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=9}} She also suggested that \"the hysterical liberal call-out\" culture of the 2010s, in which \"everyone from saccharine pop stars to [[Justin Trudeau]] [was called] a 'white supremacist' and everyone who wasn't [[2016 United States presidential election#Notable expressions, phrases, and statements|With Her]] a sexist\" made it more difficult for people to recognize when a far-right movement really emerged online; she compared the situation with the tale of [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]].{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=8\u20139}} Disagreeing with Nagle's view that the alt-right was primarily a \"response to the stupidity of marginal Internet liberalism\", the anti-fascist reporter Jay Firestone\u2014who had spent three months undercover in New York's alt-right community\u2014instead argued that it was a \"response to decades of decline in standards of living for working people, amid the proliferation of unemployment and meaningless, dead-end jobs.\"<ref>{{cite article |last=Firestone |first=Jay |title=Three Months Inside Alt-Right New York |website=Commune |date=Spring 2019 |url=https://communemag.com/alt-right-new-york/ |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Philip W. Gray cited several reasons for the emergence of the alt-right. In his analysis, new online media had reduced the conservative movement's ability to enforce its boundaries against the far right, while the growing distance of the Second World War meant that pride in the U.S. victory over Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy provided less of a barrier to the American far-right than it had when there were still large numbers of people who remembered the conflict.{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=151\u2013152}} Gray also argued that the alt-right was a reaction against the left-wing racial and social agitation of the 2010s, in particular the Black Lives Matter movement and the popularisation of concepts like [[white privilege]] and [[male privilege]], as well as events like the racial unrest in [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] and [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson]] and the shooting of police officers in [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|Dallas]] and [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|Baton Rouge]].{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n== Links to violence and terrorism ==\n{{quote box\n|quote=The sprawling networks the alt-right has built around its poisonous, racist ideology have violence at its core in its pursuit of a white ethnostate.

He noted that if the left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization, it would have to accept [[white identity politics]] as a permanent fixture of the political landscape.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Similarly, in highlighting the commonalities between alt-right and \"left-identitarian\" forms of identity politics, Gray suggested the alt-right's presence might encourage \"the intersectional Left and its allies\" to increasingly critique the theoretical basis on which their own identity politics is built.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=153}} Other commentators, like the conservative [[David Frum]], have suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse, then the alt-right would no longer be able to monopolize them.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}}\n\nSome opponents sought to undermine the alt-right's stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it. For instance, when alt-rightists became angry or upset, some of their opponents described them as \"snowflakes\" who were being \"triggered\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=221\u2013222}} Anti-fascist activists also adopted the alt-right's use of pranks; on several occasions they publicized events in which they were purportedly meeting to destroy Confederate monuments or gravestones. Alt-rightists mobilized to publicly defend these sites, only to find that no such anti-fascist event was happening at all.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=221}} Within feminist circles, the alt-right's desired future was repeatedly compared to the [[Republic of Gilead]], the fictional dystopia in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985) and its [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|2017 television adaptation]].{{sfn|Marghitu|Johnson|2018|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" Rally (35780272084).jpg|thumb|left|Counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.]]\n\nVarious opponents have also employed doxing, publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt-rightists, many of whom had previously acted anonymously.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=166}} This tactic discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt-right activities to begin with, as they fear that should they be outed as alt-rightists they might face repercussions such as job loss, social ostracization, or violence.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=168}} From 2016 onward, some anti-fascist opponents of the alt-right also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=169}} On Trump's inauguration day, for example, a masked anti-fascist punched Spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters; the footage was widely shared online.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=169|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=2\u20133}} Hawley noted that this tactic could be counter-productive to the anti-alt-right case, as it reinforces the narrative that alt-rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally-protected right to free speech were being victimized.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nOther commentators have called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} If denied access to mainstream social media outlets, the alt-right would be restricted to far-right online venues like Stormfront, where it would be isolated and ignored from those not already committed to its cause.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=163}} Many in the alt-right concur that denying it access to social media would have a devastating effect on its ability to proselytize.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} It has however been suggested that such censorship could backfire, as it would play into the alt-right narrative that those campaigning for white interests were being marginalized by the establishment, thus aiding the movement's recruitment.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}} Suppressing the alt-right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future, including leftist ones.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=165}} Phillips and Yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt-right speech reflected an \"authoritarian shift\" which was becoming \"increasingly hegemonic\" within the American Left and that endorsed the view that \"limiting or preventing the public speech of historically privileged groups (typically, whites, males) is acceptable until power relations are equalized.\"{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\n== \"Alt-left\" ==\n{{anchor|Alt-left}}\nAfter the murder of a counter-protester at the Unite the Right Rally, in a press conference Trump stated that there was \"blame on both sides\" for the violence, stating that some of the counter-protesters were part of the \"very, very violent ... alt-left\".{{refn|<ref>Shear, Michael D. and Haberman, Maggie (August 15, 2017).

Pepe the Frog is an [[Internet meme]] which has been appropriated by the alt-right as a symbol of the movement.</ref>).]]\n\nThe '''alt-right''', an abbreviation of '''alternative right''', is a loosely connected [[Far-right politics|far-right]], [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] movement based in the United States. A largely [[Internet activism|online phenomenon]], the alt-right originated in the U.S. during the 2010s, although it has since established a presence in various other countries. The term is ill-defined, having been used in different ways by various self-described \"alt-rightists\", media commentators, and academics. Groups which have been identified as alt-right also espouse [[white supremacism]], [[white separatism]], [[anti-immigration|severe immigration restrictions]], and [[antisemitism]].\n\nIn 2010, the American white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] launched ''The Alternative Right'' [[webzine]]. Spencer's \"alternative right\" was influenced by earlier forms of American white nationalism, as well as [[paleoconservatism]], the [[Dark Enlightenment]], and the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. His term was shortened to \"alt-right\" and popularised by far-right participants of [[/pol/]], the politics board of web forum [[4chan]]. It came to be associated with other white nationalist websites and groups, including Andrew Anglin's ''[[Daily Stormer]]'', Brad Griffin's ''Occidental Dissent'', and Matthew Heimbach's [[Traditionalist Worker Party]]. Following the 2014 [[Gamergate controversy]], the alt-right made increasing use of [[trolling]] and [[online harassment]] to raise its profile. In 2015, it attracted broader attention\u2014particularly through coverage on [[Steve Bannon]]'s [[Breitbart News]]\u2014due to alt-right support for [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. On [[2016 United States presidential election|being elected]], Trump renounced the movement. Attempting to move from a web-based to a street-based movement, Spencer and other alt-rightists organised the 2017 [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], Virginia, which faced significant [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] opposition. After this, the movement began to decline.\n\nThe alt-right is a [[Scientific racism|biologically racist]] movement promoting a form of far-right [[identity politics]] for [[European Americans]]. Part of its membership supports [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrationist]] policies to ensure a continued white majority in the United States. Others call for the breakup of the country to form a [[white separatism|white separatist]] [[ethno-state]] in [[North America]]. Some alt-rightists seek to make white nationalism socially respectable in the U.S., while others\u2014known as the \"[[Fourteen Words|1488]]\" scene\u2014adopt openly [[white supremacism|white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] stances. Some alt-rightists are [[Antisemitism|anti-semitic]], promoting a [[conspiracy theory]] that there is [[Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory|a Jewish plot]] to bring about [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]]; other alt-rightists view most Jews as members of the white race. The alt-right is [[anti-feminism|anti-feminist]], advocates for a more [[Patriarchy|patriarchal society]], and intersects with the [[men's rights movement]] and other sectors of the online [[manosphere]]. Alt-rightists generally support [[Anti-interventionism|anti-interventionist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]] [[Foreign policy|foreign policies]] alongside [[Protectionism|economic protectionism]].

At that point, he argued, the government would deport all undocumented migrants from the country and then introduce measures to encourage all other non-whites to emigrate from the country.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=16}} Other alt-rightists are critical of the idea of breaking up the United States into ethno-states, arguing that this would mean breaking up the country that their Euro-American ancestors fought to build.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=224}} They instead argue for restrictive immigration policies to ensure that the U.S. continues to be a white-majority state.{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\nRather than seeking independent white ethno-states, some alt-rightists promote a pan-white empire spanning Europe and North America.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=172}} Spencer noted that he did not want his proposed white ethno-state to be small, and that he wanted it to eventually form part of \"a global empire... something on a very large scale. And that is a homeland for all white people, whether you're German or Celtic or Slavic or English.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=24\u201325}} He described this as \"one big [[Roman Empire]]\" and suggested that it should engage in imperial expansion into the [[Near East]], focusing on conquering [[Istanbul]]; in Spencer's words, Istanbul was \"such a profoundly symbolic city. Retaking it, that would be a statement to the world.\"{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=25}} He added that its present [[Turkish people|Turkish]] inhabitants would be made to leave, for they could go to \"the Middle East or something.

Heimbach for instance has addressed meetings of the [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] in Greece and the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Michael|2019|p=74}} Various U.S.-based alt-rightists used social media to encourage support for the [[Alternative for Germany]] party in that country's [[2017 German federal election|2017 federal election]].{{sfn|Morstatter|Galstyan|Shao|Karunasekera|2018|p=621}}\n\n== Tactics ==\nAlt-rightists often make reference to [[freedom of speech]] when calling for their views to be heard in public discourse.{{sfn|Hofmann-Kuroda|2017|p=369}} A recurrent tactic of alt-rightists is to present themselves\u2014as white men\u2014as victims of oppression and prejudice; this subverts many leftist arguments about other social groupings being victims and is designed to infuriate leftist opponents.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=73}}\n\nThe alt-right also make heavy use of imagery drawn from popular culture for its own purposes.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|pp=256\u2013257}} For instance, the American singer [[Taylor Swift]] is often held up as an idealised example of \"Aryan\" beauty.{{sfn|Niewert|2017|p=257}} When describing their own conversion to the movement, alt-rightists refer to themselves as having been \"getting red pilled\", a reference to a scene in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'' in which Neo, the protagonist, chooses to discover the truth behind reality by consuming a red pill.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=83|2a1=Kelly|2y=2017|2p=74|3a1=Niewert|3y=2017|3p=257}} On alt-right blogs and message boards, members often discuss how they were \"red-pilled\" originally.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=83\u201384}} Alt-rightists have also adopted [[milk]] as a symbol of their views; various members have used the words \"Heil Milk\" in their online posts while Spencer included an [[emoji]] of a glass of milk on his Twitter profile along with the statement that he was \"very tolerant... lactose tolerant!\"{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|p=104}} The [[animal studies]] scholar Vasile St\u0103nescu suggested that this notion drew upon the 19th century pseudoscientific idea that Northern Europeans had become biologically superior to many other human populations because they consumed high quantities of milk and meat products.{{sfn|St\u0103nescu|2018|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\n=== Use of humor and irony ===\n\nThe alt-right makes strong use of humor and irony in its rhetoric.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=20|2a1=Niewert|2y=2017|2p=256}} As noted by Nagle, the alt-right's use of humor renders it difficult to tell \"what political views were genuinely held and what were merely, as they used to say, for the lulz.\"{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=2}} The alt-right presented an image which was much less threatening than that of earlier white nationalist groups, and thus was able to attract people who would be willing to visit alt-right websites who would not have considered attending neo-Nazi or KKK events.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=25}} As noted by Hawley, \"whereas older white nationalists came across as bitter, reactionary, and antisocial, much of the Alt-Right comes across as youthful, light-hearted, and jovial\u2014even as it says the most abhorrent things about racial and religious minorities.\"{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=20}} Members of the alt-right sometimes made fun of the earnestness and seriousness of earlier white nationalists such as William Pierce.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=76}}\n\nAnother of the tactics employed online by alt-rightists is to parody their leftist opponents. One teenaged American alt-rightist for instance created a Twitter account for a fictional individual whom they described as an \"LGBTQ+ pansexual nonbinary POC transwoman\" who was a \"Journalist for BLM. Always stayin [[woke]]\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=49\u201350}} Alt-rightists also orchestrated pranks, again to cause alarm among opponents. For instance, during the 2016 presidential campaign alt-rightists presented claims that they were plotting to send representatives posing as officials to voting booths where they would suppress ethnic minority turnout. There was no such plot, but press sources like ''[[Politico]]'' picked up on the claims and presented them as fact.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=75\u201376}} Such incidents reflected the alt-right's willingness to lie to advance their interests.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=75}} This tendency toward trolling renders it difficult for journalists to learn more about the alt-right because those members they talked to were willing to deceive them for their amusement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=74}}\n\nNagle suggested that the alt-right's use of such tactics made it strongly transgressive and thus part of a tradition that she traced back to the work of the [[Marquis de Sade]] in the 18th century.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=28\u201329}} She argued that it was with the alt-right that \"the transgressive anti-moral style\" reached \"its final detachment from any egalitarian philosophy of the left or Christian morality of the right\".{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=39}}\n\n===Use of memes===\n[[File:Feels good

In contrast, he thought, older white nationalists were keener to retain links to patriotic American imagery because they nostalgically recalled a period of U.S. history when segregation and overt white dominance were a part of life and believed that this system could be reinstated.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nWendling believed that a large portion of the alt-right were university students or recent graduates, many bearing a particular grudge against political correctness.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=8}} The alt-right ideologue Greg Johnson suggested that the alt-right was drawing in better educated people than previous white nationalist movements because the career prospects for college-educated European Americans had declined by the late 2000s. Whereas a college degree was previously perceived as a guaranteed ticket to a middle-class lifestyle, he noted that this was no longer the case and that many college and university educated people felt resentful and, due to unemployment or underemployment, had growing amounts of time on their hands which they could spend on the Internet.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nYiannopoulos claimed that some \"young rebels\" are drawn to the alt-right not for deeply political reasons, but \"because it promises fun, transgression, and a challenge to social norms\". According to ''The New Yorker'', \"testing the strength of the speech taboos that revolve around conventional politics-of what can be said, and how directly\" is a major component of alt-right identity. The beliefs that make the alt-right perceptible as a movement \"are in their essence not matters of substance but of style\" and the alt-right's tone may just be concealing \"a more familiar politics\".<ref>{{cite article |last=Wallace-Wells |first=Benjamin |date=May 5, 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/benjamin-wallace-wells/is-the-alt-right-for-real |title=Is the Alt-Right for Real? |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA research study of 447 self-identified alt-right members found higher levels of dark triad traits compared to the general population; and that members of the alt-right were more likely to express prejudice against black people and admit to engaging in aggressive behavior. Alt-right members also had significantly high levels of dehumanization, with the mean alt-right scores comparable to how the general public views the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].

In her view, much of the \"groundwork\" for this discourse was set forth by the conservative movement in the years following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.{{sfn|Kelly|2017|p=69}} Hawley concurred that American conservatism was \"at least somewhat responsible for the rise of the Alt-Right\" because some individuals within the conservative movement, such as [[Ann Coulter]], had \"effectively delegitimized complaints about hate speech and racism\" as part of their attacks on political correctness in the years before the alt-right's appearance.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=44}} This is something acknowledged by some conservatives, like columnist [[Matt K. Lewis]].{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nCommentator [[Angela Nagle]] said that a mainstream \"alt-light\" more interested in performance than political goals helped the alt-right in its rise, saying that should the alt-right grow to generate great violence, those on the right who helped to make the alt-right look attractive, such as Yiannopoulos, \"will have to take responsibility for having played their role\" in enabling its growth.{{sfn|Nagle|2017|p=9}} She also suggested that \"the hysterical liberal call-out\" culture of the 2010s, in which \"everyone from saccharine pop stars to [[Justin Trudeau]] [was called] a 'white supremacist' and everyone who wasn't [[2016 United States presidential election#Notable expressions, phrases, and statements|With Her]] a sexist\" made it more difficult for people to recognize when a far-right movement really emerged online; she compared the situation with the tale of [[The Boy Who Cried Wolf]].{{sfn|Nagle|2017|pp=8\u20139}} Disagreeing with Nagle's view that the alt-right was primarily a \"response to the stupidity of marginal Internet liberalism\", the anti-fascist reporter Jay Firestone\u2014who had spent three months undercover in New York's alt-right community\u2014instead argued that it was a \"response to decades of decline in standards of living for working people, amid the proliferation of unemployment and meaningless, dead-end jobs.\"<ref>{{cite article |last=Firestone |first=Jay |title=Three Months Inside Alt-Right New York |website=Commune |date=Spring 2019 |url=https://communemag.com/alt-right-new-york/ |accessdate=March 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Philip W. Gray cited several reasons for the emergence of the alt-right. In his analysis, new online media had reduced the conservative movement's ability to enforce its boundaries against the far right, while the growing distance of the Second World War meant that pride in the U.S. victory over Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy provided less of a barrier to the American far-right than it had when there were still large numbers of people who remembered the conflict.{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=151\u2013152}} Gray also argued that the alt-right was a reaction against the left-wing racial and social agitation of the 2010s, in particular the Black Lives Matter movement and the popularisation of concepts like [[white privilege]] and [[male privilege]], as well as events like the racial unrest in [[2015 Baltimore protests|Baltimore]] and [[Ferguson unrest|Ferguson]] and the shooting of police officers in [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|Dallas]] and [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|Baton Rouge]].{{sfn|Gray|2018|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n== Links to violence and terrorism ==\n{{quote box\n|quote=The sprawling networks the alt-right has built around its poisonous, racist ideology have violence at its core in its pursuit of a white ethnostate.

He noted that if the left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization, it would have to accept [[white identity politics]] as a permanent fixture of the political landscape.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=160}} Similarly, in highlighting the commonalities between alt-right and \"left-identitarian\" forms of identity politics, Gray suggested the alt-right's presence might encourage \"the intersectional Left and its allies\" to increasingly critique the theoretical basis on which their own identity politics is built.{{sfn|Gray|2018|p=153}} Other commentators, like the conservative [[David Frum]], have suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse, then the alt-right would no longer be able to monopolize them.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}}\n\nSome opponents sought to undermine the alt-right's stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it. For instance, when alt-rightists became angry or upset, some of their opponents described them as \"snowflakes\" who were being \"triggered\".{{sfn|Wendling|2018|pp=221\u2013222}} Anti-fascist activists also adopted the alt-right's use of pranks; on several occasions they publicized events in which they were purportedly meeting to destroy Confederate monuments or gravestones. Alt-rightists mobilized to publicly defend these sites, only to find that no such anti-fascist event was happening at all.{{sfn|Wendling|2018|p=221}} Within feminist circles, the alt-right's desired future was repeatedly compared to the [[Republic of Gilead]], the fictional dystopia in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (1985) and its [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|2017 television adaptation]].{{sfn|Marghitu|Johnson|2018|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" Rally (35780272084).jpg|thumb|left|Counter-protesters at the 2017 Unite the Right rally.]]\n\nVarious opponents have also employed doxing, publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt-rightists, many of whom had previously acted anonymously.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=166}} This tactic discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt-right activities to begin with, as they fear that should they be outed as alt-rightists they might face repercussions such as job loss, social ostracization, or violence.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=168}} From 2016 onward, some anti-fascist opponents of the alt-right also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=169}} On Trump's inauguration day, for example, a masked anti-fascist punched Spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters; the footage was widely shared online.{{sfnm|1a1=Hawley|1y=2017|1p=169|2a1=Wendling|2y=2018|2pp=2\u20133}} Hawley noted that this tactic could be counter-productive to the anti-alt-right case, as it reinforces the narrative that alt-rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally-protected right to free speech were being victimized.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nOther commentators have called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt-right.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} If denied access to mainstream social media outlets, the alt-right would be restricted to far-right online venues like Stormfront, where it would be isolated and ignored from those not already committed to its cause.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=163}} Many in the alt-right concur that denying it access to social media would have a devastating effect on its ability to proselytize.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=161}} It has however been suggested that such censorship could backfire, as it would play into the alt-right narrative that those campaigning for white interests were being marginalized by the establishment, thus aiding the movement's recruitment.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=164}} Suppressing the alt-right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future, including leftist ones.{{sfn|Hawley|2017|p=165}} Phillips and Yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt-right speech reflected an \"authoritarian shift\" which was becoming \"increasingly hegemonic\" within the American Left and that endorsed the view that \"limiting or preventing the public speech of historically privileged groups (typically, whites, males) is acceptable until power relations are equalized.\"{{sfn|Phillips|Yi|2018|p=226}}\n\n== \"Alt-left\" ==\n{{anchor|Alt-left}}\nAfter the murder of a counter-protester at the Unite the Right Rally, in a press conference Trump stated that there was \"blame on both sides\" for the violence, stating that some of the counter-protesters were part of the \"very, very violent ... alt-left\".{{refn|<ref>Shear, Michael D. and Haberman, Maggie (August 15, 2017).
