Following the success of \"EHV\", a second programme was published \u2013 Social and Emotional Education (\"SEE\"), primarily for ages 12 to 14+ but it has also proved constructive for older children identified as likely to benefit from help getting their lives 'back on track'.  The programmes enable children and young people to explore and put into practice a wide spectrum of values with the potential to enrich their lives.  Through the experiential learning, over time participants develop a well considered personal morality, all the while gaining invaluable emotional and social skills to help them lead happy, fulfilled, successful lives.\n\n===Character education===\n{{Main|Character education}}\nCharacter education is an umbrella term generally used to describe the teaching of children in a manner that will help them develop as personal and social beings. However, this definition requires research to explain what is meant by \"personal and social being\". Concepts that fall under this term include social and emotional learning, moral reasoning/cognitive development, life skills education, health education; violence prevention, critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and conflict resolution and mediation.

While both mental and physical development is needed for a student's growth, Jeevan Vigyan adds a third pillar \u2013 that of emotional intelligence and morality (or values) \u2013 to education in schools and colleges. A combination of theory and practice, Jeevan Vigyan draws on the findings of various life-sciences as well as nutritional sciences. Our parasympathetic nervous system and endocrinal system are known to be the drivers of our emotions and our behavior. These biological centers can be influenced Science of Living through a system of yogic exercises, breathing exercises, medication and contemplation. Science of Living's source of inspiration is Jain Acharya Ganadhipati Shri Tulsi (1914\u20131997). His thoughts were further developed and expanded by Acharya Shri Mahapragya (1920\u20132010).

Its fully resourced lesson plans utilise familiar teaching techniques of discussion, story-telling, quotations, group singing, activities to reinforce learning and times of quiet reflection.  Following the success of \"EHV\", a second programme was published \u2013 Social and Emotional Education (\"SEE\"), primarily for ages 12 to 14+ but it has also proved constructive for older children identified as likely to benefit from help getting their lives 'back on track'.  The programmes enable children and young people to explore and put into practice a wide spectrum of values with the potential to enrich their lives.  Through the experiential learning, over time participants develop a well considered personal morality, all the while gaining invaluable emotional and social skills to help them lead happy, fulfilled, successful lives.\n\n===Character education===\n{{Main|Character education}}\nCharacter education is an umbrella term generally used to describe the teaching of children in a manner that will help them develop as personal and social beings. However, this definition requires research to explain what is meant by \"personal and social being\". Concepts that fall under this term include social and emotional learning, moral reasoning/cognitive development, life skills education, health education; violence prevention, critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and conflict resolution and mediation. Lickona (1996) mentions eleven principles of successful character education.<ref>Lickona, T.

While both mental and physical development is needed for a student's growth, Jeevan Vigyan adds a third pillar \u2013 that of emotional intelligence and morality (or values) \u2013 to education in schools and colleges. A combination of theory and practice, Jeevan Vigyan draws on the findings of various life-sciences as well as nutritional sciences. Our parasympathetic nervous system and endocrinal system are known to be the drivers of our emotions and our behavior. These biological centers can be influenced Science of Living through a system of yogic exercises, breathing exercises, medication and contemplation. Science of Living's source of inspiration is Jain Acharya Ganadhipati Shri Tulsi (1914\u20131997). His thoughts were further developed and expanded by Acharya Shri Mahapragya (1920\u20132010).

The reason has been said to be the lack of innovative teaching approaches such as the discourse pedagogy.<ref>Thomas, E. (1992).

It is taught in 7th or 8th grade of primary school. Besides this there are two elective subjects that partly deal with values education: Religions and Ethics (for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade) and Philosophy for children (Critical thinking, Ethical exploring, Me and the other; for 7th, 8th, and 9th grade). Slovenian educational system does not require special training in the field of values education for teachers that teach mentioned subjects .\n\n===[[Sweden]]===\nValues education is a part of Swedish schools.

However, Ichiro would get a bit of revenge on Matsuzaka by hitting his 100th career home run off him in July of that year.\n\nMatsuzaka started in the All-Star game as a rookie in 1999. He struck out [[Takuro Ishii]] and [[Takanori Suzuki]] of the Bay Stars before number three hitter [[Yoshinobu Takahashi]] of the Giants managed to make contact and fly out to left field.\n\nIn his first professional season in 1999, Matsuzaka had 16 [[Win (baseball)|win]]s and 5 losses as the team ace, and was voted Rookie of the Year. Another rookie pitcher in the rival [[Central League]], [[Koji Uehara]], also won the same honor with a 20-win season. Together, they would come to represent their respective leagues as dominant starting pitchers for seasons to come.\n\nIn 2000, Matsuzaka had 14 wins and 7 losses. He had 15 wins and 15 losses in his 2001 season and won the [[Eiji Sawamura Award]].\n\nMatsuzaka spent a considerable portion of his 2002 season on the [[disabled list]], which did not count toward his service time. He was not able to regain his pitching form in the [[2002 Japan Series]], when the Lions faced the [[Yomiuri Giants]]. In Game 1 at Tokyo Dome, where the [[designated hitter]] rule is not allowed, Matsuzaka batted 7th in the lineup to take advantage of his above-average hitting for a pitcher. However, not only did Matsuzaka not fare well at the plate in this game, but he also helped the Giants to a rout by giving up two key home runs. One was to extremely popular Giants first baseman [[Kazuhiro Kiyohara]], who hit a middle-of-the-plate Matsuzaka fastball off one of the billboards at the back of the left field stands (That footage can be seen in the external links section). Matsuzaka would give up another key [[RBI]] to Kiyohara in game 4 in relief, as the Lions were meekly swept by the Giants in the series.\n\nIn 2003, Matsuzaka logged 16 wins and 7 losses. He easily won the Pacific League [[Earned run average|ERA]] title with a 2.83 mark. Matsuzaka used to play for [[Japan national baseball team|Japan's National Baseball Team]], and pitched against [[South Korea]].\n\nHe was selected for the [[NPB All-Star Game]] in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006.

He had pitched 72 complete games in Japan.\n\nMatsuzaka signed a multimillion-dollar exclusive deal with trading card company [[Upper Deck Company|Upper Deck]]. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn September 28, 2007 Matsuzaka went eight innings and threw 119 pitches. He allowed six hits and two runs while striking out eight. With the win against the Minnesota Twins to secure the Red Sox's place as the winner of the Division, he closed out his first Major League season with a record of 15\u201312 and an ERA of 4.40.\n\nOn October 6, 2007, Matsuzaka made his Major League playoff debut in the 2007 ALDS, in front of his home crowd in [[Boston]] against the visiting [[Los Angeles Angels]]. Matsuzaka started the game but lasted just 4 and 2/3 innings, giving up 3 earned runs on 7 hits before being pulled. Although Matsuzaka did not get the decision, the Red Sox eventually beat the Angels 6\u20133.\n\nOn October 15, 2007, Matsuzaka started in his second playoff game, in game 3 of the 2007 ALCS against the [[Cleveland Indians]] in [[Cleveland]]. Much like his playoff debut, Matsuzaka delivered another mediocre outing. Again, Matsuzaka was not able to make it past 5 innings, lasting 4 and 2/3 innings, giving up 4 earned runs on 6 hits. Matsuzaka was pulled after going over the 100-pitch mark. Matsuzaka suffered his first career playoff loss as the Indians beat the Red Sox 4\u20132. Matsuzaka fared better in Game 7 of the series, on October 21, 2007, retiring the first eight batters he faced. Matsuzaka pitched well for 5 innings, allowing 2 runs. The Red Sox won 11\u20132, to advance to the [[2007 World Series]] against the [[Colorado Rockies]]. Matsuzaka is the first Japanese pitcher to win an MLB playoff game and only the fifth rookie to start a game seven in the playoffs.\n\nOn October 27, 2007, he started and led the Red Sox to a 10\u20135 win in Game 3 of the 2007 World Series against the Rockies, his first World Series appearance, giving up 2 runs on 3 hits and 3 walks, with 5 strikeouts. In the game, he also recorded his first major league hit: a two-out 2-run single off [[Josh Fogg]], making Matsuzaka the third pitcher in Red Sox history to record two RBIs in a World Series game; the others were [[Babe Ruth]] (in Game 4 of the [[1918 World Series]]) and [[Cy Young]]. Matsuzaka is also the first Japanese pitcher in World Series history to start and win a game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=271027127|title=Matsuzaka and Red Sox beat Rockies 10\u20135 to take 3\u20130 World Series lead|work=[[Yahoo!Sports]]|date=2007-10-27|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> The next day, the Red Sox won the Series in Game 4.

The Red Sox placed Matsuzaka on the disabled list May 30, 2008, with a mild right [[rotator cuff]] strain.

On September 15 he won his 17th game of the season, setting a new single-season record for Japanese MLB pitchers, passing previous record holder [[Hideo Nomo]].\n\nMatsuzaka ended the season with an 18\u20133 record, 2.90 ERA and held opponents to a .211 batting average (and 6.9 hits-per-9-innings), the lowest in the majors.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-standard-pitching.shtml 2008 Major League Baseball Standard Pitching].

Retrieved May 2, 2009.</ref> These numbers were enough to place him 4th in the [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award]] race. However, a major problem for Matsuzaka was the control of his pitches, which, combined with his lack of innings pitched due to his injury, factored into his Cy Young voting. He walked 94 batters in 167 and 2/3 innings (a major-league-leading 13.1% of all batters he faced), even walking an eye-popping eight in one game against the [[Detroit Tigers]] on May 5.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-ratio-pitching.shtml 2008 Major League Baseball Pitching Ratios]. Baseball-Reference.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-13.</ref>  Eight times in the 2008 season, Matsuzaka surrendered walks to five or more batters in a game, and 12 times he walked three or more in a game. The interesting statistic is that Matsuzaka was 11\u20131 in the 16 starts he walked three or more batters, which was a testament to his ability to wiggle out of whatever trouble he got himself into.\n\nMatsuzaka started Game 2 of the American League Divisional Series against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] and fared well over five-plus innings, handing the ball over to fellow countryman [[Hideki Okajima]]. However, Game 1 of the [[2008 American League Championship Series]] was where Matsuzaka had his first solid postseason start. In 7-plus innings, he no-hit the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] before giving up a hit to [[Carl Crawford]] to start the 7th and got the win. However, at home in Game 5, Matsuzaka was rocked in four-plus innings for five runs on five hits, walking two, striking out two, and giving up three home runs to [[B.J. Upton]], [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]], and [[Evan Longoria]]. Boston however staged a miracle comeback to win 8\u20137. The Tampa Bay Rays went on to win the 2008 American League Pennant.\n\n====2009 season====\n[[File:IMG 0497 Daisuke Matsuzaka.jpg|280px|thumb|Matsuzaka pitching for the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]], triple-A affiliates of the Boston Red Sox, in 2009]]\nWhen Matsuzaka decided to pitch in the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]], the Red Sox were concerned with his decision being that it would cause him to miss a majority of spring training. Red Sox manager [[Terry Francona]] asked Team Japan manager [[Tatsunori Hara]] to keep him updated on Matsuzaka's condition along with limiting Matsuzaka's pitch count. Throughout the WBC, the Red Sox had limited access to Matsuzaka and decided not to press the issue more with Hara. Matsuzaka went on to lead Team Japan to victory earning the MVP award with a 3\u20130 record and 2.45 ERA.\n\nOn March 27, 2009, Matsuzaka reported to Red Sox spring training only twelve days before opening day. In Matsuzaka's first start of the regular season, he gave up three home runs against the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], ultimately losing the game.<ref>[http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090409&content_id=4177134&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=bos Ninth-inning rally comes up short | redsox.com: News].

He was crowned the [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] of the first [[World Baseball Classic]] after Team Japan defeated [[Cuba national baseball team|Team Cuba]] 10\u20136 in the finals. Matsuzaka, the winner of the finale, threw 4 innings of 1 run baseball before exiting. Overall, Matsuzaka pitched a total of 13 innings throughout the tournament while finishing with 3 wins and no losses. There had been talk of Matsuzaka wanting to go to [[Major League Baseball]] before the '06 WBC, and the tournament allowed Matsuzaka to show his skills on the worldwide stage. Interest in Matsuzaka from MLB teams boomed after his performance throughout the WBC.\n\n===2009 World Baseball Classic===\nMatsuzaka was a member of the Japanese team at the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]], playing a key role as they successfully defended their title. He also won his second World Baseball Classic MVP award, finishing the tournament with a 3\u20130 record and a 2.45 ERA.

The [[Pacific League]] employs the [[designated hitter]] rule. Matsuzaka's first pro home run came in an interleague game against Hanshin Tigers pitcher [[Darwin Cubill\u00e1n]] at spacious [[Koshien Stadium]] on June 9, 2006. That footage can be seen in the external links section.\n\nMatsuzaka had his first hit with the Red Sox on May 23, 2010, in Philadelphia. He also was tremendous in the post-season with his bat.

However, Ichiro would get a bit of revenge on Matsuzaka by hitting his 100th career home run off him in July of that year.\n\nMatsuzaka started in the All-Star game as a rookie in 1999. He struck out [[Takuro Ishii]] and [[Takanori Suzuki]] of the Bay Stars before number three hitter [[Yoshinobu Takahashi]] of the Giants managed to make contact and fly out to left field.\n\nIn his first professional season in 1999, Matsuzaka had 16 [[Win (baseball)|win]]s and 5 losses as the team ace, and was voted Rookie of the Year. Another rookie pitcher in the rival [[Central League]], [[Koji Uehara]], also won the same honor with a 20-win season. Together, they would come to represent their respective leagues as dominant starting pitchers for seasons to come.\n\nIn 2000, Matsuzaka had 14 wins and 7 losses. He had 15 wins and 15 losses in his 2001 season and won the [[Eiji Sawamura Award]].\n\nMatsuzaka spent a considerable portion of his 2002 season on the [[disabled list]], which did not count toward his service time. He was not able to regain his pitching form in the [[2002 Japan Series]], when the Lions faced the [[Yomiuri Giants]]. In Game 1 at Tokyo Dome, where the [[designated hitter]] rule is not allowed, Matsuzaka batted 7th in the lineup to take advantage of his above-average hitting for a pitcher. However, not only did Matsuzaka not fare well at the plate in this game, but he also helped the Giants to a rout by giving up two key home runs. One was to extremely popular Giants first baseman [[Kazuhiro Kiyohara]], who hit a middle-of-the-plate Matsuzaka fastball off one of the billboards at the back of the left field stands (That footage can be seen in the external links section). Matsuzaka would give up another key [[RBI]] to Kiyohara in game 4 in relief, as the Lions were meekly swept by the Giants in the series.\n\nIn 2003, Matsuzaka logged 16 wins and 7 losses. He easily won the Pacific League [[Earned run average|ERA]] title with a 2.83 mark. Matsuzaka used to play for [[Japan national baseball team|Japan's National Baseball Team]], and pitched against [[South Korea]].\n\nHe was selected for the [[NPB All-Star Game]] in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006.

He had pitched 72 complete games in Japan.\n\nMatsuzaka signed a multimillion-dollar exclusive deal with trading card company [[Upper Deck Company|Upper Deck]]. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn September 28, 2007 Matsuzaka went eight innings and threw 119 pitches. He allowed six hits and two runs while striking out eight. With the win against the Minnesota Twins to secure the Red Sox's place as the winner of the Division, he closed out his first Major League season with a record of 15\u201312 and an ERA of 4.40.\n\nOn October 6, 2007, Matsuzaka made his Major League playoff debut in the 2007 ALDS, in front of his home crowd in [[Boston]] against the visiting [[Los Angeles Angels]]. Matsuzaka started the game but lasted just 4 and 2/3 innings, giving up 3 earned runs on 7 hits before being pulled. Although Matsuzaka did not get the decision, the Red Sox eventually beat the Angels 6\u20133.\n\nOn October 15, 2007, Matsuzaka started in his second playoff game, in game 3 of the 2007 ALCS against the [[Cleveland Indians]] in [[Cleveland]]. Much like his playoff debut, Matsuzaka delivered another mediocre outing. Again, Matsuzaka was not able to make it past 5 innings, lasting 4 and 2/3 innings, giving up 4 earned runs on 6 hits. Matsuzaka was pulled after going over the 100-pitch mark. Matsuzaka suffered his first career playoff loss as the Indians beat the Red Sox 4\u20132. Matsuzaka fared better in Game 7 of the series, on October 21, 2007, retiring the first eight batters he faced. Matsuzaka pitched well for 5 innings, allowing 2 runs. The Red Sox won 11\u20132, to advance to the [[2007 World Series]] against the [[Colorado Rockies]]. Matsuzaka is the first Japanese pitcher to win an MLB playoff game and only the fifth rookie to start a game seven in the playoffs.\n\nOn October 27, 2007, he started and led the Red Sox to a 10\u20135 win in Game 3 of the 2007 World Series against the Rockies, his first World Series appearance, giving up 2 runs on 3 hits and 3 walks, with 5 strikeouts. In the game, he also recorded his first major league hit: a two-out 2-run single off [[Josh Fogg]], making Matsuzaka the third pitcher in Red Sox history to record two RBIs in a World Series game; the others were [[Babe Ruth]] (in Game 4 of the [[1918 World Series]]) and [[Cy Young]]. Matsuzaka is also the first Japanese pitcher in World Series history to start and win a game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=271027127|title=Matsuzaka and Red Sox beat Rockies 10\u20135 to take 3\u20130 World Series lead|work=[[Yahoo!Sports]]|date=2007-10-27|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref> The next day, the Red Sox won the Series in Game 4.

The Red Sox placed Matsuzaka on the disabled list May 30, 2008, with a mild right [[rotator cuff]] strain.

On September 15 he won his 17th game of the season, setting a new single-season record for Japanese MLB pitchers, passing previous record holder [[Hideo Nomo]].\n\nMatsuzaka ended the season with an 18\u20133 record, 2.90 ERA and held opponents to a .211 batting average (and 6.9 hits-per-9-innings), the lowest in the majors.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-standard-pitching.shtml 2008 Major League Baseball Standard Pitching].

Retrieved May 2, 2009.</ref> These numbers were enough to place him 4th in the [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award]] race. However, a major problem for Matsuzaka was the control of his pitches, which, combined with his lack of innings pitched due to his injury, factored into his Cy Young voting. He walked 94 batters in 167 and 2/3 innings (a major-league-leading 13.1% of all batters he faced), even walking an eye-popping eight in one game against the [[Detroit Tigers]] on May 5.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2008-ratio-pitching.shtml 2008 Major League Baseball Pitching Ratios]. Baseball-Reference.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-13.</ref>  Eight times in the 2008 season, Matsuzaka surrendered walks to five or more batters in a game, and 12 times he walked three or more in a game. The interesting statistic is that Matsuzaka was 11\u20131 in the 16 starts he walked three or more batters, which was a testament to his ability to wiggle out of whatever trouble he got himself into.\n\nMatsuzaka started Game 2 of the American League Divisional Series against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] and fared well over five-plus innings, handing the ball over to fellow countryman [[Hideki Okajima]]. However, Game 1 of the [[2008 American League Championship Series]] was where Matsuzaka had his first solid postseason start. In 7-plus innings, he no-hit the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] before giving up a hit to [[Carl Crawford]] to start the 7th and got the win. However, at home in Game 5, Matsuzaka was rocked in four-plus innings for five runs on five hits, walking two, striking out two, and giving up three home runs to [[B.J. Upton]], [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]], and [[Evan Longoria]]. Boston however staged a miracle comeback to win 8\u20137. The Tampa Bay Rays went on to win the 2008 American League Pennant.\n\n====2009 season====\n[[File:IMG 0497 Daisuke Matsuzaka.jpg|280px|thumb|Matsuzaka pitching for the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]], triple-A affiliates of the Boston Red Sox, in 2009]]\nWhen Matsuzaka decided to pitch in the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]], the Red Sox were concerned with his decision being that it would cause him to miss a majority of spring training. Red Sox manager [[Terry Francona]] asked Team Japan manager [[Tatsunori Hara]] to keep him updated on Matsuzaka's condition along with limiting Matsuzaka's pitch count. Throughout the WBC, the Red Sox had limited access to Matsuzaka and decided not to press the issue more with Hara. Matsuzaka went on to lead Team Japan to victory earning the MVP award with a 3\u20130 record and 2.45 ERA.\n\nOn March 27, 2009, Matsuzaka reported to Red Sox spring training only twelve days before opening day. In Matsuzaka's first start of the regular season, he gave up three home runs against the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], ultimately losing the game.<ref>[http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090409&content_id=4177134&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=bos Ninth-inning rally comes up short | redsox.com: News].

Matsuzaka, the winner of the finale, threw 4 innings of 1 run baseball before exiting. Overall, Matsuzaka pitched a total of 13 innings throughout the tournament while finishing with 3 wins and no losses. There had been talk of Matsuzaka wanting to go to [[Major League Baseball]] before the '06 WBC, and the tournament allowed Matsuzaka to show his skills on the worldwide stage. Interest in Matsuzaka from MLB teams boomed after his performance throughout the WBC.\n\n===2009 World Baseball Classic===\nMatsuzaka was a member of the Japanese team at the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]], playing a key role as they successfully defended their title.

The [[Pacific League]] employs the [[designated hitter]] rule. Matsuzaka's first pro home run came in an interleague game against Hanshin Tigers pitcher [[Darwin Cubill\u00e1n]] at spacious [[Koshien Stadium]] on June 9, 2006. That footage can be seen in the external links section.\n\nMatsuzaka had his first hit with the Red Sox on May 23, 2010, in Philadelphia. He also was tremendous in the post-season with his bat.
