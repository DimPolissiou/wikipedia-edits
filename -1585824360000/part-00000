This is evident in the name of the local historic building, '[[Llanelly House]]'. It can also lead to confusion with the village and parish, [[Llanelly]], which is in south-east Wales near [[Abergavenny]].\nLlanelly in Victoria, Australia was named after the town of Llanelli (or Llanelly as it was known as in the 19th century).\n\n==Location==\nThe town lies on the [[River Lliedi]], on the north coast of the [[Loughor Estuary]] inlet, which opens out into [[Carmarthen Bay]], and the [[Bristol Channel]]. Llanelli is within the western Welsh county of [[Carmarthenshire]], and is situated to the north-west of the city of [[Swansea]] and to the south-east of the county town of [[Carmarthen]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Llanelli history}}\nThe first beginnings of Llanelli can be found on the lands of present-day Parc Howard. An Iron Age hill fort once stood which was called ''Bryn-Caerau'' (hill of the forts). Evidence suggests that there were many as 5 hill forts from Old Road to the Dimpath.\nDuring the dark ages a saint named Elli or Ellyw who in legend is the son or daughter (gender not known) of King Brychan set up a church on the banks of the [[Afon Lliedi]]. It was around this time that the people of Bryn-Caerau began to come down the hill either to the [[Felinfoel]] area or to near [[St Ellyw's Church, Llanelli|Saint Ellyw's church]]. This was the start of the building of the town and its church. Originally the church would've been a wooden or partly stone thatched chapel. It wasn't until the 1200s that they built the stone tower and a stone church. However the church (excluding the tower) was rebuilt at the beginning of the 20th century. The reason the church still looks old is for it was rebuilt with the same stones with the same plan.\nHistorically a mining town, Llanelli grew significantly in the 18th century and 19th century with the [[mining]] of [[coal]] and later the tinplate industry and [[steel]]works. Many of these industries were served by the [[Llanelly and Mynydd Mawr Railway]] which opened in 1803.\n\nLlanelli became such a significant regional producer of tin that it was referred to as \"Tinopolis\" by the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=Tin>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Bill |last2=Lewis |first2= Ronald L.|date=May 2007|title=Gender and Transnationality among Welsh Tinplate Workers in Pittsburgh: The Hattie Williams Affair, 1895 |journal=Labor History|volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=178 |doi= }}</ref> The closure of coal mines and competition from overseas steel plants meant that Llanelli, like many other towns in southern Wales, saw significant and sustained economic decline from the late 1970s.\n\nPeople from Llanelli are sometimes nicknamed \"Turks\". The origin of this name is uncertain. One theory is that many Turkish sailors once called at the port of Llanelli during their voyages.<ref name=\"WallerCriddle1999\">{{cite book|last1=Waller|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Waller (pundit)|last2=Criddle|first2=Byron|title=The Almanac of British Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mC7pEr0R6QC&pg=PA326|work=[[Almanac of British Politics]]|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-18541-7|page=326}}</ref>\n\n==Culture and language==\n===National Eisteddfod===\nLlanelli has hosted the [[National Eisteddfod]] six times: in 1895, 1903, 1930, 1962, 2000 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-28605239|title=National Eisteddfod held in Llanelli for sixth time|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n===Welsh language===\nIn the mid-20th century, Llanelli was the largest town in the world where more than half the population spoke a [[Celtic language]].<ref>The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008.</ref> It is ranked the [[List of urban areas in Wales by population|7th largest urban area in Wales]]. According to the [[2011 UK Census]] returns, 23.7 per cent of Llanelli town residents habitually spoke [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. However, the area around Llanelli is a Welsh stronghold where 56 per cent do so in communities such as [[Llwynhendy]] and [[Burry Port]].\n\nDuring the 1950s, Trefor and [[Eileen Beasley]] campaigned to get Llanelli Rural Council to distribute tax papers in Welsh by refusing to pay taxes until their demand was met. The council reacted by sending in the bailiffs and selling their furniture to recover the money owed. The Beasleys' neighbours bought the furniture and returned it to them. The council finally reversed this policy in the 1960s, when it accepted that Welsh should have equal status with English language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/08/13/tributes-paid-to-welsh-language-activist-eileen-beasley-who-died-age-91-91466-31616229/ |title=Tributes paid to Welsh language activist Eileen Beasley, who died age 91 |publisher=WalesOnline |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=18 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117163508/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/08/13/tributes-paid-to-welsh-language-activist-eileen-beasley-who-died-age-91-91466-31616229/ |archivedate=17 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nIn 1991 Llanelli was a distinct [[Travel to Work Area]], but the 2001-based revision has merged the locality into a wider [[Swansea Bay (region)|Swansea Bay]] Travel to Work Area.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/downloads/Introduction_to_2001_TTWAs.pdf National Statistics, Introduction to the 2001-based Travel-to-Work Areas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305103131/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/geography/downloads/Introduction_to_2001_TTWAs.pdf |date=5 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Manufacture===\nA number of manufacturing companies (including the [[Tata Steel Europe]] [[tinplate]] works at [[Trostre Steelworks|Trostre]], and [[Dyfed Steels]]), many of which service the automotive industry, are in the area around Llanelli.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/jcp/stellent/groups/jcp/documents/websitecontent/dev_012099.doc|title=DISTRICT SPECIFICATION AND LOCAL INFORMATION FOR SOUTH WEST WALES|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927141245/http://www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk/jcp/stellent/groups/jcp/documents/websitecontent/dev_012099.doc|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Technium]] Performance Engineering Centre was developed at Llanelli Gate as a business incubator for businesses in the automotive, motorsport and aerospace sectors.<ref>[http://www.technium.co.uk/server.php?show=nav.8343 Technium Performance Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228152011/http://www.technium.co.uk/server.php?show=nav.8343 |date=28 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe traditional industries of Llanelli have been in gradual decline over recent decades and local government has responded by promoting developments such as the [[Machynys]] Golf Course, new retail parks at Trostre and [[Pemberton, Carmarthenshire|Pemberton]], and the [[Millennium Coastal Park]], to help attract tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wales.gov.uk/dpsp/wsp/1909654/549512/549520/864628/WSP(SB-O)06-07_key_settleme1.rtf?lang=cy|title=Strategic Development Project: Overview of Progress|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2018}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The core shopping area has now largely relocated from the town centre to the Trostre/Pemberton area.\n\n===Brewing===\nLlanelli has a brewing tradition, with the [[Felinfoel Brewery]] in [[Felinfoel]], located just outside the town.<ref name=\"footnote_3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.felinfoel-brewery.com/|title=Felinfoel Brewery - The oldest brewery in Wales|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe Reverend James Buckley was an ordained [[Methodist]] minister, born in [[Oldham]], [[Lancashire]] in 1770.

This is evident in the name of the local historic building, '[[Llanelly House]]'. It can also lead to confusion with the village and parish, [[Llanelly]], which is in south-east Wales near [[Abergavenny]].\nLlanelly in Victoria, Australia was named after the town of Llanelli (or Llanelly as it was known as in the 19th century).\n\n==Location==\nThe town lies on the [[River Lliedi]], on the north coast of the [[Loughor Estuary]] inlet, which opens out into [[Carmarthen Bay]], and the [[Bristol Channel]]. Llanelli is within the western Welsh county of [[Carmarthenshire]], and is situated to the north-west of the city of [[Swansea]] and to the south-east of the county town of [[Carmarthen]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Llanelli history}}\nThe first beginnings of Llanelli can be found on the lands of present-day Parc Howard. An Iron Age hill fort once stood which was called ''Bryn-Caerau'' (hill of the forts). Evidence suggests that there were many as 5 hill forts from Old Road to the Dimpath.\nDuring the dark ages a saint named Elli or Ellyw who in legend is the son or daughter (gender not known) of King Brychan set up a church on the banks of the [[Afon Lliedi]]. It was around this time that the people of Bryn-Caerau began to come down the hill either to the [[Felinfoel]] area or to near [[St Ellyw's Church, Llanelli|Saint Ellyw's church]]. This was the start of the building of the town and its church. Originally the church would've been a wooden or partly stone thatched chapel. It wasn't until the 1200s that they built the stone tower and a stone church. However the church (excluding the tower) was rebuilt at the beginning of the 20th century. The reason the church still looks old is for it was rebuilt with the same stones with the same plan.\nHistorically a mining town, Llanelli grew significantly in the 18th century and 19th century with the [[mining]] of [[coal]] and later the tinplate industry and [[steel]]works. Many of these industries were served by the [[Llanelly and Mynydd Mawr Railway]] which opened in 1803.\n\nLlanelli became such a significant regional producer of tin that it was referred to as \"Tinopolis\" by the latter half of the 19th century.<ref name=Tin>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Bill |last2=Lewis |first2= Ronald L.|date=May 2007|title=Gender and Transnationality among Welsh Tinplate Workers in Pittsburgh: The Hattie Williams Affair, 1895 |journal=Labor History|volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=178 |doi= }}</ref> The closure of coal mines and competition from overseas steel plants meant that Llanelli, like many other towns in southern Wales, saw significant and sustained economic decline from the late 1970s.\n\nPeople from Llanelli are sometimes nicknamed \"Turks\". The origin of this name is uncertain. One theory is that many Turkish sailors once called at the port of Llanelli during their voyages.<ref name=\"WallerCriddle1999\">{{cite book|last1=Waller|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Waller (pundit)|last2=Criddle|first2=Byron|title=The Almanac of British Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mC7pEr0R6QC&pg=PA326|work=[[Almanac of British Politics]]|year=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-18541-7|page=326}}</ref>\n\n==Culture and language==\n===National Eisteddfod===\nLlanelli has hosted the [[National Eisteddfod]] six times: in 1895, 1903, 1930, 1962, 2000 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-28605239|title=National Eisteddfod held in Llanelli for sixth time|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n===Welsh language===\nIn the mid-20th century, Llanelli was the largest town in the world where more than half the population spoke a [[Celtic language]].<ref>The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008.</ref> It is ranked the [[List of urban areas in Wales by population|7th largest urban area in Wales]]. According to the [[2011 UK Census]] returns, 23.7 per cent of Llanelli town residents habitually spoke [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. However, the area around Llanelli is a Welsh stronghold where 56 per cent do so in communities such as [[Llwynhendy]] and [[Burry Port]].\n\nDuring the 1950s, Trefor and [[Eileen Beasley]] campaigned to get Llanelli Rural Council to distribute tax papers in Welsh by refusing to pay taxes until their demand was met.

In reaction to this, there have been calls to reinstate the local government district of Llanelli either as a county or as the City of Llanelli, returning the entire area to a one party enclave.\nThe community of Llanelli is bordered by the communities of [[Llanelli Rural]]; [[Llanrhidian Higher]]; and [[Llanrhidian Lower]], the latter two being in the [[City and County of Swansea]].\n\n===Twinning===\nLlanelli is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:<ref name=Twinnings>{{Cite web |title=Llanelli Town Council |url=http://www.llanellitowncouncil.gov.uk/llanelli-twinned-with-agen-france.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311075442/http://www.llanellitowncouncil.gov.uk/llanelli-twinned-with-agen-france.html |archivedate=11 March 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> \n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Agen]], France\n\n===Town areas===\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Bigyn]]\n*[[Glanym\u00f4r]]\n*[[Llanerch]]\n*[[Machynys]]\n*[[Morfa, Llanelli|Morfa]]\n*[[Tyisha]]\n*[[New Dock]]\n*[[Sandy, Carmarthenshire|Sandy]]\n*[[Stradey]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Towns and villages near Llanelli==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Llwynhendy]]\n*[[Burry Port]]\n*[[Bynea]]\n*[[Pwll]]\n*[[Felinfoel]]\n*[[Dafen, Carmarthenshire|Dafen]]\n*[[Carway]]\n*[[Furnace, Carmarthenshire|Furnace]]\n*[[Pemberton, Carmarthenshire|Pemberton]]\n*[[Llangennech]]\n*Yr [[Hendy]]\n*[[Cwmbach, Carmarthenshire|Cwmbach]]\n*[[Trimsaran]]\n*[[Bryn, Llanelli|Bryn]]\n*[[Pen-y-graig]]\n*[[Cwmcarnhywel]]\n*[[Five Roads]]\n*[[Cynheidre]]\n*[[Horeb, Carmarthenshire|Horeb]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Current developments==\n===Llanelli Waterside===\n[[Llanelli Waterside]], a joint venture between [[Carmarthenshire County Council]] and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]], is a project that aims to drive the regeneration of the Llanelli area by transforming the waterfront into a business, leisure and residential community.

And then I played it on \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Crimson and Clover\", \"Do You Want to Touch Me\", \"Bad Reputation\" ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It's so beautiful. It's white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It's an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don't even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it.

The plug was pulled on the project halfway through shooting after Jett fell ill, but in 1984, after she became famous, producers looked for a way to use the footage from the incomplete film.<ref name=MTV/> Parts of the original footage of Jett were eventually used in another project, an underground film called ''DuBeat-Eo'', which was produced by Alan Sacks but not commercially released.<ref name=MTV/>\n\nJett and Laguna entered [[the Who]]'s [[Ramport Studios]] with the latter at the helm, and Jett's self-titled solo debut was released by [[Ariola Records]] in Europe on May 17, 1980.

The final addition to the original Blackhearts was drummer Danny \"Furious\" O'Brien, formerly of the San Francisco band the [[Avengers (band)|Avengers]]. This lineup played several gigs at the [[Golden Bear (nightclub)|Golden Bear]], in Huntington Beach, California and the [[Whisky a Go Go]] in Hollywood before embarking on their first European tour, which consisted of an extensive tour of the Netherlands and a few key shows in England, including the Marquee in London.<ref name=\"badrep\">{{cite web| last=Jett|first=Joan|title=Joan Jett and the Blackhearts&nbsp;\u2013 An Open Forum with Joan Jett!|volume=2, Issue 4|website=Bad Reputation Nation|date=July 1992|url=http://joanjettbadrep.com/Interviews/fanclub/Vol2Issue4.shtml|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLaguna fired O'Brien at the end of the tour,<ref name=\"Record8\"/> and upon returning to the States, Jett, Ryan, and Ambel moved to [[Long Beach, New York]].

The [[Riot Grrrl]] movement started in the 1990s, with Bikini Kill as a representative band, and many of these women credited Jett as a role model and inspiration.\n\nIn 1997, Jett was featured on the ''We Will Fall: The Iggy Pop Tribute'' album. She performed a cover of the [[Johnny O'Keefe]] song \"[[Wild One (Johnny O'Keefe song)|Wild One]]\" (or \"Real Wild Child\"). Jett worked with members of the punk rock band [[the Gits]], whose lead singer and lyricist, [[Mia Zapata]], had been raped and murdered in 1993.<ref name=\"VH1\"/> The results of their collaboration was a live album, ''[[Evil Stig]]'' and a single, \"Bob\", whose earnings were contributed to the investigation of Zapata's murder. To this end, the band and Jett appeared on the television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', appealing to the public for information. The case was solved in 2004, when Zapata's murderer, Jesus Mezquia, was brought to trial and convicted.\n\nJett is a guest artist on [[Marky Ramone and the Intruders]]' 1999 album ''The Answer to Your Problems?'' on the track \"Don't Blame Me\".

And then I played it on \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", \"Crimson and Clover\", \"Do You Want to Touch Me\", \"Bad Reputation\" ...all those early records. Then I took it off the road because I got nervous that someone was gonna steal it or break it. It's so beautiful. It's white, has no stickers on it, and there are cracks in the paint and yellowing from age or club cigarettes. It's an unbelievable-looking guitar. I have it in a closet and I take it out occasionally to record. But I don't even need to use it to record anymore, because I have a guitar that sounds pretty much like it.

A member of [[Aosd\u00e1na]], he is [[poetry|poet]], playwright, [[haiku]]ist, [[tanka]]ist, essayist, and author/[[translator]] of over 180 books, mostly in Irish. Born in [[Kilfinane]], [[County Limerick]], he currently resides in [[Dublin]].\n\n==Biography==\nRosenstock's father George was a [[physician|doctor]] and writer from [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]], who served as a German army doctor in World War II. His mother was a [[nurse]] from [[County Galway]]. Gabriel was the third of six children and the first born in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. He was educated locally in Kilfinane, then in Mount Sackville, Co Dublin; exhibiting an early interest in anarchism he was expelled from [[Gormanston College]], Co. Meath and exiled to [[Rockwell College]], Co. Tipperary; then on to [[University College Cork]].\n\nHis son Tristan Rosenstock is a member of the traditional Irish quintet [[T\u00e9ada]], and [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]]/actor [[Mario Rosenstock]] is his nephew.\n\n==Work==\nRosenstock worked for some time on the television series ''Anois is Ar\u00eds'' on [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]], then on the weekly newspaper ''[[Anois]]''. Until his retirement he worked with ''[[An G\u00fam]]'', the publications branch of ''[[Foras na Gaeilge]]'', the [[The North/South Language Body|North-South body]] which promotes the Irish language.\n\nAlthough he has worked in [[prose]], [[Play (theatre)|drama]] and [[translation]], Rosenstock is primarily known as a poet. He has written or translated over 180 books.\n\nHe has edited and contributed to books of haiku in Irish, English, Scots and Japanese. He is a prolific translator into Irish of international poetry (among others [[Ko Un]], [[Seamus Heaney]], [[K.
