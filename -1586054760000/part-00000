After [[World War II]], the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] governments adopted that usage officially, while the growing African nationalist movement and its liberal allies turned to the term \"African\" instead, so that \"Bantu\" became identified with the policies of [[apartheid]]. By the 1970s this so discredited \"Bantu\" as an ethno-racial designation that the apartheid government switched to the term \"Black\" in its official racial categorizations, restricting it to Bantu-speaking Africans, at about the same time that the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] led by [[Steve Biko]] and others were defining \"Black\" to mean all non-European South Africans (Bantus, Khoisan, Coloureds, and [[Asians in South Africa|Indians]]).\n\nExamples of South African usages of \"Bantu\" include:\n\n# One of South Africa's politicians of recent times, General Bantubonke Harrington Holomisa (Bantubonke is a [[compound noun]] meaning \"all the people\"), is known as [[Bantu Holomisa]].\n# The South African apartheid governments originally gave the name \"[[bantustan]]s\" to the eleven rural reserve areas intended for nominal independence to deny indigenous Bantu South Africans citizenship. \"Bantustan\" originally reflected an analogy to the various ethnic \"-stans\" of Western and Central Asia. Again association with apartheid discredited the term, and the South African government shifted to the politically appealing but historically deceptive term \"ethnic homelands\". Meanwhile, the anti-apartheid movement persisted in calling the areas bantustans, to drive home their political illegitimacy.\n# The abstract noun ''[[Ubuntu (philosophy)|ubuntu]]'', humanity or humaneness, is derived regularly from the [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] noun stem ''-ntu'' in Xhosa, Zulu, and Ndebele. In Swati the stem is ''-ntfu'' and the noun is ''buntfu''.\n# In the [[Sotho\u2013Tswana languages]] of southern Africa, ''batho'' is the cognate term to Nguni ''abantu'', illustrating that such cognates need not actually look like the ''-ntu'' root exactly. The early [[African National Congress]] of South Africa had a newspaper called ''Abantu-Batho'' from 1912\u20131933, which carried columns in English, Zulu, Sotho, and Xhosa.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Kongo people2.jpg|[[Kongo people|Kongo]] youth and adults in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\nFile:Kikyuyu-woman.jpeg|A Kikuyu woman in [[Kenya]]\nFile:Mozambique001.jpg|A [[Makua people|Makua]] mother and child in [[Mozambique]]\nFile:Bubi children.jpg|[[Bubi people|Bubi]] girls in [[Equatorial Guinea]]\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[African Pygmies]]\n* [[Bantu mythology]]\n* [[Congoid]]\n* [[Demographics of Africa]]\n* [[Genetic history of Sub-Saharan Africa]]\n* [[History of West Africa]]\n* [[Khoisan]]\n* [[Languages of Africa]]\n* [[List of ethnic groups of Africa]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Christopher Ehret, ''An African Classical Age: Eastern and Southern Africa in World History, 1000 B.C. to A.D. 400'', James Currey, London, 1998\n* Christopher Ehret and Merrick Posnansky, eds., ''The Archaeological and Linguistic Reconstruction of African History'', University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1982\n* April A.

They would have also encountered some [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] outlier groups in the southeast (mainly [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]),<ref name=\"Falola\">Toyin Falola, Aribidesi Adisa Usman, ''Movements, borders, and identities in Africa'', (University Rochester Press: 2009), pp.4-5.</ref><ref name=\"Fitzpatrick\">{{cite book|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Mary|title=Tanzania, Zanzibar & Pemba|year=1999|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-0-86442-726-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/tanzaniazanzibar00hawt/page/39 39]|url=https://archive.org/details/tanzaniazanzibar00hawt/page/39}}</ref>\nas well as   [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] (mainly [[Nilotic languages|Nilotic]] and [[Sudanic languages|Sudanic]]) groups.\nAs cattle terminology in use amongst the few modern Bantu [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] groups suggests, it is plausible that the acquisition of [[cattle]] was from their Cushitic-speaking neighbors.

On the [[Zambezi]] river, the [[Monomatapa]] kings built the  [[Great Zimbabwe]] complex, a civilisation ancestral to the [[Shona people]]. \nComparable sites  in Southern Africa, include [[Bumbusi National Monument|Bumbusi]] in Zimbabwe and [[Manyikeni]] in Mozambique.\n\nFrom the 12th century onward, the processes of state formation amongst Bantu peoples increased in frequency. This was probably due to denser population (which led to more specialized divisions of labor, including military power, while making emigration more difficult); to technological developments in economic activity; and to new techniques in the political-spiritual ritualization of royalty as the source of national strength and health.<ref>Shillington (2005)</ref>\nSome examples of such Bantu states include: in Central Africa, the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], [[Lunda Empire]],  [[Luba Empire]] of Angola, the [[History of Buganda|Buganda]]  Kingdoms of Uganda and Tanzania; and in Southern Africa, the [[Mutapa Empire]], the [[Danamombe]], [[Khami]], and [[Naletale]] Kingdoms of Zimbabwe and Mozambique<ref>Roland Oliver, et al. \"Africa South of the Equator,\" in Africa Since 1800.

With the arrival of European colonialists, the Zanzibar Sultanate came into direct trade conflict and competition with [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and other Europeans along the Swahili Coast, leading eventually to the fall of the Sultanate and the end of slave trading on the Swahili Coast in the mid-20th century.\n\n==List of Bantu groups by country{{anchor|List}}==\n{{see|Bantu_languages#By_country|List of African ethnic groups|List of African countries by population}}\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Country\n!Total population<br/>(millions, 2015 est.)\n! % Bantu \n!Bantu population<br/>(millions, 2015 est.)\n!Zones\n!Bantu groups\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]|| 77 || 80% || 62 ||B, C, D, H, J, K, L, M || [[Kongo people|Bakongo]], [[Mongo people|Mongo]], [[Luba people|Baluba]], numerous others ( Ambala, Ambuun, Angba, Babindi, Baboma, Baholo, Balunda, Bangala, Bango, Batsamba, Bazombe,[[Bemba people|Bemba]], [[Bembe people|Bembe]], Bira, Bowa, Dikidiki, Dzing, Fuliru, Havu, Hema, Hima, Hunde, Hutu, Iboko, Kanioka, Kaonde, Kuba, [[Komo language (Bantu)|Komo]], Kwango, Lengola, Lokele, Lupu, Lwalwa, Mbala, Mbole, Mbuza (Budja), Nande, Ngoli, Bangoli, Ngombe, Nkumu,[[Nyanga people|Nyanga]], Pende, Popoi, Poto, Sango, Shi, Songo, Sukus, Tabwa, Tchokw\u00e9, T\u00e9k\u00e9, Tembo, Tetela, Topoke, Ungana, Vira, Wakuti, Yaka, Yakoma, Yanzi, Yeke, Yela, total 80% Bantu)\n|-\n|[[List of ethnic groups in Tanzania|Tanzania]] || 51 || 90%?

After [[World War II]], the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] governments adopted that usage officially, while the growing African nationalist movement and its liberal allies turned to the term \"African\" instead, so that \"Bantu\" became identified with the policies of [[apartheid]]. By the 1970s this so discredited \"Bantu\" as an ethno-racial designation that the apartheid government switched to the term \"Black\" in its official racial categorizations, restricting it to Bantu-speaking Africans, at about the same time that the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] led by [[Steve Biko]] and others were defining \"Black\" to mean all non-European South Africans (Bantus, Khoisan, Coloureds, and [[Asians in South Africa|Indians]]).\n\nExamples of South African usages of \"Bantu\" include:\n\n# One of South Africa's politicians of recent times, General Bantubonke Harrington Holomisa (Bantubonke is a [[compound noun]] meaning \"all the people\"), is known as [[Bantu Holomisa]].\n# The South African apartheid governments originally gave the name \"[[bantustan]]s\" to the eleven rural reserve areas intended for nominal independence to deny indigenous Bantu South Africans citizenship. \"Bantustan\" originally reflected an analogy to the various ethnic \"-stans\" of Western and Central Asia. Again association with apartheid discredited the term, and the South African government shifted to the politically appealing but historically deceptive term \"ethnic homelands\". Meanwhile, the anti-apartheid movement persisted in calling the areas bantustans, to drive home their political illegitimacy.\n# The abstract noun ''[[Ubuntu (philosophy)|ubuntu]]'', humanity or humaneness, is derived regularly from the [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] noun stem ''-ntu'' in Xhosa, Zulu, and Ndebele. In Swati the stem is ''-ntfu'' and the noun is ''buntfu''.\n# In the [[Sotho\u2013Tswana languages]] of southern Africa, ''batho'' is the cognate term to Nguni ''abantu'', illustrating that such cognates need not actually look like the ''-ntu'' root exactly. The early [[African National Congress]] of South Africa had a newspaper called ''Abantu-Batho'' from 1912\u20131933, which carried columns in English, Zulu, Sotho, and Xhosa.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Kongo people2.jpg|[[Kongo people|Kongo]] youth and adults in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\nFile:Kikyuyu-woman.jpeg|A Kikuyu woman in [[Kenya]]\nFile:Mozambique001.jpg|A [[Makua people|Makua]] mother and child in [[Mozambique]]\nFile:Bubi children.jpg|[[Bubi people|Bubi]] girls in [[Equatorial Guinea]]\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[African Pygmies]]\n* [[Bantu mythology]]\n* [[Congoid]]\n* [[Demographics of Africa]]\n* [[Genetic history of Sub-Saharan Africa]]\n* [[History of West Africa]]\n* [[Khoisan]]\n* [[Languages of Africa]]\n* [[List of ethnic groups of Africa]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Christopher Ehret, ''An African Classical Age: Eastern and Southern Africa in World History, 1000 B.C. to A.D. 400'', James Currey, London, 1998\n* Christopher Ehret and Merrick Posnansky, eds., ''The Archaeological and Linguistic Reconstruction of African History'', University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1982\n* April A.

Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|became the Solar System]]. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated [[nuclear fusion]] in its [[solar core|core]]. It is thought that almost all stars [[Star formation|form by this process]].\n\nThe Sun currently [[nuclear fusion|fuses]] about 600 million tons of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] every second, [[mass\u2013energy equivalence|converting 4 million tons of matter into energy]] every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape from its core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When [[hydrogen fusion]] in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a [[red giant]]. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], and render [[Earth]] uninhabitable \u2013 but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a [[white dwarf]], and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.\n\nThe enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since [[prehistoric times]], and the Sun has been [[The Sun in culture|regarded by some cultures]] as a [[solar deity|deity]].

Instead, the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into [[thermal|thermal cells]] that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m<sup>3</sup> (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).<ref name=NASA1/>\n\nThe thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance  called the [[granule (solar physics)|solar granulation]] at the smallest scale and [[supergranulation]] at larger scales.

It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous.

Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the [[sky]], whose presence above the [[horizon]] creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a [[solar deity]] or other [[supernatural]] entity. [[Sun worship|Worship of the Sun]] was central to civilizations such as the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, the [[Inca]] of South America and the [[Aztec]]s of what is now [[Mexico]]. In religions such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone [[megalith]]s accurately mark the summer or winter [[solstice]] (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in [[Nabta Playa]], [[Egypt]]; [[Mnajdra]], [[Malta]] and at [[Stonehenge]], [[England]]); [[Newgrange]], a prehistoric human-built mount in [[Ireland]], was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] at [[Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]] in [[Mexico]] is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the [[pyramid]] at the vernal and autumnal [[equinox]]es.\n\nThe Egyptians portrayed the god [[Ra]] as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was [[Helios]], carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of [[Elagabalus]] in the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|late Roman Empire]] the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as [[Sol Invictus]] (literally \"Unconquered Sun\") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the [[fixed star]]s, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the [[ecliptic]] through the [[zodiac]], and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven [[classical planets|planets]] (Greek ''planetes'', \"wanderer\"); the naming of the [[Names of the days of the week|days of the weeks]] after the seven planets dates to the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]].<ref name=oed>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/planet |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Planet |accessdate=22 March 2015 |date=December 2007}}</ref><ref name=almagest>{{Cite journal |first=Bernard R. |last=Goldstein |title=Saving the phenomena : the background to Ptolemy's planetary theory |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=1997 |pages=1\u201312 |bibcode=1997JHA....28....1G |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/002182869702800101}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Ptolemy's Almagest |author=Ptolemy |last2=Toomer |first2=G.J. |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-691-00260-6}}</ref>\n\n===Development of scientific understanding===\n\nIn the early first millennium BC, [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] observed that the Sun's motion along the [[ecliptic]] is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of [[Earth]] in an [[elliptic orbit]] around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]] and moving slower when it is farther away at [[Apsis|aphelion]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Babylon to Voyager and beyond: a history of planetary astronomy |first=David |last=Leverington |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-80840-8 |pages=6\u20137 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Anaxagoras]].

It was adopted as the [[Sabbath]] day by Christians who did not have a Jewish background. The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the [[winter solstice]] (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun ([[Sol Invictus]]).

Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|became the Solar System]]. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated [[nuclear fusion]] in its [[solar core|core]]. It is thought that almost all stars [[Star formation|form by this process]].\n\nThe Sun currently [[nuclear fusion|fuses]] about 600 million tons of [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]] every second, [[mass\u2013energy equivalence|converting 4 million tons of matter into energy]] every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape from its core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When [[hydrogen fusion]] in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a [[red giant]]. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], and render [[Earth]] uninhabitable \u2013 but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a [[white dwarf]], and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.\n\nThe enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since [[prehistoric times]], and the Sun has been [[The Sun in culture|regarded by some cultures]] as a [[solar deity|deity]].

It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous.

This is the [[asymptotic giant branch|asymptotic-giant-branch]] phase, and the Sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and [[thermal pulse]]s that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so.

Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the [[sky]], whose presence above the [[horizon]] creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a [[solar deity]] or other [[supernatural]] entity. [[Sun worship|Worship of the Sun]] was central to civilizations such as the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, the [[Inca]] of South America and the [[Aztec]]s of what is now [[Mexico]]. In religions such as [[Hinduism]], the Sun is still considered a god. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone [[megalith]]s accurately mark the summer or winter [[solstice]] (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in [[Nabta Playa]], [[Egypt]]; [[Mnajdra]], [[Malta]] and at [[Stonehenge]], [[England]]); [[Newgrange]], a prehistoric human-built mount in [[Ireland]], was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] at [[Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]] in [[Mexico]] is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the [[pyramid]] at the vernal and autumnal [[equinox]]es.\n\nThe Egyptians portrayed the god [[Ra]] as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was [[Helios]], carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of [[Elagabalus]] in the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|late Roman Empire]] the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as [[Sol Invictus]] (literally \"Unconquered Sun\") soon after the winter solstice, which may have been an antecedent to Christmas. Regarding the [[fixed star]]s, the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the [[ecliptic]] through the [[zodiac]], and so Greek astronomers categorized it as one of the seven [[classical planets|planets]] (Greek ''planetes'', \"wanderer\"); the naming of the [[Names of the days of the week|days of the weeks]] after the seven planets dates to the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]].<ref name=oed>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/planet |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries |title=Planet |accessdate=22 March 2015 |date=December 2007}}</ref><ref name=almagest>{{Cite journal |first=Bernard R. |last=Goldstein |title=Saving the phenomena : the background to Ptolemy's planetary theory |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=1997 |pages=1\u201312 |bibcode=1997JHA....28....1G |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/002182869702800101}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Ptolemy's Almagest |author=Ptolemy |last2=Toomer |first2=G.J. |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-691-00260-6}}</ref>\n\n===Development of scientific understanding===\n\nIn the early first millennium BC, [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] observed that the Sun's motion along the [[ecliptic]] is not uniform, though they did not know why; it is today known that this is due to the movement of [[Earth]] in an [[elliptic orbit]] around the Sun, with Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at [[Apsis|perihelion]] and moving slower when it is farther away at [[Apsis|aphelion]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Babylon to Voyager and beyond: a history of planetary astronomy |first=David |last=Leverington |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-80840-8 |pages=6\u20137 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nOne of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Anaxagoras]].

It was adopted as the [[Sabbath]] day by Christians who did not have a Jewish background. The symbol of light was a pagan device adopted by Christians, and perhaps the most important one that did not come from Jewish traditions. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. The celebration of the [[winter solstice]] (which influenced Christmas) was part of the Roman cult of the unconquered Sun ([[Sol Invictus]]).

Mailman to serve as a \"bedroom community\" for nearby Miami and Fort Lauderdale.  Mailman bought the original property he was to develop from H.D. Perry, Sr. in 1953. He built 56 homes on the property that were inexpensive homes of concrete and flat roofs. These homes sold quickly because of the low cost of both the homes and the land, and the city of Miramar came into being.\n\nThe city was incorporated on May 26, 1955 and was named for the [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]] area of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] where Mailman had a summer home (Miramar translates to \"look at the sea\" in Spanish).<ref>http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-08-22/news/8602190930_1_mr-gordon-jewish-federation-synagogue</ref> At the time of incorporation, the city had a population of less than two hundred people. With approximately 2.9 square miles land area, Miramar's original city boundaries were Southwest 64 Avenue on the east, [[Florida State Road 817|University Drive]] on the west, the Dade County line on the south, and [[Florida State Road 824|Pembroke Road]] on the north.  On June 20, 1955, the city's first mayor (Robert Gordon) and city council were sworn in, all of whom were appointed by the governor and served until January 1959, at which time the first municipal election was held.<ref name=cityhistory1/> Mayor Robert Gordon is the individual who is attributed to have given the city its name.<ref name=cityhistory1/> The city seal is inscribed with the motto \"Beauty and Progress\".<ref name=cityhistory1/>\n\nH.D. Perry Sr.'s part in Miramar did not cease with selling the land to Mailman for development. He is recognized as one of the foremost pioneers in the history of Miramar.  His character and civic-activities influenced not only the lives of early residents, but continues to the present day, as evidenced by the schools and parks in the city which bear his family's name. Many long-time residents fondly recall the community barbecues hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Perry during those early years.  Others are grateful to Mr. Perry for the lessons in animal husbandry, which he conducted for the benefit of Miramar's youth so that they could learn something of farm life.\n\nThe only major roads when Miramar was developed were [[Florida State Road 7|U.S. 441]] which was a two-lane road at that time, [[Florida State Road 858|Hallandale Beach Boulevard]] to Southwest 66 Terrace and Pembroke Road which was a dirt road to University Drive. There were no other transportation routes of any kind supplying access to the new community. Miramar's early city fathers advocated the philosophy of planned and controlled growth. The city adopted a Comprehensive Land Use Plan in 1972 before cities and counties were mandated to do so. This provided the framework for the orderly development of future growth.

Mailman to serve as a \"bedroom community\" for nearby Miami and Fort Lauderdale.  Mailman bought the original property he was to develop from H.D. Perry, Sr. in 1953. He built 56 homes on the property that were inexpensive homes of concrete and flat roofs. These homes sold quickly because of the low cost of both the homes and the land, and the city of Miramar came into being.\n\nThe city was incorporated on May 26, 1955 and was named for the [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]] area of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] where Mailman had a summer home (Miramar translates to \"look at the sea\" in Spanish).<ref>http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-08-22/news/8602190930_1_mr-gordon-jewish-federation-synagogue</ref> At the time of incorporation, the city had a population of less than two hundred people. With approximately 2.9 square miles land area, Miramar's original city boundaries were Southwest 64 Avenue on the east, [[Florida State Road 817|University Drive]] on the west, the Dade County line on the south, and [[Florida State Road 824|Pembroke Road]] on the north.  On June 20, 1955, the city's first mayor (Robert Gordon) and city council were sworn in, all of whom were appointed by the governor and served until January 1959, at which time the first municipal election was held.<ref name=cityhistory1/> Mayor Robert Gordon is the individual who is attributed to have given the city its name.<ref name=cityhistory1/> The city seal is inscribed with the motto \"Beauty and Progress\".<ref name=cityhistory1/>\n\nH.D. Perry Sr.'s part in Miramar did not cease with selling the land to Mailman for development. He is recognized as one of the foremost pioneers in the history of Miramar.  His character and civic-activities influenced not only the lives of early residents, but continues to the present day, as evidenced by the schools and parks in the city which bear his family's name. Many long-time residents fondly recall the community barbecues hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Perry during those early years.  Others are grateful to Mr. Perry for the lessons in animal husbandry, which he conducted for the benefit of Miramar's youth so that they could learn something of farm life.\n\nThe only major roads when Miramar was developed were [[Florida State Road 7|U.S. 441]] which was a two-lane road at that time, [[Florida State Road 858|Hallandale Beach Boulevard]] to Southwest 66 Terrace and Pembroke Road which was a dirt road to University Drive. There were no other transportation routes of any kind supplying access to the new community. Miramar's early city fathers advocated the philosophy of planned and controlled growth. The city adopted a Comprehensive Land Use Plan in 1972 before cities and counties were mandated to do so. This provided the framework for the orderly development of future growth. Two-thirds of the land within city limits is currently undeveloped.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|81.0|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|76.5|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|4.6|km2|order=flip}} (5.66%) is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nA 2017 study put the city in fifth place for US cities most vulnerable to [[coastal flooding]], with 93,000 residents living within [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]]'s coastal [[floodplain]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatecentral.org/news/us-cities-most-vulnerable-major-coastal-flooding-sea-level-rise-21748|title=These U.S. Cities Are Most Vulnerable to Major Coastal Flooding and Sea Level Rise|last=|first=|date=October 25, 2017|website=www.climatecentral.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n\nThe city is bordered by the following municipalities:\n\nTo the north:\n* [[Pembroke Pines, Florida|Pembroke Pines]]\n\nTo the northeast:\n* [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]]\n\nTo the east:\n* [[West Park, Florida|West Park]]\n\nTo the south:\n* [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1960= 5485\n|1970= 23997\n|1980= 32813\n|1990= 40663\n|2000= 72739\n|2010= 122041\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=140823\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 2em; width: 35%; font-size: 75%;\"\n!colspan=4|Miramar Demographics\n|-\n![[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]||Miramar||Broward County||Florida\n|-\n|Total population||122,041||1,748,066||18,801,310\n|-\n|Population, percent change, 2000 to 2010||+67.8%||+7.7%||+17.6%\n|-\n|Population density||4,134.1/sq&nbsp;mi||1,444.9/sq&nbsp;mi||350.6/sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n|[[White (U.S. Census)|White or Caucasian]] (including [[White Hispanic]])||41.0%||63.1%||75.0%\n|-\n|([[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White or Caucasian]])||11.6%||43.5%||57.9%\n|-\n|[[Black (U.S. Census)|Black or African-American]]||45.7%||26.7%||16.0%\n|-\n|[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic or Latino (of any race)]]||36.9%||25.1%||22.5%\n|-\n|[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]]||5.2%||3.2%||2.4%\n|-\n|[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]]||0.2%||0.3%||0.4%\n|-\n|[[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]] or [[Native Hawaiian]]||0.0%||0.1%||0.1%\n|-\n|[[Multiracial American|Two or more races (Multiracial)]]||3.7%||2.9%||2.5%\n|-\n|[[Other races (U.S. Census)|Some Other Race]]||4.2%||3.7%||3.6%\n|}\nAs of 2010, there were 40,294 households, with 7.1% being vacant.

However, for much of the [[Arctic Circle]] in the Northern Hemisphere's winter months, the Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars (and thus parts of Ophiuchus, especially Rasalhague) are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon, low in the south. In the Northern Hemisphere's spring and summer months, when Ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible, at those times and places in the Arctic when [[midnight sun]] obscures the stars.
