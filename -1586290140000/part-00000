In a statement released after the close of the meeting, the intention of the cardinals is to emphasise the nature of the service on the part of the Curia and the universal and local church \"in terms of subsidiarity, rather than the exercise of centralised power. The intended direction would be to put this into practice in the service of the Church in all her dimensions\". Another important theme was the nature and functions of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], which \"should be the secretariat of the Pope; the word State should not give rise to doubt. This body serves the Pope in the governance of the universal Church\". The Council will address the matter of relations between the heads of the dicasteries and the Pope, and co-ordination between the various bodies. \"In this context, mention was made of the role of a 'Moderator Curiae' ([[Moderator of the Curia]]), and the functions of such a figure.

Zahra, the secretary Msgr. Lucio Vallejo Balda and Joachim Messemer. The work carried out during the eight months since the creation of this body was presented with no decisions taken. On 18 February, the Commission for Reference on the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) was heard. On 19 February the Council continued without Pope Francis who held his usual general audience. The cardinals of the so-called \"Council of Fifteen\" instituted by John Paul II and responsible for the general consolidated financial statement of the Holy See and the Governorate of Vatican City State met with the Council.\n\nDuring the meeting from 28 to 30 April, Cardinal Parolinas participated regularly with the Council. The Council heard a report from the president of the Pontifical Commission for Reference on the Organisation of the Economic-Administrative Structures of the Holy See (COSEA), Joseph F.X. Zahra, in relation to some of the areas of activity within its remit. Following its review in previous Meetings of the Congregations of the Roman Curia, the Council is now focusing on the Pontifical Councils, first in terms of general considerations, followed by an individual appraisal of each one. The Council is expected to complete a first report of its considerations regarding the Pontifical Councils during this Meeting.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.ie/2014/04/meeting-of-holy-father-with-council-of.html |title=Meeting of the Holy Father with the council of cardinals (28-30 April) |website=Vatican Information Service |date=29 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring their meetings from 1\u20134 July Pope Francis was present and said that he would participate fully like the other members of the Council. Cardinal Bertello presented matters relating to the Governorate, and Cardinal Parolin made a presentation relating to the Secretariat of State. The issue of the structure of the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) was discussed in depth. The meetings, held in two sessions, were also attended by Cardinal Parolin and members of the Supervisory Commission of Cardinals present in Rome: Cardinals [[Santos Abril y Castell\u00f3]], Thomas Collins and [[Jean-Louis Cardinal Tauran]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.ie/2014/07/meeting-of-council-of-cardinals.html |title=Meeting of the Council of Cardinals |website=Vatican Information Service |date=2 July 2014}}</ref> During these meetings the [[Pontifical Council for the Laity]] and the [[Pontifical Council for the Family]] were studied in particular depth, especially in terms of the contributions and roles that should be assumed by laypeople, married couples and women. Decisions were not made, but more detailed proposals were offered for subsequent insertion into the overall framework of the new configuration of the Curia. Other themes included the [[nunciature]]s and the procedures for the [[Appointment of Catholic bishops|appointment of bishops]]. The Vatican described the overall tone of the meetings as \"free, frank and friendly\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.ie/2014/07/meeting-of-council-of-cardinals-free.html |title=Meeting of the Council of Cardinals: \"Free, Frank and Friendly\" |website=Vatican Information Service |date=4 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the meetings from 15\u201317 September the Cardinals had previously worked by examining all the Congregations and Pontifical Councils, but they had also assigned a significant amount of time to hearing the referring Commissions on economic and organisational questions (COSEA and CRIOR) and on matters pertaining to the economic Dicasteries. Work in this area is considered complete.<ref name=6thMeeting>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/sixth-meeting-of-council-of-cardinals_17.html |title=Sixth meeting of the Council of Cardinals |website=Vatican Information Service}}</ref> In this meeting the Council resumed work on the other Dicasteries. In the meantime, several contributions had been prepared by various members of the Council on the different issues within their sphere of competence, which were proposed or presented to the Council. During these days, the Council focused on two principal difficult issues. The first includes the themes of the laity and the family. It is a very broad area, encompassing many issues, including for instance the role of women in society and in the Church, youth, childhood, or matters related to lay associations and movements, and so on. The second comprises themes linked to justice and peace, charity, migrants and refugees, health, and the protection of life and ecology, especially human ecology. The Council of Cardinals, as we are aware, does not make decisions, but formulates proposals for the Pope, who certainly intends to consult in further depth. In order to speed up this new phase in the work of the Council, the coordinator, Cardinal \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga, S.D.B., has prepared an overall plan to facilitate the organisation of the contributions and reflections already offered during the previous meetings and the integration of new ones.<ref name=6thMeeting />\n\nDuring the seventh meeting held from 9\u201311 December. The meetings focused on three themes: the reform of the Curia, the composition of the [[Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors]] and the reorganisation of the economic organs of the Holy See. As usual, Pope Francis participated in all meetings aside from the Wednesday morning session, due to his weekly general audience. With regard to reform of the Roman Curia, the Cardinals also addressed the specific question of the reorganisation of the Pontifical Councils that work in relation to the laity, the family, justice, peace and charity. No formal decisions were taken. The Commission for the Protection of Minors, which has eight members and a secretary, is to be enlarged with representatives from various ecclesial and cultural contexts around the world, reaching a total of around eighteen members. The candidates had been selected and their availability to participate was in the process of being verified. From 6 to 8 February 2015 the Commission plans to hold its plenary session and it is expected that all members will be confirmed by that date.<ref name=CuriaReform>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/reform-of-curia-commission-for.html |title=Reform of the Curia, the Commission for the Protection of Minors, reorganisation of economic dicasteries: key themes in the meeting of the Council of Cardinals |website=Vatican Information Service |date=12 December 2014}}</ref> Professor Joseph Zahra, the lay deputy coordinator of the Council for the Economy, reported to the Cardinals on the reorganisation of the economic dicasteries.<ref name=CuriaReform />\n\n===2015 meetings===\nThe eighth meeting was held from 9 to 11 February 2015.\nDuring the ninth meeting from 13 to 15 April the Council dedicated the majority its work regarding reform of the Roman Curia to two aspects: reflections on the methodologies to be followed for work during 2015 and 2016 in order to be able to effectively accomplish the task of preparing the new Constitution, and a rereading of the interventions by the Cardinals in relation to reform of the Curia made during the recent Consistory (there were over sixty interventions on this theme with useful indications and cues, both for the prologue of the constitution and for specific aspects of reform). The orientation towards the constitution of two dicasteries \u2013 one competent in fields of charity, justice and peace, the other regarding the laity, families and life \u2013 would appear to be confirmed. The Council also focused on the issue of the reorganisation of Vatican media, following the submission of the final report of the Commission presided over by [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten]]. It is expected that the Pope will constitute a Commission to consider how the recommendations of the report can be put into practice. This body will also include members of the Patten Commission, to ensure continuity. Cardinal O'Malley, president of the [[Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors]], under the auspices of the same Commission, has proposed that the Pope and the Council consider the theme of \"Accountability\" with regard to the protection of minors, in order to establish appropriate procedures and methods for evaluating and judging cases of \"abuse of office\" in this area, especially on the part of persons holding responsibility within the Church.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.va/en/news/ninth-meeting-of-the-council-of-cardinals-2 |website=Official Vatican Network |title=Ninth meeting of the Council of Cardinals |date=15 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nActing on their advice, Pope Francis in April 2015 established a Commission for the Reform of the Vatican's Communications Media.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1501876.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506014221/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1501876.htm |archive-date=6 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAt their tenth meeting from 8\u201310 June at which Cardinal Mosengwo Pasinya was unable to attend, the first day was dedicated largely to the examination of the draft Preamble of the new Constitution. With regard to financial and economic reform, Cardinal Pell, prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, presented a report with updated information on the financial reforms. He mentioned the appointment of the new Auditor General, the approval of the new Statute for Pension Funds and the completion of the list of bodies subject to the control and supervision of the Council for the Economy, in accordance with its Statutes. He also referred to three new initiatives of the Council for the Economy, constituting three working groups: one for the analysis of income and investments; one for human resources management, and a third for the study of the existing IT systems, their compatibility and their efficiency. He concluded by reporting on the progress of the various current activities of the Secretariat for the Economy.\n\nIn the afternoon session of 8 June, the Council received a report from Cardinal O'Malley, with a proposal for the Pope regarding allegations of the abuse of office by a bishop connected to the abuse of minors, originally prepared by the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. Cardinal O'Malley's report also included a proposal regarding allegations of sexual abuse of minors and vulnerable adults by clergy. For each proposal, the report indicated the general terms which define it, issues relating to procedure and to the competent Tribunal, as well as the advantages of the proposal compared with other possible solutions. The five specific proposals made to the Pope are firstly, because the competence to receive and investigate complaints of the episcopal abuse of office belongs to the Congregations for Bishops, Evangelisation of Peoples, or Oriental Churches, there is the duty to report all complaints to the appropriate Congregation; the Pope mandate the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to judge bishops with regard to crimes of the abuse of office when connected to the abuse of minors; the Pope authorise the establishment of a new Judicial Section in the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] and appointment of stable personnel to undertake service in the Tribunal. The implementation of this decision would follow consultation with the prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith; the Pope appoint a secretary to assist the prefect with the Tribunal. The secretary will be responsible for the new Judicial Section and the personnel of the section will also be available to the prefect for penal processes regarding the abuse of minors and vulnerable adults by clergy. This appointment will also follow the consultation with the prefect of the Congregation; the Pope establish a five-year period for further development of these proposals and for completing a formal evaluation of their effectiveness.\n\nThe Council agreed unanimously on these proposals and resolved that they be submitted to the Pope, who approved the proposals and authorised the provision of sufficient resources for this purpose. In the morning of 9 June the Council of Cardinals heard a report given by Msgr. Dario Vigano, director of the Vatican Television Centre and president of the Commission for Vatican communications instituted by Pope Francis on 23 April 2015 (made public on 30 April), and expressed its unanimous approval of the feasibility study conducted by the same Commission. Starting from the analyses and reports of McKinsey and the previous commissions (COSEA and the Vatican Media Commission chaired by Lord Patten), the current Commission presented a plan for reform to be implemented over a four-year period, ensuring the protection of staff and a gradual integration of institutions. The constitution of the dicastery will be drafted, and the necessary appointments made during the coming months to enable the process to be initiated. The Commission is currently continuing its work, which has yet to be completed. On 10 June, the Council heard a communique from Fr. [[Michael Czerny]] of the Pontifical Council \"Justice and Peace\" regarding the Pope's new encyclical and the preparation for its publication.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/the-tenth-meeting-of-council-of.html |title=The tenth meeting of the Council of Cardinals comes to an end |date=10 June 2015 |website=Vatican Information Service}}</ref>\n\nThe meeting that took place from 14\u201316 September discussed \"The proposal for a new Congregation, provisionally entitled \"Laity, Family and Life\", was again taken into consideration\", said Fr. Lombardi. \"In this regard [[Dionigi Cardinal Tettamanzi]], designated by the Pope in recent months to prepare a study on the feasibility of the project, was heard. At the end of their reflections the Council presented to the Pope a proposal orientated towards the implementation of the project. Consideration of the proposal for a new Congregation dedicated to \"Charity, Justice and Peace\" was resumed and further reflections were made without yet reaching, however, a conclusive proposal by the Council.<ref name=Briefing11>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/briefing-on-eleventh-meeting-of-council.html |title=Briefing on the eleventh meeting of the Council of Cardinals |website=Vatican Information Service |date=16 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/09/16/cardinals_approve_new_congregation_for_laity,_family,_life/1172241 |website=Vatican Radio |title=Council of cardinals approves Congregation for laity, family, life |date=16 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe meetings discussed [[Appointment of Catholic bishops|the appointment of new bishops]], or more specifically on the qualities and requisites for candidates in view of the needs of today's world, and on the related issue of information gathering. Naturally the theme will need to be explored further and developed in collaboration with the competent Dicasteries concerned. The Prefect of the [[Secretariat for Communications]] reported to the Council on the first steps taken so far and in particular on the appointment of a group to draw up the Statutes for the new Dicastery. The working group has been constituted and has already commenced activity. The regulations will subsequently be drafted and issued. The theme proposed during the last session of the Council regarding issues linked to the abuse of minors was again taken into consideration. The matter of how to implement proposals was explored in further depth, especially with regard to the possibility of accelerating the resolution of the many cases still pending. Cardinal Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga was absent for health reasons.<ref name=Briefing11 />\n\nDuring the meeting on 10 to 12 December 2015 the Pope developed extensively the theme of \"collegiality\", but also pointed out \"the need to proceed with a healthy 'decentralization'.\"  The Council returned to work on two new departments, which had previously been discussed on numerous occasions. The Department dedicated to \"Laity and family life\" \u2013 the establishment of which Pope Francis announced during the Synod (22 October) - was the subject of a detailed proposal by the Council to the Pope. The Department dedicated to \"Justice, Peace and Migration\" was subject to further considerations, in anticipation of creating the final proposal to be given to the Pope. The Council heard two reports on the reform of the economic structures of the Vatican, which were given by Cardinal Marx, Co-ordinator of the Council of Economy, and Cardinal George Pell, prefect for the Secretariat of Economy. The two Cardinals reported on the activities and achievements of the two institutions. In the course of his presentation, Cardinal Marx discussed the choice of an external auditor for the consolidated financial statements of the Vatican, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Cardinal Pell gave information about the establishment of a working group to reflect on the future of the economic issues of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, including its present state, and the control of expenditure and revenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/12/12/council_of_cardinals_conclude_twelfth_meeting/1193924 |title=Council of Cardinals conclude twelfth meeting |website=Vatican Radio |date=12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2016 meetings===\n\nThe Council with Pope Francis for a day and a half, Monday 8 February, morning and afternoon, and Tuesday 9 in the morning. Cardinal Gracias, was absent for health reasons. His absence was expected since the month of December, as he was expected to undergo a previously scheduled surgical operation. As already expected at the end of the previous meeting, the first session consisted of a close examination of the Pope's discourse on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Synod of Bishops (17 October). This discourse, which develops extensively the theme of \"synodality\", noting at the same time \"the need to promote a sound decentralisation\", constitutes an important point of reference for the work of reforming the Curia. This was followed by a \"final\" reading of the proposals of the Council regarding the two new Dicasteries, mentioned previously: \"Laity, family and life\", and \"Justice, peace, migration\". The proposals were finalised and submitted to the Pope for his decisions. Cardinal O'Malley, reported on the activities of the Commission for the Protection of Minors. The legal and disciplinary issues that fall under the jurisdiction of other Dicasteries of the Curia will need to be examined in further detail. Cardinal Pell, reported on the status and implementation of reforms in the economic field. The cardinals received documentation on the so-called \"vademecum\" prepared by the Tribunal of the Roman Rota for the implementation of reform on canonical procedures for the declaration of nullity of marriage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/thirteenth-meeting-of-council-of_9.html |title=Thirteenth meeting of the Council of Cardinals: synodality and sound decentralisation |website=Vatican Information Service |date=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nMeetings were held between 11\u201313 April, with the absence of Cardinal Gracias, for health reasons. Apart from the Wednesday morning session, which took place during the customary General Audience, Pope Francis himself participated in all of the meetings of the Council.\nIn a press briefing on the meetings, Father Federico Lombardi, SJ, the Director of the Holy See Press Office, said Cardinals\u2019 discussion focused largely on final considerations concerning the various Dicasteries of the Roman Curia, in view of a new [[Apostolic Constitution]]. In particular, the Cardinals re-read, and entrusted to the Pope, several texts relating to the proposal to create to new Dicasteries, dedicated to \"Laity, Family, and Life\" and to \"Justice, Peace, and Migration.\" Father Lombardi said the Cardinals also took up several other topics in particular, the Council considered criteria for gathering information for the nomination of new bishops, in light of their identity and pastoral mission. They also discussed the significance and role of Nuncios. Additionally, the Council heard from two of their own members. Cardinal George Pell updated his colleagues on the work of the Secretariat for the Economy, while Cardinal Sean O'Malley discussed the activities of the Pontifical Council for the Protection of Minors. The final day of the Council's work, Father Lombardi said, was dedicated to organizing the results of the foregoing discussion, in order to craft a comprehensive proposal from the Council to the Pope, in view of a new Constitution for the Roman Curia.<ref>{{cite web |website=Vatican Radio |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/04/13/council_of_cardinals_concludes_meetings_in_vatican/1222534 |title=Council of Cardinals concludes meetings in Vatican |date=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Council met from 6\u20138 June, a large part of the consultations was dedicated to discussing the reforms regarding the Secretariat of State, the Congregations for Catholic Education, for Oriental Churches, for the Clergy and for Bishops, as well as the Pontifical Councils for Culture, for Christian Unity and for Interreligious Dialogue. The results of previous consultations regarding the Congregations for the Doctrine of the Faith, for Worship and the Sacraments, for the Causes of Saints and for Consecrated Life, as well as the new Charity, Justice and Peace office, have been handed over to Pope Francis for his deliberations. Fr Lombardi said that the reforms were focused on the criteria of simplifying and harmonizing the work of the different offices, as well as exploring ways of decentralizing tasks to the different bishops conferences. Finally he noted that Cardinal Marx and Cardinal Pell discussed questions relating to the Council and the Secretariat for the Economy, while Mgr [[Dario Vigano]] reported on the continuing reform of the Vatican media offices, especially the process of integrating Vatican Radio and the Vatican Television Centre which is taking place this year.\n\nMeetings of the Council were scheduled for 12\u201314 September and 12\u201314 December 2016.\n\n===2017 meetings===\n\nFrom 13\u201315 February the Council of Cardinals met with the Pope during three days. All the members of the Council were present.\n\nPope Francis was absent during the second part of the session on Monday morning because of the \"ad Limina Apostolorum\" of the bishops of Costa Rica; and during the morning session of Wednesday 15 February because of the General Audience. He will be present to the session number 105 planned for this evening.\n\nOn 13 February, after the first consultation, the Cardinals, through the Press Office of the Holy See, released the following declaration:\n\n\"The Council of Cardinals initiated today its 18th working session.\n\nThe working sessions took place from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. and were dedicated to further consideration of the different Dicasteries of the Curia: particularly, have continued the discussions about the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (Propaganda Fide); the Congregation for the Oriental Churches; and the Pontifical Council for the Interreligious Dialogue.\n\nThe Cardinals began to examine the \"Diaconate of Justice\", and a considerable time was dedicated to the Tribunals: Apostolic Penitentiary, Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura and Tribunal of the Roman Rota. The Council has also studied, during these day, the process for the selection of candidates to the Episcopate.\n\nCardinal George Pell spoke about the work of the Secretariat for the Economy, entrusted to him, for the full implementation of the economic reform requested by the Pope, with particular attention to the activities of personnel training and human resources. The Prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, Dario Edoardo Vigan\u00f2, presented the current state of the reform of the communications of the Holy See, after the unification of the Vatican Radio and the Vatican Television Center in the Dicastery entrusted to him. Working sessions were held with the Secretariat of State, the Secretariat for the Economy, Apsa and the Office of Labour to accompany this new phase of the reform. In addition, the plan to reestructure the radio frequency and the new policy for the world of social networks, was presented. Finally, the group reflected on the project to start the reform of the Vatican Publishing House.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/02/15/press_briefing_for_xviii_meeting_of_cardinal_advisors/1292643 |title=Press briefing for XVIII Meeting of Cardinal Advisors |website=Vatican Radio |date=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe nineteenth meeting of the Council met with the Pope for three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, 24\u201326 April. The working sessions took place in the mornings from 9-12:30 and in the afternoons from 16:30-19:00. The sessions were dedicated to further considerations on the various dicasteries of the Curia; in particular, there were continued discussions concerning the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, and the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation. The Cardinals also considered texts to propose to the Pope regarding the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue; the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts; and three tribunals: the [[Apostolic Penitentiary]], the [[Apostolic Signatura]], and the [[Roman Rota]]. During the meetings, the Council also studied the selection and formation of the personnel in the service of the Holy See, both clerics and members of the lay faithful. Officials and superiors from the Secretariat of State, from the Council for the Economy, and from the [[Labour Office of the Apostolic See]] took part in the discussions. Another important theme treated by the Council was the relationship between the Episcopal Conferences and the Roman Curia. Cardinal Pell gave an update on the work of the Secretariat for the Economy, with special attention to the review of the budget for the current year. Cardinal O\u2019Malley updated the Council on the work of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of minors, focussing especially on the programme of global education, the last plenary assembly, and the visits to various dicasteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/04/26/press_briefing_at_the_conclusion_of_the_meeting_of_the_c-9/1308200 |title=Press briefing at the conclusion of the meeting of the C-9 |website=Vatican Radio |date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Council of Cardinals met with the Pope for three days: Monday 12, Tuesday 13 and Wednesday 14 June. All members of the Council were present apart from Cardinal O\u2019Malley. The sessions were dedicated to further consideration of the ways in which the Roman Curia can better serve the local Churches. For example, a larger consultation board made up also of members from consecrated life and the laity, for candidates proposed for [[Appointment of Catholic bishops|appointment as bishop]]. Among other proposals, the possibility of transferring some functions from the Roman Dicasteries to the local bishops or episcopal councils, in a spirit of healthy decentralisation. For example, the transfer of the Dicastery for the Clergy to the Episcopal Conference for examination and authorisation for: the priestly ordination of an unmarried permanent deacon; the passage to new marriage for a widowed permanent deacon; the request for priestly ordination by a widowed permanent deacon. The Council gave further consideration to various Dicasteries of the Curia, in particular the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. The Council studied and reread texts proposed for submission to the Pope regarding the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue; the Dicastery for the Oriental Churches; the Dicastery for Legislative Texts; and the three tribunals. Cardinal Pell provided an update on the work of the Secretariat for the Economy, of which he is the prefect. Particular attention was paid to the steps ahead made in the process of planning of economic resources and in monitoring financial plans for the first trimester of 2017 which have substantially confirmed, with few exceptions, the budget data. Shortly the budget process will begin for 2018, and the monitoring for the second trimester of 2017. The prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, Msgr. Dario Edoardo Vigan\u00f2, presented a report on the state of the reform of the communication system of the Holy See; he illustrated the economic and management progress of the SPC, demonstrating positive results. He then explained the projects in the realization phase of the new communication system, in accordance with the Holy Father's recent address on the occasion of the Dicastery's first Plenary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/06/14/council_of_cardinals_updates_pope_on_state_of_vatican_reform/1319013 |title=Council of Cardinals updates Pope on state of Vatican reform |date=14 June 2017 |website=Vatican Radio}}</ref>\n\nThe 21st meeting took place form 11\u201313 September. The aim of this 21st session of the C9 was to reflect on the ongoing reforms of the Curia. Pope Francis joined the group of his closest advisors for the Tuesday morning and afternoon sessions having returned from Colombia.\n\nCardinal Pell and Cardinal Monsengwo Pasinya, were unable to attend this week's meeting. A main focus for discussion at this encounter was how the Curia can be an instrument of evangelization at the service of the pope and the local Churches. In particular the cardinals talked about the need for decentralisation, the role of the [[nunciature]]s, the selection of personnel, especially the need for a less clerical and more international staff, with an increase in the number of women and young people. The cardinals also discussed Pope Francis\u2019 recent [[motu proprio]] \u2018Magnum Principium\u2019, reflecting on how it may affect the work of the Congregation for Divine Worship, and they reviewed the statutes of the office for Laity, Family and Life.\n\nThree other prelates gave presentations about the work of their offices: Archbishop [[Rino Fisichella|Salvatore Fisichella]] spoke about his Council for New Evangelisation, Cardinal O\u2019Malley updated the cardinals on the work of the [[Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors]], and at the final session, Cardinal Filoni spoke to the cardinals about the work of his 'Propaganda Fide' Congregation.<ref>[http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/09/13/c9_cardinals_meet_to_discuss_vatican_reforms/1336616]</ref>\n\nThe next meeting of the C9 is scheduled to take place in the Vatican from 11 to 13 December.\n\n===2018 meetings===\n\nThe Council met from 11\u201313 June.

The Council is expected to complete a first report of its considerations regarding the Pontifical Councils during this Meeting.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.ie/2014/04/meeting-of-holy-father-with-council-of.html |title=Meeting of the Holy Father with the council of cardinals (28-30 April) |website=Vatican Information Service |date=29 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring their meetings from 1\u20134 July Pope Francis was present and said that he would participate fully like the other members of the Council. Cardinal Bertello presented matters relating to the Governorate, and Cardinal Parolin made a presentation relating to the Secretariat of State. The issue of the structure of the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) was discussed in depth. The meetings, held in two sessions, were also attended by Cardinal Parolin and members of the Supervisory Commission of Cardinals present in Rome: Cardinals [[Santos Abril y Castell\u00f3]], Thomas Collins and [[Jean-Louis Cardinal Tauran]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.ie/2014/07/meeting-of-council-of-cardinals.html |title=Meeting of the Council of Cardinals |website=Vatican Information Service |date=2 July 2014}}</ref> During these meetings the [[Pontifical Council for the Laity]] and the [[Pontifical Council for the Family]] were studied in particular depth, especially in terms of the contributions and roles that should be assumed by laypeople, married couples and women. Decisions were not made, but more detailed proposals were offered for subsequent insertion into the overall framework of the new configuration of the Curia. Other themes included the [[nunciature]]s and the procedures for the [[Appointment of Catholic bishops|appointment of bishops]]. The Vatican described the overall tone of the meetings as \"free, frank and friendly\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.ie/2014/07/meeting-of-council-of-cardinals-free.html |title=Meeting of the Council of Cardinals: \"Free, Frank and Friendly\" |website=Vatican Information Service |date=4 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the course of the meetings from 15\u201317 September the Cardinals had previously worked by examining all the Congregations and Pontifical Councils, but they had also assigned a significant amount of time to hearing the referring Commissions on economic and organisational questions (COSEA and CRIOR) and on matters pertaining to the economic Dicasteries. Work in this area is considered complete.<ref name=6thMeeting>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/sixth-meeting-of-council-of-cardinals_17.html |title=Sixth meeting of the Council of Cardinals |website=Vatican Information Service}}</ref> In this meeting the Council resumed work on the other Dicasteries. In the meantime, several contributions had been prepared by various members of the Council on the different issues within their sphere of competence, which were proposed or presented to the Council. During these days, the Council focused on two principal difficult issues. The first includes the themes of the laity and the family. It is a very broad area, encompassing many issues, including for instance the role of women in society and in the Church, youth, childhood, or matters related to lay associations and movements, and so on. The second comprises themes linked to justice and peace, charity, migrants and refugees, health, and the protection of life and ecology, especially human ecology. The Council of Cardinals, as we are aware, does not make decisions, but formulates proposals for the Pope, who certainly intends to consult in further depth. In order to speed up this new phase in the work of the Council, the coordinator, Cardinal \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga, S.D.B., has prepared an overall plan to facilitate the organisation of the contributions and reflections already offered during the previous meetings and the integration of new ones.<ref name=6thMeeting />\n\nDuring the seventh meeting held from 9\u201311 December. The meetings focused on three themes: the reform of the Curia, the composition of the [[Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors]] and the reorganisation of the economic organs of the Holy See. As usual, Pope Francis participated in all meetings aside from the Wednesday morning session, due to his weekly general audience. With regard to reform of the Roman Curia, the Cardinals also addressed the specific question of the reorganisation of the Pontifical Councils that work in relation to the laity, the family, justice, peace and charity. No formal decisions were taken. The Commission for the Protection of Minors, which has eight members and a secretary, is to be enlarged with representatives from various ecclesial and cultural contexts around the world, reaching a total of around eighteen members. The candidates had been selected and their availability to participate was in the process of being verified. From 6 to 8 February 2015 the Commission plans to hold its plenary session and it is expected that all members will be confirmed by that date.<ref name=CuriaReform>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/reform-of-curia-commission-for.html |title=Reform of the Curia, the Commission for the Protection of Minors, reorganisation of economic dicasteries: key themes in the meeting of the Council of Cardinals |website=Vatican Information Service |date=12 December 2014}}</ref> Professor Joseph Zahra, the lay deputy coordinator of the Council for the Economy, reported to the Cardinals on the reorganisation of the economic dicasteries.<ref name=CuriaReform />\n\n===2015 meetings===\nThe eighth meeting was held from 9 to 11 February 2015.\nDuring the ninth meeting from 13 to 15 April the Council dedicated the majority its work regarding reform of the Roman Curia to two aspects: reflections on the methodologies to be followed for work during 2015 and 2016 in order to be able to effectively accomplish the task of preparing the new Constitution, and a rereading of the interventions by the Cardinals in relation to reform of the Curia made during the recent Consistory (there were over sixty interventions on this theme with useful indications and cues, both for the prologue of the constitution and for specific aspects of reform). The orientation towards the constitution of two dicasteries \u2013 one competent in fields of charity, justice and peace, the other regarding the laity, families and life \u2013 would appear to be confirmed. The Council also focused on the issue of the reorganisation of Vatican media, following the submission of the final report of the Commission presided over by [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten]]. It is expected that the Pope will constitute a Commission to consider how the recommendations of the report can be put into practice. This body will also include members of the Patten Commission, to ensure continuity. Cardinal O'Malley, president of the [[Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors]], under the auspices of the same Commission, has proposed that the Pope and the Council consider the theme of \"Accountability\" with regard to the protection of minors, in order to establish appropriate procedures and methods for evaluating and judging cases of \"abuse of office\" in this area, especially on the part of persons holding responsibility within the Church.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.va/en/news/ninth-meeting-of-the-council-of-cardinals-2 |website=Official Vatican Network |title=Ninth meeting of the Council of Cardinals |date=15 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nActing on their advice, Pope Francis in April 2015 established a Commission for the Reform of the Vatican's Communications Media.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1501876.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506014221/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1501876.htm |archive-date=6 May 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAt their tenth meeting from 8\u201310 June at which Cardinal Mosengwo Pasinya was unable to attend, the first day was dedicated largely to the examination of the draft Preamble of the new Constitution. With regard to financial and economic reform, Cardinal Pell, prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, presented a report with updated information on the financial reforms. He mentioned the appointment of the new Auditor General, the approval of the new Statute for Pension Funds and the completion of the list of bodies subject to the control and supervision of the Council for the Economy, in accordance with its Statutes. He also referred to three new initiatives of the Council for the Economy, constituting three working groups: one for the analysis of income and investments; one for human resources management, and a third for the study of the existing IT systems, their compatibility and their efficiency. He concluded by reporting on the progress of the various current activities of the Secretariat for the Economy.\n\nIn the afternoon session of 8 June, the Council received a report from Cardinal O'Malley, with a proposal for the Pope regarding allegations of the abuse of office by a bishop connected to the abuse of minors, originally prepared by the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. Cardinal O'Malley's report also included a proposal regarding allegations of sexual abuse of minors and vulnerable adults by clergy. For each proposal, the report indicated the general terms which define it, issues relating to procedure and to the competent Tribunal, as well as the advantages of the proposal compared with other possible solutions. The five specific proposals made to the Pope are firstly, because the competence to receive and investigate complaints of the episcopal abuse of office belongs to the Congregations for Bishops, Evangelisation of Peoples, or Oriental Churches, there is the duty to report all complaints to the appropriate Congregation; the Pope mandate the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to judge bishops with regard to crimes of the abuse of office when connected to the abuse of minors; the Pope authorise the establishment of a new Judicial Section in the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] and appointment of stable personnel to undertake service in the Tribunal. The implementation of this decision would follow consultation with the prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith; the Pope appoint a secretary to assist the prefect with the Tribunal. The secretary will be responsible for the new Judicial Section and the personnel of the section will also be available to the prefect for penal processes regarding the abuse of minors and vulnerable adults by clergy. This appointment will also follow the consultation with the prefect of the Congregation; the Pope establish a five-year period for further development of these proposals and for completing a formal evaluation of their effectiveness.\n\nThe Council agreed unanimously on these proposals and resolved that they be submitted to the Pope, who approved the proposals and authorised the provision of sufficient resources for this purpose. In the morning of 9 June the Council of Cardinals heard a report given by Msgr. Dario Vigano, director of the Vatican Television Centre and president of the Commission for Vatican communications instituted by Pope Francis on 23 April 2015 (made public on 30 April), and expressed its unanimous approval of the feasibility study conducted by the same Commission. Starting from the analyses and reports of McKinsey and the previous commissions (COSEA and the Vatican Media Commission chaired by Lord Patten), the current Commission presented a plan for reform to be implemented over a four-year period, ensuring the protection of staff and a gradual integration of institutions. The constitution of the dicastery will be drafted, and the necessary appointments made during the coming months to enable the process to be initiated. The Commission is currently continuing its work, which has yet to be completed. On 10 June, the Council heard a communique from Fr. [[Michael Czerny]] of the Pontifical Council \"Justice and Peace\" regarding the Pope's new encyclical and the preparation for its publication.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/the-tenth-meeting-of-council-of.html |title=The tenth meeting of the Council of Cardinals comes to an end |date=10 June 2015 |website=Vatican Information Service}}</ref>\n\nThe meeting that took place from 14\u201316 September discussed \"The proposal for a new Congregation, provisionally entitled \"Laity, Family and Life\", was again taken into consideration\", said Fr. Lombardi. \"In this regard [[Dionigi Cardinal Tettamanzi]], designated by the Pope in recent months to prepare a study on the feasibility of the project, was heard. At the end of their reflections the Council presented to the Pope a proposal orientated towards the implementation of the project. Consideration of the proposal for a new Congregation dedicated to \"Charity, Justice and Peace\" was resumed and further reflections were made without yet reaching, however, a conclusive proposal by the Council.<ref name=Briefing11>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/briefing-on-eleventh-meeting-of-council.html |title=Briefing on the eleventh meeting of the Council of Cardinals |website=Vatican Information Service |date=16 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/09/16/cardinals_approve_new_congregation_for_laity,_family,_life/1172241 |website=Vatican Radio |title=Council of cardinals approves Congregation for laity, family, life |date=16 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe meetings discussed [[Appointment of Catholic bishops|the appointment of new bishops]], or more specifically on the qualities and requisites for candidates in view of the needs of today's world, and on the related issue of information gathering. Naturally the theme will need to be explored further and developed in collaboration with the competent Dicasteries concerned. The Prefect of the [[Secretariat for Communications]] reported to the Council on the first steps taken so far and in particular on the appointment of a group to draw up the Statutes for the new Dicastery. The working group has been constituted and has already commenced activity. The regulations will subsequently be drafted and issued. The theme proposed during the last session of the Council regarding issues linked to the abuse of minors was again taken into consideration. The matter of how to implement proposals was explored in further depth, especially with regard to the possibility of accelerating the resolution of the many cases still pending. Cardinal Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga was absent for health reasons.<ref name=Briefing11 />\n\nDuring the meeting on 10 to 12 December 2015 the Pope developed extensively the theme of \"collegiality\", but also pointed out \"the need to proceed with a healthy 'decentralization'.\"  The Council returned to work on two new departments, which had previously been discussed on numerous occasions. The Department dedicated to \"Laity and family life\" \u2013 the establishment of which Pope Francis announced during the Synod (22 October) - was the subject of a detailed proposal by the Council to the Pope. The Department dedicated to \"Justice, Peace and Migration\" was subject to further considerations, in anticipation of creating the final proposal to be given to the Pope. The Council heard two reports on the reform of the economic structures of the Vatican, which were given by Cardinal Marx, Co-ordinator of the Council of Economy, and Cardinal George Pell, prefect for the Secretariat of Economy. The two Cardinals reported on the activities and achievements of the two institutions. In the course of his presentation, Cardinal Marx discussed the choice of an external auditor for the consolidated financial statements of the Vatican, PricewaterhouseCoopers. Cardinal Pell gave information about the establishment of a working group to reflect on the future of the economic issues of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, including its present state, and the control of expenditure and revenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/12/12/council_of_cardinals_conclude_twelfth_meeting/1193924 |title=Council of Cardinals conclude twelfth meeting |website=Vatican Radio |date=12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2016 meetings===\n\nThe Council with Pope Francis for a day and a half, Monday 8 February, morning and afternoon, and Tuesday 9 in the morning. Cardinal Gracias, was absent for health reasons. His absence was expected since the month of December, as he was expected to undergo a previously scheduled surgical operation. As already expected at the end of the previous meeting, the first session consisted of a close examination of the Pope's discourse on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Synod of Bishops (17 October). This discourse, which develops extensively the theme of \"synodality\", noting at the same time \"the need to promote a sound decentralisation\", constitutes an important point of reference for the work of reforming the Curia. This was followed by a \"final\" reading of the proposals of the Council regarding the two new Dicasteries, mentioned previously: \"Laity, family and life\", and \"Justice, peace, migration\". The proposals were finalised and submitted to the Pope for his decisions. Cardinal O'Malley, reported on the activities of the Commission for the Protection of Minors. The legal and disciplinary issues that fall under the jurisdiction of other Dicasteries of the Curia will need to be examined in further detail. Cardinal Pell, reported on the status and implementation of reforms in the economic field. The cardinals received documentation on the so-called \"vademecum\" prepared by the Tribunal of the Roman Rota for the implementation of reform on canonical procedures for the declaration of nullity of marriage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://visnews-en.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/thirteenth-meeting-of-council-of_9.html |title=Thirteenth meeting of the Council of Cardinals: synodality and sound decentralisation |website=Vatican Information Service |date=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nMeetings were held between 11\u201313 April, with the absence of Cardinal Gracias, for health reasons. Apart from the Wednesday morning session, which took place during the customary General Audience, Pope Francis himself participated in all of the meetings of the Council.\nIn a press briefing on the meetings, Father Federico Lombardi, SJ, the Director of the Holy See Press Office, said Cardinals\u2019 discussion focused largely on final considerations concerning the various Dicasteries of the Roman Curia, in view of a new [[Apostolic Constitution]]. In particular, the Cardinals re-read, and entrusted to the Pope, several texts relating to the proposal to create to new Dicasteries, dedicated to \"Laity, Family, and Life\" and to \"Justice, Peace, and Migration.\" Father Lombardi said the Cardinals also took up several other topics in particular, the Council considered criteria for gathering information for the nomination of new bishops, in light of their identity and pastoral mission. They also discussed the significance and role of Nuncios. Additionally, the Council heard from two of their own members. Cardinal George Pell updated his colleagues on the work of the Secretariat for the Economy, while Cardinal Sean O'Malley discussed the activities of the Pontifical Council for the Protection of Minors. The final day of the Council's work, Father Lombardi said, was dedicated to organizing the results of the foregoing discussion, in order to craft a comprehensive proposal from the Council to the Pope, in view of a new Constitution for the Roman Curia.<ref>{{cite web |website=Vatican Radio |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2016/04/13/council_of_cardinals_concludes_meetings_in_vatican/1222534 |title=Council of Cardinals concludes meetings in Vatican |date=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Council met from 6\u20138 June, a large part of the consultations was dedicated to discussing the reforms regarding the Secretariat of State, the Congregations for Catholic Education, for Oriental Churches, for the Clergy and for Bishops, as well as the Pontifical Councils for Culture, for Christian Unity and for Interreligious Dialogue. The results of previous consultations regarding the Congregations for the Doctrine of the Faith, for Worship and the Sacraments, for the Causes of Saints and for Consecrated Life, as well as the new Charity, Justice and Peace office, have been handed over to Pope Francis for his deliberations. Fr Lombardi said that the reforms were focused on the criteria of simplifying and harmonizing the work of the different offices, as well as exploring ways of decentralizing tasks to the different bishops conferences. Finally he noted that Cardinal Marx and Cardinal Pell discussed questions relating to the Council and the Secretariat for the Economy, while Mgr [[Dario Vigano]] reported on the continuing reform of the Vatican media offices, especially the process of integrating Vatican Radio and the Vatican Television Centre which is taking place this year.\n\nMeetings of the Council were scheduled for 12\u201314 September and 12\u201314 December 2016.\n\n===2017 meetings===\n\nFrom 13\u201315 February the Council of Cardinals met with the Pope during three days. All the members of the Council were present.\n\nPope Francis was absent during the second part of the session on Monday morning because of the \"ad Limina Apostolorum\" of the bishops of Costa Rica; and during the morning session of Wednesday 15 February because of the General Audience.

The Council has also studied, during these day, the process for the selection of candidates to the Episcopate.\n\nCardinal George Pell spoke about the work of the Secretariat for the Economy, entrusted to him, for the full implementation of the economic reform requested by the Pope, with particular attention to the activities of personnel training and human resources. The Prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, Dario Edoardo Vigan\u00f2, presented the current state of the reform of the communications of the Holy See, after the unification of the Vatican Radio and the Vatican Television Center in the Dicastery entrusted to him.

The Cardinals also considered texts to propose to the Pope regarding the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue; the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts; and three tribunals: the [[Apostolic Penitentiary]], the [[Apostolic Signatura]], and the [[Roman Rota]]. During the meetings, the Council also studied the selection and formation of the personnel in the service of the Holy See, both clerics and members of the lay faithful. Officials and superiors from the Secretariat of State, from the Council for the Economy, and from the [[Labour Office of the Apostolic See]] took part in the discussions. Another important theme treated by the Council was the relationship between the Episcopal Conferences and the Roman Curia.

Cardinal O\u2019Malley updated the Council on the work of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of minors, focussing especially on the programme of global education, the last plenary assembly, and the visits to various dicasteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/04/26/press_briefing_at_the_conclusion_of_the_meeting_of_the_c-9/1308200 |title=Press briefing at the conclusion of the meeting of the C-9 |website=Vatican Radio |date=26 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Council of Cardinals met with the Pope for three days: Monday 12, Tuesday 13 and Wednesday 14 June. All members of the Council were present apart from Cardinal O\u2019Malley. The sessions were dedicated to further consideration of the ways in which the Roman Curia can better serve the local Churches. For example, a larger consultation board made up also of members from consecrated life and the laity, for candidates proposed for [[Appointment of Catholic bishops|appointment as bishop]]. Among other proposals, the possibility of transferring some functions from the Roman Dicasteries to the local bishops or episcopal councils, in a spirit of healthy decentralisation. For example, the transfer of the Dicastery for the Clergy to the Episcopal Conference for examination and authorisation for: the priestly ordination of an unmarried permanent deacon; the passage to new marriage for a widowed permanent deacon; the request for priestly ordination by a widowed permanent deacon. The Council gave further consideration to various Dicasteries of the Curia, in particular the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. The Council studied and reread texts proposed for submission to the Pope regarding the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue; the Dicastery for the Oriental Churches; the Dicastery for Legislative Texts; and the three tribunals. Cardinal Pell provided an update on the work of the Secretariat for the Economy, of which he is the prefect. Particular attention was paid to the steps ahead made in the process of planning of economic resources and in monitoring financial plans for the first trimester of 2017 which have substantially confirmed, with few exceptions, the budget data. Shortly the budget process will begin for 2018, and the monitoring for the second trimester of 2017. The prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, Msgr.

Pope Francis joined the group of his closest advisors for the Tuesday morning and afternoon sessions having returned from Colombia.\n\nCardinal Pell and Cardinal Monsengwo Pasinya, were unable to attend this week's meeting. A main focus for discussion at this encounter was how the Curia can be an instrument of evangelization at the service of the pope and the local Churches. In particular the cardinals talked about the need for decentralisation, the role of the [[nunciature]]s, the selection of personnel, especially the need for a less clerical and more international staff, with an increase in the number of women and young people. The cardinals also discussed Pope Francis\u2019 recent [[motu proprio]] \u2018Magnum Principium\u2019, reflecting on how it may affect the work of the Congregation for Divine Worship, and they reviewed the statutes of the office for Laity, Family and Life.\n\nThree other prelates gave presentations about the work of their offices: Archbishop [[Rino Fisichella|Salvatore Fisichella]] spoke about his Council for New Evangelisation, Cardinal O\u2019Malley updated the cardinals on the work of the [[Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors]], and at the final session, Cardinal Filoni spoke to the cardinals about the work of his 'Propaganda Fide' Congregation.<ref>[http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/09/13/c9_cardinals_meet_to_discuss_vatican_reforms/1336616]</ref>\n\nThe next meeting of the C9 is scheduled to take place in the Vatican from 11 to 13 December.\n\n===2018 meetings===\n\nThe Council met from 11\u201313 June.

As this report states, \"The Task Force's central recommendation is establishment by 2010 of a [[North America]]n economic and security community, the boundaries of which would be defined by a [[common external tariff]] and an outer security perimeter.\"\n\n==Background==\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, Blue Oval News reporter [[John Redpath]] and [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] led a movement to merge Canada with the United States. However, the movement failed because it was massively opposed by the local constituents and by the British Empire. It had been encouraged by the [[Parti rouge]] of Rodolphe Laflamme. See also [[Montreal Annexation Manifesto]].\n\nAt the time of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846\u20131848, in which the U.S. annexed California and New Mexico among other current states, there were supporters of the idea of annexing the whole of Mexico. This idea was finally rejected because of the higher population density in the non-annexed areas- a factor that would hinder assimilation.\n\nIn recent times, the three [[North America]]n [[nation-state]]s have increased their economic ties, further accelerating the process with the signing of 1994's [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).\n\nIn response to the demands of increasing [[globalization]] and shared concerns from abroad, such as the increasing clout of other economic spheres such as the [[European Union]], the [[African Union]], [[China]], the [[Arab League]] and the proposed [[Middle Eastern Union]], the leaders of the three nations agreed in 2005 to work more cooperatively on shared North American concerns.  To this end, they agreed to establish the [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America]] (SPP).<ref name=\"SPP\">\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.spp.gov\n |title       = Security and Prosperity Partnership Of North America\n |accessdate  = 2009-02-07\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081207080118/http://www.spp.gov/\n |archivedate = 2008-12-07\n}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn reference to this summit that established the [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America|SPP]], this task force's final report stated, \"We welcome this important development and offer this report to add urgency and specific recommendations to strengthen their efforts.\"<ref name=\"Building NAC\" /> These specific recommendations include developing a North American [[customs union]], [[common market]], [[investment fund]], [[energy strategy]], set of [[regulatory]] standards, security perimeter, border pass, and advisory council, among other common goals.\n\n[[Robert Pastor]], one of this task force's vice-chairmen, has advocated such a [[monetary union]] and has suggested that North America's common currency might be called the \"amero\", which would be similar in concept to the EU's [[euro]].<ref>[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=15017 The Plan to Replace the Dollar With the 'Amero'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018101635/http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=15017 |date=2006-10-18 }}, by Jerome R.

However, the movement failed because it was massively opposed by the local constituents and by the British Empire. It had been encouraged by the [[Parti rouge]] of Rodolphe Laflamme. See also [[Montreal Annexation Manifesto]].\n\nAt the time of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846\u20131848, in which the U.S. annexed California and New Mexico among other current states, there were supporters of the idea of annexing the whole of Mexico. This idea was finally rejected because of the higher population density in the non-annexed areas- a factor that would hinder assimilation.\n\nIn recent times, the three [[North America]]n [[nation-state]]s have increased their economic ties, further accelerating the process with the signing of 1994's [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).\n\nIn response to the demands of increasing [[globalization]] and shared concerns from abroad, such as the increasing clout of other economic spheres such as the [[European Union]], the [[African Union]], [[China]], the [[Arab League]] and the proposed [[Middle Eastern Union]], the leaders of the three nations agreed in 2005 to work more cooperatively on shared North American concerns.  To this end, they agreed to establish the [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America]] (SPP).<ref name=\"SPP\">\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.spp.gov\n |title       = Security and Prosperity Partnership Of North America\n |accessdate  = 2009-02-07\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081207080118/http://www.spp.gov/\n |archivedate = 2008-12-07\n}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn reference to this summit that established the [[Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America|SPP]], this task force's final report stated, \"We welcome this important development and offer this report to add urgency and specific recommendations to strengthen their efforts.\"<ref name=\"Building NAC\" /> These specific recommendations include developing a North American [[customs union]], [[common market]], [[investment fund]], [[energy strategy]], set of [[regulatory]] standards, security perimeter, border pass, and advisory council, among other common goals.\n\n[[Robert Pastor]], one of this task force's vice-chairmen, has advocated such a [[monetary union]] and has suggested that North America's common currency might be called the \"amero\", which would be similar in concept to the EU's [[euro]].<ref>[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=15017 The Plan to Replace the Dollar With the 'Amero'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018101635/http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=15017 |date=2006-10-18 }}, by Jerome R.

From 1912 until 1931, with the opening of [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], it was the premier site of [[ice hockey]] in Toronto, being home to teams from the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA), the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] (OHA) and the [[International Hockey League (1929-1936)|International Hockey League]] (IHL).  It was the first home of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], who played at the arena under various names for their first 13\u00bd seasons. The Arena Gardens was the third rink in Canada to feature a mechanically frozen or 'artificial' ice surface, and for eleven years was the only such facility in eastern Canada. In 1923, it was the site of the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game, the first radio broadcast of an NHL game, and the first broadcast of an ice hockey game by long-time broadcaster [[Foster Hewitt]]. \n\nThe Arena was also used for musical concerts, gatherings and other sporting events, including professional [[boxing]], [[cycling]], [[wrestling]] and [[tennis]]. In 1962, it was converted to a [[curling]] club and [[roller skating]] rink known as '''The Terrace'''. The building was demolished in 1989 and the ''Cathedral Square'' residential complex and ''Arena Gardens'' municipal park now occupy the site. It was located on Mutual Street, just south of [[Dundas Street|Dundas Street East]] and two blocks east of [[Church Street (Toronto)|Church Street]] in downtown Toronto.\n\n==History==\nIt was constructed for a reported cost of {{CAD|500,000|link=yes}} and opened in 1912.{{sfn|Filey|1989|p=22}} It was built on the site of the [[Mutual Street Rink]], used primarily for [[curling]] and [[ice skating]] between [[Dundas Street|Dundas Street East]] and Shuter Street. At the time, it was billed as the largest indoor arena in Canada and held about 7,500 for hockey. The rink was owned by the Toronto Arena Company, organized September 19, 1911, with [[Henry Pellatt|Sir Henry Pellatt]] as president, [[Lol Solman]] as managing director, and directors [[Aemilius Jarvis]], Joseph Kilgour, T.W.

From 1912 until 1931, with the opening of [[Maple Leaf Gardens]], it was the premier site of [[ice hockey]] in Toronto, being home to teams from the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA), the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), the [[Ontario Hockey Association]] (OHA) and the [[International Hockey League (1929-1936)|International Hockey League]] (IHL).  It was the first home of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], who played at the arena under various names for their first 13\u00bd seasons. The Arena Gardens was the third rink in Canada to feature a mechanically frozen or 'artificial' ice surface, and for eleven years was the only such facility in eastern Canada. In 1923, it was the site of the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game, the first radio broadcast of an NHL game, and the first broadcast of an ice hockey game by long-time broadcaster [[Foster Hewitt]]. \n\nThe Arena was also used for musical concerts, gatherings and other sporting events, including professional [[boxing]], [[cycling]], [[wrestling]] and [[tennis]]. In 1962, it was converted to a [[curling]] club and [[roller skating]] rink known as '''The Terrace'''. The building was demolished in 1989 and the ''Cathedral Square'' residential complex and ''Arena Gardens'' municipal park now occupy the site. It was located on Mutual Street, just south of [[Dundas Street|Dundas Street East]] and two blocks east of [[Church Street (Toronto)|Church Street]] in downtown Toronto.\n\n==History==\nIt was constructed for a reported cost of {{CAD|500,000|link=yes}} and opened in 1912.{{sfn|Filey|1989|p=22}} It was built on the site of the [[Mutual Street Rink]], used primarily for [[curling]] and [[ice skating]] between [[Dundas Street|Dundas Street East]] and Shuter Street.

The update include improvements to the Grid Engine scheduler for larger clusters and Qmaster stability improvements for spooling and qalter commands.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.2.0 was released on Sept 02, 2014. The new Univa Grid Engine version 8.2 includes native Windows support .\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.3.0 was released on June 22, 2015. The new Preemption feature in Univa Grid Engine 8.3.0 allows users to set priorities on different work so that, if a higher priority application must use resources currently allocated to a lower priority application, the lower priority application will effectively be \u201cpaused\u201d\u2014not lost\u2014and work will automatically resume once the higher priority application is completed. Among a handful of other new features added to Grid Engine 8.3.0 to improve the overall reliability and efficiency of the cluster, is the new Run Time Modification of Resources feature. The Run Time Modification of Resources feature means much more efficient use of cluster resources.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.3.1 was released on August 28, 2015. This release contained all of the new features in Univa Grid Engine 8.3.0 and additional fixes and enhancements identified since the release of 8.3.0.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.4.0 was released on May 31, 2016.

The new Univa Grid Engine Docker integration allows for more flexibility when running Docker containers in a Univa Grid Engine environment.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.1 was released on August 8, 2018, providing improved control over GPU devices, and new affinity features, allowing jobs to gravitate towards, or away from, certain compute nodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.univa.com/2018/08/introducing-univa-grid-engine-8-6-1-next-level-enterprise-grade-workload-management/|title=Introducing Univa Grid Engine 8.6.1: Next-Level Enterprise Grade Workload Management|website=blogs.univa.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}</ref>\n\n8.6.2 was released on August 16, 2018. Univa Grid Engine performance and scalability has been improved in several key areas: network communications, job submission, memory allocation, and scheduler optimizations. This update also improved Univa Grid Engine job dispatch information.\n\n8.6.3 was released on September 27, 2018. The new update provided bulk configuration changes for Univa Grid Engine hosts. The new bulk configuration commands perform operations on many hosts simultaneously, which makes it easier to manage a large Univa Grid Engine cluster.\n\n8.6.4 was released on November 23, 2018, providing new core binding strategies to make it easier to distribute nodes and cores for jobs while also providing more flexibility. A new affinity-based job placement policy was included in this update. Jobs submitted using an affinity will either be packed close together with a \u201cpositive affinity\u201d or \u201cnegative affinity\u201d across the cluster, based on the resources requested. A new Univa Grid Engine Resource Maps can now control access to host devices such as NVIDIA GPUs. This allows jobs to request GPUs and that GPU is exclusively assigned to the job. Univa Grid Engine now also directly communicates with NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager to collect GPU metrics for scheduling and accounting.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.5 was released on May 6, 2019. The new key features are:\n\n* Support for IBM Power 9 on Linux\n* Many improvements to Docker support on Univa Grid Engine including supporting the latest Docker versions\n* Very large cluster hostname management where IP for host is contained in the hostname\n* Integration with Linux Out of Memory (OOM) Notification API ensuring that Univa Grid Engine is automatically notified of jobs that are terminated by the Linux kernel\n* Improved responsiveness in heavily loaded cluster for Grid Engine administrator commands\n* Performance improvements to Univa Grid Engine automatic job rescheduling\n* Thread deadlock detection for Univa Grid Engine qmaster\n* Updated support for NVIDIA DCGM versions up to 1.6.3\n* GPU/CPU affinity can be specified as a hard or soft request\n\n8.6.7 was released on August 5, 2019. Among the numerous enhancements, Univa Grid Engine 8.6.7 offers Red Hat Linux 8 support and NVIDIA GPU DCGM job usage.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.9 was released on February 10, 2020. It included enhancements made to qconf and improved information and messaging collection.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.11 was released on March 17, 2020.

A more comprehensive genealogy of the product is described in [[Sun Grid Engine]]. Grid Engine was first distributed by Genias Software and from 1999, after a company merger, by Gridware, Inc. In 2000, [[Sun Microsystems]] acquired Gridware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2000-07/sunflash.20000724.3.xml|title=Gridware's resource management software increases efficiency and productivity in compute-intensive technical computing environments|date=2000-07-24|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}</ref>  Sun renamed CODINE/GRD as Sun Grid Engine later that year, and released it as [[open-source software|open-source]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2001-07/sunflash.20010723.1.xml|title=Sun Microsystems makes SUN GRID ENGINE software available to open source community|date=2001-07-23|publisher=Sun Microsystems}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Oracle Corporation]] acquired Sun and thus renamed SGE to [[Oracle Grid Engine]].  The Oracle Grid Engine 6.2u6 source code was not included with the binaries, and changes were not put back to the project's source repository.  In response to this, the Grid Engine community started the ''Open Grid Scheduler'' and the ''Son of Grid Engine'' projects to continue to develop and maintain a free implementation of Grid Engine.<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/projects/gridscheduler/ Open Grid Scheduler]</ref><ref>[https://arc.liv.ac.uk/trac/SGE Son of Grid Engine]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7850|title=The State of Oracle/Sun Grid Engine|first=Douglas|last=Eadline, Ph.D.|date=September 1, 2010|accessdate=2011-01-18|publisher=Linux Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://markmail.org/message/hcxond5s4cywe5dv|title=Changes for a Bright Future at Oracle|first=Daniel|last=Templeton|date=2010-12-23|accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref>\n\nOn January 18, 2011, [[Univa]] announced that it had hired the principal engineers from the Sun Grid Engine team.<ref>{{cite press_release | url=http://www.univa.com/| title=Univa Acquires Grid Engine Expertise | publisher=Univa | date=2011-01-18 | accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref>  Univa Grid Engine development is led by CTO Fritz Ferstl, who founded the Grid Engine project and ran the business within Sun/Oracle for the past 10 years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.univa.com/about/| title=Biography of Fritz Ferstl | publisher=Univa | accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn October 22, 2013 [[Univa]] announced that it had acquired Oracle Grid Engine assets and intellectual property making it the sole commercial provider of Grid Engine software.<ref>{{cite press_release | url=http://www.univa.com/about/news/press_2013/10222013.php| title=Univa completes acquisition of Grid Engine assets | publisher=Univa | date=2013-10-22 | accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2018 [[Univa]] announced massive scalability operating a single cluster with over 1 million cores on [[Amazon Web Services|AWS]].<ref>{{cite blog | url=https://blogs.univa.com/2018/06/univa-demonstrates-extreme-scale-automation-by-deploying-more-than-one-million-cores-in-a-single-univa-grid-engine-cluster-using-aws/ | title=Univa Demonstrates Extreme Scale Automation by Deploying More Than One Million Cores in a Single Univa Grid Engine Cluster using AWS | publisher=Univa | date=2018-06-24 | accessdate=June 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Releases ==\nUniva Grid Engine 8.0 was the first version, released on April 12, 2011.<ref>{{cite press_release | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110412005977/en/Univa-Grid-Engine-8.0 | title=Univa Grid Engine 8.0 Now Available | publisher=Univa | date=2011-04-12 | accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref>  It was [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from SGE 6.2u5, the last open source release.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wheregridenginelives.com/content/rebirth-continuity-and-expansion-univa-grid-engine-v80 | title=Rebirth, Continuity and Expansion - Univa Grid Engine v8.0 | publisher=Univa | date=2011-04-12 | accessdate=April 17, 2011 | author=Ferstl, Fritz}}</ref>  It adds improved third party application integration, license and policy management, enhanced support for software and hardware platforms, and cloud management tools.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.0.1 was released on October 4, 2011.<ref>{{cite press_release | url=http://www.univa.com/news/| title=Univa Widens Grid Engine Gap | publisher=Univa | date=2011-10-04 | accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref>  It adds improved support for multi-core hardware, integration with NVIDIA GPUs, new job submission verifier extensions, and additional bug fixes.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.1.0 has been announced on May 2 and has updated it to the latest release level 8.1.3 in Nov 15 2012. The 8.1.x releases deliver important new functionality such as Job Classes, PostGres Spooling, Resource Maps, Fair Urgency, deterministic Wildcard PE Selection, improved Diagnostics, pre-configured MPI integations and improved Apache Hadoop Integration <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.univa.com/resources/| title=Univa Grid Engine Integration for Hadoop | publisher=Univa}}</ref> as well as many bug fixes and performance improvements.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.1.6 has been announced on Oct 14, 2013. The update include improvements to the Grid Engine scheduler for larger clusters and Qmaster stability improvements for spooling and qalter commands.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.2.0 was released on Sept 02, 2014. The new Univa Grid Engine version 8.2 includes native Windows support .\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.3.0 was released on June 22, 2015. The new Preemption feature in Univa Grid Engine 8.3.0 allows users to set priorities on different work so that, if a higher priority application must use resources currently allocated to a lower priority application, the lower priority application will effectively be \u201cpaused\u201d\u2014not lost\u2014and work will automatically resume once the higher priority application is completed. Among a handful of other new features added to Grid Engine 8.3.0 to improve the overall reliability and efficiency of the cluster, is the new Run Time Modification of Resources feature. The Run Time Modification of Resources feature means much more efficient use of cluster resources.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.3.1 was released on August 28, 2015. This release contained all of the new features in Univa Grid Engine 8.3.0 and additional fixes and enhancements identified since the release of 8.3.0.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.4.0 was released on May 31, 2016. This release supports [[Docker (software)|Docker]] containers and will automatically dispatch and run jobs with a user specified Docker Image.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/about/news/press_2016/05312016.php|title=New Version of Univa Grid Engine|last=univa|website=www.univa.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref>\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.5.0 was released on March 7, 2017. This release of Univa Grid Engine is 2x faster than open source Grid Engine 6.2u5. Grid Engine 8.5.0 also includes significant improvement to Docker support including mobility of GPU apps within the cluster.\n\n8.6.0 was released on July 17, 2018. Univa Grid Engine now supports NVIDIA Docker 2.0. The new Univa Grid Engine Docker integration allows for more flexibility when running Docker containers in a Univa Grid Engine environment.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.1 was released on August 8, 2018, providing improved control over GPU devices, and new affinity features, allowing jobs to gravitate towards, or away from, certain compute nodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.univa.com/2018/08/introducing-univa-grid-engine-8-6-1-next-level-enterprise-grade-workload-management/|title=Introducing Univa Grid Engine 8.6.1: Next-Level Enterprise Grade Workload Management|website=blogs.univa.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}</ref>\n\n8.6.2 was released on August 16, 2018. Univa Grid Engine performance and scalability has been improved in several key areas: network communications, job submission, memory allocation, and scheduler optimizations. This update also improved Univa Grid Engine job dispatch information.\n\n8.6.3 was released on September 27, 2018. The new update provided bulk configuration changes for Univa Grid Engine hosts. The new bulk configuration commands perform operations on many hosts simultaneously, which makes it easier to manage a large Univa Grid Engine cluster.\n\n8.6.4 was released on November 23, 2018, providing new core binding strategies to make it easier to distribute nodes and cores for jobs while also providing more flexibility. A new affinity-based job placement policy was included in this update. Jobs submitted using an affinity will either be packed close together with a \u201cpositive affinity\u201d or \u201cnegative affinity\u201d across the cluster, based on the resources requested. A new Univa Grid Engine Resource Maps can now control access to host devices such as NVIDIA GPUs. This allows jobs to request GPUs and that GPU is exclusively assigned to the job. Univa Grid Engine now also directly communicates with NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager to collect GPU metrics for scheduling and accounting.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.5 was released on May 6, 2019. The new key features are:\n\n* Support for IBM Power 9 on Linux\n* Many improvements to Docker support on Univa Grid Engine including supporting the latest Docker versions\n* Very large cluster hostname management where IP for host is contained in the hostname\n* Integration with Linux Out of Memory (OOM) Notification API ensuring that Univa Grid Engine is automatically notified of jobs that are terminated by the Linux kernel\n* Improved responsiveness in heavily loaded cluster for Grid Engine administrator commands\n* Performance improvements to Univa Grid Engine automatic job rescheduling\n* Thread deadlock detection for Univa Grid Engine qmaster\n* Updated support for NVIDIA DCGM versions up to 1.6.3\n* GPU/CPU affinity can be specified as a hard or soft request\n\n8.6.7 was released on August 5, 2019. Among the numerous enhancements, Univa Grid Engine 8.6.7 offers Red Hat Linux 8 support and NVIDIA GPU DCGM job usage.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Job scheduler#Batch queuing for HPC clusters|Job Scheduler and Batch Queuing for Clusters]]\n<!-- sort alphabetically: -->\n* [[Beowulf cluster]]\n* [[Maui Cluster Scheduler]]\n* [[Open Source Cluster Application Resources]] (OSCAR)\n* [[Slurm Workload Manager]]\n* [[TORQUE]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.univa.com/products/}}\n* [http://linuxappfinder.com/package/gridengine pointer to repository for old Debian and Ubuntu packages]\n\n[[Category:Grid computing]]\n", "name_user": "Nbendov", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReleases", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univa_Grid_Engine"}

''Stuyvesant'' is derived from [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the last governor of the colony of [[New Netherland]].\n\n====17th and 18th centuries====\nIn the second half of the 17th century, the lands which constitute the present neighborhood belonged to three Dutch settlers: Dirck Janse Hooghland, who operated a ferryboat on the East River, and farmers Jan Hansen, and Leffert Pietersen van Haughwout. In pre-[[American Revolutionary War|revolutionary]] Kings County, Bedford was the first, major settlement east of the Village of Brooklyn on the ferry road to the town of [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] and eastern [[Long Island]]. Stuyvesant Heights, however, was farmland; the area became a community after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nFor most of its early history, Stuyvesant Heights was part of the outlying farm area of the small hamlet of Bedford, settled by the Dutch during the 17th century within the incorporated town of Breuckelen. The hamlet had its beginnings when a group of Breuckelen residents decided to improve their farm properties behind the Wallabout section, which gradually developed into an important produce center and market. The petition to form a new hamlet was approved by Governor Stuyvesant in 1663. Its leading signer was Thomas Lambertsen, a carpenter from Holland. A year later, the British capture of New Netherland signaled the end of Dutch rule. In [[Richard Nicolls|Governor Nicolls']] Charter of 1667 and in the Charter of 1686, Bedford is mentioned as a settlement within the Town of Brueckelen. Bedford hamlet had an inn as early as 1668, and, in 1670, the people of Breuckelen purchased from the [[Canarsie Indians]] an additional area for common lands in the surrounding region.\n\nBedford Corners, approximately located where the present [[Bedford Avenue]] meets [[Fulton Street (Brooklyn)|Fulton Street]], and only three blocks west of the present Historic District, was the intersection of several well traveled roads. The Brooklyn and Jamaica Turnpike, constructed by a corporation founded in 1809 and one of the oldest roads in Kings County, ran parallel to the present Fulton Street, from the East River ferry to the village of Brooklyn, thence to the hamlet of Bedford and on toward Jamaica via Bed\u2013Stuy. Farmers from New Lots and Flatbush used this road on their way to Manhattan. Within the Stuyvesant Heights Historic District, the Turnpike ran along the approximate line of Decatur Street. Cripplebush Road to Newtown and the Clove Road to Flatbush also met at Bedford Corners. Hunterfly Road, which joined the Turnpike about a mile to the east of Clove Road, also served as a route for farmers and fishermen of the Canarsie and New Lots areas.\n\nAt the time of the Revolution, Leffert's son Jakop was a leading citizen of Bedford and the town clerk of Brooklyn.  His neighbor, Lambert Suydam, was captain of the Kings County cavalry in 1776. An important part of the [[Battle of Long Island]] took place in and near the Historic District. In 1784, the people of the Town of Brooklyn held their first town meeting since 1776.\n\n====19th century{{anchor|Establishment as an urban neighborhood}}====\n[[File:MacDonoughStreetSH.jpg|thumb|287px|right|Row houses on MacDonough Street]]\nIn 1800, Bedford was designated one of the seven districts of the Town of Brooklyn, and, in 1834, it became part of the seventh and ninth wards of the newly incorporated City of Brooklyn. With the building of the [[Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad]] in 1833, along [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]], Bedford was established as a railroad station near the intersection of current Atlantic Avenue and Franklin Avenues. In 1836, the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad was taken over by the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR), which in 1878 would gain a connection to the [[BMT Brighton Line|Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway]]'s northern terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Early_Rapid_Transit_in_Brooklyn,_1878-1913#The_Brooklyn.2C_Flatbush_and_Coney_Island_Railroad_.28The_Brighton_Line.29.2FThe_New_York_and_Manhattan_Beach_Railroad|title=The Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railroad (The Brighton Line)/The New York and Manhattan Beach Railroad|work=nycsubway.org|accessdate=January 16, 2013}}</ref> The [[Weeksville, Brooklyn|Weeksville]] subsection, founded in 1838, was recognized as one of the first, free [[African American|African-American]] communities in the United States.<ref>Ramirez, Anthony.[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/nyregion/05weeksville.html?_r=1&oref=slogin \"Haven for Blacks in Civil War Riots Now Safeguards History\"], ''The New York Times'', June 5, 2005.

When Charles C. Betts purchased Maria Lott's tract of land the same year, this marked the end of two centuries of Dutch patrimonial holdings. Most of the streets were not opened until the 1860s, at which point Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant's streets were named after prominent figures in American history. The Dripps Map of 1869 shows that the area was still largely rural with a few freestanding houses mostly on MacDonough Street. The real development of the district began slowly at first, accelerating between 1885 and 1900, and gradually tapering off during the first two decades of the 20th century.\n\n[[File:Brooklyn brownstones in Stuyvesant Heights built between 1870-1899.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Along Stuyvesant Avenue]]\n\nConstruction of masonry row houses in the 1870s began to transform the rural district into an urban area. The first row of masonry houses in Stuyvesant Heights was built in 1872 on MacDonough Street for developer Curtis L. North. In the 1880s and 1890s, more rows were added, most of the Stuyvesant Heights north of Decatur Street looked much as it does today. Stuyvesant Heights was emerging as a neighborhood entity with its own distinctive characteristics. The houses had large rooms, high ceilings and large windows, and were built primarily by German immigrants.<ref name=\"Gregor 2014\">{{cite web |last=Gregor |first=Alison |title=Bedford-Stuyvesant: Diverse and Changing |website=The New York Times |date=July 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/realestate/bedford-stuyvesant-diverse-and-changing.html |access-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref> The people who bought these houses were generally upper-middle-class families, mostly lawyers, shopkeepers, and merchants of German and Irish descent, with a sprinkling of English people; there were also a few professionals.

''Stuyvesant'' is derived from [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the last governor of the colony of [[New Netherland]].\n\n====17th and 18th centuries====\nIn the second half of the 17th century, the lands which constitute the present neighborhood belonged to three Dutch settlers: Dirck Janse Hooghland, who operated a ferryboat on the East River, and farmers Jan Hansen, and Leffert Pietersen van Haughwout. In pre-[[American Revolutionary War|revolutionary]] Kings County, Bedford was the first, major settlement east of the Village of Brooklyn on the ferry road to the town of [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] and eastern [[Long Island]]. Stuyvesant Heights, however, was farmland; the area became a community after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nFor most of its early history, Stuyvesant Heights was part of the outlying farm area of the small hamlet of Bedford, settled by the Dutch during the 17th century within the incorporated town of Breuckelen. The hamlet had its beginnings when a group of Breuckelen residents decided to improve their farm properties behind the Wallabout section, which gradually developed into an important produce center and market. The petition to form a new hamlet was approved by Governor Stuyvesant in 1663. Its leading signer was Thomas Lambertsen, a carpenter from Holland. A year later, the British capture of New Netherland signaled the end of Dutch rule. In [[Richard Nicolls|Governor Nicolls']] Charter of 1667 and in the Charter of 1686, Bedford is mentioned as a settlement within the Town of Brueckelen. Bedford hamlet had an inn as early as 1668, and, in 1670, the people of Breuckelen purchased from the [[Canarsie Indians]] an additional area for common lands in the surrounding region.\n\nBedford Corners, approximately located where the present [[Bedford Avenue]] meets [[Fulton Street (Brooklyn)|Fulton Street]], and only three blocks west of the present Historic District, was the intersection of several well traveled roads. The Brooklyn and Jamaica Turnpike, constructed by a corporation founded in 1809 and one of the oldest roads in Kings County, ran parallel to the present Fulton Street, from the East River ferry to the village of Brooklyn, thence to the hamlet of Bedford and on toward Jamaica via Bed\u2013Stuy. Farmers from New Lots and Flatbush used this road on their way to Manhattan. Within the Stuyvesant Heights Historic District, the Turnpike ran along the approximate line of Decatur Street. Cripplebush Road to Newtown and the Clove Road to Flatbush also met at Bedford Corners. Hunterfly Road, which joined the Turnpike about a mile to the east of Clove Road, also served as a route for farmers and fishermen of the Canarsie and New Lots areas.\n\nAt the time of the Revolution, Leffert's son Jakop was a leading citizen of Bedford and the town clerk of Brooklyn.  His neighbor, Lambert Suydam, was captain of the Kings County cavalry in 1776. An important part of the [[Battle of Long Island]] took place in and near the Historic District. In 1784, the people of the Town of Brooklyn held their first town meeting since 1776.\n\n====19th century{{anchor|Establishment as an urban neighborhood}}====\n[[File:MacDonoughStreetSH.jpg|thumb|287px|right|Row houses on MacDonough Street]]\nIn 1800, Bedford was designated one of the seven districts of the Town of Brooklyn, and, in 1834, it became part of the seventh and ninth wards of the newly incorporated City of Brooklyn. With the building of the [[Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad]] in 1833, along [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]], Bedford was established as a railroad station near the intersection of current Atlantic Avenue and Franklin Avenues. In 1836, the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad was taken over by the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR), which in 1878 would gain a connection to the [[BMT Brighton Line|Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway]]'s northern terminal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Early_Rapid_Transit_in_Brooklyn,_1878-1913#The_Brooklyn.2C_Flatbush_and_Coney_Island_Railroad_.28The_Brighton_Line.29.2FThe_New_York_and_Manhattan_Beach_Railroad|title=The Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railroad (The Brighton Line)/The New York and Manhattan Beach Railroad|work=nycsubway.org|accessdate=January 16, 2013}}</ref> The [[Weeksville, Brooklyn|Weeksville]] subsection, founded in 1838, was recognized as one of the first, free [[African American|African-American]] communities in the United States.<ref>Ramirez, Anthony.[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/nyregion/05weeksville.html?_r=1&oref=slogin \"Haven for Blacks in Civil War Riots Now Safeguards History\"], ''The New York Times'', June 5, 2005.

When Charles C. Betts purchased Maria Lott's tract of land the same year, this marked the end of two centuries of Dutch patrimonial holdings. Most of the streets were not opened until the 1860s, at which point Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant's streets were named after prominent figures in American history. The Dripps Map of 1869 shows that the area was still largely rural with a few freestanding houses mostly on MacDonough Street. The real development of the district began slowly at first, accelerating between 1885 and 1900, and gradually tapering off during the first two decades of the 20th century.\n\n[[File:Brooklyn brownstones in Stuyvesant Heights built between 1870-1899.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Along Stuyvesant Avenue]]\n\nConstruction of masonry row houses in the 1870s began to transform the rural district into an urban area. The first row of masonry houses in Stuyvesant Heights was built in 1872 on MacDonough Street for developer Curtis L. North. In the 1880s and 1890s, more rows were added, most of the Stuyvesant Heights north of Decatur Street looked much as it does today. Stuyvesant Heights was emerging as a neighborhood entity with its own distinctive characteristics. The houses had large rooms, high ceilings and large windows, and were built primarily by German immigrants.<ref name=\"Gregor 2014\">{{cite web |last=Gregor |first=Alison |title=Bedford-Stuyvesant: Diverse and Changing |website=The New York Times |date=July 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/realestate/bedford-stuyvesant-diverse-and-changing.html |access-date=September 18, 2018}}</ref> The people who bought these houses were generally upper-middle-class families, mostly lawyers, shopkeepers, and merchants of German and Irish descent, with a sprinkling of English people; there were also a few professionals.

Radi\u0107 was selected as a member of the [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. On 24 November 1918 he famously urged delegates attending a session that would decide the country's political future not to \"rush like [[geese]] into [[fog]]\".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} He was the lone member of the National Council's central committee to vote against sending a delegation to [[Belgrade]] to negotiate with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]].<ref name=\"Matijevic\">Zlatko Matijevi\u0107, ''Narodno vije\u0107e Slovenaca, Hrvata i Srba u Zagrebu'', Hrvatski institut za povijest.</ref> On 26 November, he was removed from the central committee.<ref name=\"Matijevic\"/>\n\nUnder pressure from the [[Great powers]] ([[British Empire]], France, United States), as well as honouring the [[Treaty of London (1915)|secret deals]] that were struck between the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was established and two representatives of Radi\u0107's party (by then named the Croatian Common-people Peasant Party) were appointed to the [[Provisional Representation]] which served as a parliament until elections for the Constituent could be held. The party's representatives, however, decided not to take their seats.\n\n===Arrest===\n\nOn 8 March 1919 the central committee passed a resolution penned by Radi\u0107 that declared \"''Croatian citizens do not recognize the so called [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] dynasty because this kingdom was proclaimed other than by the Croatian [[Sabor]] and without any mandate of the Croatian People.''\" The full statement was included in a Memorandum which was translated into French and sent abroad to be addressed to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].<ref>Zlatko Matijevi\u0107, ''Prilozi za politi\u010dku biografiju dr.

The result of the November election was 230,590 votes, which equaled to 50 seats in the parliament out of 419. On 8 December, before the first sitting of parliament, Radi\u0107 held a massive [[Demonstration (people)|rally]] in front of 100,000 people in [[Zagreb]]. Stjepan Radi\u0107 and the CCPP held an extraordinary meeting, in which a motion was put forward and voted on that the party will not be part of parliamentary discussions before matters are first resolved with Serbia on the matters of governance, the most sticking issues being the minorisation of the Croatian people and the overt powers of the King with the central government in [[Belgrade]]. The party was subsequently renamed to the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, highlighting the party's official stance. In December, [[ban of Croatia]] [[Matko Laginja]] was dismissed by the cabinet of [[Milenko Radomar Vesni\u0107]] for allowing the rally to take place.\n\n===The new Constitution===\n\nOn 12 December 1920, the Parliament of SHS had their first sitting, without the representatives of CPP (50 representatives) and the Croatian Party of Rights (2 representatives). A total of 342 representatives presented their credentials out of a total of 419.{{sfn|Dragnich|1983|p=21}} On 28 June 1921, the Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was made law after a vote of 223 representatives out of the present 285, the total number representatives in the parliament being 419. The representatives turnout and subsequent vote is quite poor considering that it was a constitutive parliament, which was supposed to have created the new constitution. The constitution was commonly known as the Vidovdan (St. Vitus Day) Constitution after the anniversary of the Serbian [[Battle of Kosovo]], also the anniversary of the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in 1914.\n\nIn the next parliamentary elections, which were held in March 1923, the stance of Stjepan Radi\u0107 and the CPP against the central government managed to turn into extra votes. The results of the election were, 70 seats or 473.733 votes, which represented the majority of the Croatian vote in Northern and Southern parts of Croatia, as well as the Croatian votes in Bosnia, as well as Herzegovina.\n\n===Again imprisoned===\n\nRadi\u0107 still held on to the idea of an [[independent (nation)|independent]] Croatia, and kept the party out of parliament in protest. This in effect afforded Serbian prime minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] the opportunity to consolidate power and strengthen his Serb-dominated government. Returning from an unsanctioned overseas trip in 1923 in which Stjepan Radi\u0107 visited England (for 5 months), [[Austria]] (5 months) and the [[Soviet Union]] (2 months). upon his return in 1924, Radi\u0107 was arrested in Zagreb and sentenced for associating with Soviet Communists and imprisoned. The trip was used for the purpose of internationalising the plight of Croatians in the Kingdom of SHS.\n\nAfter his release, Stjepan Radi\u0107 soon reentered politics, but this was not without problems. On 23 December, the Serb dominated central government declared that the political party CRPP was in contravention of the Internal security law of 1921 in the infamous [[Obznana]] declaration, and this was confirmed by King Alexander on 1 January 1924, thus arresting the CRPP executive on 2 January 1925, and finally arresting Stjepan Radi\u0107 on 5 January.\n\nAfter the parliamentary elections in February 1925, the CRPP even with its whole executive team behind bars, and with only Stjepan Radi\u0107 at its helm, CRPP managed to win 67 parliamentary seats with a total of 532,872 votes. Even though the vote count was higher than at the previous election, the [[gerrymandering]] by the central government ensured that CRPP received fewer parliamentary seats. In order to increase his negotiating power the CRPP entered into a [[coalition]] with the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic party]] (Samostalna demokratska stranka), [[Slovenian People's Party]] (Slovenska ljudska stranka) and the [[Yugoslav Muslim Organization]] (Jugoslavenska muslimanska organizacija).\n\n===Return to Parliament===\n\nImmediately after the [[1925 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] in March 1925, the CRPP changed the party name to [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (Hrvatska selja\u010dka stranka). With the backing of the coalition partners, the CPP made an agreement with the major conservative Serbian party - the [[People's Radical Party]] (Narodna radikalna stranka), in which a power-sharing arrangement was struck, as well as a deal to release the CPP executive from jail. The CPP had to make certain concessions like recognising the central government and the rule of the monarch, as well as the Vidovdan constitution in front of the full parliament on 27 March 1925. Stjepan Radi\u0107 was made the [[Minister for Education]], whereas other CPP party members obtained ministerial posts: [[Pavle Radi\u0107]], [[Nikola Niki\u0107 (politician)|Nikola Niki\u0107]], [[Benjamin \u0160uperina]], and [[Ivan Kraja\u010d]]. This powersharing arrangement was cut short after the passing away of the president of the Peoples Radical Party, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]], on 10 December 1926.\n\nRadi\u0107 soon resigned his ministerial post in 1926 and returned to the opposition, and in 1927 entered into a coalition with [[Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107]], president of the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party]], a leading party of the Serbs in Croatia.  The Peasant-Democrat coalition had a real chance to end the Radicals' long-time stranglehold control of the Parliament. Previously they had long been opponents, but the Democrats became disillusioned with the Belgrade [[bureaucracy]] and restored good relations with the Peasant Party with which they were allies in the time of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. With this arrangement, Stjepan Radi\u0107 managed to obtain a parliamentary majority in 1928. However, he was not able to form a government. The Peasant-Democrat coalition was opposed by some of the [[Croatia]]n [[elite]], like [[Ivo Andri\u0107]], who even regarded the followers of the CPP as \"''...fools following a blind dog...''\" (the blind dog being Stjepan Radi\u0107).\n\nIn his elder days, Radi\u0107 was nearly blind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hic.hr/books/myth-reality/p01.htm|title=CROATIA: MYTH AND REALITY|at=CROATIA AND THE CROATIANS|author=C.

On the morning of 20 June 1928, Radi\u0107 was warned of the danger of an assassination attempt against him and was begged to stay away from the Assembly for that day.  He replied that he was like a soldier in war, in the trenches and as such it was his duty to go but he nevertheless promised not to utter a single word.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn the [[Legislative Assembly|Assembly]], [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]], a member of [[People's Radical Party]] from [[Montenegro]], got up and made a provocative speech which produced a stormy reaction from the opposition but Radi\u0107 himself stayed completely silent.  Finally, [[Ivan Pernar (politician, born 1889)|Ivan Pernar]] shouted in response, \"''thou plundered [[bey]]s''\" (referring to accusations of corruption related to him).

He put his hand in his pocket, where he held the revolver, and faced the president Ninko Peri\u0107 and told him: \"I ask of you, Mr. president, to sanction Pernar. If you fail to stop me, I shall punish him myself!\" After that threat shouting started in the room. But Ra\u010di\u0107 continued his threats: \"Whoever tries to stand between me and Pernar will be killed!\"\nAt that moment Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107 took out his [[Luger pistol|parabellum]]. Minister [[Vuji\u010di\u0107]], sitting at the bench behind Ra\u010di\u0107, grabbed his hand in order to stop him. At the same time, minister Kujund\u017ei\u0107 came to his aid, but Ra\u010di\u0107, however, being very strong, broke himself free. At exactly 11:25 AM shots were fired - Pernar was hit 1&nbsp;cm above the heart. When he collapsed, Ra\u010di\u0107 took aim at Stjepan Radi\u0107. [[\u0110uro Basari\u010dek]] noticed this and leaped to help him. Ra\u010di\u0107, however, turned his way and shot him, bullet entering his loins and exiting around his [[scapula]]. Basari\u010dek fainted immediately. Ivan Gran\u0111a ran in front of Stjepan Radi\u0107 and Ra\u010di\u0107 shot him in the arm. As soon as he was down, Ra\u010di\u0107 aimed at Stjepan Radi\u0107, and shot him in the chest. At that point Pavle Radi\u0107 jumped towards Ra\u010di\u0107, who didn't get confused, but remarked: \"Ha! I've been looking for you!\" and shot him 1&nbsp;cm below the heart. It was believed Ra\u010di\u0107 would shoot [[Svetozar Pribi\u010devi\u0107]], sitting next to Stjepan Radi\u0107, next, but Ra\u010di\u0107 instead left the room through the ministers' chambers.

But when they mistake religion with politics, with such gentile politics of revenge, blood, arrogance and gluttony, they are not teachers, but destroyers of faith and church. (...)

Throughout his entire career, Radi\u0107 was opposed to the union and later [[Serb]] [[hegemony]] in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and became an important political figure in that country. He was shot in parliament by the Serbian [[People's Radical Party|radical]] politician [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]].

Radi\u0107 was selected as a member of the [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. On 24 November 1918 he famously urged delegates attending a session that would decide the country's political future not to \"rush like [[geese]] into [[fog]]\".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} He was the lone member of the National Council's central committee to vote against sending a delegation to [[Belgrade]] to negotiate with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]].<ref name=\"Matijevic\">Zlatko Matijevi\u0107, ''Narodno vije\u0107e Slovenaca, Hrvata i Srba u Zagrebu'', Hrvatski institut za povijest.</ref> On 26 November, he was removed from the central committee.<ref name=\"Matijevic\"/>\n\nUnder pressure from the [[Great powers]] ([[British Empire]], France, United States), as well as honouring the [[Treaty of London (1915)|secret deals]] that were struck between the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was established and two representatives of Radi\u0107's party (by then named the Croatian Common-people Peasant Party) were appointed to the [[Provisional Representation]] which served as a parliament until elections for the Constituent could be held. The party's representatives, however, decided not to take their seats.\n\n===Arrest===\n\nOn 8 March 1919 the central committee passed a resolution penned by Radi\u0107 that declared \"''Croatian citizens do not recognize the so called [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] dynasty because this kingdom was proclaimed other than by the Croatian [[Sabor]] and without any mandate of the Croatian People.''\" The full statement was included in a Memorandum which was translated into French and sent abroad to be addressed to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].<ref>Zlatko Matijevi\u0107, ''Prilozi za politi\u010dku biografiju dr.

(2006)</ref> This act provoked a decision by the government to arrest Radi\u0107 along with several other party members.{{sfn|Dragnich|1983|p=18}}\n\nHe was to be held some 11 months until February 1920,{{sfn|Janjatovi\u0107|1997|p=102}} just before the first parliamentary elections of the Kingdom of SHS to a Constitutional Assembly which were held on 28 November. The result of the November election was 230,590 votes, which equaled to 50 seats in the parliament out of 419. On 8 December, before the first sitting of parliament, Radi\u0107 held a massive [[Demonstration (people)|rally]] in front of 100,000 people in [[Zagreb]]. Stjepan Radi\u0107 and the CCPP held an extraordinary meeting, in which a motion was put forward and voted on that the party will not be part of parliamentary discussions before matters are first resolved with Serbia on the matters of governance, the most sticking issues being the minorisation of the Croatian people and the overt powers of the King with the central government in [[Belgrade]]. The party was subsequently renamed to the Croatian Republican Peasant Party, highlighting the party's official stance. In December, [[ban of Croatia]] [[Matko Laginja]] was dismissed by the cabinet of [[Milenko Radomar Vesni\u0107]] for allowing the rally to take place.\n\n===The new Constitution===\n\nOn 12 December 1920, the Parliament of SHS had their first sitting, without the representatives of CPP (50 representatives) and the Croatian Party of Rights (2 representatives). A total of 342 representatives presented their credentials out of a total of 419.{{sfn|Dragnich|1983|p=21}} On 28 June 1921, the Constitution of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was made law after a vote of 223 representatives out of the present 285, the total number representatives in the parliament being 419. The representatives turnout and subsequent vote is quite poor considering that it was a constitutive parliament, which was supposed to have created the new constitution. The constitution was commonly known as the Vidovdan (St. Vitus Day) Constitution after the anniversary of the Serbian [[Battle of Kosovo]], also the anniversary of the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in 1914.\n\nIn the next parliamentary elections, which were held in March 1923, the stance of Stjepan Radi\u0107 and the CPP against the central government managed to turn into extra votes. The results of the election were, 70 seats or 473.733 votes, which represented the majority of the Croatian vote in Northern and Southern parts of Croatia, as well as the Croatian votes in Bosnia, as well as Herzegovina.\n\n===Again imprisoned===\n\nRadi\u0107 still held on to the idea of an [[independent (nation)|independent]] Croatia, and kept the party out of parliament in protest. This in effect afforded Serbian prime minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] the opportunity to consolidate power and strengthen his Serb-dominated government. Returning from an unsanctioned overseas trip in 1923 in which Stjepan Radi\u0107 visited England (for 5 months), [[Austria]] (5 months) and the [[Soviet Union]] (2 months). upon his return in 1924, Radi\u0107 was arrested in Zagreb and sentenced for associating with Soviet Communists and imprisoned. The trip was used for the purpose of internationalising the plight of Croatians in the Kingdom of SHS.\n\nAfter his release, Stjepan Radi\u0107 soon reentered politics, but this was not without problems. On 23 December, the Serb dominated central government declared that the political party CRPP was in contravention of the Internal security law of 1921 in the infamous [[Obznana]] declaration, and this was confirmed by King Alexander on 1 January 1924, thus arresting the CRPP executive on 2 January 1925, and finally arresting Stjepan Radi\u0107 on 5 January.\n\nAfter the parliamentary elections in February 1925, the CRPP even with its whole executive team behind bars, and with only Stjepan Radi\u0107 at its helm, CRPP managed to win 67 parliamentary seats with a total of 532,872 votes. Even though the vote count was higher than at the previous election, the [[gerrymandering]] by the central government ensured that CRPP received fewer parliamentary seats. In order to increase his negotiating power the CRPP entered into a [[coalition]] with the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic party]] (Samostalna demokratska stranka), [[Slovenian People's Party]] (Slovenska ljudska stranka) and the [[Yugoslav Muslim Organization]] (Jugoslavenska muslimanska organizacija).\n\n===Return to Parliament===\n\nImmediately after the [[1925 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] in March 1925, the CRPP changed the party name to [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (Hrvatska selja\u010dka stranka). With the backing of the coalition partners, the CPP made an agreement with the major conservative Serbian party - the [[People's Radical Party]] (Narodna radikalna stranka), in which a power-sharing arrangement was struck, as well as a deal to release the CPP executive from jail. The CPP had to make certain concessions like recognising the central government and the rule of the monarch, as well as the Vidovdan constitution in front of the full parliament on 27 March 1925. Stjepan Radi\u0107 was made the [[Minister for Education]], whereas other CPP party members obtained ministerial posts: [[Pavle Radi\u0107]], [[Nikola Niki\u0107 (politician)|Nikola Niki\u0107]], [[Benjamin \u0160uperina]], and [[Ivan Kraja\u010d]]. This powersharing arrangement was cut short after the passing away of the president of the Peoples Radical Party, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]], on 10 December 1926.\n\nRadi\u0107 soon resigned his ministerial post in 1926 and returned to the opposition, and in 1927 entered into a coalition with [[Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107]], president of the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party]], a leading party of the Serbs in Croatia.  The Peasant-Democrat coalition had a real chance to end the Radicals' long-time stranglehold control of the Parliament. Previously they had long been opponents, but the Democrats became disillusioned with the Belgrade [[bureaucracy]] and restored good relations with the Peasant Party with which they were allies in the time of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. With this arrangement, Stjepan Radi\u0107 managed to obtain a parliamentary majority in 1928. However, he was not able to form a government. The Peasant-Democrat coalition was opposed by some of the [[Croatia]]n [[elite]], like [[Ivo Andri\u0107]], who even regarded the followers of the CPP as \"''...fools following a blind dog...''\" (the blind dog being Stjepan Radi\u0107).\n\nIn his elder days, Radi\u0107 was nearly blind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hic.hr/books/myth-reality/p01.htm|title=CROATIA: MYTH AND REALITY|at=CROATIA AND THE CROATIANS|author=C.

On the morning of 20 June 1928, Radi\u0107 was warned of the danger of an assassination attempt against him and was begged to stay away from the Assembly for that day.  He replied that he was like a soldier in war, in the trenches and as such it was his duty to go but he nevertheless promised not to utter a single word.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn the [[Legislative Assembly|Assembly]], [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]], a member of [[People's Radical Party]] from [[Montenegro]], got up and made a provocative speech which produced a stormy reaction from the opposition but Radi\u0107 himself stayed completely silent.  Finally, [[Ivan Pernar (politician, born 1889)|Ivan Pernar]] shouted in response, \"''thou plundered [[bey]]s''\" (referring to accusations of corruption related to him). In an earlier speech Radi\u0107 accused Ra\u010di\u0107 of stealing from civilian population and later refused to apolagize when Ra\u010di\u0107 asked him to.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=John Paul|date=2017|title=War Veterans, Fascism, and Para-Fascist Departures in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, 1918\u20131941|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318166421_War_Veterans_Fascism_and_Para-Fascist_Departures_in_the_Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_1918-1941|journal=FASCISM|volume=6|pages=63|via=}}</ref> Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107 made his way to the speaker podium facing the Croats. He put his hand in his pocket, where he held the revolver, and faced the president Ninko Peri\u0107 and told him: \"I ask of you, Mr. president, to sanction Pernar. If you fail to stop me, I shall punish him myself!\" After that threat shouting started in the room. But Ra\u010di\u0107 continued his threats: \"Whoever tries to stand between me and Pernar will be killed!\"\nAt that moment Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107 took out his [[Luger pistol|parabellum]]. Minister [[Vuji\u010di\u0107]], sitting at the bench behind Ra\u010di\u0107, grabbed his hand in order to stop him. At the same time, minister Kujund\u017ei\u0107 came to his aid, but Ra\u010di\u0107, however, being very strong, broke himself free. At exactly 11:25 AM shots were fired - Pernar was hit 1&nbsp;cm above the heart. When he collapsed, Ra\u010di\u0107 took aim at Stjepan Radi\u0107. [[\u0110uro Basari\u010dek]] noticed this and leaped to help him. Ra\u010di\u0107, however, turned his way and shot him, bullet entering his loins and exiting around his [[scapula]]. Basari\u010dek fainted immediately. Ivan Gran\u0111a ran in front of Stjepan Radi\u0107 and Ra\u010di\u0107 shot him in the arm. As soon as he was down, Ra\u010di\u0107 aimed at Stjepan Radi\u0107, and shot him in the chest. At that point Pavle Radi\u0107 jumped towards Ra\u010di\u0107, who didn't get confused, but remarked: \"Ha! I've been looking for you!\" and shot him 1&nbsp;cm below the heart. It was believed Ra\u010di\u0107 would shoot [[Svetozar Pribi\u010devi\u0107]], sitting next to Stjepan Radi\u0107, next, but Ra\u010di\u0107 instead left the room through the ministers' chambers.

He led a normal life during the Nazi occupation of Serbia and was captured and killed by Communist partisans in 1945 or 1946.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nFollowing the political crisis triggered by the shooting, in January 1929, King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Aleksandar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] abolished the constitution, dissolved the parliament, banned all ethnic, regional and religious political parties, and declared a [[6 January Dictatorship|royal dictatorship]].<ref name=\"Goldstein\"/>\n\nRadi\u0107 is buried in the [[Mirogoj]] cemetery in Zagreb.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x49sCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA131 | title=Croatia | publisher=Bradt Travel Guides | year=2016 | isbn=9781784770082 | page=131 | accessdate=17 April 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\nRadi\u0107's violent death turned him into a martyr and an icon of political struggle for the peasantry and the working class, as well as an icon of Croatian patriots. The iconography of Stjepan Radi\u0107 was later used not only by his successor [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]], but also by other political options in Croatia: right wing or left wing.\n\nThe [[Usta\u0161e]] used the death of Stjepan Radi\u0107 as proof of Serbian hegemony, and as an excuse for their treatment of Serbs.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} However, a number of leading CPP figures who became political opponents of the Ustashe were imprisoned or killed by the regime. The [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] on the other hand used this as a recruiting point with CPP members who were disillusioned with the [[Independent State of Croatia]], and latter had one brigade named after Antun and Stjepan Radi\u0107 in 1943.\n\nThe image of Stjepan Radi\u0107 was used extensively during the [[Croatian Spring]] movement in the early 1970s. There are many folk groups, clubs, primary and secondary schools which bear the name of Stjepan Radi\u0107. Many Croatian cities have streets and squares in his name. In 2008, a total of 265 streets in Croatia were named after him, making Radi\u0107 the third most common person eponym of streets in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.croatia.org/crown/articles/9663/1/Dr-Slaven-Letica-If-Streets-Could-Talk-Kad-bi-ulice-imale-dar-govora.html | title = If Streets Could Talk.

In a 1924 rally in [[Kra\u0161i\u0107]], birthplace of the late Cardinal [[Aloysius Stepinac]], he stated: \"Priests or bishops are teachers of the faith and as such we are listening to them in church, and even outside the church. But when they mistake religion with politics, with such gentile politics of revenge, blood, arrogance and gluttony, they are not teachers, but destroyers of faith and church. (...) When our bishops write a political letter, and when they want to be political leaders to the Croatian people, then it is my and our duty to decipher it and if necessary, condemn it.\" In an interview for Nova revija in 1926 he stated that \"clericalism means abuse of the most sacred feelings of religion in order to destroy the family, to demolish people in order to gain political power.\"<ref>Nova revija, no. 1, p. 67-68</ref> He would often repeat the slogan: Believe in God, but not in the priest. He supported the establishment of the Indigenous Croatian Catholic Church, and its separation from the Vatican.

On Championship Sunday OpTic beat a young team called Stunner Gaming 3\u20131 in the grand finals.\n\nOpTic was one of twelve teams to qualify for Pro League Season 1, the others being Prophecy, FaZe, Justus, Aware, Automatic Reload, EnVyUs, Denial, eLevate, Rise Nation, Team KaLiBeR and OpTic Nation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pro League Season 1 Stats|url=http://stats.optic.tv/stats.html?id=19|website=optic.tv}}</ref> The Pro League ran from December 8 through February 28. OpTic Gaming went 38\u20136 in the MLG Season 1 ''[[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]]'' and qualified with the number one seed for the playoffs which they completed at with a $75,000 prize pool. OpTic Gaming went into the event led by NaDeSHoT and hoped to become the first team to win a [[LAN]] tournament without dropping a map. After defeating Rise Nation 3-0, they faced off against a team of younger players in Aware Gaming, who they defeated losing only one map. However, this ruined the team's goal of being the first team to win a LAN tournament with a perfect map-win record. Following a narrow 3-2 victory over Team Kaliber in the winners bracket final, OpTic defeated Denial eSports 3-0 to win their second event in a row.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pro League Season 1 Champions|url=http://www.redbull.com/us/en/esports/stories/1331707370652/optic-gaming-wins-mlg-pro-league-season-1-championship}}</ref> This was OpTic's first win of an MLG event since winning previously at X Games during the ''[[Call of Duty: Ghosts]]'' season.\n\nAt the Call of Duty Championships on March 27\u201329, OpTic officially announced their long-awaited sponsorship with [[Red Bull]], following members Matt \"NaDeSHoT\" Haag and Michael \"FlameSword\" Chavez who had been individually sponsored.

The team would not disappoint winning and having the first shot at an international tournament [[ELEAGUE]] Season 1 later in the year. After the team lost to [[Splyce]] in [[MLG Major Championship: Columbus|MLG]] Columbus Minor and then failed to beat [[Winterfox]] in [[MLG Major Championship: Columbus|MLG Columbus]] last Chance Minor a roster move was inevitable. OpTic brought in Oscar \"mixwell\" Ca\u00f1ellas from gBots eSports Club. The Spanish FPL star replaced ShahZaM. The teams first [[ESL Pro League]] season under the OpTic banner was a success, making the Season 3 Finals and narrowly missing out on making the Playoffs losing narrowly to the eventual champions, [[Luminosity Gaming]]. Finally OpTic's group at [[ELEAGUE]] Season 1 would materialise. The team won only a third of that which they played being knocked out in 15th-16th. The team's disappointing [[ELEAGUE]] event was not to be a norm for the roster. With the [[ESL Cologne 2016|Cologne Major]] looming and OpTic attending the minor, a loss here could be catastrophic. Luckily OpTic won the American Minor making their way to the offline qualifier for the German held major.\n\nThe Americans and their lone Spaniard managed to make the major by beating FLuffy Gangsters, [[FlipSid3 Tactics]] and [[HellRaisers]] during their run at [[ESL One Cologne 2016|The Cologne]] Offline qualifier. Their major run was short with the team coming dead last managing only 4 rounds against [[Ninjas in Pyjamas|NiP]]. A series of poor results where the team struggled against even their American rivals. Fractures began to emerge, stanislaw was the first to be released but was quickly brought back in replace of daps. Tarik \"tarik\" Celik was brought in for their replacement from [[Counter Logic Gaming]]. The team made Season 4 Finals but managed a 5th-6th losing again to the eventual champions, [[Cloud9]]. The result seemed to light a spark in the OpTic boys as their next event Northern Arena Montreal was a success. The team came second in their group making the playoffs and were tasked with taking on the [[Denmark|Danish]] roster of Heroic. They beat them in a hard-fought series taking it 2-1. In the final they were faced [[G2 Esports|G2]]. Another long battle would break out with [[G2 Esports|G2]] taking the first. OpTic would fight back and win Northern Arena Montreal. The team's next tournament would be [[DreamHack Winter 2017|Dreamhack Winter]] where they would lose to their American counterparts [[Cloud9]] and finish in last place. [[ELEAGUE Season 2]] which they qualified for a few months earlier was the next international tournament. After the dismal performance in Sweden the team needed to bounce back on home soil down in Atlanta and rectify their results. A group with [[Sweden|Swedish]] powerhouse [[Fnatic]] and [[EnVyUs]] seemed like a tough task for the boys in Green. This would not be the case as they managed to get out of their group with [[Dignitas (esports)|Dignitas]]. Their playoff's run was smooth beating Nikola \"NiKo\" Kova\u010d's [[mousesports]] 2-0 and then defeating [[FaZe Clan]] decisively. The final was against [[Astralis]] whose recent resurgence was frightening, this was for all teams except OpTic. In a hard-fought slog OpTic managed to beat the Danes in 3 including on their home map Overpass. With $400,000 in the bank and a huge tournament win in the bag the team laid eyes on ECS Season 2 Finals. Again OpTic managed to come out of a remarkably hard group along with [[Astralis]] who were the only team to beat OpTic. Their semifinal against the Boys in Blue was quick with a succinct 2-0 victory. A grand final rematch was to be had at ECS Season 2 Finals as OpTic were to be taking on the team they beat only a week ago at ELEAGUE. Astralis dominated the Americans in two maps showing who really is the boss of Overpass taking it 16-6. OpTic made the ELEAGUE 2017 Major but again lost in the groups. stanislaw left for [[Team Liquid]] soon after. OpTic saw constant replacements from here on out with Spencer \"Hiko\" Martin, Ryan \"fREAKAZOiD\" Abadir, Jason \"jasonR\" Ruchelski and James \"hazed\" Cobb all doing their part for the roster. Luis \"peacemaker\" Tadeu and hazed both tried out as coaches for the team though neither of them stayed in the team or in the role long term. It was to no avail as the team only managed to win the online tournament of [[CyberPowerPC]] Extreme Gaming Series in Spring 2017. In July 2017, Chet \"ImAPet\" Singh joined as a coach but in August 2017, RUSH and tarik left for [[Cloud9]], hazed was then released leaving only NAF and mixwell. The [[North American]] line up had run its course and a new line up needed to be curated.\n\n=== Second roster (August 2017 \u2013 February 2018) ===\nWith NAF being placed on the transfer list, where he would later join [[Renegades (esports)|Renegades]], H3CZ decided to create a European line up. Headlining this would be mixwell and former [[Ninjas in Pyjamas|NiP]] veteran, Adam \u201c[[friberg]]\u201d Friberg acting as in-game leader. The roster brought in ex-[[FaZe Clan|FaZe]] AWPer Aleksi \"allu\" Jalli, ex-North rifler Emil \"Magisk\" Reif and PENTA Sports young up and comer Kevin \"HS\" Tarn. At the online event [[CyberPowerPC]] Extreme Gaming Series Fall 2017 they managed only a 3rd-4th place. Their online league results were promising but did not lead to LAN success. The European Boston Minor was their first LAN Event but they failed to make it to the [[ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018]], coming 3rd in the Minor. The team managed to win the [[North American]] Qualifier for IEM Oakland but came 5th- 6th in the main event, losing 2-0 to [[SK Gaming]]. Due to impressive online results they showed up to Pro league Finals coming 5th-6th the same result at ECS Season 4 finals. These unsuccessful results lead to the dropping of the roster.\n\n=== Third roster (February 2018 \u2013 October 2019) ===\nOn February 7, 2018 OpTic announced a new [[Denmark|Danish]]/[[North American]] roster that saw the return of [[ShahZaM]] and stanislaw, joined by former North duo Kristian \"k0nfig\" Wienecke and Ren\u00e9 \"cajunb\" Borg. Rounding out the roster was Nicklas \"gade\" Gade, on loan from North Academy. ImAPet remained as the teams coach. The team failed to make any LAN appearances and had average online results leading to the roster going full Danish some two months after the roster was formed. [[ShahZaM]], stanislaw and ImAPet were released from their contracts. OpTic acquired Marco \"[[Snappi]]\" Pfeiffer and Jakob \"JUGi\" Hansen from Heroic and picked up ex-North coach Casper \"ruggah\" Due. For the first time, OpTic would have a single nationality lineup all consisting of [[Danes]]. In the following months the team struggled achieving no notable placings other than a second place at [[DreamHack Summer|Dreamhack Summer]] where they lost to EspiranTo and The Imperial in the final. When the [[Faceit]] Minor came along, OpTic were favorites to make the [[FACEIT Major: London 2018|FACEIT Major]]. After a quick 2-0 in groups knocking over 3DMAX and ENCE respectively the team made it to the play-offs. Their first match-up was against [[Ninjas in Pyjamas]] who they bowled over in 3 maps including a 16-3 Victory on Inferno. They played ENCE in the next round where again they beat with a quick 2-1 Victory making the final of the minor qualifier and making the New challenger stage at the Major. The minor was not done as the Danish boys faced off against the Swedes again. They could not replicate their previous match as the Ninja's took them down 2-0. A successful run lead them to the major but the elusive first LAN win again did not become reality. On October 11, 2019, k0nfig announced the disbanding of the team, marking an apparent end to OpTic CS:GO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dexerto.com/csgo/optic-csgo-roster-disbands-1126839|title=OpTic CSGO roster completely disbands amid organizational confusion|website=Dexerto.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==== Former roster ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Nationality\n!Alias\n!Name\n!Role\n!Join date\n!New Team\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|k0nfig\n|Kristian Wienecke\n|Rifler\n|2018-02-07\n|[[Complexity Gaming]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|MSL\n|Mathias Sommer Lauridsen\n|AWPer/IGL\n|2019-03-28\n|[[NORTH (eSports team)|NORTH]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|niko\n|Nicolaj Kristensen\n|Rifler (Entry Fragger)\n|2019-03-28\n|\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|TeSeS\n|Ren\u00e9 Madsen\n|AWPer/IGL\n|2019-06-??\n|[[Copenhagen Flames]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|cajunb\n|Ren\u00e9 Borg\n|Rifler (Entry Fragger)\n|2019-08-10\n|[[Heroic (esports)|Heroic]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|ruggah\n|Casper Due\n|Coach\n|2018-04-24\n|[[OG (esports)|OG]]\n|}\n\n=== Notable achievements ===\n* 1st \u2014 Dreamhack Open Summer\n* 1st \u2014 [[ELEAGUE Season 2]]\n* 2nd \u2014 Esports Championship Series Season 2 - Finals\n* 2nd \u2014 cs_summit 3\n* 1st \u2014 Northern Arena 2016 - Montreal\n\n=== Major history ===\nMajors are tournaments sponsored by Valve and involve a prize pool of at least US$1,000,000.\n* 17th\u201319th - FACEIT Major: London 2018\n* 12th\u201314th - ELEAGUE Major: Atlanta 2017\n* 13th\u201316th - ESL One: Cologne 2016\n\n== ''League of Legends'' ==\n\nFrom the 2020 [[League of Legends Championship Series|LCS]] season, the OpTic Gaming League of Legends roster will be transferred to [[Immortals (esports)|Immortals]].\n\n=== Former roster ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

OpTic Gaming started the tournament strong, making their way to the finals without losing. The team then lost the first series in the final. However, because they were the winners of the 'winners final' the match went into a final and decisive series, in which they were able to win 3\u20132 and become the first ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops II]]'' champions.\n\nThe next tournament was MLG Dallas. Here, the top 8 teams qualified to compete at that year's ''Call of Duty'' Championships, which was an annual $1,000,000 event.

OpTic Gaming disappointed at both of their first two events which were to be MLG Columbus (13\u201316th place) and UMG Philadelphia (9\u201312th place) before a roster change occurred with one player retiring, two leaving and one later rejoining. During this time Haag teamed with Christopher Duarte, who goes by the name of 'Parasite'. At this time, the team consisted of 'NaDeSHoT', 'Clayster', 'Ricky' and 'Parasite'. However, after only a handful of days, 'Parasite' and 'Ricky' left OpTic to join Curse Las Vegas. OpTic then picked up 'Saints' and 'MBoZe', before 'Scumpii' rejoined OpTic to replace the departing 'Saints', who returned to Strictly Business.

OpTic Gaming later announced they were hosting the winners of the US Regional finals, Strictly Business Gaming for a pre-LAN event for the World Championships.\n\nAt the ''Call of Duty'' World Championships, OpTic were placed in a group with Epsilon eSports, NSP, and SSOF. Controversy was caused when 'SSOF' were disqualified and OpTic only had two teams in their group. OpTic first played 'NSP' and beat them 3-0 leading to a group decider against Epsilon where OpTiC Gaming lost 3\u20130. However they advanced as the second seed and faced tK in the first round of the winners bracket. OpTic had a 3-0 victory against a team considered to be a top three team by many. In the second round OpTic was to come up against Strictly Business Gaming who they had hosted in a pre-LAN event, however, they won 3\u20132 and played Australian team Trident T1 Dotters for a guaranteed top three finish. OpTic Gaming won the series 3\u20131 and guaranteed themselves 3rd and $120,000. OpTic were then to face [[CompLexity]] who were undefeated on ''[[Call of Duty: Ghosts]]'' and came up short in the winners bracket finals losing 3-2.

The team would not disappoint winning and having the first shot at an international tournament [[ELEAGUE]] Season 1 later in the year. After the team lost to [[Splyce]] in [[MLG Major Championship: Columbus|MLG]] Columbus Minor and then failed to beat [[Winterfox]] in [[MLG Major Championship: Columbus|MLG Columbus]] last Chance Minor a roster move was inevitable. OpTic brought in Oscar \"mixwell\" Ca\u00f1ellas from gBots eSports Club. The Spanish FPL star replaced ShahZaM. The teams first [[ESL Pro League]] season under the OpTic banner was a success, making the Season 3 Finals and narrowly missing out on making the Playoffs losing narrowly to the eventual champions, [[Luminosity Gaming]]. Finally OpTic's group at [[ELEAGUE]] Season 1 would materialise. The team won only a third of that which they played being knocked out in 15th-16th. The team's disappointing [[ELEAGUE]] event was not to be a norm for the roster. With the [[ESL Cologne 2016|Cologne Major]] looming and OpTic attending the minor, a loss here could be catastrophic. Luckily OpTic won the American Minor making their way to the offline qualifier for the German held major.\n\nThe Americans and their lone Spaniard managed to make the major by beating FLuffy Gangsters, [[FlipSid3 Tactics]] and [[HellRaisers]] during their run at [[ESL One Cologne 2016|The Cologne]] Offline qualifier. Their major run was short with the team coming dead last managing only 4 rounds against [[Ninjas in Pyjamas|NiP]]. A series of poor results where the team struggled against even their American rivals. Fractures began to emerge, stanislaw was the first to be released but was quickly brought back in replace of daps. Tarik \"tarik\" Celik was brought in for their replacement from [[Counter Logic Gaming]]. The team made Season 4 Finals but managed a 5th-6th losing again to the eventual champions, [[Cloud9]]. The result seemed to light a spark in the OpTic boys as their next event Northern Arena Montreal was a success. The team came second in their group making the playoffs and were tasked with taking on the [[Denmark|Danish]] roster of Heroic. They beat them in a hard-fought series taking it 2-1. In the final they were faced [[G2 Esports|G2]]. Another long battle would break out with [[G2 Esports|G2]] taking the first. OpTic would fight back and win Northern Arena Montreal. The team's next tournament would be [[DreamHack Winter 2017|Dreamhack Winter]] where they would lose to their American counterparts [[Cloud9]] and finish in last place. [[ELEAGUE Season 2]] which they qualified for a few months earlier was the next international tournament. After the dismal performance in Sweden the team needed to bounce back on home soil down in Atlanta and rectify their results. A group with [[Sweden|Swedish]] powerhouse [[Fnatic]] and [[EnVyUs]] seemed like a tough task for the boys in Green. This would not be the case as they managed to get out of their group with [[Dignitas (esports)|Dignitas]]. Their playoff's run was smooth beating Nikola \"NiKo\" Kova\u010d's [[mousesports]] 2-0 and then defeating [[FaZe Clan]] decisively. The final was against [[Astralis]] whose recent resurgence was frightening, this was for all teams except OpTic. In a hard-fought slog OpTic managed to beat the Danes in 3 including on their home map Overpass. With $400,000 in the bank and a huge tournament win in the bag the team laid eyes on ECS Season 2 Finals. Again OpTic managed to come out of a remarkably hard group along with [[Astralis]] who were the only team to beat OpTic. Their semifinal against the Boys in Blue was quick with a succinct 2-0 victory. A grand final rematch was to be had at ECS Season 2 Finals as OpTic were to be taking on the team they beat only a week ago at ELEAGUE. Astralis dominated the Americans in two maps showing who really is the boss of Overpass taking it 16-6. OpTic made the ELEAGUE 2017 Major but again lost in the groups. stanislaw left for [[Team Liquid]] soon after. OpTic saw constant replacements from here on out with Spencer \"Hiko\" Martin, Ryan \"fREAKAZOiD\" Abadir, Jason \"jasonR\" Ruchelski and James \"hazed\" Cobb all doing their part for the roster. Luis \"peacemaker\" Tadeu and hazed both tried out as coaches for the team though neither of them stayed in the team or in the role long term. It was to no avail as the team only managed to win the online tournament of [[CyberPowerPC]] Extreme Gaming Series in Spring 2017. In July 2017, Chet \"ImAPet\" Singh joined as a coach but in August 2017, RUSH and tarik left for [[Cloud9]], hazed was then released leaving only NAF and mixwell. The [[North American]] line up had run its course and a new line up needed to be curated.\n\n=== Second roster (August 2017 \u2013 February 2018) ===\nWith NAF being placed on the transfer list, where he would later join [[Renegades (esports)|Renegades]], H3CZ decided to create a European line up. Headlining this would be mixwell and former [[Ninjas in Pyjamas|NiP]] veteran, Adam \u201c[[friberg]]\u201d Friberg acting as in-game leader. The roster brought in ex-[[FaZe Clan|FaZe]] AWPer Aleksi \"allu\" Jalli, ex-North rifler Emil \"Magisk\" Reif and PENTA Sports young up and comer Kevin \"HS\" Tarn. At the online event [[CyberPowerPC]] Extreme Gaming Series Fall 2017 they managed only a 3rd-4th place. Their online league results were promising but did not lead to LAN success. The European Boston Minor was their first LAN Event but they failed to make it to the [[ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018]], coming 3rd in the Minor. The team managed to win the [[North American]] Qualifier for IEM Oakland but came 5th- 6th in the main event, losing 2-0 to [[SK Gaming]]. Due to impressive online results they showed up to Pro league Finals coming 5th-6th the same result at ECS Season 4 finals. These unsuccessful results lead to the dropping of the roster.\n\n=== Third roster (February 2018 \u2013 October 2019) ===\nOn February 7, 2018 OpTic announced a new [[Denmark|Danish]]/[[North American]] roster that saw the return of [[ShahZaM]] and stanislaw, joined by former North duo Kristian \"k0nfig\" Wienecke and Ren\u00e9 \"cajunb\" Borg. Rounding out the roster was Nicklas \"gade\" Gade, on loan from North Academy. ImAPet remained as the teams coach. The team failed to make any LAN appearances and had average online results leading to the roster going full Danish some two months after the roster was formed. [[ShahZaM]], stanislaw and ImAPet were released from their contracts. OpTic acquired Marco \"[[Snappi]]\" Pfeiffer and Jakob \"JUGi\" Hansen from Heroic and picked up ex-North coach Casper \"ruggah\" Due. For the first time, OpTic would have a single nationality lineup all consisting of [[Danes]]. In the following months the team struggled achieving no notable placings other than a second place at [[DreamHack Summer|Dreamhack Summer]] where they lost to EspiranTo and The Imperial in the final. When the [[Faceit]] Minor came along, OpTic were favorites to make the [[FACEIT Major: London 2018|FACEIT Major]]. After a quick 2-0 in groups knocking over 3DMAX and ENCE respectively the team made it to the play-offs. Their first match-up was against [[Ninjas in Pyjamas]] who they bowled over in 3 maps including a 16-3 Victory on Inferno. They played ENCE in the next round where again they beat with a quick 2-1 Victory making the final of the minor qualifier and making the New challenger stage at the Major. The minor was not done as the Danish boys faced off against the Swedes again. They could not replicate their previous match as the Ninja's took them down 2-0. A successful run lead them to the major but the elusive first LAN win again did not become reality. On October 11, 2019, k0nfig announced the disbanding of the team, marking an apparent end to OpTic CS:GO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dexerto.com/csgo/optic-csgo-roster-disbands-1126839|title=OpTic CSGO roster completely disbands amid organizational confusion|website=Dexerto.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==== Former roster ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Nationality\n!Alias\n!Name\n!Role\n!Join date\n!New Team\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|k0nfig\n|Kristian Wienecke\n|Rifler\n|2018-02-07\n|[[Complexity Gaming]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|MSL\n|Mathias Sommer Lauridsen\n|AWPer/IGL\n|2019-03-28\n|[[NORTH (eSports team)|NORTH]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|niko\n|Nicolaj Kristensen\n|Rifler (Entry Fragger)\n|2019-03-28\n|\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|TeSeS\n|Ren\u00e9 Madsen\n|AWPer/IGL\n|2019-06-??\n|[[Copenhagen Flames]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|cajunb\n|Ren\u00e9 Borg\n|Rifler (Entry Fragger)\n|2019-08-10\n|[[Heroic (esports)|Heroic]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}}\n|ruggah\n|Casper Due\n|Coach\n|2018-04-24\n|[[OG (esports)|OG]]\n|}\n\n=== Notable achievements ===\n* 1st \u2014 Dreamhack Open Summer\n* 1st \u2014 [[ELEAGUE Season 2]]\n* 2nd \u2014 Esports Championship Series Season 2 - Finals\n* 2nd \u2014 cs_summit 3\n* 1st \u2014 Northern Arena 2016 - Montreal\n\n=== Major history ===\nMajors are tournaments sponsored by Valve and involve a prize pool of at least US$1,000,000.\n* 17th\u201319th - FACEIT Major: London 2018\n* 12th\u201314th - ELEAGUE Major: Atlanta 2017\n* 13th\u201316th - ESL One: Cologne 2016\n\n== ''League of Legends'' ==\n\nFrom the 2020 [[League of Legends Championship Series|LCS]] season, the OpTic Gaming League of Legends roster will be transferred to [[Immortals (esports)|Immortals]].\n\n=== Former roster ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Smith briefly experimented with a project called [[ASAP (band)|ASAP]] (Adrian Smith and Project) before seemingly retiring from the [[music industry]] altogether in 1990. However, it was a chance meeting with [[Jamie Stewart (The Cult)|Jamie Stewart]], formerly bass guitarist with [[The Cult]] and Carl Dufresne that finally persuaded Smith back into the spotlight. \n<blockquote>\n{{cquote|We became friends, and decided to form a little band called The Untouchables, just for fun. He didn't want to get back in the music business full time, and neither did I - to be honest I'd had enough of it. We started off playing just little clubs for fun and it snowballed from there. We played everywhere around Britain. But the one thing that I didn't want to do was to find myself committed to recording and touring, just like the old days.}}\n</blockquote>\n''Quote from Adrian Smith, as quoted from the State of Mind cover.''\n\nHowever, Stewart soon quit the project and was replaced by bassist Gary Leideman. In 1993, The Untouchables (featuring Smith on vocals, Carl Dufresne, Gary Leideman and Fabio DelRio). Dufresne and DelRio soon left the band and Smith decided to extend the line-up by bringing in singer [[:nb:Hans-Olav_Solli|Solli]], a Norwegian who had been working with [[Thin Lizzy]] guitarist [[Scott Gorham]] in [[21 Guns (band)|21 Guns]]. A demo impressed enough for the band to land a recording deal. They changed their name to Psycho Motel and debuted with the album ''[[State of Mind (Psycho Motel album)|State of Mind]]'' in 1995, followed by ''[[Welcome to the World]]'' in 1997.\n\nAs far as Smith was concerned, the two records were distinct from each other:\n<blockquote>\n{{cquote|They're quite different, because there are different singers on them. The first album we had a Norwegian guy called Solli who used to be with a band named 21 Guns. We did tour in Europe but he couldn't continue with us, because he had some personal stuff to take care of. He got divorced plus he lived in Norway, which is kind of difficult. So we had to find another singer. Then I found Andy, a young guy, 26 years old and we did the second album with him. He brought a more modern influence to the band. I was sort of doing a retro thing with my [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] and [[Led Zeppelin|Zeppelin]] influences. On the first album with Solli, there was a more of a [[Robert Plant]] type vocal. The second album is more modern, because Andy was into [[Alice in Chains]] and [[Soundgarden]] so it made for a great blend. I really like the second album, although I've played the first album a couple of times and realized it's just as good.}}\n</blockquote>\n''Quote from Adrian Smith, as quoted from the Welcome to the World album cover.''\n\nAfter the release of ''Welcome To The World'', Smith went to help on two albums and two tours with [[Bruce Dickinson]]. After this, they both re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, and Psycho Motel split up. When asked if he would consider re-forming the band in 2001, he said that they had \"no plans at the moment\" but they would \"possibly do some stuff next year\".

Smith briefly experimented with a project called [[ASAP (band)|ASAP]] (Adrian Smith and Project) before seemingly retiring from the [[music industry]] altogether in 1990. However, it was a chance meeting with [[Jamie Stewart (The Cult)|Jamie Stewart]], formerly bass guitarist with [[The Cult]] and Carl Dufresne that finally persuaded Smith back into the spotlight. \n<blockquote>\n{{cquote|We became friends, and decided to form a little band called The Untouchables, just for fun. He didn't want to get back in the music business full time, and neither did I - to be honest I'd had enough of it. We started off playing just little clubs for fun and it snowballed from there. We played everywhere around Britain. But the one thing that I didn't want to do was to find myself committed to recording and touring, just like the old days.}}\n</blockquote>\n''Quote from Adrian Smith, as quoted from the State of Mind cover.''\n\nHowever, Stewart soon quit the project and was replaced by bassist Gary Leideman. In 1993, The Untouchables (featuring Smith on vocals, Carl Dufresne, Gary Leideman and Fabio DelRio). Dufresne and DelRio soon left the band and Smith decided to extend the line-up by bringing in singer [[:nb:Hans-Olav_Solli|Solli]], a Norwegian who had been working with [[Thin Lizzy]] guitarist [[Scott Gorham]] in [[21 Guns (band)|21 Guns]]. A demo impressed enough for the band to land a recording deal. They changed their name to Psycho Motel and debuted with the album ''[[State of Mind (Psycho Motel album)|State of Mind]]'' in 1995, followed by ''[[Welcome to the World]]'' in 1997.\n\nAs far as Smith was concerned, the two records were distinct from each other:\n<blockquote>\n{{cquote|They're quite different, because there are different singers on them. The first album we had a Norwegian guy called Solli who used to be with a band named 21 Guns. We did tour in Europe but he couldn't continue with us, because he had some personal stuff to take care of. He got divorced plus he lived in Norway, which is kind of difficult. So we had to find another singer. Then I found Andy, a young guy, 26 years old and we did the second album with him. He brought a more modern influence to the band. I was sort of doing a retro thing with my [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] and [[Led Zeppelin|Zeppelin]] influences. On the first album with Solli, there was a more of a [[Robert Plant]] type vocal. The second album is more modern, because Andy was into [[Alice in Chains]] and [[Soundgarden]] so it made for a great blend. I really like the second album, although I've played the first album a couple of times and realized it's just as good.}}\n</blockquote>\n''Quote from Adrian Smith, as quoted from the Welcome to the World album cover.''\n\nAfter the release of ''Welcome To The World'', Smith went to help on two albums and two tours with [[Bruce Dickinson]]. After this, they both re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, and Psycho Motel split up. When asked if he would consider re-forming the band in 2001, he said that they had \"no plans at the moment\" but they would \"possibly do some stuff next year\". This has yet to happen with his continued success with Iron Maiden.\n\nIn 2006, both albums were re-released, ''Welcome to the World'' was released with two bonus tracks, \"Wait\" and \"Just Like A Woman\".\n\n==Last line-up==\n*Andy Makin - Vocals\n*[[Adrian Smith]] - Guitars, backing vocals\n*[[Gary Leideman]] - Bass\n*[[Mike Sturgis]] - Drums\n\n==Former members==\n*[[:nb:Hans-Olav_Solli|(Hans Olav) Solli]] - Vocals (State of Mind)\n*[[Jamie Stewart (bassist)|Jamie Stewart]] - Bass in The Untouchables\n*Carl Dufresne- Guitars, Keys, vocals in The Untouchables\n*Huwey Lucas - Guitars in The Untouchables\n*Bob Richards - Drums in The Untouchables\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n*''[[State of Mind (Psycho Motel album)|State of Mind]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Welcome to the World]]'' (1997)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:English rock music groups]]\n", "name_user": "Psychomotelfan81", "label": "safe", "comment": "added info.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_Motel"}
