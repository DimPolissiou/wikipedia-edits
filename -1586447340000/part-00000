The narrator, Teddy, also speaks of how \"The Ancient Mariner was sent an albatross ... [[Noah]] was sent a dove\", while he himself was sent a crow.\n* In [[Anne Rice]]'s novel ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'', Louis de Pointe du Lac quoted these lines when referring to Claudia: \"Her lips were red, her looks were free, Her locks were yellow as gold: Her skin was as white as leprosy, The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she, Who thicks man's blood with cold\".''\n* In [[James M. Cain]]'s crime novel ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', Phyllis is described as the creature who came on board ship to shoot dice in ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.''\n* The poem features prominently in the plot of [[Douglas Adams]]'s novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]''. In the novel, the title character time travels to interrupt Coleridge's work on his poem \"Kubla Khan\"; during his rambling dialogue, intended to disrupt Coleridge from unintentionally encoding information from a ghost which could lead to the destruction of the human race, Dirk Gently's references to \"Albert Ross\", another character from the novel, are misheard by Coleridge as \"albatross,\" which he says might have given him an idea for another poem he is working on, which he considers superior to a previous idea involving a meteor striking the Earth.\n* [[Gene Wolfe]]'s science fiction novella, ''[[The Fifth Head of Cerberus]]'', uses as its motto the lines: \"When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow, / And the owlet whoops to the wolf below, / That eats the she-wolf's young\".\n* In [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', chapter 5, [[Victor Frankenstein]] quotes the lines: \"Like one, that on a lonesome road / Doth walk in fear and dread / And, having once turned round, walks on / And turns no more his head / Because he knows a frightful fiend / Doth close behind him tread\" (Penguin Popular Classic 1968 page 57, cited from ''Rime'', 1817 edition). In the book's opening letters from Robert Walton to his sister, specifically Letter II, Walton explicitly mentions the poem by name and claims he \"shall kill no albatross\" on his journey.\n* In [[Clive Cussler]]'s novel ''[[Iceberg (Cussler novel)|Iceberg]]'', several references are made to the poem and it is quoted several times. The villain's company logo is the albatross. In another novel ''The Silent Sea'', four lines from the poem are written on the page before the prologue.\n* In [[Garth Nix]]'s ''[[The Keys to the Kingdom|Keys to the Kingdom]]'' series, the Mariner is an ancient and powerful being. He claims his real name is Captain Tom Shelvocke, and he mentions accidentally shooting an albatross.\n* In ''Lights Out'' by [[Peter Abrahams (US author)|Peter Abrahams]], the protagonist Eddie Nye has memorised the poem during his 15 years in prison. He ponders many aspects of the poem as his own story unfolds. The plot of the novel reflects several aspects of the poem.\n* The poem is heavily referred to in the [[Connie Willis]] science fiction novel, ''[[Passage (2001 novel)|Passage]]''.\n* The poem plays a crucial role in [[W. W. Denslow]]'s 1904 children's book, ''The Pearl and the Pumpkin''.\n* The author [[Garry Kilworth]], known for the ''[[Welkin Weasels]]'' trilogy, was inspired by Coleridge for the entire trilogy. For example, when Sherriff Falshed is on the run from a [[dragonfly]] nymph, he quotes \"A frightful fiend, did close behind him ''swish''\", and also in the third book the entire scene with Death is re-enacted with a walrus and a nebulous shadow, when the weasels pass their ghostly vessel.\n* In his poem \"Snake\", [[D. H. Lawrence]] compares the albatross in ''Ancient Mariner'' to the poem's subject, a snake.\n* [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]'s ''[[Watchmen]]'' includes a [[story within a story]] \"Tales of the Black Freighter\", which bears similarities to the poem through its [[supernatural]] themes and the tale of a mariner's impending doom.\n* [[Charles Baudelaire]] (who also translated E. A. Poe into French) revisits the scene with the albatross (see D\u00fcrer's illustration above), suggesting the poet is the albatross rather than the mariner. (\"The Albatross\", 1857, ''[[Les fleurs du mal|Flowers of Evil]]'').\n* In [[Michael Morpurgo]]'s novel ''[[Alone on a Wide, Wide Sea]]'', ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' is featured heavily and key ideas from the poem are used in the novel.\n* In [[M. R. James]]'s short story, ''Casting the Runes,'' a prior victim of Karswell received in the mail a (fictional) engraving of a man pursued by a demon, supposed to have been torn from a volume of Bewick's engravings, with a quotation from the poem written upon it: \"having once looked round \u2013 walks on, And turns no more his head, Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.\"\n* In [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s short story \"Footprints on the Sea-Shore\", published in ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'', the main character walks along the seashore and at one point he \"encountered a bird,\u2014a large gray bird,\u2014but whether a loon, or a wild goose, or the identical albatross of the Ancient Mariner, was beyond my ornithology to decide.\"\n\n==Games==\n* The videogame, ''[[Alpha Protocol]]'', features a character known as Albatross. One of the dossier packages players can unlock for him states that he takes his name from the poem, which alludes to the vengeance he unleashes if hurt.\n* In the online computer game ''[[Guild Wars]]'', the opening lines of NPC [http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Samti_Kohlreg Samti Kohlreg's] dialogue and the name of his quest reference the poem and the author.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Messages,_Messages_Everywhere |title=Messages, Messages Everywhere |work=Guild Wars Wiki |accessdate= 22 December 2010}}</ref> In its sequel, ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'', the name of the item [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rime-Rimmed_Mariner%27s_Rebreather Rime-Rimmed Mariner's Rebreather] is a reference to the poem.\n* The Ancient Mariner appears as a rare miniature in the game ''[[Horrorclix]]''' 2008 Nightmares set, carrying the soul of a dead sailor and a piece of the Albatross.\n* In the collectible card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', the [[flavor text]]s of the cards Scathe Zombies, Wall of Ice and Will-o'-the-Wisp (all from the ''[[Limited Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Limited Edition Alpha]]'' set) are quotes from the poem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=81|title=Scathe Zombies (Limited Edition Alpha) - Gatherer - Magic: The Gathering|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180|title=Wall of Ice (Limited Edition Alpha) - Gatherer - Magic: The Gathering|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=91|title=Will-O'-The-Wisp (Limited Edition Alpha) - Gatherer - Magic: The Gathering|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref>\n* In the ''[[Soul (series)|Soulcalibur]]'' series of video games, the pirate [[Cervantes de Leon]] has a throw move named \"Curse of the Ancient Mariner\" (called \"Rime of Ancient Mariner\" in the Japanese version). [[Shura (Soulcalibur)|Shura]], a Japanese [[Oni (folklore)|demon]] slayer appearing in ''[[Soulcalibur IV]]'', can also use the move, despite having no connection to mariners, the high seas or anything else mentioned in the poem&nbsp;\u2013 this is because she shares a moveset with Cervantes.\n* In the online computer game ''[[Vanguard: Saga of Heroes]]'', in the city of Martok, there is an NPC ([[non-player character]]) [[Orc]] named Rolyat Leumas, the Ancient Seafarer of Martok. If the player questions him, he will tell the complete story of the ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner'', with minor modifications to make it appropriate to the game world. The character's name is \"Samuel Taylor\" spelled backwards.\n* The online computer game, ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' contains a quest named \"Horn of the Ancient Mariner\" as well as an obtainable weapon called the \"Crossbow of the Albatross\" and a cosmetic item called the \"Rime of the Time-Lost Mariner\".\n* ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' DLC \"Lonesome Road\" is significantly inspired by ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' Part VI, stanza 11 which reads \"Like one that on a lonesome road / Doth walk in fear and dread, / And having once turned round walks on, / And turns no more his head; / Because he knows a frightful fiend / Doth close behind him tread.\"\n* Some game maps in ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic III]]'' contain floating bottles on the water, that give quotes from ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' when inspected by a player's hero.\n* In ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', the ''vigor'' (potion) \"Undertow\" is advertised by the vigor dispenser machine with the words \"Ancient mariner, disperse the hated albatross with the vigor Undertow\".\n* In ''[[Silent Hill: Downpour]]'', there is a television set in the train conductor's living quarters. If the player changes the channel twice, an ominous voice can be heard reciting the lines \"Alone, alone, all, all alone. Alone on a wide wide sea! And never a saint took pity on my soul in agony.\"\n* In ''[[Dota 2]]'', the hero Kunkka the Admiral quotes lines from the poem.\n* In ''[[Stardew Valley]]'', there is a minor character called the 'Old Mariner' that appears on a beach during a storm. He offers a pendant that allows the player to marry another character.\n\n==Comics==\n* ''[[MAD Magazine]]'' [http://madcoversite.com/mad200.html #200 (July 1978)] published \"The Rime of the Modern Skateboarder\", a full-length [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] by [[Tom Koch]] and [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plurk.com/p/ifgod4|title=He was a wild-eyed skateboard freak; / He stoppeth one of three. / I've slalomed all through hell, he said. / That's where I skinned my knee.|website=Plurk|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> A similar parody entitled \"The Rime of the Modern Surfer\" and previously been done by the same people.<ref>\"The completely Mad Don Martin, Vol. 1, p. 292, Running Press, Philadelphia, 2007</ref>\n* In [[Marvel Comics]]' Marvel Universe:\n** [[Agent Pratt]], a reoccurring nemesis of the character [[Hulk]], habitually quotes from ''The Rime'', and debates with Banner about exactly what the albatross symbolises.\n** Comic book author [[Bill Everett]] named his most famous character, the [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner (an [[antihero]]), in part from this poem.<ref>Peter Sanderson (1996).

In it, the closing lines of the first part of Coleridge's poem (\"Why look'st thou so?'\u2014'With my crossbow/I shot the Albatross.\") are quoted several times.\n* The pirate Brook from the manga ''[[One Piece]]'' has a similar background story to the rime.\n* The cartoonist [[Hunt Emerson]] produced a [[graphic novel]], ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner'', illustrating the poem, and featuring his usual quota of visual puns, gags and grotesque caricatures. The text, however, is essentially used verbatim.\n\n==Military==\n* Since 1978, the [[US Coast Guard]] has recognised the active duty member with the most accumulated time aboard its ships and an exemplary character as the \"Ancient Mariner\", as described in [http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/AncientAlbatross.pdf this document] ([[Portable Document Format|pdf]]).\n\n==Music==\n\n* \"[[Powerslave#tracklisting|Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]\" is a song by the English [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]], from their fifth studio album, ''[[Powerslave]]'' (1984). Written by the band's bass player [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]], the song is based on Coleridge's poem with many direct quotes from the text. The song is almost fourteen minutes long and like the poem, it contains several distinct sections with differing moods. It has remained a fan favourite for over 30 years. \n* Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]] makes a reference to the poem in the song \"The Islander\".\n* Progressive rock band [[Pink Floyd]] alludes to Coleridge's poem in the first verse of their song \"[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]\".\n* [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s hit song \"[[Albatross (composition)|Albatross]]\" drew its title from the poem, as the composer [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] read the poem when he was at school.

The Pogues song \"The Turkish Song of the Damned\" is also based heavily on the poem, adopting the same meter and including many direct quotes and references.\n* The [[Flogging Molly]] song \"Rebels of the Sacred Heart\" has the line \"the albatross hangin' round your neck is the cross you bear for your sins.\"\n* The band [[Corrosion of Conformity]] has a song called \"Albatross\", in which the lyricist warns the [[albatross]] away. The lyricist also states, \"I believe the albatross is me\".\n* [[David Bedford]] recorded a concept album ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (album)|The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' in 1975. An experimental work, it consists of two parts of the poem set to music, and is similar in style to a dramatic reading of the poem.\n* The music video for the song \"Living Hell\" by [[The Tiger Lillies]] draws heavily on the poem, recreating themes such as the killing of the [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]]. They later made a whole album named after the poem.\n* The song \"Albatross\" by [[Wild Beasts]] re-tells the story of the poem.\n* The song \"Peep-Hole\" by [[Guided by Voices]], featured on their album [[Bee Thousand]], contains the lyrics, \"Give me the cost of the albatross / And wear it around your neck for size,\" in reference to the poem.\n* The lyrics to the song \"(In The Wake Of) The Swollen Goat\" by the band [[Clutch (band)|Clutch]] mentions having an \"Albatross on your neck\" in reference to the poem.\n* American punk band [[Alesana]]'s song \"Heavy Hangs the Albatross\" is named in reference to the poem.\n* Hard rock band [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle's]] song \"Face to the Floor\" contains a reference to an albatross as a great weight dragging one downwards, much like that in the poem.\n* The [[Big Wreck]] song \"[[Albatross (Big Wreck song)|Albatross]]\" alludes to the poem, particularly via the lyric \"I'll wear the albatross for one more day\".\n* \"Bear's Vision of St. Agnes\" by American indie band [[mewithoutYou]] includes the lyrics \"you've worn me like an albatross / I've only slowed you down\".\n* The British band [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]] make direct use of the \"albatross around your neck\" in their hidden track \"The Weight of Living Part I\" on their debut full-length album ''[[Bad Blood (Bastille album)|Bad Blood]]''.

Imagery from the book and the subtext is also featured heavily in the video.\n* The band [[Foxing]] named their first album ''Albatross'', and the song \"Bloodhound\" makes reference to \"An ALbatross hanging from my neck\"\n* The American rock band [[Weezer]]'s song \"Wind in our Sails\" opens with the lines \"A boy and a girl/Albatross around their necks.\"\n\n==Film==\n* In the 1951 film ''[[Pandora and the Flying Dutchman]]'', the story draws as much from the ''Ancient Mariner'' as it does from the Flying Dutchman legend. The main character, believing his wife unfaithful, kills her and is sentenced to death. At his trial, he blasphemes by proclaiming Heaven a lie and asking that if he be mistaken, that Heaven do what it pleases with his soul. Instead of being executed, the man is condemned to sail the oceans of the world for eternity and becomes literally unable to die, until he can find a woman who loves him enough to die for him. Every seven years, he may search for her on land for six months. The ship's crew consists entirely of ghosts, and a bloody white bird resembling an albatross flies overhead.\n* A 1952 ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' short is titled \"[[Water, Water Every Hare]]\".\n* In the film ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'' an attempt is made to shoot an albatross which leads to negative results.\n* In ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'', Clooney's character asks McGregor's character if he ever heard the poem about the sailor who had to wear the dead seagull around his neck. He is referencing ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''.\n* In the 1999 film ''[[Noah's Ark (1999 film)|Noah's Ark]]'', a group of sceptics mock Noah's warnings of the flood, while the land suffers drought, with a chorus of \"Water, Water, everywhere, but not a drop to drink.\"\n* In the 1985 film ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' Denys Finch-Hatton quotes from the ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' as he washes Karen's hair. She says \"you're skipping verses\" and he replies \"Well, I leave out the dull parts\".\n* The poem is extensively featured in the film ''[[Pandaemonium (film)|Pandaemonium]]'', which is based on the early lives of Coleridge, [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] and [[William Wordsworth]].\n* The ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' films contain many parallels to the epic poem, including life and death playing dice for the souls of men (the game [[Liar's Dice]]), Calypso (as [[Tia Dalma]]'s true form), smelly slimy creatures ([[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]' crew), the \"frost and the cold\", and even \"water, water, everywhere and not a drop to drink\" when the characters are at sea and out of drinking water.\n* In the 1996 [[Ridley Scott]] film ''[[White Squall (film)|White Squall]]'', the Ocean Academy's ship is christened the ''Albatross''; the ship's captain Christopher Sheldon makes mention of the albatross being a very good omen which \"embodied the spirits of lost sailors.\" \"Only bad luck if you kill one,\" he added.\n* [[Ra\u00fal daSilva]] produced and directed a critically acclaimed six-time international prizewinning visualisation of the epic poem, titled ''[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1975 film)|Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' (1975) using the work of illustrators of the past two centuries who attempted to bring life to the epic. Sir Michael Redgrave, who once taught the poem as a schoolmaster, narrates it. The film also includes a biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and how he came to write the poem.\n* [[Ken Russell]] directed a film about Coleridge, called [http://imdb.com/title/tt0077347/ ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner''], in 1978 for British [[Granada Television]].\n* The original ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' film series (starring [[Basil Rathbone]] as Holmes and [[Nigel Bruce]] as Doctor Watson) contained a film titled ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (film)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', released in 1939, in which Holmes' nemesis, [[Professor Moriarty]] (played by [[George Zucco]]), creates a series of murder threats to draw Holmes' attention away from his real plan. These diversionary plots all revolve around a series of drawings which depict a man with an albatross around his neck. Throughout the film, Holmes makes references to lines from Coleridge's work.\n* In [[Richard O'Brien]]'s ''[[Shock Treatment]]'', the character Betty Hapschatt recites the entire poem to Judge Oliver Wright who, along with an entire theatre of people, has fallen asleep by its closing lines. When the lights are turned back on, the security guard Vance threateningly presents her with a dead white bird.\n* [[Larry Jordan]] directed a short film that features animations of [[Gustave Dore]]'s engravings and [[Orson Welles]] as the narrator of the poem, along with sound effects (the albatross, the sea, etc.).\n* In 1998, [[BBC]] produced ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' as a 57-minute made-for-TV movie with [[Films for Humanities and the Sciences (FHS)]] that features [[Paul McGann]] as both Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the Ancient Mariner. The film was directed by Juliet May and produced by Anne Brogan.\n* In ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'', The Operative refers to River Tam as an albatross, causing Malcolm Reynolds to reply: \"Way I remember it, albatross was a ship's good luck, 'til some idiot killed it.\" he then assures Inara: \"Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to faint.\"\n* In the 1983 film ''[[Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone]]'', Wolff ([[Peter Strauss]]) quotes the \"Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink\" line while walking across a dried up lakebed, explaining to Nikki ([[Molly Ringwald]]) that it's from \"the first poem you learn in Highschool\"\n* In the 1971 film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', as the group is entering the room where Wonka is developing \"fizzy-lifting drinks\" Wonka says, \"Bubbles, bubbles, every where, but not a drop to drink.\"\n* In the 1986 [[B movie]] ''[[Never Too Young to Die]]'', Velvet Von Ragner ([[Gene Simmons]]) gloats \"Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink\" as he explains his plan to poison the city's water supply.\n* In the 1980 movie ''[[The Fog]]'', the reference \"like an albatross around the neck\" can be heard on the cassette recorder in the lighthouse where Stevie Wayne ([[Adrienne Barbeau]]) works. Just before that a wooden piece with the word \"Dane\" explodes when the quote \"6 Must Die\" appears magically written in it. Also, a small fishing vessel comes across a large hulking vessel in the fog (in reality, a 19th-century clipper ship) which is carrying the ghosts of mariners who died 100 years earlier. \n* In the film adaptation of [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s novel ''[[The Rum Diary]]'', Paul Kemp ([[Johnny Depp]]) is found reading and contemplating the poem.\n* In the 2012 film ''[[Ice Age 4]]'', Sid the sloth bemoans the lack of drinking water whilst adrift on the ocean with \"Water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink!\"\n* In the film ''[[Against the Sun]]'', one of the sailors, Aldrich, shoots an albatross that lands on the crew's emergency life raft in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, prompting the character of Chief Dixon to remark \"I can't believe you actually shot an albatross.\"\n\n==Television==\n* In the \"[[Super Trivia]]\" episode of ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', [[Master Shake]] says to both [[Meatwad]] and [[Frylock]] that they're \"albacores around my neck\" like \"the Rime of the Marinade.\" which Frylock corrects by replying \"that's Albatross!\"\n* In ''[[The Dream with Roy and HG#The Ice Dream|The Ice Dream]]'', an irreverent Australian talk show covering the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], the hosts said that a curse had been put on Australia's Winter Olympic team after Cedric Sloane skewered a seagull in a cross-country skiing event at the Oslo Winter Olympics, which could only be lifted by the team winning a gold medal.\n* A portion of the poem was recited by [[Wonder Woman]] as the body of the [[Viking Prince]] and his [[longship]] were sent into the [[Sun]], during the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode: \"To Another Shore\", at the same time that the [[Martian Manhunter]] leaves the Watchtower.\n* In episode 90 of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'', \"Stage Fight\", a trainer aboard a ship recites the opening stanza of the ballad to her [[Raichu]].\n* In the third to last episode of the Australian television series ''[[SeaChange]]'', Max compares the failure of his relationship with Laura to the Mariner shooting down the Albatross. This episode is entitled \"Love in the Time of Coleridge\".\n* In the episode of the ''[[Simpsons]]'' entitled \"Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood\", Homer incorrectly recalls the verse \"Water, water, everywhere, so let's all have a drink\" as rationale for drinking seawater while stranded at sea.\n* In episode XLV of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'', \"The Scotsman Saves Jack,\" the characters encounter a sailor who tries to recite for them his harrowing tale. The Scotsman is uninterested, but is convinced to at least hear the name of his story, which is revealed to be \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"\n* [[Monty Python]] performed a sketch (Series 1, Episode 13, Albatross) which figured John Cleese as a cinema usherette with a tray hung around her neck containing an albatross instead of the more normal choc ices.\n* In the ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' episode \"[[Objects in Space]]\", the character [[River Tam]] ([[Summer Glau]]) was nicknamed \"Albatross\" and in ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' was subsequently referred to as an albatross by the [[List of Firefly characters#The Operative|Operative]].\n* At the end of the ''[[SeaQuest DSV]]'' episode \"Hide and Seek\", [[Roy Scheider]] can be heard reciting one of the last stanzas of this poem over the closing scene.\n* In the episode of ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', \"Sleeping Dogs Lie\" Rodney remarks regarding his Uncle Albert \"I've said it before, I'll say it again: that man's a right Jonah.

Cain]]'s crime novel ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', Phyllis is described as the creature who came on board ship to shoot dice in ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.''\n* The poem features prominently in the plot of [[Douglas Adams]]'s novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]''. In the novel, the title character time travels to interrupt Coleridge's work on his poem \"Kubla Khan\"; during his rambling dialogue, intended to disrupt Coleridge from unintentionally encoding information from a ghost which could lead to the destruction of the human race, Dirk Gently's references to \"Albert Ross\", another character from the novel, are misheard by Coleridge as \"albatross,\" which he says might have given him an idea for another poem he is working on, which he considers superior to a previous idea involving a meteor striking the Earth.\n* [[Gene Wolfe]]'s science fiction novella, ''[[The Fifth Head of Cerberus]]'', uses as its motto the lines: \"When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow, / And the owlet whoops to the wolf below, / That eats the she-wolf's young\".\n* In [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', chapter 5, [[Victor Frankenstein]] quotes the lines: \"Like one, that on a lonesome road / Doth walk in fear and dread / And, having once turned round, walks on / And turns no more his head / Because he knows a frightful fiend / Doth close behind him tread\" (Penguin Popular Classic 1968 page 57, cited from ''Rime'', 1817 edition). In the book's opening letters from Robert Walton to his sister, specifically Letter II, Walton explicitly mentions the poem by name and claims he \"shall kill no albatross\" on his journey.\n* In [[Clive Cussler]]'s novel ''[[Iceberg (Cussler novel)|Iceberg]]'', several references are made to the poem and it is quoted several times. The villain's company logo is the albatross. In another novel ''The Silent Sea'', four lines from the poem are written on the page before the prologue.\n* In [[Garth Nix]]'s ''[[The Keys to the Kingdom|Keys to the Kingdom]]'' series, the Mariner is an ancient and powerful being. He claims his real name is Captain Tom Shelvocke, and he mentions accidentally shooting an albatross.\n* In ''Lights Out'' by [[Peter Abrahams (US author)|Peter Abrahams]], the protagonist Eddie Nye has memorised the poem during his 15 years in prison. He ponders many aspects of the poem as his own story unfolds. The plot of the novel reflects several aspects of the poem.\n* The poem is heavily referred to in the [[Connie Willis]] science fiction novel, ''[[Passage (2001 novel)|Passage]]''.\n* The poem plays a crucial role in [[W. W. Denslow]]'s 1904 children's book, ''The Pearl and the Pumpkin''.\n* The author [[Garry Kilworth]], known for the ''[[Welkin Weasels]]'' trilogy, was inspired by Coleridge for the entire trilogy. For example, when Sherriff Falshed is on the run from a [[dragonfly]] nymph, he quotes \"A frightful fiend, did close behind him ''swish''\", and also in the third book the entire scene with Death is re-enacted with a walrus and a nebulous shadow, when the weasels pass their ghostly vessel.\n* In his poem \"Snake\", [[D. H. Lawrence]] compares the albatross in ''Ancient Mariner'' to the poem's subject, a snake.\n* [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]'s ''[[Watchmen]]'' includes a [[story within a story]] \"Tales of the Black Freighter\", which bears similarities to the poem through its [[supernatural]] themes and the tale of a mariner's impending doom.\n* [[Charles Baudelaire]] (who also translated E. A. Poe into French) revisits the scene with the albatross (see D\u00fcrer's illustration above), suggesting the poet is the albatross rather than the mariner. (\"The Albatross\", 1857, ''[[Les fleurs du mal|Flowers of Evil]]'').\n* In [[Michael Morpurgo]]'s novel ''[[Alone on a Wide, Wide Sea]]'', ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' is featured heavily and key ideas from the poem are used in the novel.\n* In [[M. R. James]]'s short story, ''Casting the Runes,'' a prior victim of Karswell received in the mail a (fictional) engraving of a man pursued by a demon, supposed to have been torn from a volume of Bewick's engravings, with a quotation from the poem written upon it: \"having once looked round \u2013 walks on, And turns no more his head, Because he knows a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread.\"\n* In [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s short story \"Footprints on the Sea-Shore\", published in ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'', the main character walks along the seashore and at one point he \"encountered a bird,\u2014a large gray bird,\u2014but whether a loon, or a wild goose, or the identical albatross of the Ancient Mariner, was beyond my ornithology to decide.\"\n\n==Games==\n* The videogame, ''[[Alpha Protocol]]'', features a character known as Albatross. One of the dossier packages players can unlock for him states that he takes his name from the poem, which alludes to the vengeance he unleashes if hurt.\n* In the online computer game ''[[Guild Wars]]'', the opening lines of NPC [http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Samti_Kohlreg Samti Kohlreg's] dialogue and the name of his quest reference the poem and the author.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Messages,_Messages_Everywhere |title=Messages, Messages Everywhere |work=Guild Wars Wiki |accessdate= 22 December 2010}}</ref> In its sequel, ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'', the name of the item [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rime-Rimmed_Mariner%27s_Rebreather Rime-Rimmed Mariner's Rebreather] is a reference to the poem.\n* The Ancient Mariner appears as a rare miniature in the game ''[[Horrorclix]]''' 2008 Nightmares set, carrying the soul of a dead sailor and a piece of the Albatross.\n* In the collectible card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'', the [[flavor text]]s of the cards Scathe Zombies, Wall of Ice and Will-o'-the-Wisp (all from the ''[[Limited Edition (Magic: The Gathering)|Limited Edition Alpha]]'' set) are quotes from the poem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=81|title=Scathe Zombies (Limited Edition Alpha) - Gatherer - Magic: The Gathering|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=180|title=Wall of Ice (Limited Edition Alpha) - Gatherer - Magic: The Gathering|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=91|title=Will-O'-The-Wisp (Limited Edition Alpha) - Gatherer - Magic: The Gathering|publisher=|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref>\n* In the ''[[Soul (series)|Soulcalibur]]'' series of video games, the pirate [[Cervantes de Leon]] has a throw move named \"Curse of the Ancient Mariner\" (called \"Rime of Ancient Mariner\" in the Japanese version). [[Shura (Soulcalibur)|Shura]], a Japanese [[Oni (folklore)|demon]] slayer appearing in ''[[Soulcalibur IV]]'', can also use the move, despite having no connection to mariners, the high seas or anything else mentioned in the poem&nbsp;\u2013 this is because she shares a moveset with Cervantes.\n* In the online computer game ''[[Vanguard: Saga of Heroes]]'', in the city of Martok, there is an NPC ([[non-player character]]) [[Orc]] named Rolyat Leumas, the Ancient Seafarer of Martok. If the player questions him, he will tell the complete story of the ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner'', with minor modifications to make it appropriate to the game world. The character's name is \"Samuel Taylor\" spelled backwards.\n* The online computer game, ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' contains a quest named \"Horn of the Ancient Mariner\" as well as an obtainable weapon called the \"Crossbow of the Albatross\" and a cosmetic item called the \"Rime of the Time-Lost Mariner\".\n* ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' DLC \"Lonesome Road\" is significantly inspired by ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' Part VI, stanza 11 which reads \"Like one that on a lonesome road / Doth walk in fear and dread, / And having once turned round walks on, / And turns no more his head; / Because he knows a frightful fiend / Doth close behind him tread.\"\n* Some game maps in ''[[Heroes of Might and Magic III]]'' contain floating bottles on the water, that give quotes from ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' when inspected by a player's hero.\n* In ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', the ''vigor'' (potion) \"Undertow\" is advertised by the vigor dispenser machine with the words \"Ancient mariner, disperse the hated albatross with the vigor Undertow\".\n* In ''[[Silent Hill: Downpour]]'', there is a television set in the train conductor's living quarters. If the player changes the channel twice, an ominous voice can be heard reciting the lines \"Alone, alone, all, all alone. Alone on a wide wide sea! And never a saint took pity on my soul in agony.\"\n* In ''[[Dota 2]]'', the hero Kunkka the Admiral quotes lines from the poem.\n* In ''[[Stardew Valley]]'', there is a minor character called the 'Old Mariner' that appears on a beach during a storm. He offers a pendant that allows the player to marry another character.\n\n==Comics==\n* ''[[MAD Magazine]]'' [http://madcoversite.com/mad200.html #200 (July 1978)] published \"The Rime of the Modern Skateboarder\", a full-length [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] by [[Tom Koch]] and [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plurk.com/p/ifgod4|title=He was a wild-eyed skateboard freak; / He stoppeth one of three. / I've slalomed all through hell, he said. / That's where I skinned my knee.|website=Plurk|language=en|access-date=2019-10-01}}</ref> A similar parody entitled \"The Rime of the Modern Surfer\" and previously been done by the same people.<ref>\"The completely Mad Don Martin, Vol. 1, p. 292, Running Press, Philadelphia, 2007</ref>\n* In [[Marvel Comics]]' Marvel Universe:\n** [[Agent Pratt]], a reoccurring nemesis of the character [[Hulk]], habitually quotes from ''The Rime'', and debates with Banner about exactly what the albatross symbolises.\n** Comic book author [[Bill Everett]] named his most famous character, the [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner (an [[antihero]]), in part from this poem.<ref>Peter Sanderson (1996).

In it, the closing lines of the first part of Coleridge's poem (\"Why look'st thou so?'\u2014'With my crossbow/I shot the Albatross.\") are quoted several times.\n* The pirate Brook from the manga ''[[One Piece]]'' has a similar background story to the rime.\n* The cartoonist [[Hunt Emerson]] produced a [[graphic novel]], ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner'', illustrating the poem, and featuring his usual quota of visual puns, gags and grotesque caricatures. The text, however, is essentially used verbatim.\n\n==Military==\n* Since 1978, the [[US Coast Guard]] has recognised the active duty member with the most accumulated time aboard its ships and an exemplary character as the \"Ancient Mariner\", as described in [http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/AncientAlbatross.pdf this document] ([[Portable Document Format|pdf]]).\n\n==Music==\n\n* \"[[Powerslave#tracklisting|Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]\" is a song by the English [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]], from their fifth studio album, ''[[Powerslave]]'' (1984). Written by the band's bass player [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]], the song is based on Coleridge's poem with many direct quotes from the text. The song is almost fourteen minutes long and like the poem, it contains several distinct sections with differing moods. It has remained a fan favourite for over 30 years. \n* Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]] makes a reference to the poem in the song \"The Islander\".\n* Progressive rock band [[Pink Floyd]] alludes to Coleridge's poem in the first verse of their song \"[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]\".\n* [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s hit song \"[[Albatross (composition)|Albatross]]\" drew its title from the poem, as the composer [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] read the poem when he was at school.

The Pogues song \"The Turkish Song of the Damned\" is also based heavily on the poem, adopting the same meter and including many direct quotes and references.\n* The [[Flogging Molly]] song \"Rebels of the Sacred Heart\" has the line \"the albatross hangin' round your neck is the cross you bear for your sins.\"\n* The band [[Corrosion of Conformity]] has a song called \"Albatross\", in which the lyricist warns the [[albatross]] away. The lyricist also states, \"I believe the albatross is me\".\n* [[David Bedford]] recorded a concept album ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (album)|The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' in 1975. An experimental work, it consists of two parts of the poem set to music, and is similar in style to a dramatic reading of the poem.\n* The music video for the song \"Living Hell\" by [[The Tiger Lillies]] draws heavily on the poem, recreating themes such as the killing of the [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]]. They later made a whole album named after the poem.\n* The song \"Albatross\" by [[Wild Beasts]] re-tells the story of the poem.\n* The song \"Peep-Hole\" by [[Guided by Voices]], featured on their album [[Bee Thousand]], contains the lyrics, \"Give me the cost of the albatross / And wear it around your neck for size,\" in reference to the poem.\n* The lyrics to the song \"(In The Wake Of) The Swollen Goat\" by the band [[Clutch (band)|Clutch]] mentions having an \"Albatross on your neck\" in reference to the poem.\n* American punk band [[Alesana]]'s song \"Heavy Hangs the Albatross\" is named in reference to the poem.\n* Hard rock band [[Chevelle (band)|Chevelle's]] song \"Face to the Floor\" contains a reference to an albatross as a great weight dragging one downwards, much like that in the poem.\n* The [[Big Wreck]] song \"[[Albatross (Big Wreck song)|Albatross]]\" alludes to the poem, particularly via the lyric \"I'll wear the albatross for one more day\".\n* \"Bear's Vision of St. Agnes\" by American indie band [[mewithoutYou]] includes the lyrics \"you've worn me like an albatross / I've only slowed you down\".\n* The British band [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]] make direct use of the \"albatross around your neck\" in their hidden track \"The Weight of Living Part I\" on their debut full-length album ''[[Bad Blood (Bastille album)|Bad Blood]]''.

Imagery from the book and the subtext is also featured heavily in the video.\n* The band [[Foxing]] named their first album ''Albatross'', and the song \"Bloodhound\" makes reference to \"An ALbatross hanging from my neck\"\n* The American rock band [[Weezer]]'s song \"Wind in our Sails\" opens with the lines \"A boy and a girl/Albatross around their necks.\"\n\n==Film==\n* In the 1951 film ''[[Pandora and the Flying Dutchman]]'', the story draws as much from the ''Ancient Mariner'' as it does from the Flying Dutchman legend. The main character, believing his wife unfaithful, kills her and is sentenced to death. At his trial, he blasphemes by proclaiming Heaven a lie and asking that if he be mistaken, that Heaven do what it pleases with his soul. Instead of being executed, the man is condemned to sail the oceans of the world for eternity and becomes literally unable to die, until he can find a woman who loves him enough to die for him. Every seven years, he may search for her on land for six months. The ship's crew consists entirely of ghosts, and a bloody white bird resembling an albatross flies overhead.\n* A 1952 ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' short is titled \"[[Water, Water Every Hare]]\".\n* In the film ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'' an attempt is made to shoot an albatross which leads to negative results.\n* In ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'', Clooney's character asks McGregor's character if he ever heard the poem about the sailor who had to wear the dead seagull around his neck. He is referencing ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''.\n* In the 1999 film ''[[Noah's Ark (1999 film)|Noah's Ark]]'', a group of sceptics mock Noah's warnings of the flood, while the land suffers drought, with a chorus of \"Water, Water, everywhere, but not a drop to drink.\"\n* In the 1985 film ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' Denys Finch-Hatton quotes from the ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' as he washes Karen's hair. She says \"you're skipping verses\" and he replies \"Well, I leave out the dull parts\".\n* The poem is extensively featured in the film ''[[Pandaemonium (film)|Pandaemonium]]'', which is based on the early lives of Coleridge, [[Dorothy Wordsworth]] and [[William Wordsworth]].\n* The ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' films contain many parallels to the epic poem, including life and death playing dice for the souls of men (the game [[Liar's Dice]]), Calypso (as [[Tia Dalma]]'s true form), smelly slimy creatures ([[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]]' crew), the \"frost and the cold\", and even \"water, water, everywhere and not a drop to drink\" when the characters are at sea and out of drinking water.\n* In the 1996 [[Ridley Scott]] film ''[[White Squall (film)|White Squall]]'', the Ocean Academy's ship is christened the ''Albatross''; the ship's captain Christopher Sheldon makes mention of the albatross being a very good omen which \"embodied the spirits of lost sailors.\" \"Only bad luck if you kill one,\" he added.\n* [[Ra\u00fal daSilva]] produced and directed a critically acclaimed six-time international prizewinning visualisation of the epic poem, titled ''[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1975 film)|Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' (1975) using the work of illustrators of the past two centuries who attempted to bring life to the epic. Sir Michael Redgrave, who once taught the poem as a schoolmaster, narrates it. The film also includes a biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and how he came to write the poem.\n* [[Ken Russell]] directed a film about Coleridge, called [http://imdb.com/title/tt0077347/ ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner''], in 1978 for British [[Granada Television]].\n* The original ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' film series (starring [[Basil Rathbone]] as Holmes and [[Nigel Bruce]] as Doctor Watson) contained a film titled ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (film)|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'', released in 1939, in which Holmes' nemesis, [[Professor Moriarty]] (played by [[George Zucco]]), creates a series of murder threats to draw Holmes' attention away from his real plan. These diversionary plots all revolve around a series of drawings which depict a man with an albatross around his neck. Throughout the film, Holmes makes references to lines from Coleridge's work.\n* In [[Richard O'Brien]]'s ''[[Shock Treatment]]'', the character Betty Hapschatt recites the entire poem to Judge Oliver Wright who, along with an entire theatre of people, has fallen asleep by its closing lines. When the lights are turned back on, the security guard Vance threateningly presents her with a dead white bird.\n* [[Larry Jordan]] directed a short film that features animations of [[Gustave Dore]]'s engravings and [[Orson Welles]] as the narrator of the poem, along with sound effects (the albatross, the sea, etc.).\n* In 1998, [[BBC]] produced ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' as a 57-minute made-for-TV movie with [[Films for Humanities and the Sciences (FHS)]] that features [[Paul McGann]] as both Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the Ancient Mariner. The film was directed by Juliet May and produced by Anne Brogan.\n* In ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'', The Operative refers to River Tam as an albatross, causing Malcolm Reynolds to reply: \"Way I remember it, albatross was a ship's good luck, 'til some idiot killed it.\" he then assures Inara: \"Yes, I've read a poem. Try not to faint.\"\n* In the 1983 film ''[[Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone]]'', Wolff ([[Peter Strauss]]) quotes the \"Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink\" line while walking across a dried up lakebed, explaining to Nikki ([[Molly Ringwald]]) that it's from \"the first poem you learn in Highschool\"\n* In the 1971 film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', as the group is entering the room where Wonka is developing \"fizzy-lifting drinks\" Wonka says, \"Bubbles, bubbles, every where, but not a drop to drink.\"\n* In the 1986 [[B movie]] ''[[Never Too Young to Die]]'', Velvet Von Ragner ([[Gene Simmons]]) gloats \"Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink\" as he explains his plan to poison the city's water supply.\n* In the 1980 movie ''[[The Fog]]'', the reference \"like an albatross around the neck\" can be heard on the cassette recorder in the lighthouse where Stevie Wayne ([[Adrienne Barbeau]]) works. Just before that a wooden piece with the word \"Dane\" explodes when the quote \"6 Must Die\" appears magically written in it. Also, a small fishing vessel comes across a large hulking vessel in the fog (in reality, a 19th-century clipper ship) which is carrying the ghosts of mariners who died 100 years earlier. \n* In the film adaptation of [[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s novel ''[[The Rum Diary]]'', Paul Kemp ([[Johnny Depp]]) is found reading and contemplating the poem.\n* In the 2012 film ''[[Ice Age 4]]'', Sid the sloth bemoans the lack of drinking water whilst adrift on the ocean with \"Water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink!\"\n* In the film ''[[Against the Sun]]'', one of the sailors, Aldrich, shoots an albatross that lands on the crew's emergency life raft in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, prompting the character of Chief Dixon to remark \"I can't believe you actually shot an albatross.\"\n\n==Television==\n* In the \"[[Super Trivia]]\" episode of ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', [[Master Shake]] says to both [[Meatwad]] and [[Frylock]] that they're \"albacores around my neck\" like \"the Rime of the Marinade.\" which Frylock corrects by replying \"that's Albatross!\"\n* In ''[[The Dream with Roy and HG#The Ice Dream|The Ice Dream]]'', an irreverent Australian talk show covering the [[2002 Winter Olympics]], the hosts said that a curse had been put on Australia's Winter Olympic team after Cedric Sloane skewered a seagull in a cross-country skiing event at the Oslo Winter Olympics, which could only be lifted by the team winning a gold medal.\n* A portion of the poem was recited by [[Wonder Woman]] as the body of the [[Viking Prince]] and his [[longship]] were sent into the [[Sun]], during the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode: \"To Another Shore\", at the same time that the [[Martian Manhunter]] leaves the Watchtower.\n* In episode 90 of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'', \"Stage Fight\", a trainer aboard a ship recites the opening stanza of the ballad to her [[Raichu]].\n* In the third to last episode of the Australian television series ''[[SeaChange]]'', Max compares the failure of his relationship with Laura to the Mariner shooting down the Albatross. This episode is entitled \"Love in the Time of Coleridge\".\n* In the episode of the ''[[Simpsons]]'' entitled \"Boy Scoutz 'N the Hood\", Homer incorrectly recalls the verse \"Water, water, everywhere, so let's all have a drink\" as rationale for drinking seawater while stranded at sea.\n* In episode XLV of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'', \"The Scotsman Saves Jack,\" the characters encounter a sailor who tries to recite for them his harrowing tale. The Scotsman is uninterested, but is convinced to at least hear the name of his story, which is revealed to be \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\"\n* [[Monty Python]] performed a sketch (Series 1, Episode 13, Albatross) which figured John Cleese as a cinema usherette with a tray hung around her neck containing an albatross instead of the more normal choc ices.\n* In the ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' episode \"[[Objects in Space]]\", the character [[River Tam]] ([[Summer Glau]]) was nicknamed \"Albatross\" and in ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' was subsequently referred to as an albatross by the [[List of Firefly characters#The Operative|Operative]].\n* At the end of the ''[[SeaQuest DSV]]'' episode \"Hide and Seek\", [[Roy Scheider]] can be heard reciting one of the last stanzas of this poem over the closing scene.\n* In the episode of ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', \"Sleeping Dogs Lie\" Rodney remarks regarding his Uncle Albert \"I've said it before, I'll say it again: that man's a right Jonah. I reckon that when he boarded his last ship, the crew shot an albatross for luck.\"\n\n==Sports==\n* Baseball [[pitcher]] [[Diego Segu\u00ed]], who was pitching for the [[Seattle Mariners]] at the age of 40, was tagged by sportswriters as \"The Ancient Mariner\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=seguidi01|title=Diego Segui Baseball Stats by Baseball Almanac|website=www.baseball-almanac.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marinersblog.mlblogs.com/the-ancient-mariner-returns-to-safeco-field-eebf772008c1|title=\u201cThe Ancient Mariner\u201d Returns to Safeco Field|date=27 October 2016|website=Medium}}</ref> Twenty years later, [[Jamie Moyer]] (who pitched until 49 in the MLB, and up to age 43 with the Mariners) inherited the nickname.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2006/02/06/8368725/the-ancient-mariner|title=The Ancient Mariner|first=Albert|last=Chen|website=Vault}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://1460espnyakima.com/the-ancient-mariner-jamie-moyer-to-be-inducted-into-seattle-hall-of-fame/|title=\"The Ancient Mariner\" \u2013 Jamie Moyer \u2013 To Be Inducted Into Seattle Hall of Fame|first=Todd|last=Lyons|website=1460 ESPN Yakima}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rime Of The Ancient Mariner In Popular Culture}}\n[[Category:Works by Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]\n[[Category:British poems]]\n[[Category:Maritime folklore]]\n[[Category:Poems in popular culture]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner_in_popular_culture"}

Laso was the last person to see them alive and claimed that they had run away together to never come back. Although no trace of either was ever found, Laso was arrested and convicted for the murders after he was caught faking evidence intended to make people believe that the victims were alive. It is suspected that the bodies were buried in a land plot owned by Laso at the time, which was later expropriated to build a road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/sociedad/2016/12/04/5841e29622601d00668b45a2.html|title=Sin cad\u00e1ver... s\u00ed hay delito|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2014/10/16/543fad76e2704e70458b4575.html|title=El jurado popular declara culpable Ram\u00f3n Laso de doble asesinado|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalunyapress.es/texto-diario/mostrar/470217/supremo-ratifica-sentencia-30-anos-doble-homicidio-ramon-laso|title=El Supremo ratifica la sentencia de 30 a\u00f1os por el doble homicidio de Ram\u00f3n Laso|first=|last=CatalunyaPress.es|publisher=}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==United Kingdom==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Victim(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Convicted\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Disappeared\n! scope=\"col\" | Conviction date\n! scope=\"col\" | Description\n|-\n| [[The Campden Wonder|William Harrison]]\n| John, Richard, and Joan Perry\n| [[Chipping Campden]], [[England]]\n| August 16, 1660\n| Spring 1661\n| A wealthy 70-year-old man last seen walking to Charingworth.

Laso was the last person to see them alive and claimed that they had run away together to never come back. Although no trace of either was ever found, Laso was arrested and convicted for the murders after he was caught faking evidence intended to make people believe that the victims were alive. It is suspected that the bodies were buried in a land plot owned by Laso at the time, which was later expropriated to build a road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/sociedad/2016/12/04/5841e29622601d00668b45a2.html|title=Sin cad\u00e1ver... s\u00ed hay delito|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cataluna/2014/10/16/543fad76e2704e70458b4575.html|title=El jurado popular declara culpable Ram\u00f3n Laso de doble asesinado|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catalunyapress.es/texto-diario/mostrar/470217/supremo-ratifica-sentencia-30-anos-doble-homicidio-ramon-laso|title=El Supremo ratifica la sentencia de 30 a\u00f1os por el doble homicidio de Ram\u00f3n Laso|first=|last=CatalunyaPress.es|publisher=}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==United Kingdom==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Victim(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Convicted\n! scope=\"col\" | Location\n! scope=\"col\" | Disappeared\n! scope=\"col\" | Conviction date\n! scope=\"col\" | Description\n|-\n| [[The Campden Wonder|William Harrison]]\n| John, Richard, and Joan Perry\n| [[Chipping Campden]], [[England]]\n| August 16, 1660\n| Spring 1661\n| A wealthy 70-year-old man last seen walking to Charingworth.
