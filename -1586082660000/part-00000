However, the use of a Labradoodle as a guide/service dog was not common until 1989, when Australian breeder Wally Conron introduced the cross-breed to the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia in Victoria. Conron hoped that the combination of the low-shedding coat of the poodle, along with the gentleness and trainability of a Labrador retriever, would provide a [[guide dog]] suitable for people with allergies to fur and [[dander]].<ref name=\"hotdog\" /><ref>{{cite web |date=2008-01-01 |url=http://animal-world.com/dogs/Mixed-Dog-Breeds/Labradoodle.php |title=Labradoodle |publisher=Animal World |access-date=2008-10-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213015958/http://animal-world.com/dogs/Mixed-Dog-Breeds/Labradoodle.php |archive-date=13 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |author=Conron, Wally |date=10 July 2007 |url=http://www.readersdigest.com.au/article/16022%26pageno%3D1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314061218/http://www.readersdigest.com.au/article/16022%26pageno%3D1 |archive-date=2012-03-14 |department=My Story |title=I designed a dog |magazine=Reader's Digest |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSultan, a dog from this litter, displayed all the qualities Conron was seeking and worked as a guide dog for a woman in Hawaii for ten years.<ref name=\"hotdog\" />\n\nConron has since repeatedly stated he regrets initiating the fashion for this type of crossbreed and maintains it caused \"a lot of damage\" together with \"a lot of problems\".

The first crossing of a poodle with a Labrador does result in variations in terms of appearance, size, coat and temperament. So while most Labradoodles share some common traits, their appearance and behavioral characteristics can be widely variable.<ref name=\"hotdog\" /> The variation mostly applies to early-generation Labrador-poodle crosses, and not to multigeneration Labradoodles or Australian Labradoodles: Once a Labrador-poodle cross has been selectively bred to other Labradoodles for 4&nbsp;generations or more, then there is much greater consistency for all the selected aspects.{{citation needed|date=September 2019|reason=I am worried this claim is stronger than it should be.

Some breeders prefer to restrict breeding to produce [[F1 hybrid]]s (bred from a poodle and Labrador rather than, e.g. F2 hybrids bred from two Labradoodles) to ensure relatively uniform genetics among the Labradoodles, while maximizing [[genetic diversity]] of individual dogs to avoid inherited health problems that have plagued some inbred dog breeds.\n\nA large number of Labradoodle and Australian Labradoodle breeders who are ethical and well regarded, were previously breeders of purebred dogs. For many of these breeders, the inherent concerns with health and temperament for dogs who are being produced through repeated and more closely inbreeding and line-breeding led them to the Labradoodle or Australian Labradoodle.

Conron hoped that the combination of the low-shedding coat of the poodle, along with the gentleness and trainability of a Labrador retriever, would provide a [[guide dog]] suitable for people with allergies to fur and [[dander]].<ref name=\"hotdog\" /><ref>{{cite web |date=2008-01-01 |url=http://animal-world.com/dogs/Mixed-Dog-Breeds/Labradoodle.php |title=Labradoodle |publisher=Animal World |access-date=2008-10-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213015958/http://animal-world.com/dogs/Mixed-Dog-Breeds/Labradoodle.php |archive-date=13 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |author=Conron, Wally |date=10 July 2007 |url=http://www.readersdigest.com.au/article/16022%26pageno%3D1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314061218/http://www.readersdigest.com.au/article/16022%26pageno%3D1 |archive-date=2012-03-14 |department=My Story |title=I designed a dog |magazine=Reader's Digest |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSultan, a dog from this litter, displayed all the qualities Conron was seeking and worked as a guide dog for a woman in Hawaii for ten years.<ref name=\"hotdog\" />\n\nConron has since repeatedly stated he regrets initiating the fashion for this type of crossbreed and maintains it caused \"a lot of damage\" together with \"a lot of problems\". He also felt he was to blame for \"creating a [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]\", adding that problems were being bred into the dogs rather than breeding away from problems. He is further quoted as claiming: \"For every perfect one, you're going to find a lot of crazy ones.\"<ref name=OurDogs>{{cite magazine |title=Inventor of the Labradoodle speaks out |url=https://www.ourdogs.co.uk/News/2014/News140214/newsindex140214.htm |accessdate=13 February 2014 |magazine=Our Dogs |date=14 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150515213351/http://www.ourdogs.co.uk/News/2014/News140214/newsindex140214.htm |archivedate=15 May 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Mr.&nbsp;Conron was referring to the craze he initiated of multiple types of \"designer\" dogs being developed as copy-cats to the Labradoodle. There was a flurry of activity to breed virtually every breed to a poodle to create a new type of \"-doodle\" almost monthly in the beginning.\n\n===Follow-on guide-dog breeding programs===\nCurrently, as with other crossbreeds, Labradoodles are not considered a [[breed]] by any major kennel club associations in North America. However, there are reputable organizations breeders can join if they qualify and follow the breed standard, regulations and ethical requirements. ALAA and ALCA are the two major organizations for Australian Labradoodles.\n\nGuide Dogs Victoria no longer breeds Labradoodles,<ref name=\"hotdog\" /> however, they are bred by other guide and assistance dog organizations in Australia and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guidedogswa.com.au/resources/Wickham_Press-Release_Sep-2010.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706104513/http://www.guidedogswa.com.au/resources/Wickham_Press-Release_Sep-2010.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-06 |title=A guide dog with a difference |publisher=Association for the Blind of Western Australia |agency=Guide Dogs Western Australia |date=2010-09-07 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Association for the Blind of Western Australia has introduced Labradoodles into their training program, and their first, Jonnie, graduated in November 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guidedogswa.com.au/articles/latest-news/busselton-guide-dog-graduation |title=Busselton guide dog graduation |publisher=Association for the Blind of Western Australia |agency=Guide Dogs Western Australia |website=guidedogswa.com.au |access-date=2012-12-18 |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217091124/http://www.guidedogswa.com.au/articles/latest-news/busselton-guide-dog-graduation |archive-date=17 February 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guidedogswa.com.au/resources/Jonnie-Training-Press-Release-final_Sep-2010.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706104529/http://www.guidedogswa.com.au/resources/Jonnie-Training-Press-Release-final_Sep-2010.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-06 |title=New dog in town |publisher=Association for the Blind of Western Australia |agency=Guide Dogs Western Australia |date=2010-09-02 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Labradoodles are now widely used around the world as [[guide dog|guide]], [[Assistance dog|assistance]], and [[therapy dog]]s<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/local/display.var.2347446.0.colchester_more_than_puppy_love.php |title=Colchester: More than puppy love! |newspaper=Gazette-News |location=England, UK |date=2008-06-17 |access-date=2012-12-18 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Altonn, Helen |date=2004-06-28 |url=http://starbulletin.com/2004/06/28/news/story6.html |newspaper=Star-Bulletin |location=Honolulu, Hawaii |title=What do you get when you breed Labradors with poodles? |access-date=2012-12-18 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> as well as being popular family dogs.<ref name=\"hotdog\" />\n\n===Emerging breed standard and family dogs===\nLabradoodles are, as mentioned, a poodle and a Labrador retriever.

The first crossing of a poodle with a Labrador does result in variations in terms of appearance, size, coat and temperament. So while most Labradoodles share some common traits, their appearance and behavioral characteristics can be widely variable.<ref name=\"hotdog\" /> The variation mostly applies to early-generation Labrador-poodle crosses, and not to multigeneration Labradoodles or Australian Labradoodles: Once a Labrador-poodle cross has been selectively bred to other Labradoodles for 4&nbsp;generations or more, then there is much greater consistency for all the selected aspects.{{citation needed|date=September 2019|reason=I am worried this claim is stronger than it should be.

''Wool'' coats have tight curls, and similar in appearance to that of a poodle, but with a softer texture. ''Fleece'' coats are soft and free-flowing, with a kinked or wavy appearance. ''Hair'' coats can be curly, straight or wavy, but are more similar in texture to a Labrador's coat.</ref><ref name=\"hotdog\" /> Some Labradoodles do shed, although the coat usually sheds less and has less \"[[dog odor]]\" than that of a [[Labrador retriever]].<ref name=\"hotdog\" />  Regular haircuts, bathing and brushing are necessary to maintaining a healthy coat.\n\n[[File:Labradoodle Flowers.jpg|left|thumb|Labradoodle among Tulips]]\nLabradoodles often display an affinity for water and strong swimming ability from their parent breeds.<ref name=\"hotdog\" /> Like most Labrador retrievers and poodles, Labradoodles are generally friendly, energetic, and good with families and children.<ref name=\"hotdog\" /> Their parent breeds are both among the world's most intelligent dog breeds, in which the poodle is believed to be among the smartest (second, after the [[border collie]]).<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Coren |year=1994 |title=The Intelligence of Dogs |publisher=New York Free Press |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.petmedsonline.org/top-10-smartest-dogs-in-the-world.html |access-date=2008-10-16 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n[[Image:Labradoodle Assistance Dogs.jpg|thumb|left|A group of labradoodle Assistance Dogs.]]\n===Breeding line issues===\nThere is no consensus as to whether breeders should aim to have Labradoodles recognized as a breed. Some breeders prefer to restrict breeding to produce [[F1 hybrid]]s (bred from a poodle and Labrador rather than, e.g. F2 hybrids bred from two Labradoodles) to ensure relatively uniform genetics among the Labradoodles, while maximizing [[genetic diversity]] of individual dogs to avoid inherited health problems that have plagued some inbred dog breeds.\n\nA large number of Labradoodle and Australian Labradoodle breeders who are ethical and well regarded, were previously breeders of purebred dogs. For many of these breeders, the inherent concerns with health and temperament for dogs who are being produced through repeated and more closely inbreeding and line-breeding led them to the Labradoodle or Australian Labradoodle. The ALAA maintains an open stud book whereas the ALCA maintains a closed stud book.\n\n[[Image:Jonnie, the first Labradoodle Guide Dog in WA, Nov 2010.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jonnie, the first Labradoodle guide dog to graduate from Association for the Blind of Western Australia.]]\nOthers are breeding Labradoodle to Labradoodle over successive generations, and trying to establish a new dog breed.

Infusions occur with early generation breedings. Multigeneration breedings do not use any breed other than Australian Labradoodle to Australian Labradoodle. Australian Labradoodles also generally have poodles and Labradors in their pedigrees that come from European lines, whereas other Labradoodle lines tend to rely heavily on American stock.
