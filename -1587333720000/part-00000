The original format of four teenagers and their dog(s) solving faux-supernatural mysteries for a half-hour was eschewed for simpler, more comedic adventures which involved real supernatural villains (the villains in previous ''Scooby'' episodes were almost always regular humans in disguise).\nScrappy remained an integral part of the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise, on both TV and in ''Scooby''-related licensed products and merchandising, through the end of the 1980s.\n\n===Criticism===\nScrappy was initially seen as a \"good idea\" by ''Saturday Morning Review''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.unz.com/print/SaturdayRev-1979nov24-00024 |title = Publication|website=Unz.com}}</ref> Though he did have his critics, he was a well loved character who showed up on merchandise and reruns, but in later years, the presence of Scrappy-Doo has been criticized as on the various ''Scooby-Doo'' series of the 1980s.

However, it is clear from later articles that Gen-Xers did have a bone to pick with Scrappy, whose main source of ire was the unconfirmed yet long held belief that Scrappy was the direct cause of radically changing the format. It is unknown where this rumor originated from, though the earliest example of it in circulation is in Jim Corkis and John Cawley's ''Encyclopedia of Cartoon Superstars,'' where Cawley states, \"However, the addition of Scrappy eliminated the majority of the regular cast.\" Cawley, when questioned on this statement responded, \"And as for fluctuation of the mystery inc, it was often done just to 'freshen' the series and make it look new. It's why some series had real monsters... and some didn't. You might say they just kept 're-booting' the show as time went on.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nWhen Archie gained the rights to Hanna-Barbera in 1995, both Bill Vallely and Mike Kirschenbaum, two writers for the series, both acknowledged that Scrappy was hated, and even attempted to remake his personality in response to that, according to Kirschenbaum, but \"the animosity was too great\" and Scrappy got the boot from the series midway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/6868ad9063791da843a132b136615d7f/tumblr_inline_ps4lkzvA2R1vygboo_540.png|format=JPG|title=Photographic image of messaging|website=66.media.tumblr.com|accessdate=August 27, 2019}}<</ref> After [[Archie Comics]] concluded as a series, DC Comics picked up rights and produced ''Scooby-Doo'' for some time after that, and, possibly taking their cue from Archie, continued with Scrappy being gone.\n\n==Cartoon Network==\n[[Cartoon Network]] gained the rights to Scooby around 1995 and promptly set about making it its most shown franchise via reruns of various series.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.inthe90s.com/saturdays.shtml | title=Saturday Morning TV Schedules of the 90s|website=Inthe90s.com}}</ref> Scooby, which had been dormant for the last few years aside from comics, soon became quite heavily rerun over the place.<ref>https://totally-90s.com/scooby-doo/</ref> Cartoon Network's goal was to appeal to the nostalgia of the older fans, as it was documented that a third of their audience was 'old enough to vote'.<ref>https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1994-12-28-1994362168-story.html</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Jon Hein published his Jump the Shark website, a site dedicated to complaining about unwelcome changes to beloved shows, the very thing that Scrappy was blamed for. Scrappy was entered in on the Scooby-Doo section and was voted as the top JTS cause by approximately 1500 people. His website gained newspaper coverage by Maureen Dowd, in September 1998, who published an opinion article entitled \"Scrappy-Doo Spoiled Scooby-Doo\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12102393/longview_newsjournal/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607005552/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12102393/longview_newsjournal/ |archive-date=June 7, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> though Scrappy actually featured very little in the article and said article was written with a political punchline in mind, word picked up and Jump the Shark (and Scrappy's presence in it) were soon republished from 1998 to 2001 in newspapers across the country under various titles, some of which included Scrappy and some of which did not.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12102240/wow_the_internet_really_was_different/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607003500/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12102240/wow_the_internet_really_was_different/ |archive-date=June 7, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAt midnight, of October 31, 1999, Cartoon Network aired several promos over the gang's disappearance.

It was around this time that Cartoon Network began showing the first negative appearances of Scrappy in the form of promos.\n\nIn 2002, Cartoon Network aired a bumper titled \"Scrappy Loses It\" where Scrappy rants about how the newer [[Cartoon Cartoons]] were becoming more popular than him despite him being around longer, to the point where he yells at [[Dexter's Laboratory|Dexter]] and makes him cry. The bumper ends with Scrappy saying \"Not for me, not for me, man!\" in response to Cartoon Network's then-current slogan, \"The Best Place for Cartoons\".{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Character biography==\n{{original research|section|date=February 2020}}\nScrappy has a contradicted origin. Originally as shown in the introduction of the series, Scrappy only met his Uncle Scooby as a puppy. However, the December 1980 episode of ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1980 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' (\"Scrappy's Birthday\") depicts Scrappy-Doo's birth with both Scooby and Shaggy in attendance. Born at St. Bernard's Hospital to Scooby-Doo's sister Ruby-Doo on December 20, 1980, Scrappy went on to grow up in New York. Some time after this, Scrappy was sent to live with Scooby on the road for unknown reasons. Scrappy idolizes his uncle Scooby and would often assist Scooby and his friends in solving mysteries (Scrappy saves Scooby several times from monsters when they were looking for the rest of the gang). \nIn ''[[Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School]]'', and ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Reluctant Werewolf|Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf]]'', Scrappy is more toned down, as he is less feisty and a little more cowardly, but still much braver than Scooby and Shaggy. In all three movies, he sometimes serves as the brains of the trio, figuring out the clues and where to go next.\n\n===Personality and Characteristics===\nFrom his very first appearance, Scrappy has shown himself to be as reckless and daring as his Uncle Scooby is timid. Scrappy displays little concern for his own safety - he'll think nothing of charging into a confrontation with anything up to and including an elephant stampede - yet he is also very protective of the Mystery Incorporated gang (particularly his uncle) and sticks up for them relentlessly. \n\nScrappy's greatest weakness - unrecognized by himself - is a lack of discretion, which tends to counteract his valor. Being more zealous than clever, he'll often rush ahead of his Mystery Inc. associates to apprehend the first suspect he encounters - who seldom turns out to be the one they're looking for. (Once, in San Francisco, Scrappy mistakenly picked up and brought back [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] - his own mistress - thinking she was a vampire they were hunting!) More than anything else, Scrappy requires guidance in much the same way that Shaggy and Scooby require motivation. \n\nIf his courageous and energetic personality wasn't enough to make him stand out, Scrappy could be identified by a handful of [[catchphrase]]s; two of the better-known were, \"Lemme at 'em, lemme at 'em! I'll splat 'em! I'll rock 'em and sock 'em!\" and, \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Ta dadada ta daaa]]! Puppy power!\". Scrappy also possessed strength which belied his diminutive stature; he was capable of smashing down solid rock walls, and of carrying bulky loads over his head with no apparent effort. \n\nAs befitting the light-hearted tone of the series, Scrappy was upbeat by nature and rarely sad, but not without a sensitive side which he shared with his Mystery Incorporated caretakers. In later episodes, Scrappy became more reserved and better at finding clues...opting to ask questions first and shoot later, as it were. However, his feisty and adventurous streak continued to shine through - especially in the proverbial crunch.\n\n===Voices===\n* [[Lennie Weinrib]] (1979\u20131980)\n* [[Don Messick]] (1980\u20131988)\n* [[Scott Innes]] (2002)\n* [[J.P.

While in a bar reminiscing, Velma tells another patron that the gang kicked Scrappy out of their ranks because he peed on Daphne and demanded to be the new leader. Velma also claims that Scrappy was not really a puppy but rather had a glandular disorder. In the course of the film, it is revealed that he is seeking to summon a demon army that he can use to rule the world, with the ritual requiring him to absorb a purely good soul to unleash the full power of his army, with Scrappy selecting Scooby as the final sacrifice. However, his ego causes him to call in the rest of the Mystery Inc. crew to witness his triumph despite them having gone their separate ways two years ago, with the gang rallying to defeat Scrappy's plan and save Scooby by disrupting the ritual. At the conclusion of the film, Velma says that Scrappy's full name is Scrappy Cornelius Doo.{{pb}}Interestingly, Scrappy was not the villain in an earlier draft around March 2000 (that role went to Don Knotts) and the first hint of his involvement in the plot at all didn't come until a month later, an interview with [[James Gunn]] in April 2000. Other original ideas for the villain included the Old Man Smithers, the villain from the beginning of the film. According to the DVD commentary, choosing the villain of the movie was a problematic part of production, as the makers did not feel comfortable simply giving the role to an \"anonymous monster\", and that the ending was in \"bits and pieces\" and the \"confinements forced them to be creative.\" The ultimate decision to have the villain be Scrappy was embraced by the writer of the script, James Gunn, the screenwriter for the first 2002 feature film, who has stated numerous times that he loathes the character. \"There is a Scrappy, because he exists in the cartoon, so we have to acknowledge him.\" He said in an interview shortly prior to the release of [[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]. He also said on Scrappy, \"I hate Scrappy's guts. We all hate Scrappy's guts.

As with all the previous and current direct-to-video movies, Scrappy never made an appearance.\n* In ''An Evening with the Scooby Gang'', a bonus feature on the ''[[Aloha, Scooby-Doo!]]'' DVD, Fred mentions a sixth member of the gang, to the gang's shock and dismay. Shaggy mentions they were not supposed to talk about Scrappy. Freddy was talking about the Mystery Machine.\n* In the 2011 ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode \"The Siren's Song\", Fred and Daphne come across a statue of Scrappy in the Crystal Cove Haunted Museum among the statues of their defeated foes. Daphne remarks she has never seen his statue before. Fred pulls her away and reminds her that they all promised never to speak of him again, once again a reference to his unpopularity, along with the fact that he had not appeared in any Scooby-Doo cartoons or films in the latest decades as a consequence of it. Scrappy also appeared with a statue of [[List of Scooby-Doo characters#Flim Flam|Flim Flam]].\n* Scrappy made a quick \"[[Easter egg (media)|Easter Egg]]\" appearance in the \"Scoobynatural\" episode of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''.\n* Scrappy was part of the storyline in [[DC Comics]] [[Scooby Apocalypse]]. However, this was in-name-only.\n* In the 2019 film ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Curse of the 13th Ghost]]'', which concludes \"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo\" series; but despite his actual involvement of the show, Scrappy's entire presence was absent in the film, even within the opening credit recap montage at the start of the movie. Near the climax of the movie, Flim Flam makes a comment about Scrappy, to which Velma responds with \"What's a Scrappy?\"\n\n==Appearances in other media==\n{{trivia|section|date=February 2020}}\n{{original research|section|date=February 2020}}\nScrappy appears in ''[[Hanna-Barbera's 50th: A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration|A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration]]'' as a respected part of the large family of classic Hanna-Barbera characters. He is the only Scooby member besides Shaggy and Scooby but does not have any lines.\n\nScrappy-Doo appeared in a few ''[[Cartoon Network]]'' commercial bumpers, reflecting his fall in popularity. One such has him loitering outside Cartoon Network's main office, ranting about how the other CN cartoon characters are getting better treatment than him, despite his having been created long before them. The bumper ends with Scrappy responding to the network's tagline (\"The best place for cartoons\") with \"Not for me! Not for me, man!\" Shaggy appears in the bumper.\n\nAnother one had him and [[List of Scooby-Doo characters#Flim Flam|Flim Flam]] standing alone in the rain and getting splashed by mud by passing traffic, ending with the pair dejectedly slinking off.\n\nScrappy-Doo is a recurring gag in ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]''. He first appears at the end of \"Shaggy Busted\" to utter his catchphrase, only to be cut-off halfway when Avenger grabs Scrappy in his talons. From then on, Scrappy's corpse appears in various episodes, usually being carried around by Avenger.\n\nIn another he appears in a locker room with Astro from ''[[The Jetsons]]'', [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]], [[Courage the Cowardly Dog]] and [[Droopy]] complaining about how [[Scooby-Doo (character)|his uncle]] gets more fame than any of them. Daphne and Scooby appear in the bumper.\n\nHe appears in the \"Laff-A-Munich\" skit in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"[[Robot Chicken (season 3)|Ban on the Fun]]\". In the skit, Scrappy is kicked into a lake by [[Blue Falcon]].\n\nHe also appears in the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode \"[[Lost in Parking Space, Part Two]]\", wherein he and several other cartoon characters are brutally tortured.\n\nIn the ''[[Family Guy]]'' movie ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', [[Chris Griffin]] was required by his mother, [[Lois Griffin]], to mention the fourth member of ''[[Sex and the City]]'', he could not come up with the correct answer, he instead took a wild and very inaccurate guess by saying it was Scrappy-Doo. In the episode \"[[Meg Stinks!]]\", [[Brian Griffin]] is forced to sleep outside (due to getting sprayed by a skunk) and states his nephew Scrappy Brian did not even make it through the night. It then cuts to a scene depicting a puppy resembling Brian, who inquires about a noise in the bushes, Brian would rather ignore it, but Scrappy Brian shouts Scrappy-Doo's catchphrase, \"Let me at 'em\", and charges and is eaten by a [[velociraptor]]. Brian notes he told his sister, \"This was not a good weekend\". On the soundtrack album, ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'', [[Jason Alexander]] reports that Scrappy is the product of a drunken encounter between Scooby-Doo and Daphne.\n\nIn October of the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, he was made the King of Boomerroyalty in which each weekend despite being infamous, the channel \"Boomerang\" showed 2-hour installments of ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' and ''[[The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show]]'' all month.\n\nIn the series finale of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' \"Mitefall!\", [[Bat-Mite]] attempts to get the show cancelled and introduces a thinly-veiled analogy to Scrappy in Punchichi, the nephew of [[Ace the Bat-Hound]]. Scrappy had been added for opposite reasons.\n\nDuring one of ''Cartoon Network's'' commercials promoting its 20th anniversary [[Bugs Bunny]] was taking a group photo of various cartoon characters, with Scrappy-Doo being among them. Before the picture was taken, [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] from ''[[Adventure Time]]'' elongated his body to push Scrappy out of the picture to which Scrappy says \"Hey!\" in frustration and has the last line in the commercial.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cartoon|Television|United States}}\n* [[Characters of The Brady Bunch#Cousin Oliver|Cousin Oliver]]\n* [[Jar-Jar Binks]]\n* [[Jumping the Shark]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.newsfromme.com/writings/scrappy-days/ \"Scrappy Days\"], [[Mark Evanier]]'s recollections of the creation of Scrappy-Doo\n* [http://www.erictb.info/scrappy.html The Scooby Story: The Facts on Scrappy]\n\n{{Scooby-Doo}}\n{{Hanna-Barbera}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional dogs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic dogs]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Ohio]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1979]]\n[[Category:Fictional amateur detectives]]\n[[Category:Child characters in television]]\n[[Category:Comedy film characters]]\n[[Category:Scooby-Doo characters]]\n[[Category:Hanna-Barbera characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2016}}\n{{Unreliable sources|date=July 2016}}}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Scrappy Doo\n| series             = [[Scooby-Doo]]\n| franchise          = \n| image              = Scrappy-doo.png\n| alt                = \n| caption            = \n| first_major        = \n| first_minor        = \n| first_issue        = \n| first_date         = \n| last_major         = \n| last_minor         = \n| last_issue         = \n| last_date          = \n| first              = \"The Scarab Lives!\" (''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' episode, 1979)\n| firstgame          = \n| last               = \n| creator            = \n| adapted_by         = \n| portrayer          = \n| voice              = [[Lennie Weinrib]] (1979\u20131980) <br />[[Don Messick]] (1980\u20131996) <br />[[Scott Innes]] (2000\u2013present) <br />[[J.

However, it is clear from later articles that Gen-Xers did have a bone to pick with Scrappy, whose main source of ire was the unconfirmed yet long held belief that Scrappy was the direct cause of radically changing the format. It is unknown where this rumor originated from, though the earliest example of it in circulation is in Jim Corkis and John Cawley's ''Encyclopedia of Cartoon Superstars,'' where Cawley states, \"However, the addition of Scrappy eliminated the majority of the regular cast.\" Cawley, when questioned on this statement responded, \"And as for fluctuation of the mystery inc, it was often done just to 'freshen' the series and make it look new. It's why some series had real monsters... and some didn't.

Scrappy was entered in on the Scooby-Doo section and was voted as the top JTS cause by approximately 1500 people.

It was around this time that Cartoon Network began showing the first negative appearances of Scrappy in the form of promos.\n\nIn 2002, Cartoon Network aired a bumper titled \"Scrappy Loses It\" where Scrappy rants about how the newer [[Cartoon Cartoons]] were becoming more popular than him despite him being around longer, to the point where he yells at [[Dexter's Laboratory|Dexter]] and makes him cry. The bumper ends with Scrappy saying \"Not for me, not for me, man!\" in response to Cartoon Network's then-current slogan, \"The Best Place for Cartoons\".{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Character biography==\n{{original research|section|date=February 2020}}\nScrappy has a contradicted origin. Originally as shown in the introduction of the series, Scrappy only met his Uncle Scooby as a puppy. However, the December 1980 episode of ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1980 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' (\"Scrappy's Birthday\") depicts Scrappy-Doo's birth with both Scooby and Shaggy in attendance. Born at St. Bernard's Hospital to Scooby-Doo's sister Ruby-Doo on December 20, 1980, Scrappy went on to grow up in New York. Some time after this, Scrappy was sent to live with Scooby on the road for unknown reasons. Scrappy idolizes his uncle Scooby and would often assist Scooby and his friends in solving mysteries (Scrappy saves Scooby several times from monsters when they were looking for the rest of the gang). \nIn ''[[Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School]]'', and ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Reluctant Werewolf|Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf]]'', Scrappy is more toned down, as he is less feisty and a little more cowardly, but still much braver than Scooby and Shaggy. In all three movies, he sometimes serves as the brains of the trio, figuring out the clues and where to go next.\n\n===Personality and Characteristics===\nFrom his very first appearance, Scrappy has shown himself to be as reckless and daring as his Uncle Scooby is timid. Scrappy displays little concern for his own safety - he'll think nothing of charging into a confrontation with anything up to and including an elephant stampede - yet he is also very protective of the Mystery Incorporated gang (particularly his uncle) and sticks up for them relentlessly. \n\nScrappy's greatest weakness - unrecognized by himself - is a lack of discretion which tends to counteract his valor. Being more zealous than clever, he'll often rush ahead of his Mystery Inc. associates to apprehend the first suspect he encounters - who seldom turns out to be the one they're looking for. (Once, in San Francisco, Scrappy mistakenly picked up and brought back [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] - his own mistress - thinking she was a vampire they were hunting!) More than anything else, Scrappy requires guidance in much the same way that Shaggy and Scooby require motivation. \n\nIf his courageous and energetic personality wasn't enough to make him stand out, Scrappy could be identified by a handful of [[catchphrase]]s; two of the better-known were, \"Lemme at 'em, lemme at 'em! I'll splat 'em! I'll rock 'em and sock 'em!\" and, \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Ta dadada ta daaa]]! Puppy power!\". Scrappy also possessed strength which belied his diminutive stature; he was capable of smashing down solid rock walls, and of carrying bulky loads over his head with no apparent effort. \n\nAs befitting the light-hearted tone of the series, Scrappy was upbeat by nature and rarely sad, but not without a sensitive side which he shared with his Mystery Incorporated caretakers. In later episodes, Scrappy became more reserved and better at finding clues...opting to ask questions first and shoot later, as it were. However, his feisty and adventurous streak continued to shine through - especially in the proverbial crunch.\n\n===Voices===\n* [[Lennie Weinrib]] (1979\u20131980)\n* [[Don Messick]] (1980\u20131988)\n* [[Scott Innes]] (2002)\n* [[J.P.

While in a bar reminiscing, Velma tells another patron that the gang kicked Scrappy out of their ranks because he peed on Daphne and demanded to be the new leader. Velma also claims that Scrappy was not really a puppy but rather had a glandular disorder. In the course of the film, it is revealed that he is seeking to summon a demon army that he can use to rule the world, with the ritual requiring him to absorb a purely good soul to unleash the full power of his army, with Scrappy selecting Scooby as the final sacrifice. However, his ego causes him to call in the rest of the Mystery Inc. crew to witness his triumph despite them having gone their separate ways two years ago, with the gang rallying to defeat Scrappy's plan and save Scooby by disrupting the ritual. At the conclusion of the film, Velma says that Scrappy's full name is Scrappy Cornelius Doo.{{pb}}Interestingly, Scrappy was not the villain in an earlier draft around March 2000 (that role went to Don Knotts) and the first hint of his involvement in the plot at all didn't come until a month later, an interview with [[James Gunn]] in April 2000. Other original ideas for the villain included the Old Man Smithers, the villain from the beginning of the film. According to the DVD commentary, choosing the villain of the movie was a problematic part of production, as the makers did not feel comfortable simply giving the role to an \"anonymous monster\", and that the ending was in \"bits and pieces\" and the \"confinements forced them to be creative.\" The ultimate decision to have the villain be Scrappy was embraced by the writer of the script, James Gunn, the screenwriter for the first 2002 feature film, who has stated numerous times that he loathes the character. \"There is a Scrappy, because he exists in the cartoon, so we have to acknowledge him.\" He said in an interview shortly prior to the release of [[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]. He also said on Scrappy, \"I hate Scrappy's guts. We all hate Scrappy's guts.

As with all the previous and current direct-to-video movies, Scrappy never made an appearance.\n* In ''An Evening with the Scooby Gang'', a bonus feature on the ''[[Aloha, Scooby-Doo!]]'' DVD, Fred mentions a sixth member of the gang, to the gang's shock and dismay. Shaggy mentions they were not supposed to talk about Scrappy. Freddy was talking about the Mystery Machine.\n* In the 2011 ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode \"The Siren's Song\", Fred and Daphne come across a statue of Scrappy in the Crystal Cove Haunted Museum among the statues of their defeated foes. Daphne remarks she has never seen his statue before. Fred pulls her away and reminds her that they all promised never to speak of him again, once again a reference to his unpopularity, along with the fact that he had not appeared in any Scooby-Doo cartoons or films in the latest decades as a consequence of it. Scrappy also appeared with a statue of [[List of Scooby-Doo characters#Flim Flam|Flim Flam]].\n* Scrappy made a quick \"[[Easter egg (media)|Easter Egg]]\" appearance in the \"Scoobynatural\" episode of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''.\n* Scrappy was part of the storyline in [[DC Comics]] [[Scooby Apocalypse]]. However, this was in-name-only.\n* In the 2019 film ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Curse of the 13th Ghost]]'', which concludes \"The 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo\" series; but despite his actual involvement of the show, Scrappy's entire presence was absent in the film, even within the opening credit recap montage at the start of the movie. Near the climax of the movie, Flim Flam makes a comment about Scrappy, to which Velma responds with \"What's a Scrappy?\"\n\n==Appearances in other media==\n{{trivia|section|date=February 2020}}\n{{original research|section|date=February 2020}}\nScrappy appears in ''[[Hanna-Barbera's 50th: A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration|A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration]]'' as a respected part of the large family of classic Hanna-Barbera characters. He is the only Scooby member besides Shaggy and Scooby but does not have any lines.\n\nScrappy-Doo appeared in a few ''[[Cartoon Network]]'' commercial bumpers, reflecting his fall in popularity. One such has him loitering outside Cartoon Network's main office, ranting about how the other CN cartoon characters are getting better treatment than him, despite his having been created long before them. The bumper ends with Scrappy responding to the network's tagline (\"The best place for cartoons\") with \"Not for me! Not for me, man!\" Shaggy appears in the bumper.\n\nAnother one had him and [[List of Scooby-Doo characters#Flim Flam|Flim Flam]] standing alone in the rain and getting splashed by mud by passing traffic, ending with the pair dejectedly slinking off.\n\nScrappy-Doo is a recurring gag in ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]''. He first appears at the end of \"Shaggy Busted\" to utter his catchphrase, only to be cut-off halfway when Avenger grabs Scrappy in his talons. From then on, Scrappy's corpse appears in various episodes, usually being carried around by Avenger.\n\nIn another he appears in a locker room with Astro from ''[[The Jetsons]]'', [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]], [[Courage the Cowardly Dog]] and [[Droopy]] complaining about how [[Scooby-Doo (character)|his uncle]] gets more fame than any of them. Daphne and Scooby appear in the bumper.\n\nHe appears in the \"Laff-A-Munich\" skit in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"[[Robot Chicken (season 3)|Ban on the Fun]]\". In the skit, Scrappy is kicked into a lake by [[Blue Falcon]].\n\nHe also appears in the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode \"[[Lost in Parking Space, Part Two]]\", wherein he and several other cartoon characters are brutally tortured.\n\nIn the ''[[Family Guy]]'' movie ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', [[Chris Griffin]] was required by his mother, [[Lois Griffin]], to mention the fourth member of ''[[Sex and the City]]'', he could not come up with the correct answer, he instead took a wild and very inaccurate guess by saying it was Scrappy-Doo. In the episode \"[[Meg Stinks!]]\", [[Brian Griffin]] is forced to sleep outside (due to getting sprayed by a skunk) and states his nephew Scrappy Brian did not even make it through the night. It then cuts to a scene depicting a puppy resembling Brian, who inquires about a noise in the bushes, Brian would rather ignore it, but Scrappy Brian shouts Scrappy-Doo's catchphrase, \"Let me at 'em\", and charges and is eaten by a [[velociraptor]]. Brian notes he told his sister, \"This was not a good weekend\". On the soundtrack album, ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'', [[Jason Alexander]] reports that Scrappy is the product of a drunken encounter between Scooby-Doo and Daphne.\n\nIn October of the years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, he was made the King of Boomerroyalty in which each weekend despite being infamous, the channel \"Boomerang\" showed 2-hour installments of ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' and ''[[The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show]]'' all month.\n\nIn the series finale of ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' \"Mitefall!\", [[Bat-Mite]] attempts to get the show cancelled and introduces a thinly-veiled analogy to Scrappy in Punchichi, the nephew of [[Ace the Bat-Hound]]. Scrappy had been added for opposite reasons.\n\nDuring one of ''Cartoon Network's'' commercials promoting its 20th anniversary [[Bugs Bunny]] was taking a group photo of various cartoon characters, with Scrappy-Doo being among them. Before the picture was taken, [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] from ''[[Adventure Time]]'' elongated his body to push Scrappy out of the picture to which Scrappy says \"Hey!\" in frustration and has the last line in the commercial.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cartoon|Television|United States}}\n* [[Characters of The Brady Bunch#Cousin Oliver|Cousin Oliver]]\n* [[Jar-Jar Binks]]\n* [[Jumping the Shark]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.newsfromme.com/writings/scrappy-days/ \"Scrappy Days\"], [[Mark Evanier]]'s recollections of the creation of Scrappy-Doo\n* [http://www.erictb.info/scrappy.html The Scooby Story: The Facts on Scrappy]\n\n{{Scooby-Doo}}\n{{Hanna-Barbera}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional dogs]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic dogs]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Ohio]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1979]]\n[[Category:Fictional amateur detectives]]\n[[Category:Child characters in television]]\n[[Category:Comedy film characters]]\n[[Category:Scooby-Doo characters]]\n[[Category:Hanna-Barbera characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Male film villains]]\n", "name_user": "Khaosjr", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePersonality and Characteristics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrappy-Doo"}

As a result, a few years after his first contract with King Khaled, Hariri had become a multi-billionaire.\n\n{{Politics of Lebanon}}\nHaving accumulated his wealth, Hariri started a number of philanthropic projects, including the building of educational facilities in Lebanon. His first initiative in Lebanon was the Islamic Association for Culture and Education, which he founded in 1979.<ref name=mermay>{{cite journal|title=Lebanon's Politics: The Sunni Community and Hariri's Future Current|journal=[[Middle East Report]]|date=26 May 2010|issue=96|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Iraq%20Syria%20Lebanon/Lebanon/96%20Lebanons%20Politics%20-%20The%20Sunni%20Community%20and%20Hariris%20Future%20Current.ashx|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> The association was later renamed the Hariri Foundation.<ref name=mermay/> Hariri became progressively more embroiled in politics. His appeals to the United Nations and services as an emissary to the Saudi Royal family won him international recognition on the political stage for his humanitarian efforts.\n\nIn 1982, Hariri donated $12 million to Lebanese victims of the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict]] and helped clean up Beirut's streets with his company's money and contributed to early reconstruction efforts during lulls in the Lebanon war. Said to have heavily financed opposing militias during the war, his former deputy [[Najah Wakim]] later accused him of helping to destroy downtown Beirut in order to rebuild it again and make billions of dollars in the process.<ref name=gary2001july/> After the conflict, he acted as an envoy of the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]] to Lebanon. He laid the groundwork that led to the 1989 [[Taif Accord]], which Saudi Arabia organised to bring the warring factions together. Taif put an end to the [[Lebanese civil war|civil war]], building goodwill for Hariri politically. While acting as the Saudi envoy to Lebanon, he spent more time in Damascus than in Beirut where he ingratiated himself with the [[Assad regime]]; he had a new presidential palace built in Damascus as a gift to the Syrian dictator but Assad didn't use it personally.<ref name=gary2001july/>\n\n==Political career==\nHariri returned to Lebanon in the early 1980s as a wealthy man and began to build a name for himself by making large donations and contributions to various groups in Lebanon. However, he continued to serve as a political advisor to [[Prince Bandar bin Sultan]] in 1983.<ref name=saad9july>{{cite news|last=Mehio|first=Saad|title=Prime Minister Alwaleed bin Talal?

Perhaps Hariri's most important creation in the beginning of his career was \"Horizon 2000\" the government's name for its new rejuvenation plan. A large component of \"Horizon 2000\" was [[Solidere]], the privately owned<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |title=''About Solidere'' |publisher=Solidere.com |accessdate=4 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116054209/http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> construction company that was established to reconstruct post-war Lebanon. Solidere was owned by the government and private investors. Solidere was largely focused on redeveloping Beirut's downtown and turning it into a new urban center as quickly as possible as one aspect of the various infrastructure redevelopment plans that would be implemented by \"Horizon 2000\". Another aspect of the decade-long plan was the privatization of major industries. Numerous contracts were awarded in important industries such as energy, telecommunications, electricity, airports and roads.\n\nThe last and perhaps most significant aspect of \"Horizon 2000\" was economic stimulus via foreign direct investment. Specifically, Hariri supported foreign firms and individuals taking an interest in Lebanon's developmental potential. Hariri simplified tax codes and provided tax breaks to foreign investors. Due to his previous successes in the private sector and the numerous resulting international connections, Hariri was able to garner a significant amount of low-interest loans from foreign investors. Hariri also pursued aggressive macroeconomic policy such as maintaining strict regulations on bank reserves and inter-bank interest rates to curb inflation and raise the value of the Lebanese pound relative to the dollar.\n\nHariri's economic policies were a remarkable success during his first year in office. From 1992 to 1993 there was a 6 percent increase in real national income, the capital base of commercial banks effectively doubled, the budgetary earnings hovered at around a billion dollars, and commercial banks\u2019 consolidated balance sheets increased about 25%. By 1998, however, real GDP growth was around 1%, a year later it would be -1%, national debt had skyrocketed 540% from two to eighteen billion dollars, Lebanon's economy was in a miserable state.\n\n=== Hariri and Lebanon's political environment ===\n[[Image:Rafik_Hariri_George_W._Bush.jpg|thumb|left|[[George W.

The Company for the Development and Reconstruction of Beirut's Central District, known as [[Solidere]], in which Hariri is the primary shareholder, expropriated most property in the [[Beirut Central District|central business district]] of Beirut, compensating each owner with shares in the company which were worth as little as 15% of the property's value.

In order to secure support from militia chieftains, and pro-Syrian ideologues that Damascus had installed in the government, Hariri allowed kickbacks from public spending to enrich all major government figures.

Hariri is widely credited with his role in constructing the [[Taif Agreement]] that ended the 15 year [[Lebanese Civil War]] and reconstructing the capital [[Beirut]]. He was the first post-civil war Prime Minister and the most influential and wealthiest Lebanese politician until his assassination. \n\n<!-- Assassination -->\nHariri was assassinated on 14 February 2005 by a suicide truck bomb in Beirut. Four Hezbollah members were indicted for the assassination and are currently being tried ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]], but others have linked the assassination to the [[Syria]]n government.\n\n<!-- Consequences -->\n[[Assassination of Rafic Hariri|Hariri's assassination]] was a catalyst for dramatic political change in Lebanon. The massive protests of the [[Cedar Revolution]] helped achieve the withdrawal of Syrian troops and security forces from Lebanon, and a change in governments.\n\n==Early life and education==\nHariri was born on 1 November 1944 to a modest [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]] family in the Lebanese port city of [[Sidon]].

He then went in business with the French construction firm Oger for the construction of a hotel in [[Ta\u2019if]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the timely construction of which earned praise from [[King Khaled]]. Hariri took over Oger, forming [[Saudi Oger]], which became the main construction firm used by the [[Saudi Royal family]] for all their important developments. As a result, a few years after his first contract with King Khaled, Hariri had become a multi-billionaire.\n\n{{Politics of Lebanon}}\nHaving accumulated his wealth, Hariri started a number of philanthropic projects, including the building of educational facilities in Lebanon. His first initiative in Lebanon was the Islamic Association for Culture and Education, which he founded in 1979.<ref name=mermay>{{cite journal|title=Lebanon's Politics: The Sunni Community and Hariri's Future Current|journal=[[Middle East Report]]|date=26 May 2010|issue=96|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Iraq%20Syria%20Lebanon/Lebanon/96%20Lebanons%20Politics%20-%20The%20Sunni%20Community%20and%20Hariris%20Future%20Current.ashx|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref> The association was later renamed the Hariri Foundation.<ref name=mermay/> Hariri became progressively more embroiled in politics. His appeals to the United Nations and services as an emissary to the Saudi Royal family won him international recognition on the political stage for his humanitarian efforts.\n\nIn 1982, Hariri donated $12 million to Lebanese victims of the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict]] and helped clean up Beirut's streets with his company's money and contributed to early reconstruction efforts during lulls in the Lebanon war.

He laid the groundwork that led to the 1989 [[Taif Accord]], which Saudi Arabia organised to bring the warring factions together. Taif put an end to the [[Lebanese civil war|civil war]], building goodwill for Hariri politically. While acting as the Saudi envoy to Lebanon, he spent more time in Damascus than in Beirut where he ingratiated himself with the [[Assad regime]]; he had a new presidential palace built in Damascus as a gift to the Syrian dictator but Assad didn't use it personally.<ref name=gary2001july/>\n\n==Political career==\nHariri returned to Lebanon in the early 1980s as a wealthy man and began to build a name for himself by making large donations and contributions to various groups in Lebanon.

Perhaps Hariri's most important creation in the beginning of his career was \"Horizon 2000\" the government's name for its new rejuvenation plan. A large component of \"Horizon 2000\" was [[Solidere]], the privately owned<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |title=''About Solidere'' |publisher=Solidere.com |accessdate=4 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116054209/http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> construction company that was established to reconstruct post-war Lebanon. Solidere was owned by the government and private investors. Solidere was largely focused on redeveloping Beirut's downtown and turning it into a new urban center as quickly as possible as one aspect of the various infrastructure redevelopment plans that would be implemented by \"Horizon 2000\". Another aspect of the decade-long plan was the privatization of major industries. Numerous contracts were awarded in important industries such as energy, telecommunications, electricity, airports and roads.\n\nThe last and perhaps most significant aspect of \"Horizon 2000\" was economic stimulus via foreign direct investment. Specifically, Hariri supported foreign firms and individuals taking an interest in Lebanon's developmental potential. Hariri simplified tax codes and provided tax breaks to foreign investors. Due to his previous successes in the private sector and the numerous resulting international connections, Hariri was able to garner a significant amount of low-interest loans from foreign investors. Hariri also pursued aggressive macroeconomic policy such as maintaining strict regulations on bank reserves and inter-bank interest rates to curb inflation and raise the value of the Lebanese pound relative to the dollar.\n\nHariri's economic policies were a remarkable success during his first year in office. From 1992 to 1993 there was a 6 percent increase in real national income, the capital base of commercial banks effectively doubled, the budgetary earnings hovered at around a billion dollars, and commercial banks\u2019 consolidated balance sheets increased about 25%. By 1998, however, real GDP growth was around 1%, a year later it would be -1%, national debt had skyrocketed 540% from two to eighteen billion dollars, Lebanon's economy was in a miserable state.\n\n=== Hariri and Lebanon's political environment ===\n[[Image:Rafik_Hariri_George_W._Bush.jpg|thumb|left|[[George W.

In order to secure support from militia chieftains, and pro-Syrian ideologues that Damascus had installed in the government, Hariri allowed kickbacks from public spending to enrich all major government figures.

{"title_page": "Bardic name", "text_new": "A '''bardic name''' ({{Lang-cy|enw barddol}}, {{Lang-kw|hanow bardhek}}) is a [[pseudonym]] used in [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], or [[Brittany]] by [[poet]]s and other artists, especially those involved in the [[eisteddfod]] movement.\n\nThe [[Welsh language|Welsh]] term '''bardd''' (\"poet\") originally referred to the Welsh poets of the [[Middle Ages]], who might be itinerant or attached to a noble household. Some of these medieval poets were known by a pseudonym, for eisteddfod whale birch harrow example [[Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr]] (\"Cynddelw the Master Poet\"), fl. 1155\u20131200 and [[Iolo Goch]] (\"Iolo the Red\"), c. 1320 \u2013 c. 1398. The practice seems to have very ancient antecedents, as in the names of the presumably 6th century poets [[Talhaearn Tad Awen]], [[Blwchfardd]] and [[Culfardd]], mentioned by the Welsh historian [[Nennius]] alongside [[Taliesin]] and [[Aneirin]], the last referred to as ''Aneurin Gwenithwawd'' (\"Aneurin of the Corn Poetry\").\n\nThe revival of bardic names became something of a conceit following the reinvention of medieval tradition by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in the 18th century. The usage has also extended to [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] poetry.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/ztbk87h BBC iWonder - \"Druids, bards and rituals: What is an Eisteddfod?\"]. Accessed 7 October 2015</ref> In Cornwall, some of the pioneers of the [[Cornish language]] movement are referred to by their bardic names, e.g. \"Mordon\" for [[Robert Morton Nance]], and \"Talek\" for [[E. G. Retallack Hooper]].<ref>[http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/archives/newbards/bardlist.htm List of new Cornish bards / bardic names] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119161350/http://www.gorsethkernow.org.uk/english/archives/newbards/bardlist.htm |date=19 November 2007 }}</ref>\n\nMany surnames in Wales derive from [[patronymics]] rather than, for instance, places of origin. Many people therefore share a limited number of surnames, and many people can share even the full name, so it was common practice to add a nickname to distinguish between people with similar names. For some people, this might be a reference to their occupation within the village, but for those with a literary reputation, whose name would be known across the land, it was common practice to take, or be awarded, a [[sobriquet]].\n\nFor example, [[John Jones (Talhaiarn)]] took his bardic name from his place of origin, to distinguish him from contemporaries with the name [[John Jones (disambiguation)|John Jones]]. The minister [[Joseph Harris (Gomer)]] selected his bardic name from the Bible.

Some of these medieval poets were known by a pseudonym, for example [[Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr]] (\"Cynddelw the Master Poet\"), fl. 1155\u20131200 and [[Iolo Goch]] (\"Iolo the Red\"), c. 1320 \u2013 c. 1398. The practice seems to have very ancient antecedents, as in the names of the presumably 6th century poets [[Talhaearn Tad Awen]], [[Blwchfardd]] and [[Culfardd]], mentioned by the Welsh historian [[Nennius]] alongside [[Taliesin]] and [[Aneirin]], the last referred to as ''Aneurin Gwenithwawd'' (\"Aneurin of the Corn Poetry\").\n\nThe revival of bardic names became something of a conceit following the reinvention of medieval tradition by [[Iolo Morganwg]] in the 18th century. The usage has also extended to [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] poetry.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/ztbk87h BBC iWonder - \"Druids, bards and rituals: What is an Eisteddfod?\"]. Accessed 7 October 2015</ref> In Cornwall, some of the pioneers of the [[Cornish language]] movement are referred to by their bardic names, e.g. \"Mordon\" for [[Robert Morton Nance]], and \"Talek\" for [[E.

Many people therefore share a limited number of surnames, and many people can share even the full name, so it was common practice to add a nickname to distinguish between people with similar names. For some people, this might be a reference to their occupation within the village, but for those with a literary reputation, whose name would be known across the land, it was common practice to take, or be awarded, a [[sobriquet]].\n\nFor example, [[John Jones (Talhaiarn)]] took his bardic name from his place of origin, to distinguish him from contemporaries with the name [[John Jones (disambiguation)|John Jones]]. The minister [[Joseph Harris (Gomer)]] selected his bardic name from the Bible. Others, such as [[Hedd Wyn]], used poetic inventions.\n\nThe name could be a [[nom de plume]] but it could also be an accolade.

This has displaced thousands of poor families who owned their Bajaaj for basic livelihood, education for their children, and support extended to families. These families worked twenty-four hours a day...families with three to four adults, including women, who take shifts to meet their basic needs. Now, similar to what the New York City taxi service offered prior to Uber and Lyft, where drivers had to drive eight hours to pay the daily fee for renting a taxi, Hormuud charges these families \u2153 of their income for driving their Bajaaj.  Hormuud has taken over almost every sector of the economy, and in doing so destroyed the livelihood of millions of poor families.\n\n===Milk===\nHormuud has taken over poor families' market for selling milk from their 1-2 goats or cows. Hormuud works with local governments to put undue restrictions on these families. Families gave up and must sell their milk to Hormuud who then sells in the markets. This is increasing extreme poverty in Somalia.\n\n===Tri-Band 3G===\nIn December 2012, Hormuud launched its Tri-Band [[3G]] service for mobile and internet clients.
