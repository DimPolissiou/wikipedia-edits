NSB took delivery of the class to replace the aging [[NSB Di 3|Di 3]], and the units have been used on freight trains on un-electrified lines, including the [[Nordland Line]] and the [[R\u00f8ros Line]]. They were transferred to [[CargoNet]] in 2002, when NSB's cargo division was demerged. Ten units were sold to [[GB Railfreight]] in 2011 and are used at the Scunthorpe Steel works in Scunthorpe, United Kingdom.\n\n==History==\nDuring the late 1980s, the Norwegian State Railways sought a new locomotive type to replace its aging fleet of Di 3 diesel-electric locomotives, which made up the back-bone of the dieselized operations. The new locomotives were planned for use as freight and passenger trains on the Nordland Line, and to a lesser extent on the R\u00f8ros Line.<ref name=n138>N\u00e6ss: 138</ref> In 1980, NSB had taken delivery of five [[NSB Di 4|Di&nbsp;4]] from [[Henschel]].<ref>N\u00e6ss: 72</ref> Originally there were plans to order additional Di 4 units, but this was discarded and instead a new class was pursued,<ref name=n100>N\u00e6ss: 100</ref> as NSB wanted similar, but slightly more modern, locomotives.<ref name=n138 />\n\n[[File:CargoNet Di 8 hauling freight tain on Nordlandsbanen.jpg|thumb|left|Twin Di 8 unit hauling a [[CargoNet]] freight train across [[Saltfjellet]] on the [[Nordland Line]]]]\nA MaK-built [[DB Class 240]] locomotive was test-run in Norway during 1990.<ref name=kiel>{{cite web |url=http://www.loks-aus-kiel.de/index.php?nav=1400710&lang=1 |title=MaK - Di 6 f\u00fcr die NSB |editor1=Patrick B\u00f6ttger |editor2=Patrick Paulsen |editor3=Andreas Kabelitz |editor4=Malte Werning |publisher=Loks-aus-Kiel |accessdate=16 January 2012 |language=German }}</ref> On 23 November 1992, NSB's board decided to order ten similar units, later expanded to twelve, which would primarily be used in passenger trains.

The Di 8 operated in pairs, which proved to be an optimal power ratio and driving times on the Nordland Line. On the other hand, the locomotives had high operating costs, in part because of the twin configuration, and proved less reliable than NSB had hoped.<ref name=lokman>{{cite web |url=http://www.lokmann.no/lt/2005/1005diesel.htm |title=Nye diessellokomotivier |year=2005 |work=Lokotivmands Tidende |last=Sv\u00e4rd |first=\u00d8yvind |publisher=[[National Union of Norwegian Locomotivemen]] |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nNo. 714 was plagued with operational problems because of errors in a generator.

The fire fighting was complicated by the train dispatcher not wanting to disconnect the overhead wire power as he thought it was an electric train.

NSB took delivery of the class to replace the aging [[NSB Di 3|Di 3]], and the units have been used on freight trains on un-electrified lines, including the [[Nordland Line]] and the [[R\u00f8ros Line]]. They were transferred to [[CargoNet]] in 2002, when NSB's cargo division was demerged. Ten units were sold to [[GB Railfreight]] in 2011 and are used at the Scunthorpe Steel works in Scunthorpe, United Kingdom.\n\n==History==\nDuring the late 1980s, the Norwegian State Railways sought a new locomotive type to replace its aging fleet of Di 3 diesel-electric locomotives, which made up the back-bone of the dieselized operations. The new locomotives were planned for use as freight and passenger trains on the Nordland Line, and to a lesser extent on the R\u00f8ros Line.<ref name=n138>N\u00e6ss: 138</ref> In 1980, NSB had taken delivery of five [[NSB Di 4|Di&nbsp;4]] from [[Henschel]].<ref>N\u00e6ss: 72</ref> Originally there were plans to order additional Di 4 units, but this was discarded and instead a new class was pursued,<ref name=n100>N\u00e6ss: 100</ref> as NSB wanted similar, but slightly more modern, locomotives.<ref name=n138 />\n\n[[File:CargoNet Di 8 hauling freight tain on Nordlandsbanen.jpg|thumb|left|Twin Di 8 unit hauling a [[CargoNet]] freight train across [[Saltfjellet]] on the [[Nordland Line]]]]\nA MaK-built [[DB Class 240]] locomotive was test-run in Norway during 1990.<ref name=kiel>{{cite web |url=http://www.loks-aus-kiel.de/index.php?nav=1400710&lang=1 |title=MaK - Di 6 f\u00fcr die NSB |editor1=Patrick B\u00f6ttger |editor2=Patrick Paulsen |editor3=Andreas Kabelitz |editor4=Malte Werning |publisher=Loks-aus-Kiel |accessdate=16 January 2012 |language=German }}</ref> On 23 November 1992, NSB's board decided to order ten similar units, later expanded to twelve, which would primarily be used in passenger trains.

NSB's need for hauling power was dire enough that the company leased two locomotives of two classes of diesel-electric locomotives, the [[SJ T44]] from the [[Swedish State Railways]] and the MaK-built NS 6400 from  [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]].<ref name=\"loks\"/>\n\nThe NS 6400 was built through a cooperation between MaK and [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] in [[Mannheim]], with 120 units having been built between 1988 and 1992.<ref name=ns>{{cite web |url=http://www.loks-aus-kiel.de/index.php?nav=1400707 |title=MaK - DE 6400 f\u00fcr die Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) |editor1=Patrick B\u00f6ttger |editor2=Patrick Paulsen |editor3=Andreas Kabelitz |editor4=Malte Werning |publisher=Loks-aus-Kiel |accessdate=14 March 2014 |language=German}}</ref> It was again based on the DE 1002, which had been built in twenty-four copies for the [[H\u00e4fen und G\u00fcterverkehr K\u00f6ln]] 1982 and 1993.<ref name=koln>{{cite web |url=http://www.loks-aus-kiel.de/index.php?nav=1400727 |title=MaK - DE 1002 |editor1=Patrick B\u00f6ttger |editor2=Patrick Paulsen |editor3=Andreas Kabelitz |editor4=Malte Werning |publisher=Loks-aus-Kiel |accessdate=14 March 2014 |language=German}}</ref> Another variant of the DE 1002 and NS 6400 is the [[Eurotunnel Class 0001]], built in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.loks-aus-kiel.de/index.php?nav=1400729 |title=MaK - DE 1004 |editor1=Patrick B\u00f6ttger |editor2=Patrick Paulsen |editor3=Andreas Kabelitz |editor4=Malte Werning |publisher=Loks-aus-Kiel |accessdate=14 March 2014 |language=German}}</ref> The Di 8 was technically similar, although slightly larger and more powerful, than the Dutch and German variants.<ref name=\"loks\"/>\n\nDelivery of both the Di 6 and 8 commenced in 1996.<ref name=n100 /> The first Di 8 was delivered on 8 June 1996 and the last on 10 June 1997.<ref name=loks />  NSB hoped that the combined 32 locos would be sufficient to replace all the Di 3s. However, the Di 8s were at first put into use on freight trains in [[Eastern Norway]], largely running on electrified lines and thus not replacing the Di 3. Unlike their larger counterparts, which were unsuitable for service and returned to the manufacturer, the Di 8 proved a sufficiently reliable to remain in operation.<ref name=n100 /> The Di 8s were gradually introduced on the Nordland Line and [[Mer\u00e5ker Line]] to replace the Di 3 on freight trains. The Di 8 operated in pairs, which proved to be an optimal power ratio and driving times on the Nordland Line. On the other hand, the locomotives had high operating costs, in part because of the twin configuration, and proved less reliable than NSB had hoped.<ref name=lokman>{{cite web |url=http://www.lokmann.no/lt/2005/1005diesel.htm |title=Nye diessellokomotivier |year=2005 |work=Lokotivmands Tidende |last=Sv\u00e4rd |first=\u00d8yvind |publisher=[[National Union of Norwegian Locomotivemen]] |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nNo. 714 was plagued with operational problems because of errors in a generator.

The fire started in an electrical cabinet after a diesel pipe running over it had cracked. The fire fighting was complicated by the train dispatcher not wanting to disconnect the overhead wire power as he thought it was an electric train. The damages were so severe that the locomotive was scrapped. The [[Accident Investigation Board Norway]] criticized CargoNet for not having sufficient maintenance routines for diesel pipes, as they were neither part of the maintenance procedure nor where there specified intervals for replacement.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Darlig-vedlikehold-kan-ha-fort-til-brann-6798244.html |title=D\u00e5rlig vedlikehold kan ha f\u00f8rt til brann |last=Holm |first=Per Annar |date=2 April 2012 |archivedate=5 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405040751/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Darlig-vedlikehold-kan-ha-fort-til-brann-6798244.html |accessdate=8 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the delivery of the Class 66 and later the [[Vossloh Euro]], CargoNet's need for the uneconomical and underdimensioned Di 8 fell through.

He is also known today for his setting of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], ''Missa Per arma justitiae''.\n\n==Life==\nProbably a native of [[Beverley]] in Yorkshire, Merbecke appears to have been a [[boy soprano|boy chorister]] at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], and was employed as an organist there from about 1541. Two years later he was convicted with [[Windsor Martyrs|four others]] of heresy and sentenced to be [[execution by burning|burnt at the stake]], but received a pardon owing to the intervention of [[Stephen Gardiner]], [[Bishop of Winchester]],<ref name=BRH8>{{cite book |title=Berkshire in the Reign of Henry VIII |last=Ford |first=David Nash |year=2009 |publisher=Nash Ford Publishing |location=Wokingham |url=http://www.nashfordpublishing.co.uk}}</ref> who said he was \"but a musitian\". An English [[Concordance of the Bible]] which Merbecke had been preparing at the suggestion of [[Richard Turner (reformer)|Richard Turner]], was however confiscated and destroyed. A later version of this work, the first of its kind in English, was published in 1550 with a dedication to [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]].\n\nIn the same year, Merbecke published his ''Booke of Common Praier Noted'', intended to provide for musical uniformity in the use of the [[Book of Common Prayer (1549)|First Prayer Book]] of Edward VI. This set the liturgy to semi-rhythmical melodies partly adapted from [[Gregorian chant]]; it was rendered obsolete when the Prayer Book was revised in 1552. Merbecke wrote several devotional and controversial works of a strongly [[Calvinist]]ic character, and a number of his musical compositions are preserved in manuscript in the [[British Library]], and at [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]. He died, probably while still organist at Windsor, about 1585.\n\nHis son, [[Roger Marbeck]] (1536\u20131605), was a noted classical scholar and physician.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn the first half of the 19th century, the [[Oxford Movement]] inspired renewed interest in liturgical music within the [[Church of England]]. [[John Jebb (priest)|John Jebb]] first drew attention to Merbecke's Prayer Book settings in 1841. In 1843, William Dyce published [[plainsong]] music for all the Anglican services, which included nearly all of Merbecke's settings, adapted for the 1662 edition of the Book of Common Prayer then in use. During the latter half of the 19th century, many different editions of Merbecke's settings were published, especially for the [[Communion service]], with arrangements by noted musicians such as Sir [[John Stainer]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] and [[Basil Harwood]], Merbecke's Communion setting was very widely sung by choirs and congregations throughout the [[Anglican Communion]] until the 1662 Book of Common Prayer began to be supplanted by more modern liturgy in the late 20th century.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ezVH2h6PKUcC&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=book+of+common+prayer+1662+Merbecke&source=bl&ots=NRzlmV7ZIB&sig=mf7_evEoKu0MyT-Ai6mesbwJTm0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=19lxUPS2MvKb1AXj44HADQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=book%20of%20common%20prayer%201662%20Merbecke&f=false Charles Hefling and Cynthia Shattuck (editors), ''The Oxford Guide to The Book of Common Prayer: A Worldwide Survey'', Oxford University Press 1988], {{ISBN|978-0-19-529756-0}} (pp.42\u201343)</ref> Parts of his service, notably the Nicene Creed, have been adapted to \"modern\" wording.

Akbar succeeded his father, [[Humayun]], under a regent, [[Bairam Khan]], who helped the young emperor expand and consolidate Mughal domains in India.\n\nA strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the [[Mughal Empire]] to include much of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. His power and influence, however, extended over the entire subcontinent because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar strove to unite far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through an [[Indo-Persian culture]], to himself as an emperor.\n\nMughal India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to commercial expansion and greater patronage of culture. Akbar himself was a patron of art and culture. He was fond of literature, and created a library of over 24,000 volumes written in [[Sanskrit]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], staffed by many scholars, translators, artists, [[calligraphers]], scribes, bookbinders and readers. He did much of the cataloging himself through three main groupings.<ref name=\"Murray, Stuart 2009\">Murray, Stuart. 2009. The library: an illustrated history. Chicago, ALA Editions</ref> Akbar also established the library of Fatehpur Sikri exclusively for women,{{sfn|Wiegand|Davis, Jr.|1994|p=273}} and he decreed that schools for the education of both Muslims and Hindus should be established throughout the realm. He also encouraged bookbinding to become a high art.<ref name=\"Murray, Stuart 2009\"/> Holy men of many faiths, poets, architects, and artisans adorned his court from all over the world for study and discussion. Akbar's courts at [[Delhi]], [[Agra]], and [[Fatehpur Sikri]] became centres of the arts, letters, and learning. Perso-Islamic culture began to merge and blend with indigenous Indian elements, and a distinct Indo-Persian culture emerged characterized by Mughal style arts, [[Mughal painting|painting]], and [[Mughal architecture|architecture]]. Disillusioned with orthodox Islam and perhaps hoping to bring about religious unity within his empire, Akbar promulgated [[Din-i-Ilahi]], a syncretic creed derived mainly from [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]] as well as some parts of [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Christianity]].\n\nAkbar's reign significantly influenced the course of Indian history. During his rule, the Mughal Empire tripled in size and wealth. He created a powerful military system and instituted effective political and social reforms. By abolishing the [[Jizya|sectarian tax]] on non-Muslims and appointing them to high civil and military posts, he was the first Mughal ruler to win the trust and loyalty of the native subjects. He had [[Sanskrit literature]] translated, participated in native festivals, realising that a stable empire depended on the co-operation and good-will of his subjects. Thus, the foundations for a multicultural empire under Mughal rule were laid during his reign. Akbar was succeeded as emperor by his son, Prince Salim, later known as [[Jahangir]].\n\n==Early years==\nDefeated in battles at [[Chausa]] and [[Kannauj]] in 1539 to 1541 by the forces of [[Sher Shah Suri]], Mughal emperor [[Humayun]] fled westward to [[Sindh]].<ref name=\"Multiple5\">{{cite book|author=Banjerji, S.K.|title=Humayun Badshah|url=https://archive.org/details/humayunbadshah035068mbp|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1938}}</ref> There he met and married the then 14-year-old [[Hamida Banu Begum]], daughter of Shaikh Ali Akbar Jami, a [[Persians|Persian]] teacher of Humayun's younger brother [[Hindal Mirza]].

No imperial power in India based on the Indo-Gangetic plains could be secure if a rival centre of power existed on its flank in Rajputana.<ref name=\"Chandra\"/> The Mughals had already established domination over parts of northern Rajputana in [[Mewar|Mewat]], [[Ajmer]], and Nagor.<ref name=\"Richards2\"/><ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> Now, Akbar was determined to drive into the heartlands of the [[Rajput]] kings that had never previously submitted to the Muslim rulers of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Beginning in 1561, the Mughals actively engaged the Rajputs in warfare and diplomacy.<ref name=\"Richards4\"/> Most Rajput states accepted Akbar's suzerainty; the rulers of Mewar and Marwar, [[Udai Singh II|Udai Singh]] and [[Chandrasen Rathore]], however, remained outside the imperial fold.<ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> Rana Udai Singh was descended from the Sisodia ruler, [[Rana Sanga]], who had died fighting Babur at the [[Battle of Khanwa]] in 1527.<ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> As the head of the Sisodia clan, he possessed the highest ritual status of all the Rajput kings and chieftains in India. Unless Udai Singh was reduced to submission, the imperial authority of the Mughals would be lessened in Rajput eyes.<ref name=\"Eraly2\"/> Furthermore, Akbar, at this early period, was still enthusiastically devoted to the cause of Islam and sought to impress the superiority of his faith over the most prestigious warriors in Brahminical Hinduism.<ref name=\"Eraly2\"/>\n\nIn 1567, Akbar moved to reduce the [[Chittor Fort]] in Mewar. The fortress-capital of Mewar was of great strategic importance as it lay on the shortest route from Agra to [[Gujarat Sultanate|Gujarat]] and was also considered a key to holding the interior parts of Rajputana.

Moreover, Akbar had received invitations from cliques in Gujarat to oust the reigning king, which served as justification for his military expedition.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> In 1572, he moved to occupy [[Ahmedabad]], the capital, and other northern cities, and was proclaimed the lawful sovereign of Gujarat. By 1573, he had driven out the Mirzas who, after offering token resistance, fled for refuge in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. [[Surat]], the commercial capital of the region and other coastal cities soon capitulated to the Mughals.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> The king, [[Muzaffar Shah III]], was caught hiding in a corn field; he was pensioned off by Akbar with a small allowance.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/>\n\nHaving established his authority over Gujarat, Akbar returned to Fatehpur Sikiri, where he built the [[Buland Darwaza]] to commemorate his victories, but a rebellion by Afghan nobles supported by the Rajput ruler of [[Idar]], and the renewed intrigues of the Mirzas forced his return to Gujarat.<ref name=\"Richards5\"/> Akbar crossed the Rajputana and reached Ahmedabad in eleven days \u2013 a journey that normally took six weeks. The outnumbered Mughal army then won a decisive victory on 2 September 1573. Akbar slew the rebel leaders and erected a tower out of their severed heads.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> The conquest and subjugation of Gujarat proved highly profitable for the Mughals; the territory yielded a revenue of more than five million rupees annually to Akbar's treasury, after expenses.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/>\n\nAkbar had now defeated most of the Afghan remnants in India. The only centre of Afghan power was now in Bengal, where Sulaiman Khan Karrani, an Afghan chieftain whose family had served under Sher Shah Suri, was reigning in power.

The Mughal army was subsequently victorious at the [[Battle of Tukaroi]] in 1575, which led to the annexation of Bengal and parts of Bihar that had been under the dominion of Daud Khan. Only [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] was left in the hands of the [[Karrani dynasty]] as a fief of the Mughal Empire. A year later, however, Daud Khan rebelled and attempted to regain Bengal. He was defeated by the Mughal general, [[Khan Jahan I|Khan Jahan Quli]], and had to flee into exile. Daud Khan was later captured and executed by Mughal forces.

He did not leave Fatehpur Sikri on a military campaign until 1581, when Punjab was again invaded by his brother, Mirza Muhammad Hakim.<ref name=\"Eraly5\"/> Akbar expelled his brother to Kabul and this time pressed on, determined to end the threat from Muhammad Hakim once and for all.<ref name=\"Eraly5\"/> In contrast to the problem that his predecessors once had in getting Mughal nobles to stay on in India, the problem now was to get them to leave India.<ref name=\"Eraly5\"/> They were, according to Abul Fazl \"afraid of the cold of Afghanistan.\"<ref name=\"Eraly5\"/> The Hindu officers, in turn, were additionally inhibited by the traditional taboo against crossing the Indus.

However, this placed hardship on the peasantry because tax rates were fixed on the basis of prices prevailing in the imperial court, which were often higher than those in the countryside.<ref>{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=233}}</ref> Akbar changed to a decentralised system of annual assessment, but this resulted in corruption among local officials and was abandoned in 1580, to be replaced by a system called the ''{{transl|bn|dahsala}}''.<ref name=\"dahsala\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=234}}</ref> Under the new system, revenue was calculated as one-third of the average produce of the previous ten years, to be paid to the state in cash. This system was later refined, taking into account local prices, and grouping areas with similar productivity into assessment circles. Remission was given to peasants when the harvest failed during times of flood or drought.<ref name=\"dahsala\"/> Akbar's ''{{transl|bn|dahsala}}'' system (also known as ''{{transl|bn|zabti}})'' is credited to [[Raja Todar Mal]], who also served as a revenue officer under Sher Shah Suri,<ref name=\"Chandra 2007 236\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=236}}</ref> and the structure of the revenue administration was set out by the latter in a detailed memorandum submitted to the emperor in 1582\u201383.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|p=160}}</ref>\n\nOther local methods of assessment continued in some areas. Land which was fallow or uncultivated was charged at concessional rates.<ref name=\"localassessment\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=235}}</ref> Akbar also actively encouraged the improvement and extension of agriculture. The village continued to remain the primary unit of revenue assessment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|pp=164\u2013165}}</ref> [[Zamindar]]s of every area were required to provide loans and agricultural implements in times of need, to encourage farmers to plough as much land as possible and to sow seeds of superior quality. In turn, the zamindars were given a hereditary right to collect a share of the produce. Peasants had a hereditary right to cultivate the land as long as they paid the land revenue.<ref name=\"localassessment\"/> While the revenue assessment system showed concern for the small peasantry, it also maintained a level of distrust towards the revenue officials. Revenue officials were guaranteed only three-quarters of their salary, with the remaining quarter dependent on their full realisation of the revenue assessed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|p=165}}</ref>\n\n===Military organization===\n{{Main|Mansabdari}}\n[[File:The Adventures of Akbar artillery.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mughal Army]] [[artillery]] men during the reign of Akbar]]\n\nAkbar organised his army as well as the nobility by means of a system called the ''mansabdari''. Under this system, each officer in the army was assigned a rank (a ''mansabdar''), and assigned a number of [[cavalry]] that he had to supply to the imperial army.<ref name=\"Chandra 2007 236\"/> The ''mansabdars'' were divided into 33 classes. The top three commanding ranks, ranging from 7000 to 10000 troops, were normally reserved for princes. Other ranks between 10 and 5000 were assigned to other members of the nobility. The empire's permanent [[standing army]] was quite small and the imperial forces mostly consisted of contingents maintained by the ''mansabdars''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=359}}</ref> Persons were normally appointed to a low ''mansab'' and then promoted, based on their merit as well as the favour of the emperor.<ref name=\"mansabdari\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=238}}</ref> Each ''mansabdar'' was required to maintain a certain number of cavalrymen and twice that number of horses. The number of horses was greater because they had to be rested and rapidly replaced in times of war. Akbar employed strict measures to ensure that the quality of the armed forces was maintained at a high level; horses were regularly inspected and only [[Arabian horse]]s were normally employed.<ref>{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=237}}</ref> The ''mansabdars'' were remunerated well for their services and constituted the highest paid military service in the world at the time.<ref name=\"mansabdari\"/>\n\n===Capital===\n[[File:Audienzhalle.jpg|thumb|''Diwan-i-Khas'' (Hall of Private Audience) in Fatehpur Sikri]]\n\nAkbar was a follower of [[Salim Chishti]], a [[Asceticism|holy man]] who lived in the region of Sikri near Agra. Believing the area to be a lucky one for himself, he had a mosque constructed there for the use of the priest. Subsequently, he celebrated the victories over Chittor and Ranthambore by laying the foundation of a new walled capital, {{convert|23|mi|km}} west of Agra in 1569, which was named Fatehpur (\"''town of victory''\") after the conquest of Gujarat in 1573 and subsequently came to be known as [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in order to distinguish it from other similarly named towns.<ref name=\"earlyconquest\"/> Palaces for each of Akbar's senior queens, a huge artificial lake, and sumptuous water-filled courtyards were built there. However, the city was soon abandoned and the capital was moved to [[Lahore]] in 1585. The reason may have been that the water supply in Fatehpur Sikri was insufficient or of poor quality. Or, as some historians believe, Akbar had to attend to the northwest areas of his empire and therefore moved his capital northwest. Other sources indicate Akbar simply lost interest in the city<ref>Petersen, A. (1996). ''Dictionary of Islamic Architecture''. New York: Routledge.</ref> or realised it was not militarily defensible. In 1599, Akbar shifted his capital back to Agra from where he reigned until his death.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Trade===\nThe reign of Akbar was characterised by commercial expansion.<ref name=\"Economy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_17.html#n10|title=Economic and Social Developments under the Mughals|publisher=columbia.edu |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref> The Mughal government encouraged traders, provided protection and security for transactions, and levied a very low custom duty to stimulate foreign trade. Furthermore, it strived to foster a climate conductive to commerce by requiring local administrators to provide restitution to traders for goods stolen while in their territory. To minimise such incidents, bands of highway police called ''{{transl|bn|rahdars}}'' were enlisted to patrol roads and ensure safety of traders. Other active measures taken included the construction and protection of routes of commerce and communications.<ref name=\"Levi\">{{Cite book\n| publisher = Brill\n| page = 39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qVkNBge8mIC&pg=PA39#v=onepage|isbn=978-90-04-12320-5\n| last =  Levi\n| first =  S.

The coins of Akbar set a new chapter in India's numismatic history.<ref>Mughals coins, https://www.indian-coins.com/joomla/index.php/coins-catalogue/akbar-coins</ref> The coins of Akbar's grandfather, Babur, and father, Humayun, are basic and devoid of any innovation as the former was busy establishing the foundations of the Mughal rule in India while the latter was ousted by the Afghan, Sher Shah Suri, and returned to the throne only to die a year later. While the reign of both Babur and Humayun represented turmoil, Akbar's relative long reign of 50 years allowed him to experiment with coinage.\n\nAkbar introduced coins with decorative floral motifs, dotted borders, quatrefoil and other types. His coins were both round and square in shape with a unique 'mehrab' (lozenge) shape coin highlighting numismatic calligraphy at its best.<ref>Coins of Akbar, https://www.mintageworld.com/blog/coins-of-akbar/</ref> Akbar's portrait type gold coin (Mohur) is generally attributed to his son, Prince Salim (later Emperor Jahangir), who had rebelled and then sought reconciliation thereafter by minting and presenting his father with gold Mohur's bearing Akbar's portrait. The tolerant view of Akbar is represented by the 'Ram-Sita' silver coin type while during the latter part of Akbar's reign, we see coins portraying the concept of Akbar's newly promoted religion 'Din-e-ilahi' with the Ilahi type and Jalla Jalal-Hu type coins.\n\nThe coins,<ref>Mughal Empire coins and Rulers, http://www.chiefacoins.com/Database/Countries/Mughal.htm</ref> left, represent examples of these innovative concepts introduced by Akbar that set the precedent for Mughal coins which was refined and perfected by his son, Jahangir, and later by his grandson, Shah Jahan.\n\n==Diplomacy==\n\n===Matrimonial alliances===\nThe practice of arranging marriages between Hindu princesses and Muslim kings was known much before Akbar's time, but in most cases these marriages did not lead to any stable relations between the families involved, and the women were lost to their families and did not return after marriage.<ref name=\"Eraly\">{{cite book|title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne, The Saga of the Great Mughals|last=Eraly|first=Abraham|publisher=Penguin Books India|year=2000|page=136|isbn=0-14-100143-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/><ref name=\"Sarkar 37\">{{harvnb|Sarkar|1984|p=37}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Akbar's policy of matrimonial alliances marked a departure in India from previous practice in that the marriage itself marked the beginning of a new order of relations, wherein the Hindu Rajputs who married their daughters or sisters to him would be treated on par with his Muslim fathers-in-law and brothers in-law in all respects except being able to dine and pray with him or take Muslim wives. These Rajputs were made members of his court and their daughters' or sisters' marriage to a Muslim ceased to be a sign of degradation, except for certain proud elements who still considered it a sign of humiliation.<ref name=\"Sarkar 37\"/>\n\n[[File:Birth of jahangir.jpg|thumb|Birth of Salim, the future emperor Jahangir]]\n\nThe [[Kacchwaha]] [[Rajput]], Raja [[Bharmal]], of the small kingdom of [[Amer, India|Amer]], who had come to Akbar's court shortly after the latter's accession, entered into an alliance by giving his daughter in marriage to the emperor. Bharmal was made a noble of high rank in the imperial court, and subsequently his son [[Bhagwant Das]] and grandson [[Man Singh]] also rose to high ranks in the nobility.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\">{{Harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=243}}</ref>\n\nOther Rajput kingdoms also established matrimonial alliances with Akbar, but matrimony was not insisted on as a precondition for forming alliances. Two major Rajput clans remained aloof \u2013 the [[Sisodiya]]s of [[Mewar]] and [[Hada (clan)|Hadas]] of Ranthambore. In another turning point of Akbar's reign, [[Raja Man Singh]] I of Amber went with Akbar to meet the Hada leader, Surjan Hada, to effect an alliance. Surjan accepted an alliance on the condition that Akbar did not marry any of his daughters. Consequently, no matrimonial alliance was entered into, yet Surjan was made a noble and placed in charge of Garh-Katanga.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/>\n\nThe political effect of these alliances was significant. While some Rajput women who entered Akbar's harem converted to Islam, they were generally provided full religious freedom, and their relatives, who continued to remain Hindu, formed a significant part of the nobility and served to articulate the opinions of the majority of the common populace in the imperial court.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/> The interaction between Hindu and Muslim nobles in the imperial court resulted in exchange of thoughts and blending of the two cultures. Further, newer generations of the Mughal line represented a merger of Mughal and Rajput blood, thereby strengthening ties between the two. As a result, the Rajputs became the strongest allies of the Mughals, and Rajput soldiers and generals fought for the Mughal army under Akbar, leading it in several campaigns including the conquest of Gujarat in 1572.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarkar|1984|pp=38\u201340}}</ref> Akbar's policy of religious tolerance ensured that employment in the imperial administration was open to all on merit irrespective of creed, and this led to an increase in the strength of the administrative services of the empire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sarkar|1984|p=38}}</ref>\n\nAnother legend is that Akbar's daughter Meherunnissa was enamoured by [[Tansen]] and had a role in his coming to Akbar's court.<ref name=dawn>{{cite news\n | title =        Profile: Tansen \u2013 the mesmerizing maestro\n | author =       Maryam Juzer Kherulla\n | publisher =    [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]\n | url =          http://dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/021012/yworld5.htm\n | date =         12 October 2002\n | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20071121000709/http://dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/021012/yworld5.htm\n | archive-date=  2007-11-21\n | accessdate =   2007-10-02\n}}</ref> Tansen converted to [[Islam]] from [[Hinduism]], apparently on the eve of his marriage with Akbar's daughter.<ref>India Divided, By Rajendra Prasad, p. 63</ref><ref>A History of Hindi Literature, By F.

As a consequence of this colonialism, all other trading entities were subject to the terms and conditions of the Portuguese, and this was resented by the rulers and traders of the time including [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Habib|1997|p=256}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Death of Sultan Bahadur in front of Diu against the Portuguese 1537 Akbar Nama end of 16th century.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Death of [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]] at [[Siege of Diu|Diu]], in front of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1537<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Dodwell |editor-first=Henry H. |date=1929 |title=The Cambridge history of the British Empire |volume=Volume IV: British India, 1497\u20131858 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y-08AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA14 |location=Cambridge |publisher=The University Press |page=14 |oclc=1473561}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the year 1572 the [[Mughal Empire]] annexed [[Gujarat]] and acquired its first access to the sea after local officials informed Akbar that the Portuguese had begun to exert control in the Indian Ocean.

Akbar suppressed the rebellion and handed out severe punishments to the Qazis.

An orthodox Muslim at the outset, he later came to be influenced by [[Sufi]] mysticism that was being preached in the country at that time, and moved away from orthodoxy, appointing to his court several talented people with liberal ideas, including Abul Fazl, [[Faizi]] and [[Birbal]]. In 1575, he built a hall called the [[Ibadat Khana]] (''\"House of Worship\"'') at Fatehpur Sikri, to which he invited theologians, mystics and selected courtiers renowned for their intellectual achievements and discussed matters of [[spirituality]] with them.<ref name=\"religion1\"/> These discussions, initially restricted to Muslims, were acrimonious and resulted in the participants shouting at and abusing each other. Upset by this, Akbar opened the Ibadat Khana to people of all religions as well as atheists, resulting in the scope of the discussions broadening and extending even into areas such as the validity of the [[Quran]] and the nature of God. This shocked the orthodox theologians, who sought to discredit Akbar by circulating rumours of his desire to forsake Islam.<ref name=\"religion6\"/>\n\nAkbar's effort to evolve a meeting point among the representatives of various religions was not very successful, as each of them attempted to assert the superiority of their respective religions by denouncing other religions. Meanwhile, the debates at the Ibadat Khana grew more acrimonious and, contrary to their purpose of leading to a better understanding among religions, instead led to greater bitterness among them, resulting in the discontinuance of the debates by Akbar in 1582.<ref name=\"Chandra 2007 255\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=255}}</ref> However, his interaction with various religious theologians had convinced him that despite their differences, all religions had several good practices, which he sought to combine into a new religious movement known as [[Din-i-Ilahi]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=256}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9030480/Din-i-Ilahi |title=Din-i Ilahi&nbsp;\u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Silver rupee coin of Akbar, from Lahore mint.jpg|thumb|left|Silver square rupee of Akbar, Lahore mint, struck in Aban month of Ilahi]]\n\nSome modern scholars claim that Akbar did not initiate a new religion but instead introduced what [[Oscar R.

Akbar succeeded his father, [[Humayun]], under a regent, [[Bairam Khan]], who helped the young emperor expand and consolidate Mughal domains in India.\n\nA strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the [[Mughal Empire]] to include much of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. His power and influence, however, extended over the entire subcontinent because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar strove to unite far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through an [[Indo-Persian culture]], to himself as an emperor.\n\nMughal India developed a strong and stable economy, leading to commercial expansion and greater patronage of culture. Akbar himself was a patron of art and culture. He was fond of literature, and created a library of over 24,000 volumes written in [[Sanskrit]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], staffed by many scholars, translators, artists, [[calligraphers]], scribes, bookbinders and readers. He did much of the cataloging himself through three main groupings.<ref name=\"Murray, Stuart 2009\">Murray, Stuart. 2009. The library: an illustrated history. Chicago, ALA Editions</ref> Akbar also established the library of Fatehpur Sikri exclusively for women,{{sfn|Wiegand|Davis, Jr.|1994|p=273}} and he decreed that schools for the education of both Muslims and Hindus should be established throughout the realm. He also encouraged bookbinding to become a high art.<ref name=\"Murray, Stuart 2009\"/> Holy men of many faiths, poets, architects, and artisans adorned his court from all over the world for study and discussion. Akbar's courts at [[Delhi]], [[Agra]], and [[Fatehpur Sikri]] became centres of the arts, letters, and learning. Perso-Islamic culture began to merge and blend with indigenous Indian elements, and a distinct Indo-Persian culture emerged characterized by Mughal style arts, [[Mughal painting|painting]], and [[Mughal architecture|architecture]]. Disillusioned with orthodox Islam and perhaps hoping to bring about religious unity within his empire, Akbar promulgated [[Din-i-Ilahi]], a syncretic creed derived mainly from [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]] as well as some parts of [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Christianity]].\n\nAkbar's reign significantly influenced the course of Indian history. During his rule, the Mughal Empire tripled in size and wealth. He created a powerful military system and instituted effective political and social reforms. By abolishing the [[Jizya|sectarian tax]] on non-Muslims and appointing them to high civil and military posts, he was the first Mughal ruler to win the trust and loyalty of the native subjects. He had [[Sanskrit literature]] translated, participated in native festivals, realising that a stable empire depended on the co-operation and good-will of his subjects. Thus, the foundations for a multicultural empire under Mughal rule were laid during his reign. Akbar was succeeded as emperor by his son, Prince Salim, later known as [[Jahangir]].\n\n==Early years==\nDefeated in battles at [[Chausa]] and [[Kannauj]] in 1539 to 1541 by the forces of [[Sher Shah Suri]], Mughal emperor [[Humayun]] fled westward to [[Sindh]].<ref name=\"Multiple5\">{{cite book|author=Banjerji, S.K.|title=Humayun Badshah|url=https://archive.org/details/humayunbadshah035068mbp|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1938}}</ref> There he met and married the then 14-year-old [[Hamida Banu Begum]], daughter of Shaikh Ali Akbar Jami, a [[Persians|Persian]] teacher of Humayun's younger brother [[Hindal Mirza]].

According to Smith, the recorded date of birth was changed at the time of Akbar's circumcision ceremony in March 1546 in order to throw off astrologers and sorcerers, and the name accordingly changed to Jalal ud-din (\"Splendour of Religion\")<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1917|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>}} (the fourth day of [[Rajab]], 949 [[Hijri year|AH]]) at the [[Umarkot Fort|Rajput Fortress]] of [[Amarkot]] in [[Rajputana]] (in modern-day [[Sindh]]), where his parents had been given refuge by the local Hindu ruler Rana Prasad.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1917|pp=12\u201319}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Akbar.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Akbar as a boy]]\n\nDuring the extended period of Humayun's exile, Akbar was brought up in Kabul by the extended family of his paternal uncles, [[Kamran Mirza]] and [[Askari Mirza]], and his aunts, in particular Kamran Mirza's wife.

Moreover, Akbar had received invitations from cliques in Gujarat to oust the reigning king, which served as justification for his military expedition.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> In 1572, he moved to occupy [[Ahmedabad]], the capital, and other northern cities, and was proclaimed the lawful sovereign of Gujarat. By 1573, he had driven out the Mirzas who, after offering token resistance, fled for refuge in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. [[Surat]], the commercial capital of the region and other coastal cities soon capitulated to the Mughals.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/> The king, [[Muzaffar Shah III]], was caught hiding in a corn field; he was pensioned off by Akbar with a small allowance.<ref name=\"Eraly4\"/>\n\nHaving established his authority over Gujarat, Akbar returned to Fatehpur Sikiri, where he built the [[Buland Darwaza]] to commemorate his victories, but a rebellion by Afghan nobles supported by the Rajput ruler of [[Idar]], and the renewed intrigues of the Mirzas forced his return to Gujarat.<ref name=\"Richards5\"/> Akbar crossed the Rajputana and reached Ahmedabad in eleven days \u2013 a journey that normally took six weeks.

He besieged [[Ahmednagar Fort]] in 1595, forcing [[Chand Bibi]] to cede [[Berar Subah|Berar]]. A subsequent revolt forced Akbar to take the fort in August 1600. Akbar occupied [[Burhanpur]] and besieged [[Asirgarh Fort]] in 1599, and took it on 17 January 1601, when Miran Bahadur Shah refused to submit [[Khandesh]]. Akbar then established the [[Subah (province)|Subahs]] of Ahmadnagar, Berar and Khandesh under Prince Daniyal. \"By the time of his death in 1605, Akbar controlled a broad sweep of territory from the Bay of Bengal to Qandahar and Badakshan.

The ''mir bakshi'' was in charge of intelligence gathering, and also made recommendations to the emperor for military appointments and promotions.\n* The ''mir saman'' was in charge of the imperial household, including the harems, and supervised the functioning of the court and royal bodyguard.\n* The judiciary was a separate organisation headed by a chief ''[[qazi]]'', who was also responsible for religious beliefs and practices\n\n===Taxation===\nAkbar set about reforming the administration of his empire's land revenue by adopting a system that had been used by [[Sher Shah Suri]]. A cultivated area where crops grew well was measured and taxed through fixed rates based on the area's crop and productivity. However, this placed hardship on the peasantry because tax rates were fixed on the basis of prices prevailing in the imperial court, which were often higher than those in the countryside.<ref>{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=233}}</ref> Akbar changed to a decentralised system of annual assessment, but this resulted in corruption among local officials and was abandoned in 1580, to be replaced by a system called the ''{{transl|bn|dahsala}}''.<ref name=\"dahsala\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=234}}</ref> Under the new system, revenue was calculated as one-third of the average produce of the previous ten years, to be paid to the state in cash. This system was later refined, taking into account local prices, and grouping areas with similar productivity into assessment circles. Remission was given to peasants when the harvest failed during times of flood or drought.<ref name=\"dahsala\"/> Akbar's ''{{transl|bn|dahsala}}'' system (also known as ''{{transl|bn|zabti}})'' is credited to [[Raja Todar Mal]], who also served as a revenue officer under Sher Shah Suri,<ref name=\"Chandra 2007 236\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=236}}</ref> and the structure of the revenue administration was set out by the latter in a detailed memorandum submitted to the emperor in 1582\u201383.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|p=160}}</ref>\n\nOther local methods of assessment continued in some areas. Land which was fallow or uncultivated was charged at concessional rates.<ref name=\"localassessment\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=235}}</ref> Akbar also actively encouraged the improvement and extension of agriculture. The village continued to remain the primary unit of revenue assessment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|pp=164\u2013165}}</ref> [[Zamindar]]s of every area were required to provide loans and agricultural implements in times of need, to encourage farmers to plough as much land as possible and to sow seeds of superior quality. In turn, the zamindars were given a hereditary right to collect a share of the produce. Peasants had a hereditary right to cultivate the land as long as they paid the land revenue.<ref name=\"localassessment\"/> While the revenue assessment system showed concern for the small peasantry, it also maintained a level of distrust towards the revenue officials. Revenue officials were guaranteed only three-quarters of their salary, with the remaining quarter dependent on their full realisation of the revenue assessed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moosvi|2008|p=165}}</ref>\n\n===Military organization===\n{{Main|Mansabdari}}\n[[File:The Adventures of Akbar artillery.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mughal Army]] [[artillery]] men during the reign of Akbar]]\n\nAkbar organised his army as well as the nobility by means of a system called the ''mansabdari''. Under this system, each officer in the army was assigned a rank (a ''mansabdar''), and assigned a number of [[cavalry]] that he had to supply to the imperial army.<ref name=\"Chandra 2007 236\"/> The ''mansabdars'' were divided into 33 classes. The top three commanding ranks, ranging from 7000 to 10000 troops, were normally reserved for princes. Other ranks between 10 and 5000 were assigned to other members of the nobility. The empire's permanent [[standing army]] was quite small and the imperial forces mostly consisted of contingents maintained by the ''mansabdars''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=359}}</ref> Persons were normally appointed to a low ''mansab'' and then promoted, based on their merit as well as the favour of the emperor.<ref name=\"mansabdari\">{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=238}}</ref> Each ''mansabdar'' was required to maintain a certain number of cavalrymen and twice that number of horses. The number of horses was greater because they had to be rested and rapidly replaced in times of war. Akbar employed strict measures to ensure that the quality of the armed forces was maintained at a high level; horses were regularly inspected and only [[Arabian horse]]s were normally employed.<ref>{{harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=237}}</ref> The ''mansabdars'' were remunerated well for their services and constituted the highest paid military service in the world at the time.<ref name=\"mansabdari\"/>\n\n===Capital===\n[[File:Audienzhalle.jpg|thumb|''Diwan-i-Khas'' (Hall of Private Audience) in Fatehpur Sikri]]\n\nAkbar was a follower of [[Salim Chishti]], a [[Asceticism|holy man]] who lived in the region of Sikri near Agra. Believing the area to be a lucky one for himself, he had a mosque constructed there for the use of the priest. Subsequently, he celebrated the victories over Chittor and Ranthambore by laying the foundation of a new walled capital, {{convert|23|mi|km}} west of Agra in 1569, which was named Fatehpur (\"''town of victory''\") after the conquest of Gujarat in 1573 and subsequently came to be known as [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in order to distinguish it from other similarly named towns.<ref name=\"earlyconquest\"/> Palaces for each of Akbar's senior queens, a huge artificial lake, and sumptuous water-filled courtyards were built there. However, the city was soon abandoned and the capital was moved to [[Lahore]] in 1585. The reason may have been that the water supply in Fatehpur Sikri was insufficient or of poor quality. Or, as some historians believe, Akbar had to attend to the northwest areas of his empire and therefore moved his capital northwest. Other sources indicate Akbar simply lost interest in the city<ref>Petersen, A. (1996). ''Dictionary of Islamic Architecture''. New York: Routledge.</ref> or realised it was not militarily defensible. In 1599, Akbar shifted his capital back to Agra from where he reigned until his death.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Trade===\nThe reign of Akbar was characterised by commercial expansion.<ref name=\"Economy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part2_17.html#n10|title=Economic and Social Developments under the Mughals|publisher=columbia.edu |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref> The Mughal government encouraged traders, provided protection and security for transactions, and levied a very low custom duty to stimulate foreign trade. Furthermore, it strived to foster a climate conductive to commerce by requiring local administrators to provide restitution to traders for goods stolen while in their territory.

The coins of Akbar set a new chapter in India's numismatic history.<ref>Mughals coins, https://www.indian-coins.com/joomla/index.php/coins-catalogue/akbar-coins</ref> The coins of Akbar's grandfather, Babur, and father, Humayun, are basic and devoid of any innovation as the former was busy establishing the foundations of the Mughal rule in India while the latter was ousted by the Afghan, Sher Shah Suri, and returned to the throne only to die a year later. While the reign of both Babur and Humayun represented turmoil, Akbar's relative long reign of 50 years allowed him to experiment with coinage.\n\nAkbar introduced coins with decorative floral motifs, dotted borders, quatrefoil and other types. His coins were both round and square in shape with a unique 'mehrab' (lozenge) shape coin highlighting numismatic calligraphy at its best.<ref>Coins of Akbar, https://www.mintageworld.com/blog/coins-of-akbar/</ref> Akbar's portrait type gold coin (Mohur) is generally attributed to his son, Prince Salim (later Emperor Jahangir), who had rebelled and then sought reconciliation thereafter by minting and presenting his father with gold Mohur's bearing Akbar's portrait. The tolerant view of Akbar is represented by the 'Ram-Sita' silver coin type while during the latter part of Akbar's reign, we see coins portraying the concept of Akbar's newly promoted religion 'Din-e-ilahi' with the Ilahi type and Jalla Jalal-Hu type coins.\n\nThe coins,<ref>Mughal Empire coins and Rulers, http://www.chiefacoins.com/Database/Countries/Mughal.htm</ref> left, represent examples of these innovative concepts introduced by Akbar that set the precedent for Mughal coins which was refined and perfected by his son, Jahangir, and later by his grandson, Shah Jahan.\n\n==Diplomacy==\n\n===Matrimonial alliances===\nThe practice of arranging marriages between Hindu princesses and Muslim kings was known much before Akbar's time, but in most cases these marriages did not lead to any stable relations between the families involved, and the women were lost to their families and did not return after marriage.<ref name=\"Eraly\">{{cite book|title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne, The Saga of the Great Mughals|last=Eraly|first=Abraham|publisher=Penguin Books India|year=2000|page=136|isbn=0-14-100143-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/><ref name=\"Sarkar 37\">{{harvnb|Sarkar|1984|p=37}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Akbar's policy of matrimonial alliances marked a departure in India from previous practice in that the marriage itself marked the beginning of a new order of relations, wherein the Hindu Rajputs who married their daughters or sisters to him would be treated on par with his Muslim fathers-in-law and brothers in-law in all respects except being able to dine and pray with him or take Muslim wives. These Rajputs were made members of his court and their daughters' or sisters' marriage to a Muslim ceased to be a sign of degradation, except for certain proud elements who still considered it a sign of humiliation.<ref name=\"Sarkar 37\"/>\n\n[[File:Birth of jahangir.jpg|thumb|Birth of Salim, the future emperor Jahangir]]\n\nThe [[Kacchwaha]] [[Rajput]], Raja [[Bharmal]], of the small kingdom of [[Amer, India|Amer]], who had come to Akbar's court shortly after the latter's accession, entered into an alliance by giving his daughter in marriage to the emperor. Bharmal was made a noble of high rank in the imperial court, and subsequently his son [[Bhagwant Das]] and grandson [[Man Singh]] also rose to high ranks in the nobility.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\">{{Harvnb|Chandra|2007|p=243}}</ref>\n\nOther Rajput kingdoms also established matrimonial alliances with Akbar, but matrimony was not insisted on as a precondition for forming alliances. Two major Rajput clans remained aloof \u2013 the [[Sisodiya]]s of [[Mewar]] and [[Hada (clan)|Hadas]] of Ranthambore. In another turning point of Akbar's reign, [[Raja Man Singh]] I of Amber went with Akbar to meet the Hada leader, Surjan Hada, to effect an alliance. Surjan accepted an alliance on the condition that Akbar did not marry any of his daughters. Consequently, no matrimonial alliance was entered into, yet Surjan was made a noble and placed in charge of Garh-Katanga.<ref name=\"Chandra 243\"/>\n\nThe political effect of these alliances was significant.

He often plunged on his horse into the flooded river during the rainy seasons and safely crossed it. He rarely indulged in cruelty and is said to have been affectionate towards his relatives.

He is believed to have died on 27 October 1605, after which his body was buried at [[Akbar's tomb|his mausoleum]] in Sikandra, [[Agra]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Majumdar|1984|pp=168\u2013169}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Akbar-konkani vishwkosh.png|thumb|Akbar remains a popular historical figure in many parts of South Asia]]\n\nAkbar left a rich legacy both for the Mughal Empire as well as the Indian subcontinent in general. He firmly entrenched the authority of the Mughal Empire in India and beyond, after it had been threatened by the Afghans during his father's reign,<ref>{{Harvnb|Habib|1997|p=79}}</ref> establishing its military and diplomatic superiority.<ref>{{Harvnb|Majumdar|1984|p=170}}</ref> During his reign, the nature of the state changed to a secular and liberal one, with emphasis on cultural integration. He also introduced several far-sighted social reforms, including prohibiting ''[[Sati (practice)|sati]]'', legalising widow remarriage and raising the age of marriage. [[Folklore|Folk tales]] revolving around him and Birbal, one of his ''navratnas'', are popular in India.\n\n''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'' is a minor ''[[Purana]]'' that depicts the various Hindu holy days and includes a section devoted to the various dynasties that ruled India, dating its oldest portion to 500 CE and newest to the 18th century. It contains a story about Akbar in which he is compared to the other Mughal rulers. The section called \"Akbar Bahshaha Varnan\", written in Sanskrit, describes his birth as a \"[[reincarnation]]\" of a sage who immolated himself on seeing the first Mughal ruler Babur, who is described as the \"cruel king of Mlecchas (Muslims)\". In this text it is stated that Akbar \"was a miraculous child\" and that he would not follow the previous \"violent ways\" of the Mughals.<ref name=\"Khanna, Culture of Medieval India\">{{cite book|author=Meenakshi Khanna|title=Cultural History Of Medieval India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbKv3zyIFD8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA24#v=onepage |year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-81-87358-30-5|pages=34\u201335 |accessdate=2013-06-30}}</ref><ref name=\"Review colonial record\">{{cite book|title=The Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review and Oriental and Colonial Record|url=https://archive.org/details/imperialandasia00unkngoog |year=1900|publisher=Oriental Institute|pages=[https://archive.org/details/imperialandasia00unkngoog/page/n166 158]\u2013161 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref>\n\nCiting Akbar's melding of the disparate 'fiefdoms' of India into the [[Mughal Empire]] as well as the lasting legacy of \"pluralism and tolerance\" that \"underlies the values of the modern republic of India\", [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] included his name in its list of top 25 world leaders.<ref name=time>{{cite journal |last=Tharoor |first=Ishaan |date=4 February 2011 |title=Top 25 Political Icons:Akbar the Great |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2046285_2045996_2046303,00.html |journal=Time}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, his legacy is explicitly negative in [[Pakistan]] for the same reasons. Historian [[Mubarak Ali]], while studying the image of Akbar in Pakistani textbooks, observes that Akbar \"is conveniently ignored and not mentioned in any school textbook from class one to matriculation\", as opposed to the omnipresence of [[emperor Aurangzeb]]. He quotes historian [[Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi]], who said that, due to his religious tolerance, \"Akbar had so weakened Islam through his policies that it could not be restored to its dominant position in the affairs.\" A common thread among Pakistani historians is to blame Akbar's [[Rajput]] policy. As a conclusion, after analyzing many textbooks, Mubarak Ali says that \"Akbar is criticized for bringing Muslims and Hindus together as one nation and putting the separate identity of the Muslims in danger. This policy of Akbar contradicts the [[Two-nation theory|theory of Two-Nation]] and therefore makes him an unpopular figure in Pakistan.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ali |first=Mubarak |date=September\u2013October 1992 |title=Akbar in Pakistani Textbooks |journal=Social Scientist |volume=20 |issue=9/10 |pages=73\u201376 |jstor=3517719|doi=10.2307/3517719 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2018}}\n;Films and television\n* Akbar was portrayed in the award-winning 1960 [[Bollywood|Hindi movie]] ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' (The great Mughal), in which his character was played by [[Prithviraj Kapoor]].\n* Akbar was portrayed by [[Hrithik Roshan]] in the 2008 Bollywood film ''[[Jodhaa Akbar]]''.\n* Akbar and Birbal were portrayed in the Hindi series ''Akbar-Birbal'' aired on [[Zee TV]] in late 1990s where Akbar's role was played by [[Vikram Gokhale]].\n* A television series, called ''Akbar the Great'', directed by [[Akbar Khan (director)|Akbar Khan]] was aired on [[DD National]] in the 1990s.\n* Since 2013\u20132015, a television series, called ''[[Jodha Akbar (TV series)|Jodha Akbar]]'' aired on Zee TV, in which the role of Akbar was played by actor [[Rajat Tokas]].\n* Akbar was portrayed by [[Uday Tikekar]] in [[EPIC (TV channel)|EPIC]] channel's critically acclaimed historical drama ''[[Siyaasat]]'' (based on the novel ''The Twentieth Wife'').\n* In [[Sony TV]]'s historical drama ''[[Bharat Ka Veer Putra \u2013 Maharana Pratap]]'', Akbar was at first portrayed by [[Krip Suri]] and later by [[Avinesh Rekhi]].\n* Akbar is portrayed by [[Kiku Sharda]] in [[BIG Magic]]'s sitcom ''[[Akbar Birbal]]''.\n* Abhishek Nigam portrayed Akbar in BIG MAGIC's historical drama ''Akbar \u2013 Rakht Se Takht Tak Ka Safar''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Farzeen|first1=Sana|title=Abhishek Nigam to play the grown-up Akbar in Big Magic show|url=http://www.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/abhishek-nigam-play-the-grown-akbar-big-magic-show-170411|website=Tellychakkar.com|publisher=Tellychakkar.com|accessdate=18 July 2017|date=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Mohammed Iqbal Khan]] played the role of Akbar in ABP News' documentary series, [[Bharatvarsh (TV series)|Bharatvarsh]].\n*[[Shahbaz Khan (actor)|Shahbaz Khan]] played the role of Akbar in Colors television show [[Dastaan-E-Mohabbat Salim Anarkali]]\n\n;Fiction\n* Akbar is a principal character in [[Indu Sundaresan]]'s award-winning historical novel ''The Twentieth Wife'' (2002) as well as in its sequel ''The Feast of Roses'' (2003).\n* A fictionalised Akbar plays an important supporting role in [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s 2002 novel, ''[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]''.\n* Akbar is also a major character in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s 2008 novel ''[[The Enchantress of Florence]]''.\n* [[Bertrice Small]] is known for incorporating historical figures as primary characters in her romance novels, and Akbar is no exception.
