Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor, raising concerns about [[nepotism]]. He also stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel. Kushner had an influential role within the Trump administration in its response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which included advising Trump in the first two months of the outbreak that the media was exaggerating the threat of the virus, and later on helping to draft an error-riddled Oval Office address about the crisis.\n\n== Early life (1981\u20132007) ==\nKushner was born in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], to Seryl Kushner (n\u00e9e Stadtmauer) and [[Charles Kushner]], a real-estate developer and convicted felon.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |title=The Legacy |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=July 12, 2009 |first=Gabriel |last=Sherman |accessdate=January 3, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103120035/http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |archivedate=January 3, 2015 }}</ref> His paternal grandparents, Reichel and [[Joseph Kushner]], were [[Holocaust]] survivors who came to the U.S. in 1949 from [[Navahrudak]], now in [[Belarus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |title=What Does Trump's Presidency Mean for Belarus? |last=Rudnik |first=Alesia |last2=Smok |first2=Vadzim |date=November 18, 2016 |website=BelarusDigest.com |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180709183434/https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |archive-date=July 9, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=July 9, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |title=The Young Trump: Jared Kushner's Rise to Unimaginable Power |first=Andrew |last=Rice |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=January 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115000329/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |archivedate=January 15, 2017 }}</ref> Morris Stadtmauer was Jared's [[maternal grandfather]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kushner Insider January 30, 2015 |url=https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |website=[[Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy]]/[[Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School]] |accessdate=July 7, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422084708/https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |archivedate=April 22, 2016  |date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> \n\nRaised in a [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox Jewish]] family,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |title=Jared Kushner once broke up with Ivanka Trump over 'religion issue' |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224132903/http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |archivedate=February 24, 2017 }}</ref> Kushner graduated from the [[Frisch School]], a Modern Orthodox [[Jewish day school|yeshiva high school]], in 1999.

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor, raising concerns about [[nepotism]]. He also stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel. Kushner had an influential role within the Trump administration in its response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which included advising Trump in the first two months of the outbreak that the media was exaggerating the threat of the virus, and later on helping to draft an error-riddled Oval Office address about the crisis.\n\n== Early life (1981\u20132007) ==\nKushner was born in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], to Seryl Kushner (n\u00e9e Stadtmauer) and [[Charles Kushner]], a real-estate developer and convicted felon.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |title=The Legacy |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=July 12, 2009 |first=Gabriel |last=Sherman |accessdate=January 3, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103120035/http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |archivedate=January 3, 2015 }}</ref> His paternal grandparents, Reichel and [[Joseph Kushner]], were [[Holocaust]] survivors who came to the U.S. in 1949 from [[Navahrudak]], now in [[Belarus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |title=What Does Trump's Presidency Mean for Belarus? |last=Rudnik |first=Alesia |last2=Smok |first2=Vadzim |date=November 18, 2016 |website=BelarusDigest.com |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180709183434/https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |archive-date=July 9, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=July 9, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |title=The Young Trump: Jared Kushner's Rise to Unimaginable Power |first=Andrew |last=Rice |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=January 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115000329/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |archivedate=January 15, 2017 }}</ref> Morris Stadtmauer was Jared's [[maternal grandfather]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kushner Insider January 30, 2015 |url=https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |website=[[Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy]]/[[Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School]] |accessdate=July 7, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422084708/https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |archivedate=April 22, 2016  |date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> \n\nRaised in a [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox Jewish]] family,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |title=Jared Kushner once broke up with Ivanka Trump over 'religion issue' |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224132903/http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |archivedate=February 24, 2017 }}</ref> Kushner graduated from the [[Frisch School]], a Modern Orthodox [[Jewish day school|yeshiva high school]], in 1999.

The second modern role-playing game published, it was written by Ken St. Andre to be a more accessible alternative to ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZExaEP-g_A |title=A Chat with Ken St Andre Part 1  |publisher=LordStrange YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYlRHXRjsFg |title=A Chat with Ken St Andre Part 2  |publisher=LordStrange YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> and is suitable for solitaire, group, and play-by-mail gameplay.\n\n==History==\nKen St. Andre, a public librarian in Phoenix, Arizona, liked the idea of fantasy role-playing after reading a friend's ''D&D'' rule books but found the actual rules confusing, so he wrote his own. \"I just wanted something I could play with my friends at a reasonable price, with reasonable equipment,\u201d he said.<ref name=dragon /> The first edition of ''Tunnels & Trolls'' was self-published in April 1975.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.garenewing.co.uk/tnt/interview.html| year = 1986| title = The Ken St Andre/Demon Issue Interview}}</ref> In June 1975, publisher Flying Buffalo Inc. released a second edition of the game, and Tunnels & Trolls quickly became D&D's biggest competitor.<ref name=ODaM>{{cite book | first=David M. | last=Ewalt | authorlink= David M.

This edition was also translated and published abroad in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]],<ref>In Germany ''Tunnels & Trolls'' was released as ''Schwerter & D\u00e4monen'' in September 1983, two months earlier than ''Dungeons & Dragons'', it was the very first roleplaying game available in German.<br/>{{cite book|last = Evers|first = Momo|title=Magische Zeiten|edition=1st|date=January 2005|publisher=[[Fantasy Productions]]|language=German|isbn=3-89064-516-X}}<br/>{{cite book|last=[[Ken St. Andre]] |first=Rick Loomis|title=Schwerter & D\u00e4monen|edition=1st|date=September 1983|publisher=[[Fantasy Productions]]|language=German|isbn=3-89064-000-1}}</ref> [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], and it entered these markets before ''Dungeons & Dragons'' did in most cases.\n\nIn 1999 ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' magazine named ''Tunnels & Trolls'' as one of ''The Millennium's Most Underrated Games''.  Editor [[Scott Haring]] said of the game \"everybody knows this was the second ever fantasy roleplaying game ... But to dismiss it as just an opportunistic ripoff would be grossly unfair. Flying Buffalo's ''T&T'' had its own zany feel \u2013 it was much less serious than ''D&D'' \u2013 and a less-complicated game system.\"<ref>{{cite journal| title=Second Sight: The Millennium's Most Influential Company and The Millennium's Most Underrated Game|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] (online)|last=Haring| first=Scott D. |authorlink=Scott Haring | url= http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=1240| date=1999-11-25| accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, [[Flying Buffalo]] updated the 5th edition rules with a \"5.5\" publication that added about 40 pages of extra material. That same year, [[Fiery Dragon Productions]] produced a ''30th Anniversary Edition'' under license in a tin box complete with CD, map, and monster counters, and two new versions of the rules. Ken St. Andre used the opportunity to extensively update the style of play and introduce new role-playing concepts, such as character level determined by character attribute statistics instead of arbitrary numbers of experience points. The ''30th Anniversary'' rules are generally known as the 7th edition. One of the most significant innovations of 7th edition is the introduction of a skills system. The 7.5 edition was released in 2008 by Fiery Dragon, being an update and clarification on the 30th Anniversary Edition.\n\nIn 2012, Tunnels & Trolls was re-introduced in French-speaking markets by [[Grimtooth]] under license by Flying Buffalo. The French rulebook, which is officially the 8th edition, is based on the 7th edition, but includes elements taken from the 5.5 edition as well as clarifications by Ken St. Andre. The interior artwork includes the illustrations of the 5th edition, plus new inks by [[Liz Danforth]]. Several other products (solos and GM adventures) have already been released via Lulu.com and others have been announced.\n\nThe production work for the 8th edition prompted Flying Buffalo to start working on a Deluxe (9th) Edition of the rulebook.<ref>[http://trollhalla.com/outer-sanctum/2012/07/31/announcing-tunnels-and-trolls-deluxe/ Ken St.Andre Announcing Tunnels and Trolls Deluxe] [http://www.trollishdelver.com/2012/03/deluxe-edition-of-tunnels-trolls.html?showComment=1331512511480&m=0#c5423708491776565668 Explanations on the context of the Deluxe edition project] by [[Liz Danforth]] and [[Steve Crompton]]</ref> As Rick Loomis, head of Flying Buffalo Inc., put it, \"The French edition came out so beautiful that now that I have run out of 5.5, I am not satisfied to just reprint 5.5. I wanted to have a deluxe edition even better than the French one. (Competition is what drives us to be better!)\".  ''Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls'', written by St. Andre with additional design input and editing from longtime players [[Liz Danforth]] and James \"Bear\" Peters, was published in August 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deluxetunnelsandtrolls.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/deluxe-tt-rules-now-available-to-all/|title=Deluxe T&T Rules Now Available to ALL!|date=July 22, 2015|author=SSCrompton|publisher=Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe 5th edition ''Tunnels & Trolls'' core ruleset does not detail a specific setting, saying only that gameplay occurs in \"a world somewhat but not exactly similar to Tolkien's [[Middle-earth|Middle Earth]].\" In an interview in 1986, Ken St. Andre stated that \"my conception of the ''T&T'' world was based on ''The Lord of The Rings'' as it would have been done by Marvel Comics in 1974 with [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]], [[Elric]], the [[Gray Mouser]] and a host of badguys thrown in.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garenewing.co.uk/tnt/interview.html |title=T&T Interviews |publisher=Garenewing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref>\n\nThe current Deluxe Edition includes Ken St. Andre's house campaign setting, Trollworld. Along with additional material by early players Jim \"Bear\" Peters and Liz Danforth.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Prime attributes===\nEight prime attributes define characters in ''Tunnels & Trolls'':\n\n*'''Strength (ST)''' determines which weapons the character can use and how much the character can carry. It also serves as magic points in 5th and earlier editions.\n*'''Intelligence (IQ)''' measures the character's ability to think and remember facts.\n*'''Luck (LK)''' affects combat results and saving throws.\n*'''Constitution (CON)''' measures how healthy the character is and how much damage the character can take before being killed.\n*'''Dexterity (DEX)''' represents agility, nimbleness and affects marksmanship.\n*'''Charisma (CHR)''' represents attractiveness and leadership ability.\n\nLater editions add the following prime attributes:\n\n*'''Wizardry (WIZ)''' replaces Strength for powering magic points. Also called '''Power (POW)''' in the 5.5 Edition.\n*'''Speed (SPD)''' represents reaction speed and, in some editions, movement rate.\n\nA new character begins with a randomly generated score for each attribute, determined by rolling three six-side dice.\n\n===Character races===\nThe rules recommend that novice players create human characters, but also offer the options of [[elves]], [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]], and [[hobbit]]s. Other races, like [[leprechaun]]s and [[fairy|fairies]], serve as additional character options. A character's race affects his or her attributes. A player may also choose to play as a \"monster race\" such as a zombie or vampire.\n\n===Character classes===\nPlayers also choose a character class for their character. The two base classes are Warriors and Wizards. Wizards can cast spells but have combat limitations. While Warriors cannot cast magic, they are allowed the full use of weapons and armor is twice as effective in blocking damage. Rogues and Warrior-Wizards are also available as character classes. These two classes both combine the abilities of the Warrior and the Wizard. Rogues in ''Tunnels & Trolls'' are not thieves, unlike the Rogue classes in ''[[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dungeons & Dragons]]'', but could be more accurately described as 'Rogue Wizards'. Rogues are limited in their spell-casting abilities, can utilize the full range of combat weapons and armor as a warrior but do not receive the Warrior's armor bonus or the Wizard's spell-creating ability. Warrior-Wizards are not so limited, but the player must be lucky with the dice when creating the character: high minimum attribute scores are required. Later editions include new classes such as Specialist Mage, Paragon (a renaming of the Warrior-Wizard), Leader, and Ranger.\n\n===Starting equipment and money===\nNew characters begin with a number of gold pieces determined by rolling three six-sided dice and multiplying the total by ten. These gold pieces can be used to buy weapons, armor, and other equipment.\n\n===Combat===\nCombat is handled by comparing dice rolls between a character and his opponent. Both sides roll a number of dice determined by which weapon is in use, then modify the appropriate result by \"personal adds\". Totals are compared, with the higher roll damaging the opposing combatant by the difference in totals. Armor absorbs this damage taken, and any amount remaining is subtracted from the Constitution attribute.\n\n''Tunnels & Trolls'' is unusual among roleplaying games in conducting mass combat resolution with one set of rolls, as the above system applies to combats between any number of opponents.\n\nPersonal adds are determined by Strength, Luck, and Dexterity. For every point above 12 possessed in each of these attributes, the character receives a one-point bonus to his personal adds. Similarly, for every point below 9 possessed in each of these attributes, the character receives a one-point penalty.\n\nIn the 7th Edition, the formula was changed to include Speed in the personal adds.  This also applies to the Deluxe Edition.\n\nThe 5.5, 7th and Deluxe edition include 'spite damage' whereby each \"6\" rolled on the combat dice causes a minimum of one damage to be inflicted on the opposing side, regardless of armor or the respective combat totals. This helped resolve the interminable stalemate that could occur between evenly matched, heavily armored opponents.\n\n===Saving rolls===\nThe Saving Roll (SR) is used during combat to break a stalemate or overcome the characters being outmatched as well as for use of ranged weapons. The SR is also used in all other tests of skill or luck the characters may be presented with by the GM or solo adventure. Checks are made using a character's attribute plus 2d6 (doubles add and roll over) against a difficulty level based on the task at hand. For every level of saving roll the formula is 15+5x, with x being the level of difficulty. This was one of the earliest uses of this mechanic in RPGs.\n\n==Reception==\nIn the third issue of ''[[The Space Gamer]]'', Brant Bates called the first edition of ''Tunnels & Trolls'' \"very playable, and a lot of fun\", and recommended it for fantasy fans who are \"not purists.\"<ref name=\"SG3\">{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=Brant |date=1975 |title=Tunnels and Trolls: A Review of Sorts|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Metagaming Concepts|Metagaming]]|issue=3|pages=16-17}}</ref> \n\nFive years later, in the March\u2013April 1980 edition of ''The Space Gamer'' (Issue 27), [[Steve Jackson (American game designer)|Steve Jackson]] said of the 5th edition, \"On the whole, a good book, worth the price for any adventure gamer just for the ideas and comments it holds. A ''must'' for anyone playing T&T with an earlier edition.\"<ref name=\"SG27\">{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Steve|authorlink=Steve Jackson (American game designer) |date=March\u2013April 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=27|pages=31}}</ref>\n\nThat same year, in the July 1980 edition of ''[[Ares (magazine)|Ares]]'' (Issue 3), [[Eric Goldberg (game designer)|Eric Goldberg]] dismissed the 5th edition as \"a pleasant puff piece\", although he agreed that since 1st edition, \"the production values have increased from amateur status to a nearly professional standard.\" However, he did not recommend it, saying, \"the game will be passed over by all but the completist; there are better buys on the market now.\" <ref name=\"ares\">{{cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Eric |author-link=Eric Goldberg (game designer) |date=July 1980 |title=Games|journal=[[Ares (magazine)|Ares]]|publisher=[[Simulations Publications, Inc.]]|issue=3|pages=33-34}}</ref>\n\nIn the August 1992 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue 184), [[Rick Swan]] liked several aspects of the 5th edition: \"What the combat system lacks in realism, it makes up for in simplicity and speed\" and \"Players... will find the magic system to be exceptionally clever.\" Swan criticized the imprecision of the rules, calling them \"a hairsplitter's delight\", as well as the simplicity of the monster ratings, which meant \"there\u2019s no meaningful distinction between fighting a giant slug and a drunken swordsman.\" But he concluded that the simplicity of the rules was its own virtue, especially for new players. \"The ''Tunnels & Trolls'' game is by no means the most sophisticated alternative to the ''D&D'' game \u2014 the ''AD&D'' game, the Avalon Hill Game Company's ''[[Runequest]]'' game, and even the new ''Lord of the Rings'' game are all better designs \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly the easiest to learn. A beginner should be able to master it in an afternoon, and a veteran will probably nail it in under an hour.\"<ref name=dragon>{{cite journal|last=Swan|first=Rick|authorlink=Rick Swan| date=August 1992 |title=Roleplaying Reviews|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=184|pages=74-76}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1996 reader poll undertaken by ''Arcane'' magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, ''Tunnels and Trolls'' was ranked 32nd. Paul Pettengale, the magazine's editor, called ''T&T'' \"pretty crude\", noting its early release, and said \"It's probably here for nostalgic reasons.\"<ref name=\"Arcane14\">{{cite journal|last= Pettengale|first=Paul|date= Christmas 1996 |title=Arcane Presents the Top 50 Roleplaying Games 1996|journal=Arcane|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=14|pages=25-35}}</ref>\n\n==Reviews==\n*''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' #2\n*''[[Different Worlds]]'' #11\n\n==List of ''Tunnels & Trolls'' publications==\n''Tunnels & Trolls'' was also the first system to publish a series of fantasy-themed [[gamebook]]s - adventures which are designed to be played by one person, without the need for a referee. At least twenty such adventures were published by Flying Buffalo. The ''[[Fighting Fantasy]]'' series achieved great popularity using this format. Both ''T&T'''s simplicity and its reliance on use of six-sided dice (as compared to the various polyhedral dice used by Dungeons and Dragons) contributed to its success in this format.\n\n===Solo adventures===\n* ''Alice in Weirdworld'' by Joel Marler\n* ''[[Buffalo Castle]]'' by [[Rick Loomis]]\n* ''[[Deathtrap Equalizer Dungeon]]'' by Ken St. Andre\n* ''Labyrinth'' by Lee Russell\n* ''Naked Doom'' by Ken St. Andre\n* ''[[Dargon's Dungeon]]'' by Michael Stackpole\n* ''Weirdworld'' by Keith Abbott\n* ''[[Overkill (Flying Buffalo)|Overkill]]'' by Michael Stackpole\n* ''Beyond the Silvered Pane'' by James & Steven Marciniak\n* ''[[City of Terrors]]'' by Michael Stackpole\n* ''[[Sorcerer Solitaire]]'' by Walker Vaning\n* ''[[Sword for Hire (Flying Buffalo)|Sword for Hire]]'' by James Wilson\n* ''[[Arena of Khazan]]'' by Ken St. Andre\n* ''[[Sewers of Oblivion]]'' by Michael Stackpole\n* ''[[Sea of Mystery]]'' by Gienn Rahman\n* ''[[Blue Frog Tavern]]'' by James Wilson\n* ''[[Mistywood]]'' by Roy Cram Jr.\n* ''[[Gamesmen of Kasar]]'' by Roy Cram\n* ''[[Beyond the Wall of Tears]]'' by K.

In Ken St. Andre's editorial in the first issue (Winter 1978) the magazine was described as a \"'zine based around T&T specifically and fantasy role-playing in general\".\n\n===Reference publications===\nA number of books were published that support GMs by giving them ideas for \"traps\" and other tools for creating adventures when designing a dungeon or adventure.  One example is the [[Grimtooth's Traps]] series, authored by Paul O'Connor (and others), that is a listing of traps that GMs can insert into their adventures.\n\n===Spin-offs===\n''[[Monsters! Monsters!]]'' is a subset of the ''T&T'' rules tailored to playing monsters. It is fully compatible with 5th edition.

The second modern role-playing game published, it was written by Ken St. Andre to be a more accessible alternative to ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZExaEP-g_A |title=A Chat with Ken St Andre Part 1  |publisher=LordStrange YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYlRHXRjsFg |title=A Chat with Ken St Andre Part 2  |publisher=LordStrange YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> and is suitable for solitaire, group, and play-by-mail gameplay.\n\n==History==\nKen St. Andre, a public librarian in Phoenix, Arizona, liked the idea of fantasy role-playing after reading a friend's ''D&D'' rule books but found the actual rules confusing, so he wrote his own. \"I just wanted something I could play with my friends at a reasonable price, with reasonable equipment,\u201d he said.<ref name=dragon /> The first edition of ''Tunnels & Trolls'' was self-published in April 1975.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.garenewing.co.uk/tnt/interview.html| year = 1986| title = The Ken St Andre/Demon Issue Interview}}</ref> In June 1975, publisher Flying Buffalo Inc. released a second edition of the game, and Tunnels & Trolls quickly became D&D's biggest competitor.<ref name=ODaM>{{cite book | first=David M. | last=Ewalt | authorlink= David M.

This edition was also translated and published abroad in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]],<ref>In Germany ''Tunnels & Trolls'' was released as ''Schwerter & D\u00e4monen'' in September 1983, two months earlier than ''Dungeons & Dragons'', it was the very first roleplaying game available in German.<br/>{{cite book|last = Evers|first = Momo|title=Magische Zeiten|edition=1st|date=January 2005|publisher=[[Fantasy Productions]]|language=German|isbn=3-89064-516-X}}<br/>{{cite book|last=[[Ken St. Andre]] |first=Rick Loomis|title=Schwerter & D\u00e4monen|edition=1st|date=September 1983|publisher=[[Fantasy Productions]]|language=German|isbn=3-89064-000-1}}</ref> [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], and it entered these markets before ''Dungeons & Dragons'' did in most cases.\n\nIn 1999 ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' magazine named ''Tunnels & Trolls'' as one of ''The Millennium's Most Underrated Games''.  Editor [[Scott Haring]] said of the game \"everybody knows this was the second ever fantasy roleplaying game ... But to dismiss it as just an opportunistic ripoff would be grossly unfair. Flying Buffalo's ''T&T'' had its own zany feel \u2013 it was much less serious than ''D&D'' \u2013 and a less-complicated game system.\"<ref>{{cite journal| title=Second Sight: The Millennium's Most Influential Company and The Millennium's Most Underrated Game|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] (online)|last=Haring| first=Scott D. |authorlink=Scott Haring | url= http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=1240| date=1999-11-25| accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, [[Flying Buffalo]] updated the 5th edition rules with a \"5.5\" publication that added about 40 pages of extra material. That same year, [[Fiery Dragon Productions]] produced a ''30th Anniversary Edition'' under license in a tin box complete with CD, map, and monster counters, and two new versions of the rules. Ken St. Andre used the opportunity to extensively update the style of play and introduce new role-playing concepts, such as character level determined by character attribute statistics instead of arbitrary numbers of experience points. The ''30th Anniversary'' rules are generally known as the 7th edition. One of the most significant innovations of 7th edition is the introduction of a skills system. The 7.5 edition was released in 2008 by Fiery Dragon, being an update and clarification on the 30th Anniversary Edition.\n\nIn 2012, Tunnels & Trolls was re-introduced in French-speaking markets by [[Grimtooth]] under license by Flying Buffalo. The French rulebook, which is officially the 8th edition, is based on the 7th edition, but includes elements taken from the 5.5 edition as well as clarifications by Ken St. Andre. The interior artwork includes the illustrations of the 5th edition, plus new inks by [[Liz Danforth]]. Several other products (solos and GM adventures) have already been released via Lulu.com and others have been announced.\n\nThe production work for the 8th edition prompted Flying Buffalo to start working on a Deluxe (9th) Edition of the rulebook.<ref>[http://trollhalla.com/outer-sanctum/2012/07/31/announcing-tunnels-and-trolls-deluxe/ Ken St.Andre Announcing Tunnels and Trolls Deluxe] [http://www.trollishdelver.com/2012/03/deluxe-edition-of-tunnels-trolls.html?showComment=1331512511480&m=0#c5423708491776565668 Explanations on the context of the Deluxe edition project] by [[Liz Danforth]] and [[Steve Crompton]]</ref> As Rick Loomis, head of Flying Buffalo Inc., put it, \"The French edition came out so beautiful that now that I have run out of 5.5, I am not satisfied to just reprint 5.5. I wanted to have a deluxe edition even better than the French one. (Competition is what drives us to be better!)\".  ''Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls'', written by St. Andre with additional design input and editing from longtime players [[Liz Danforth]] and James \"Bear\" Peters, was published in August 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deluxetunnelsandtrolls.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/deluxe-tt-rules-now-available-to-all/|title=Deluxe T&T Rules Now Available to ALL!|date=July 22, 2015|author=SSCrompton|publisher=Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe 5th edition ''Tunnels & Trolls'' core ruleset does not detail a specific setting, saying only that gameplay occurs in \"a world somewhat but not exactly similar to Tolkien's [[Middle-earth|Middle Earth]].\" In an interview in 1986, Ken St. Andre stated that \"my conception of the ''T&T'' world was based on ''The Lord of The Rings'' as it would have been done by Marvel Comics in 1974 with [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]], [[Elric]], the [[Gray Mouser]] and a host of badguys thrown in.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garenewing.co.uk/tnt/interview.html |title=T&T Interviews |publisher=Garenewing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref>\n\nThe current Deluxe Edition includes Ken St. Andre's house campaign setting, Trollworld. Along with additional material by early players Jim \"Bear\" Peters and Liz Danforth.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Prime attributes===\nEight prime attributes define characters in ''Tunnels & Trolls'':\n\n*'''Strength (ST)''' determines which weapons the character can use and how much the character can carry. It also serves as magic points in 5th and earlier editions.\n*'''Intelligence (IQ)''' measures the character's ability to think and remember facts.\n*'''Luck (LK)''' affects combat results and saving throws.\n*'''Constitution (CON)''' measures how healthy the character is and how much damage the character can take before being killed.\n*'''Dexterity (DEX)''' represents agility, nimbleness and affects marksmanship.\n*'''Charisma (CHR)''' represents attractiveness and leadership ability.\n\nLater editions add the following prime attributes:\n\n*'''Wizardry (WIZ)''' replaces Strength for powering magic points. Also called '''Power (POW)''' in the 5.5 Edition.\n*'''Speed (SPD)''' represents reaction speed and, in some editions, movement rate.\n\nA new character begins with a randomly generated score for each attribute, determined by rolling three six-side dice.\n\n===Character races===\nThe rules recommend that novice players create human characters, but also offer the options of [[elves]], [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]], and [[hobbit]]s. Other races, like [[leprechaun]]s and [[fairy|fairies]], serve as additional character options. A character's race affects his or her attributes. A player may also choose to play as a \"monster race\" such as a zombie or vampire.\n\n===Character classes===\nPlayers also choose a character class for their character. The two base classes are Warriors and Wizards. Wizards can cast spells but have combat limitations. While Warriors cannot cast magic, they are allowed the full use of weapons and armor is twice as effective in blocking damage. Rogues and Warrior-Wizards are also available as character classes. These two classes both combine the abilities of the Warrior and the Wizard. Rogues in ''Tunnels & Trolls'' are not thieves, unlike the Rogue classes in ''[[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dungeons & Dragons]]'', but could be more accurately described as 'Rogue Wizards'. Rogues are limited in their spell-casting abilities, can utilize the full range of combat weapons and armor as a warrior but do not receive the Warrior's armor bonus or the Wizard's spell-creating ability. Warrior-Wizards are not so limited, but the player must be lucky with the dice when creating the character: high minimum attribute scores are required. Later editions include new classes such as Specialist Mage, Paragon (a renaming of the Warrior-Wizard), Leader, and Ranger.\n\n===Starting equipment and money===\nNew characters begin with a number of gold pieces determined by rolling three six-sided dice and multiplying the total by ten. These gold pieces can be used to buy weapons, armor, and other equipment.\n\n===Combat===\nCombat is handled by comparing dice rolls between a character and his opponent. Both sides roll a number of dice determined by which weapon is in use, then modify the appropriate result by \"personal adds\". Totals are compared, with the higher roll damaging the opposing combatant by the difference in totals. Armor absorbs this damage taken, and any amount remaining is subtracted from the Constitution attribute.\n\n''Tunnels & Trolls'' is unusual among roleplaying games in conducting mass combat resolution with one set of rolls, as the above system applies to combats between any number of opponents.\n\nPersonal adds are determined by Strength, Luck, and Dexterity. For every point above 12 possessed in each of these attributes, the character receives a one-point bonus to his personal adds. Similarly, for every point below 9 possessed in each of these attributes, the character receives a one-point penalty.\n\nIn the 7th Edition, the formula was changed to include Speed in the personal adds.  This also applies to the Deluxe Edition.\n\nThe 5.5, 7th and Deluxe edition include 'spite damage' whereby each \"6\" rolled on the combat dice causes a minimum of one damage to be inflicted on the opposing side, regardless of armor or the respective combat totals. This helped resolve the interminable stalemate that could occur between evenly matched, heavily armored opponents.\n\n===Saving rolls===\nThe Saving Roll (SR) is used during combat to break a stalemate or overcome the characters being outmatched as well as for use of ranged weapons. The SR is also used in all other tests of skill or luck the characters may be presented with by the GM or solo adventure. Checks are made using a character's attribute plus 2d6 (doubles add and roll over) against a difficulty level based on the task at hand. For every level of saving roll the formula is 15+5x, with x being the level of difficulty. This was one of the earliest uses of this mechanic in RPGs.\n\n==Reception==\nIn the third issue of ''[[The Space Gamer]]'', Brant Bates called the first edition of ''Tunnels & Trolls'' \"very playable, and a lot of fun\", and recommended it for fantasy fans who are \"not purists.\"<ref name=\"SG3\">{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=Brant |date=1975 |title=Tunnels and Trolls: A Review of Sorts|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Metagaming Concepts|Metagaming]]|issue=3|pages=16-17}}</ref> \n\nFive years later, in the March\u2013April 1980 edition of ''The Space Gamer'' (Issue 27), [[Steve Jackson (American game designer)|Steve Jackson]] said of the 5th edition, \"On the whole, a good book, worth the price for any adventure gamer just for the ideas and comments it holds. A ''must'' for anyone playing T&T with an earlier edition.\"<ref name=\"SG27\">{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Steve|authorlink=Steve Jackson (American game designer) |date=March\u2013April 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=27|pages=31}}</ref>\n\nThat same year, in the July 1980 edition of ''[[Ares (magazine)|Ares]]'' (Issue 3), [[Eric Goldberg (game designer)|Eric Goldberg]] dismissed the 5th edition as \"a pleasant puff piece\", although he agreed that since 1st edition, \"the production values have increased from amateur status to a nearly professional standard.\" However, he did not recommend it, saying, \"the game will be passed over by all but the completist; there are better buys on the market now.\" <ref name=\"ares\">{{cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Eric |author-link=Eric Goldberg (game designer) |date=July 1980 |title=Games|journal=[[Ares (magazine)|Ares]]|publisher=[[Simulations Publications, Inc.]]|issue=3|pages=33-34}}</ref>\n\nIn the August 1992 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue 184), [[Rick Swan]] liked several aspects of the 5th edition: \"What the combat system lacks in realism, it makes up for in simplicity and speed\" and \"Players... will find the magic system to be exceptionally clever.\" Swan criticized the imprecision of the rules, calling them \"a hairsplitter's delight\", as well as the simplicity of the monster ratings, which meant \"there\u2019s no meaningful distinction between fighting a giant slug and a drunken swordsman.\" But he concluded that the simplicity of the rules was its own virtue, especially for new players. \"The ''Tunnels & Trolls'' game is by no means the most sophisticated alternative to the ''D&D'' game \u2014 the ''AD&D'' game, the Avalon Hill Game Company's ''[[Runequest]]'' game, and even the new ''Lord of the Rings'' game are all better designs \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly the easiest to learn. A beginner should be able to master it in an afternoon, and a veteran will probably nail it in under an hour.\"<ref name=dragon>{{cite journal|last=Swan|first=Rick|authorlink=Rick Swan| date=August 1992 |title=Roleplaying Reviews|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=184|pages=74-76}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1996 reader poll undertaken by ''Arcane'' magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, ''Tunnels and Trolls'' was ranked 32nd. Paul Pettengale, the magazine's editor, called ''T&T'' \"pretty crude\", noting its early release, and said \"It's probably here for nostalgic reasons.\"<ref name=\"Arcane14\">{{cite journal|last= Pettengale|first=Paul|date= Christmas 1996 |title=Arcane Presents the Top 50 Roleplaying Games 1996|journal=Arcane|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|issue=14|pages=25-35}}</ref>\n\n==Reviews==\n*''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' #2\n*''[[Different Worlds]]'' #11\n\n==List of ''Tunnels & Trolls'' publications==\n''Tunnels & Trolls'' was also the first system to publish a series of fantasy-themed [[gamebook]]s - adventures which are designed to be played by one person, without the need for a referee. At least twenty such adventures were published by Flying Buffalo. The ''[[Fighting Fantasy]]'' series achieved great popularity using this format. Both ''T&T'''s simplicity and its reliance on use of six-sided dice (as compared to the various polyhedral dice used by Dungeons and Dragons) contributed to its success in this format.\n\n===Solo adventures===\n* ''Alice in Weirdworld'' by Joel Marler\n* ''[[Buffalo Castle]]'' by [[Rick Loomis]]\n* ''[[Deathtrap Equalizer Dungeon]]'' by Ken St. Andre\n* ''Labyrinth'' by Lee Russell\n* ''Naked Doom'' by Ken St. Andre\n* ''[[Dargon's Dungeon]]'' by Michael Stackpole\n* ''Weirdworld'' by Keith Abbott\n* ''[[Overkill (Flying Buffalo)|Overkill]]'' by Michael Stackpole\n* ''Beyond the Silvered Pane'' by James & Steven Marciniak\n* ''[[City of Terrors]]'' by Michael Stackpole\n* ''[[Sorcerer Solitaire]]'' by Walker Vaning\n* ''[[Sword for Hire (Flying Buffalo)|Sword for Hire]]'' by James Wilson\n* ''[[Arena of Khazan]]'' by Ken St. Andre\n* ''[[Sewers of Oblivion]]'' by Michael Stackpole\n* ''[[Sea of Mystery]]'' by Gienn Rahman\n* ''[[Blue Frog Tavern]]'' by James Wilson\n* ''[[Mistywood]]'' by Roy Cram Jr.\n* ''[[Gamesmen of Kasar]]'' by Roy Cram\n* ''[[Beyond the Wall of Tears]]'' by K.

In Ken St. Andre's editorial in the first issue (Winter 1978) the magazine was described as a \"'zine based around T&T specifically and fantasy role-playing in general\".\n\n===Reference publications===\nA number of books were published that support GMs by giving them ideas for \"traps\" and other tools for creating adventures when designing a dungeon or adventure.  One example is the [[Grimtooth's Traps]] series, authored by Paul O'Connor (and others), that is a listing of traps that GMs can insert into their adventures.\n\n===Spin-offs===\n''[[Monsters! Monsters!]]'' is a subset of the ''T&T'' rules tailored to playing monsters. It is fully compatible with 5th edition.

In 1939 he passed the entrance exams for the [[w:fr:\u00c9cole royale militaire (Belgique)|\u00c9cole Royale Militaire]] (ERM). After the campaign of 1940 followed about seven months as a prisoner of war in a German camp (an intervention of King Leopold III resulted in the release of the ERM-students).\n\nAt Ghent University (Belgium) van Meerhaeghe obtained a master's degree in Economic Sciences in 1944 (first diet: July) and a Masters in Political Science and Sociology, also in 1944 (second diet: September). As regards the economics studies he attended the lectures given by Professor Raoul Miry who was the counterpart of Professor [[Gaston Eyskens]] of the University of [[Leuven]].<ref>Bulletin d'Information et de Documentation, [[Banque Nationale de Belgique]], Vol. II, N\u00b0 1, July 1937, editorial by [[Louis Franck (politician)|Louis Franck]] (Governor), pp.&nbsp;1\u20136.</ref>\n\nIn 1946 he obtained his PhD: ''Aviation in the traffic economy : the Belgian case in particular''.\n\nIn 1947 he became part-time lecturer political economy at the [[w:fr:Universit\u00e9 coloniale de Belgique|Koloniale Hogeschool]] (Antwerp)<ref>M. van Meerhaeghe, ''De Economische Structuur van Belgisch-Kongo en Ruanda-Urundi'' (Ontwikkeling, Antwerp 1958).</ref> and in 1955 part-time lecturer colonial economy at the University of Ghent.\n\nBefore becoming Professor of economics and international economics at the [[Ghent University|University of Ghent]] in 1957,<ref>''Sartonia'' ([[George Sarton]] Chair of the History of Sciences), Volume 19 (Academia Press, Ghent 2006), pp.&nbsp;191\u2013193.</ref> he worked as economic advisor in the Belgian Ministry of Economic Affairs,<ref>In 1945 he had started using data about the local economic policy in the town of [[Mechelen]].</ref> as 'faculty advisor' of the [[NATO Defence College]] in Paris (1953\u201354) and as an advisor to the Minister of Foreign Trade.<ref>D.

He was in favor of operational economics, helpful to practitioners (''n\u00fctzlich'').<ref>Fernand Goyens, ''Marktgericht: Professor M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe, ekonomie, RUG'', Knack Magazine (16de jaargang), September 1th 1986 (Special edition), pp.&nbsp;24\u201326.</ref> Later he elaborated his criticism in ''Economic Theory. A Critic's Companion'' (Martinus Nijhoff 1980), probably his most important work. It caused quite a stir because of its unconventional approach. (K. Nakaura published a Japanese translation.) [[Guy Routh]] wrote a favourable review in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' (Vol. 91, No. 362, June 1981, p.&nbsp;591): \"Professor van Meerhaeghe's book is a masterpiece of condensation:<ref>Selectivity was indeed a characteristic of van Meerhaeghe: see e.g. the review of the textbook ''Economics'' of [[Richard Lipsey|R.G.

Six chapters deal with the main divisions of the subject (consumer behaviour, producer behaviour, price, income distribution, general level of income and prices, growth, and international trade), one with its practicability, one with its significance, and an appendix added that surveys thirteen types of theory. The preface modestly disclaims any intention of instructing fellow economists. The book is intended as a complement to an introductory course in economics. It is reminiscent of a surveyors report of a tumble-down house. It is unfit for human habitation, one would be mad to buy it, but one does, patches it up together as best one can, and inhabits it contentedly, gradually becoming inured to its defects. It is chastening to learn, from van Meerhaeghe's review, how deftly and how long ago the weaknesses of the economic edifice have been revealed. Mayer (1932),<ref>[[w:fr:Hans Mayer (\u00e9conomiste)|Hans Mayer]] (1879-1955) : ''Die Wirtschaftstheorie der Gegenwart'' (1927-32), ''Der Erkenntniswert der funktionellen Preistheorien'' (1932).</ref> Miry (1937), [[Robert Triffin|Triffin]] (1940) and many others produced cogent criticisms that, had they been heeded, would have helped to convert economics into an operational science. Instead, their names and doctrines have been forgotten, and we may be grateful to van Meerhaeghe for reminding us of them.\" G. Routh's conclusion is brief and to the point : \"This guarantees van Meerhaeghe's slim volume a long life. I fear that in ten years time its criticisms will be as valid and as relevant as they are today\". He proved to be something of an optimist: they remain as valid today as they did in 1981.<ref>E.g.

Relentlessly van Meerhaeghe insisted upon the necessity of knowledge of the historic backgrounds. Indeed, as history was his favoured subject area, since 1999 he was very active for the Annual [[Heilbronn]] Symposium in Economics and the Social Sciences<ref>A forum for the reconsideration of the traditions of the [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]].</ref> because it goes back to the old masters, i.e. the German classicists of the 19th (and even 18th) century. The German universities attracted many foreign students with a knowledge of German. Nowadays, some of these 'scholars' tend to invent theories which had already  been formulated in Germany during the 19th century. Hence the observation, made in ''Economic Theory'' (see above) that \u00abfar too often in economics, conclusions that were already formulated long ago are drawn triumphantly\u00bb (p.&nbsp;4).

Contrary to certain scholars van Meerhaeghe doesn't regard Nietzsche's views on economics as particularly sensational, even though there are certain aspects of his philosophy which could provide a better tool for economic analysis in some fields. \n* ''Bismarck and the social question'', Journal of Economic Studies, Sept. 2006, Vol. 33, Iss. 4, pp.&nbsp;284\u2013301.<ref>Paper presented at the 15th Heilbronn Symposion on \"The Social Question\", June 20\u201323, 2002.</ref> Discussing the political consequences of social welfare legislation, and in particular its effects on the ''Social Question''.

[[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|Justi]] might have been expected to adopt a protectionist and nationalist stance, but instead he comes across as an 'anti-Machiavelli' in his foreign-policy nostrums and a liberal in his views on foreign trade and population policy. \n* ''Is Montaigne a Utopian ?'', in ''The State as Utopia \u2013 Continental Approaches'', ed J.

Van Meerhaeghe examines the dominant political, social and economic trends of our time: multiculturalism and immigration versus patriotism and regionalism, capitalism versus state governance, America versus the rest of the world. He concludes a.o. that (a) Russia is a normal trade partner and a natural ally for Europe, and (b) nothing seems to stop the further triumphal procession of - undemocratic - globalisation.<ref>See also ''An Interview on International Economic Problems - Interview met Prof. Em.

This paper considers the factors that lead to the crisis from a specific perspective \u2013 essentially the absence of adequate regulation \u2013 and is informed by earlier research and by van Meerhaeghe's experience in banking and certain government institutions. Is capitalism the appropriate term when the entire financial system has to be saved by the public sector? Under capitalism, the investor must accept responsibility for the losses he incurs. But the banks received no advice from the universities, even though they were urgently pressed for such assistance. The EU countries have come to realize that the free movement of capital has come too early. With the [[Brexit]] looming, Van Meerhaeghe arguments for the Sterling to join the eurozone as soon as possible.\n\n==Opinions==\n\nIn 1972, at the anniversary conference meeting of the [[Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik]] Professor van Meerhaeghe noted:\n\n\"Die B\u00fccherbesprechungen in amerikanischen und franz\u00f6sischen Zeitschriften sind sehr unterschiedlich.

He was in favor of operational economics, helpful to practitioners (''n\u00fctzlich'').<ref>Fernand Goyens, ''Marktgericht: Professor M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe, ekonomie, RUG'', Knack Magazine (16de jaargang), September 1th 1986 (Special edition), pp.&nbsp;24\u201326.</ref> Later he elaborated his criticism in ''Economic Theory. A Critic's Companion'' (Martinus Nijhoff 1980), probably his most important work. It caused quite a stir because of its unconventional approach. (K. Nakaura published a Japanese translation.) [[Guy Routh]] wrote a favourable review in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' (Vol. 91, No. 362, June 1981, p.&nbsp;591): \"Professor van Meerhaeghe's book is a masterpiece of condensation:<ref>Selectivity was indeed a characteristic of van Meerhaeghe: see e.g. the review of the textbook ''Economics'' of [[Richard Lipsey|R.G. Lipsey]] and [[Peter O. Steiner|P.O. Steiner]] by H.J.

Six chapters deal with the main divisions of the subject (consumer behaviour, producer behaviour, price, income distribution, general level of income and prices, growth, and international trade), one with its practicability, one with its significance, and an appendix added that surveys thirteen types of theory. The preface modestly disclaims any intention of instructing fellow economists. The book is intended as a complement to an introductory course in economics. It is reminiscent of a surveyors report of a tumble-down house. It is unfit for human habitation, one would be mad to buy it, but one does, patches it up together as best one can, and inhabits it contentedly, gradually becoming inured to its defects. It is chastening to learn, from van Meerhaeghe's review, how deftly and how long ago the weaknesses of the economic edifice have been revealed. Mayer (1932),<ref>[[w:fr:Hans Mayer (\u00e9conomiste)|Hans Mayer]] (1879-1955) : ''Die Wirtschaftstheorie der Gegenwart'' (1927-32), ''Der Erkenntniswert der funktionellen Preistheorien'' (1932).</ref> Miry (1937), [[Robert Triffin|Triffin]] (1940) and many others produced cogent criticisms that, had they been heeded, would have helped to convert economics into an operational science. Instead, their names and doctrines have been forgotten, and we may be grateful to van Meerhaeghe for reminding us of them.\" G. Routh's conclusion is brief and to the point : \"This guarantees van Meerhaeghe's slim volume a long life. I fear that in ten years time its criticisms will be as valid and as relevant as they are today\". He proved to be something of an optimist: they remain as valid today as they did in 1981.<ref>E.g.

Relentlessly van Meerhaeghe insisted upon the necessity of knowledge of the historic backgrounds. Indeed, as history was his favoured subject area, since 1999 he was very active for the Annual [[Heilbronn]] Symposium in Economics and the Social Sciences<ref>A forum for the reconsideration of the traditions of the [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]].</ref> because it goes back to the old masters, i.e. the German classicists of the 19th (and even 18th) century. The German universities attracted many foreign students with a knowledge of German. Nowadays, some of these 'scholars' tend to invent theories which had already  been formulated in Germany during the 19th century. Hence the observation, made in ''Economic Theory'' (see above) that \u00abfar too often in economics, conclusions that were already formulated long ago are drawn triumphantly\u00bb (p.&nbsp;4). We mention :\n\n* ''The lost chapter of Schumpeter\u2019s \u2018Economic Development\u2019'' in ''Joseph Alo\u00efs Schumpeter. Entrepreneurship, style and vision'', ed. [[w:de:J\u00fcrgen Backhaus|J. Backhaus]], The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 1, Kluwer, Boston, Dordrecht, London 2003, pp.&nbsp;233\u2013244. M. van Meerhaeghe considers [[Schumpeter]] as \u2018superior\u2019 to [[Keynes]] because of his better knowledge of the economic science and his unsurpassed \u2018History of economic analysis\u2019.\n* ''[[Nietzsche]] and economics'' and ''Nietzsche and business ethics'', in ''Friedrich Nietzsche 1844-1900.

Contrary to certain scholars van Meerhaeghe doesn't regard Nietzsche's views on economics as particularly sensational, even though there are certain aspects of his philosophy which could provide a better tool for economic analysis in some fields. \n* ''Bismarck and the social question'', Journal of Economic Studies, Sept. 2006, Vol. 33, Iss. 4, pp.&nbsp;284\u2013301.<ref>Paper presented at the 15th Heilbronn Symposion on \"The Social Question\", June 20\u201323, 2002.</ref> Discussing the political consequences of social welfare legislation, and in particular its effects on the ''Social Question''. Otto von Bismarck (at some time ambassador for Prussia in Saint-Petersburg) did not expect that the Social Question could be solved within a generation or two (p.&nbsp;285). Although von Bismarck's position passed through many important alterations, one aim remains unchanged: guarantee the stability and social peace of the state.<ref>[[Patricia Owens (academic)|Patricia Owens]], ''From Bismarck to Petraeus: The question of the social and the Social Question in counterinsurgency'', [[European Journal of International Relations]], 2013, Vol. 19, Iss. 1, p. 148.</ref><ref>Prof. Enrico Colombatto, ''It was the Rule of Law: Will it be the Rule of Judges'', Journal of Entrepreneurial Economy, Vol. XV, Issue I, Podgorica May 2008, p. 32.</ref>\n* ''The international aspects of Justi\u2019s work'', in ''The beginnings of Political Economy. Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi'', ed. J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 7, Springer, New York 2009, pp.&nbsp;99\u2013110. [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|Justi]] might have been expected to adopt a protectionist and nationalist stance, but instead he comes across as an 'anti-Machiavelli' in his foreign-policy nostrums and a liberal in his views on foreign trade and population policy. \n* ''Is Montaigne a Utopian ?'', in ''The State as Utopia \u2013 Continental Approaches'', ed J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 9, Springer, 2011, pp.&nbsp;67\u201376. Van Meerhaeghe refutes the idea that [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] would have been a 'famous utopian': no, he was the founder of modern scepticism.  \n* ''Mature Cameralism According to [[w:de:Johann Friedrich von Pfeiffer|Pfeiffer]]'', in ''Physiocracy, Antiphysiocracy and Pfeiffer'', ed J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 10, Springer, 2011, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013147. Unfortunately there is a good deal of terminological confusion on display. Cameralism is the German version of mercantilism; trade requires freedom. [[Adam Smith]]'s criticism of mercantilism is wrong.\n* ''The Austrian and German \"Economist\" in the interwar period: international aspects'', in ''The beginnings of Scholarly Economic Journalism'', ed.

Van Meerhaeghe examines the dominant political, social and economic trends of our time: multiculturalism and immigration versus patriotism and regionalism, capitalism versus state governance, America versus the rest of the world. He concludes a.o. that (a) Russia is a normal trade partner and a natural ally for Europe, and (b) nothing seems to stop the further triumphal procession of - undemocratic - globalisation.<ref>See also ''An Interview on International Economic Problems - Interview met Prof. Em.

This paper considers the factors that lead to the crisis from a specific perspective \u2013 essentially the absence of adequate regulation \u2013 and is informed by earlier research and by van Meerhaeghe's experience in banking and certain government institutions. Is capitalism the appropriate term when the entire financial system has to be saved by the public sector? Under capitalism, the investor must accept responsibility for the losses he incurs. But the banks received no advice from the universities, even though they were urgently pressed for such assistance. The EU countries have come to realize that the free movement of capital has come too early. With the [[Brexit]] looming, Van Meerhaeghe arguments for the Sterling to join the eurozone as soon as possible.\n\n==Opinions==\n\nIn 1972, at the anniversary conference meeting of the [[Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik]] Professor van Meerhaeghe noted:\n\n\"Die B\u00fccherbesprechungen in amerikanischen und franz\u00f6sischen Zeitschriften sind sehr unterschiedlich.

Dort ist man ziemlich hart. Man kann dasselbe sagen von Diskussionen und Korreferaten.

He was the second surviving son of King [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]]. In his childhood he had a claim on the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]; however, he never ruled there. He was granted all the lands of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] in 1265, and from 1267 he was titled [[Earl of Leicester]]. In that year he also began to rule [[Lancashire]], but he did not take the title [[Earl of Lancaster]] until 1276. Between 1276 and 1284 he governed the counties of Champagne and Brie with his second wife, [[Blanche of Artois]], in the name of her daughter [[Joan I of Navarre|Joan]], and he was described in the English patent rolls as earl of Lancaster and Champagne.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His nickname, \"Crouchback\" (meaning \"cross-back\"), refers to his participation in the [[Ninth Crusade]].<ref>Simon Lloyd, \"Edmund , first earl of Lancaster and first earl of Leicester (1245\u20131296)\", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008).</ref>\n\n==Life==\nEdmund was born in London, a son of [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]]. He was a younger brother of [[Edward I of England|Edward&nbsp;I]], [[Margaret of England|Margaret]], and [[Beatrice of England|Beatrice]], and an elder brother of [[Katherine of England|Catherine]].\n\nHe was invested ruler of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] by the Bishop of Bologna in 1255, on behalf of [[Pope Alexander IV]]. In return, his father undertook to pay the papacy 135,541 marks and fight a war to dislodge the [[Hohenstaufen]] king [[Manfred of Sicily|Manfred]]. Henry's barons refused to contribute to what they called the \"Sicilian business\", and ultimately Henry was only able to pay 60,000 marks. [[Steven Runciman]] says the grant of the kingdom was revoked by Pope Alexander IV on 18 December 1258;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Runciman|first1=Steven|title=The Sicilian Vespers|url=https://archive.org/details/sicilianvesperst00runc|url-access=registration|date=1958|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sicilianvesperst00runc/page/59 59\u201363]}}</ref> Baines and Harland state that this occurred in 1263, under [[Pope Urban IV]].\n\nHowever, Edmund soon obtained important possessions and dignities, for soon after the forfeiture of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]] on 25 October 1265, Edmund received the [[Earl of Leicester|Earldom of Leicester]]{{r|Baines}} and later that of [[Earl of Lancaster|Lancaster]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Edmund, Earl of Lancaster|volume=8|pages=948-949}}</ref> He was granted the honour of the [[Lord High Steward|Stewardship]] of England and the lands of [[Nicolas de Segrave]]. He also acquired the estates of [[Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby]], that included the Honour of Hinckley Castle.\n\nIn 1267, Edmund was granted the lordship of [[Builth Wells]], in opposition to the then holder, [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] (the last prince of an independent Wales). To help him conquer the land, he was also granted his elder brother's lordships of the Trilateral of [[Skenfrith]], [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire|Grosmont]] and [[White Castle (Wales)|White Castle]], all in [[Monmouthshire]], together with [[Monmouth]]. After the civil war in 1267, he was appointed [[High Sheriff of Lancashire]]. Henry III created his second son Earl of Leicester in 1267, granting the honour and privileges of that city. The following year he was made Constable of [[Leicester Castle]], a royal possession in the king's name. Crouchback by now had a reputation as a ruthless and ferocious warrior, but he was not in England fighting de Montfort.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rothero|first1=Christopher|title=The Scottish and Welsh Wars 1250\u20131400|publisher=Osprey Publishing|date=1984|pages=32}}</ref>\n\nIn 1271, Edmund accompanied his elder brother Edward on the [[Ninth Crusade]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Some historians, including the authors of the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] article on him, state that it was because of this that he received the nickname 'Crouchback' (which means \"cross-back\"), indicating that he was entitled to wear a cross stitched into the back of his garments.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Heylin |first1=Peter |title=Cosmographie |date=1652 |pages=110 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEZpAAAAcAAJ |accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn his return from the Crusade of 1271\u20132, he seems to have made [[Grosmont Castle]] his favoured home and undertook much rebuilding there. His son [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]] was apparently born there in 1281.\n\nEdmund remained loyal to his brother, Edward I; the Charter grants of 1265, 1267, and 1268\u20139 were confirmed by the King in a document of ''Inspeximus'' in 1284, and by Parliament in the Great Charter of Leicester.<ref>\"Fourteenth century England\" vol. VII, p.137.</ref> Also in 1284, on the marriage of his stepdaughter, he renounced the title of earl of Champagne, although he continued in possession of his wife's [[dowry|dowerlands]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Edmund frequently acted as an ambassador abroad. He was sent as Governor of [[Ponthieu]] in 1291, on behalf of his second wife, [[Blanche of Artois]].\n\nHis duty to the church included the foundation of a Nuns of Clara or [[Poor Clares]] nunnery at [[Minories]], St Aldate's. In 1291, his estate paid for the establishment for the [[Savoy Chapel|Chapel of Savoy]], in memory of his mother, near [[St Clement Danes]]. Filial piety was part of the chivalric code of an honourable knight. Edmund was a generous benefactor to the monastery of Grace Dieu in Leicestershire, and to the nuns at [[Tarrant Abbey|Tarrant Crawford]]. He also helped establish a major [[Franciscan|Greyfriars]] monastery at [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in the duchy of Lancaster.\n\nIn 1281, he supervised the construction of [[Aberystwyth Castle]] for King Edward I to subjugate the Welsh. The following year Edmund accompanied [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer|Roger Mortimer]] on campaign against Llywelyn, defeating and capturing the prince.\n\nIn 1294 the French king, [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], through trickery, defrauded King Edward out of his lands in [[Gascony]]. Edward immediately began to plan an invasion, but ran into difficulties. First, some of the Welsh rebelled against him, then the Scots rebelled. Finally, by the end of 1295, he was ready to take up the conflict with Philip. He wanted to send Edmund to lead a small force ahead of the main army he was gathering, but Edmund fell ill in that autumn and was unwell until Christmas. Finally Edmund was able to go to [[Bordeaux]] for his brother.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Mark|title=A Great and Terrible King: Edward I and the Forging of Britain|date=2015|chapter=\"Chapter 9\"}}</ref> Amongst the nobles{{r|Baines|p=123}} was the Earl of Lincoln and 26 [[Knight banneret|banneret knights]]. During the siege of [[Bayonne]] the English ran out of money, so the army melted into the countryside. Broken-hearted, the warrior-prince Edmund Crouchback died on 5 June. His body was carried to England and was interred on 15 July 1296 at [[Westminster Abbey]], London.\n\n==Family==\nEdmund married firstly on 8 April 1269 [[Aveline de Forz, Countess of Aumale|Aveline de Forz]], daughter of [[William de Forz, 4th Earl of Albemarle]] and [[Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon]].

He was the second surviving son of King [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]]. In his childhood he had a claim on the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]; however, he never ruled there. He was granted all the lands of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] in 1265, and from 1267 he was titled [[Earl of Leicester]]. In that year he also began to rule [[Lancashire]], but he did not take the title [[Earl of Lancaster]] until 1276. Between 1276 and 1284 he governed the counties of Champagne and Brie with his second wife, [[Blanche of Artois]], in the name of her daughter [[Joan I of Navarre|Joan]], and he was described in the English patent rolls as earl of Lancaster and Champagne.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His nickname, \"Crouchback\" (meaning \"cross-back\"), refers to his participation in the [[Ninth Crusade]].<ref>Simon Lloyd, \"Edmund , first earl of Lancaster and first earl of Leicester (1245\u20131296)\", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008).</ref>\n\n==Life==\nEdmund was born in London, a son of [[Henry III of England]] and [[Eleanor of Provence]]. He was a younger brother of [[Edward I of England|Edward&nbsp;I]], [[Margaret of England|Margaret]], and [[Beatrice of England|Beatrice]], and an elder brother of [[Katherine of England|Catherine]].\n\nHe was invested ruler of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] by the Bishop of Bologna in 1255, on behalf of [[Pope Alexander IV]]. In return, his father undertook to pay the papacy 135,541 marks and fight a war to dislodge the [[Hohenstaufen]] king [[Manfred of Sicily|Manfred]]. Henry's barons refused to contribute to what they called the \"Sicilian business\", and ultimately Henry was only able to pay 60,000 marks. [[Steven Runciman]] says the grant of the kingdom was revoked by Pope Alexander IV on 18 December 1258;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Runciman|first1=Steven|title=The Sicilian Vespers|url=https://archive.org/details/sicilianvesperst00runc|url-access=registration|date=1958|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sicilianvesperst00runc/page/59 59\u201363]}}</ref> Baines and Harland state that this occurred in 1263, under [[Pope Urban IV]].\n\nHowever, Edmund soon obtained important possessions and dignities, for soon after the forfeiture of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]] on 25 October 1265, Edmund received the [[Earl of Leicester|Earldom of Leicester]]{{r|Baines}} and later that of [[Earl of Lancaster|Lancaster]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Edmund, Earl of Lancaster|volume=8|pages=948-949}}</ref> He was granted the honour of the [[Lord High Steward|Stewardship]] of England and the lands of [[Nicolas de Segrave]]. He also acquired the estates of [[Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby]], that included the Honour of Hinckley Castle.\n\nIn 1267, Edmund was granted the lordship of [[Builth Wells]], in opposition to the then holder, [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] (the last prince of an independent Wales). To help him conquer the land, he was also granted his elder brother's lordships of the Trilateral of [[Skenfrith]], [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire|Grosmont]] and [[White Castle (Wales)|White Castle]], all in [[Monmouthshire]], together with [[Monmouth]]. After the civil war in 1267, he was appointed [[High Sheriff of Lancashire]]. Henry III created his second son Earl of Leicester in 1267, granting the honour and privileges of that city. The following year he was made Constable of [[Leicester Castle]], a royal possession in the king's name. Crouchback by now had a reputation as a ruthless and ferocious warrior, but he was not in England fighting de Montfort.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rothero|first1=Christopher|title=The Scottish and Welsh Wars 1250\u20131400|publisher=Osprey Publishing|date=1984|pages=32}}</ref>\n\nIn 1271, Edmund accompanied his elder brother Edward on the [[Ninth Crusade]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Some historians, including the authors of the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] article on him, state that it was because of this that he received the nickname 'Crouchback' (which means \"cross-back\"), indicating that he was entitled to wear a cross stitched into the back of his garments.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Heylin |first1=Peter |title=Cosmographie |date=1652 |pages=110 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEZpAAAAcAAJ |accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn his return from the Crusade of 1271\u20132, he seems to have made [[Grosmont Castle]] his favoured home and undertook much rebuilding there. His son [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]] was apparently born there in 1281.\n\nEdmund remained loyal to his brother, Edward I; the Charter grants of 1265, 1267, and 1268\u20139 were confirmed by the King in a document of ''Inspeximus'' in 1284, and by Parliament in the Great Charter of Leicester.<ref>\"Fourteenth century England\" vol.

He was sent as Governor of [[Ponthieu]] in 1291, on behalf of his second wife, [[Blanche of Artois]].\n\nHis duty to the church included the foundation of a Nuns of Clara or [[Poor Clares]] nunnery at [[Minories]], St Aldate's. In 1291, his estate paid for the establishment for the [[Savoy Chapel|Chapel of Savoy]], in memory of his mother, near [[St Clement Danes]].

They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium]] in [[San Francisco]] by Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]], and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the [[iPhone 6S|iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus]] as the flagship devices in the [[iPhone]] series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] on September 22, 2017, and the [[iPhone X]] on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe iPhone 7's overall design is similar to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6. Changes introduced included new color options (matte black and jet black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|headphone jack]]. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] [[quad-core processor|quad-core]] [[system-on-chip]] with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12&nbsp;[[megapixel]] rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional [[telephoto lens]] exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode.\n\nReception of the iPhone 7 was mixed. Although reviewers noted the improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, they also stated that iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing for flagship smartphones surpassed the quality of iPhone 7.{{Citation needed|reason=Please cite reviews/reviewers|date=July 2019}}\n\nMany reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]] and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for [[Phil Schiller]]'s statement that such a drastic change required \"courage.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 7 was discontinued and removed from Apple's website after its annual September hardware event on September 10, 2019.\n\n== History ==\nPrior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumored. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[headphone jack]] received significant media attention.{{refn|<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple May Replace 3.5mm Headphone Jack on

Gordon Kelly of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted that rival smartphones, such as the [[Samsung Galaxy S7]], had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and [[Nexus 6P]]. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the [[iPhone 6]] and [[iPhone 6S]], was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that \"the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display\".<ref name=\"Forbes review\">{{cite web |first=Gordon |last=Kelly |title=iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus Review: Should You Upgrade? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/09/21/apple-iphone-7-vs-iphone-7-plus-review-should-you-upgrade/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNilay Patel of ''[[The Verge]]'' described the devices as being \"full of aggressive breaks from convention\" despite their design continuity with previous models (going as far as dubbing them \"a prototype of [[iPhone X|next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign]] disguised as an iPhone 6\"), citing the headphone jack removal (which he felt was an attempt to encourage the use of [[AirPods|wireless headphones]]), [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] CPU, and home button redesign. The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit \"not as insane\" as the [[quad HD]] displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the \"first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years\" (as opposed to the \"gimmick\" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a \"step\" above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple \"took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem.\" Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were \"legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal.

They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium]] in [[San Francisco]] by Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]], and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the [[iPhone 6S|iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus]] as the flagship devices in the [[iPhone]] series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] on September 22, 2017, and the [[iPhone X]] on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe iPhone 7's overall design is similar to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6. Changes introduced included new color options (matte black and jet black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|headphone jack]]. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] [[quad-core processor|quad-core]] [[system-on-chip]] with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12&nbsp;[[megapixel]] rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional [[telephoto lens]] exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode.\n\nReception of the iPhone 7 was generally negative. Although reviewers noted the improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, they also stated that iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing for flagship smartphones surpassed the quality of iPhone 7.{{Citation needed|reason=Please cite reviews/reviewers|date=July 2019}}\n\nMany reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]] and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for [[Phil Schiller]]'s statement that such a drastic change required \"courage.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 7 was discontinued and removed from Apple's website after its annual September hardware event on September 10, 2019.\n\n== History ==\nPrior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumored. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[headphone jack]] received significant media attention.{{refn|<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple May Replace 3.5mm Headphone Jack on

Gordon Kelly of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted that rival smartphones, such as the [[Samsung Galaxy S7]], had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and [[Nexus 6P]]. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the [[iPhone 6]] and [[iPhone 6S]], was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that \"the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display\".<ref name=\"Forbes review\">{{cite web |first=Gordon |last=Kelly |title=iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus Review: Should You Upgrade? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/09/21/apple-iphone-7-vs-iphone-7-plus-review-should-you-upgrade/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNilay Patel of ''[[The Verge]]'' described the devices as being \"full of aggressive breaks from convention\" despite their design continuity with previous models (going as far as dubbing them \"a prototype of [[iPhone X|next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign]] disguised as an iPhone 6\"), citing the headphone jack removal (which he felt was an attempt to encourage the use of [[AirPods|wireless headphones]]), [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] CPU, and home button redesign. The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit \"not as insane\" as the [[quad HD]] displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the \"first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years\" (as opposed to the \"gimmick\" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a \"step\" above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple \"took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem.\" Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were \"legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal.

{"title_page": "Acellular dermis", "text_new": "'''Acellular dermis''' is a type of [[biomaterial]] derived from processing human or animal tissues to remove cells and retain portions of the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM).  These materials are typically cell-free, distinguishing them from classical [[allografts]] and [[xenografts]], can be integrated or incorporated into the body, and have been FDA approved for human use for more than 10 years in a wide range of clinical indications.<ref name=\"general source\">Cornwell, K.G., Landsman, A., James, K.S. ''Extracellular Matrix Biomaterials for Soft Tissue Repair.'' Clin Podiatr Med Surg 26 (2009) 507\u2013523 [http://www.podiatric.theclinics.com/article/S0891-8422(09)00068-8/abstract (Original Article)]</ref>\n\n==Harvesting and processing==\nAll ECM samples originate from mammalian tissues, such as dermis, pericardium, and small intestinal submucosa (SIS).<ref name=\"general source\" /> After explantation from the source, the ECM biomaterial retains some characteristics of the original tissue.<ref name=\"general source\" /> The ECM tissues can be harvested from varying stages in the developmental stages in mammalian species such as human, porcine, equine, and bovine.<ref name=\"general source\" /> Although they are similarly composed of fibril collagen, the microstructure, specific composition (including presence of noncollageous protein and glycosaminoglycans and ratio of different types of collagen), physical dimensions and mechanical properties can differ.<ref name=\"general source\" /> Depending on the developmental stage of the tissue during which harvesting occurred, the microstructure can vary within an organism. Additionally, keeping in mind the size and shape of the final tissue, the potential of the physical dimensions of the tissue of origin must be considered.<ref name=\"general source\" />\n\nDespite this \u201cmemory\u201d of the ECM tissue, methods have been engineered so that these innate characteristics can be modified, saved or removed.<ref name=\"general source\" /> The modification process varies depending on the material used in clinical setting. Some ECM biomaterials undergo a modification that removes all the cells but leaves the remainder of the other ECM components called [[decellularization]]. Another process that can be introduced into the biomaterial is artificial crosslinking. Artificial crosslinking has been shown to stabilize reconstituted collagen, which can rapidly degenerate in vivo.<ref name=\"general source\" /> Although mechanical strength is gained, the artificial crosslinks that are added increase the chance for a host-cell rejection, due to its foreign origin.<ref name = \"Host response\">[http://www.mirm.pitt.edu/badylak/projects/projects.Host.asp Badylak S. \"Host Response to Biomaterials\"]</ref> Due to this complication, intentional crosslinking is no longer practiced as more recent advancements have been made that increase the lifespan of the collagen without the use of artificial stabilization. Finally, to ensure the ECM biomaterial is without infectious [[bacteria]] and [[viruses]], most are terminally sterilized.<ref name=\"general source\" /> This can include ethylene oxide (EO) gas, gamma irradiation, or electron beam (e-beam) irradiation as the sterilizing agent.<ref name=\"general source\" /> In all, the small variances from origin, time of harvest, and processing method can direct the final properties of the ECM biomaterial.\n\nDecellularized ECM biomaterials can be further processed into a fine powder and then lyophilized ([[freeze-dried]]). This powder can then be mixed with [[collagenase]] to form an ECM derived hydrogel ([[self-healing hydrogels]]). These hydrogels are then used in cell culture to help maintain cell [[phenotype]] and increase cell proliferation. Cells cultured on ECM hydrogels maintain their phenotype better than cells cultured on other substrates such as [[matrigel]] or type 1 [[collagen]].<ref name=\"hydrogel1\">Wolf MT, et al. \"A hydrogel derived from decellularized dermal extracellular matrix\"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22789723]</ref><ref name=\"hydrogel2\">Sawkins MJ, et al. \"Hydrogels derived from demineralized and decellularized bone extracellular matrix\"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23624219]</ref> Though hydrogels do not yet have direct clinical relevance, they have shown promise as a method of assisting in organ regeneration.<ref name=\"hydrogel1\" /><ref name=\"hydrogel2\" /><ref>Barker TH \"The role of ECM proteins and protein fragments in guiding cell behavior in regenerative medicine\"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21515169]</ref>\n\nSimilarly, whole organs can be [[decellularized]] to create 3-D ECM scaffolds.<ref name=\"Denver\">Faulk DM, et al. \"Role of the extracellular matrix in whole organ engineering\" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24347365]</ref> These scaffolds can then be re-cellularized in an attempt to regenerate whole organs for transplant. This method works primarily for organs with a complex [[vasculature]], as it allows detergent to be fully perfused through the material.<ref name=\"Denver\" />\n\n==Host/implant interactions==\nWound healing of the skin and tendons is a complex coordinated process in the body that happens slowly over weeks or even years. A number of products in the market today aim to affect this process positively, although little data is available on their success. The majority of products are still in the development phases where the (often inflammatory) interactions between the host and the implanted devices are being assessed.\n\nImplanted ECM biomaterials fall into two general categories based on how they interact with the host. Incorporating devices eventually allow the growth of cells and passage of blood vessels through the matrix, whereas nonincorporating biomaterials are encapsulated by a wall of fused macrophages. In nonincorporating biomaterials such as Permacol, an acellular porcine dermal implant for hernia repair, it is important that the material is not degraded or infiltrated by the [[immune system]].<ref name=\"general source\" /><ref>Faulk DM, et al. \"ECM hydrogel coating mitigates the chronic inflammatory response to polypropylene mesh.\"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25043571]</ref> Encapsulated biomaterials that are recognized as foreign can be degraded and/or rejected by the body and migrate to the outside of the body.\nIn incorporated ECM biomaterials, infiltration by the immune system can occur in as few as seven days, leading to rapid degradation of the device volume. In the case of Graftjacket, an allograft from human dermis, the matrix is quickly populated by host cells as [[vasculature]]. The device itself decreased more than 60% in volume, and is replaced with host fibroblasts and macrophages.<ref name=\"general source\" /><ref>[Graft Jacket [http://www.graftjacketbykci.com/clinicalevidence.html]</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nECM biomaterials are used to promote healing in a number of tissues, especially the skin and tendons. Surgimend, a collagen matrix derived from fetal bovine dermis, can trigger the healing of tendons (which do not heal spontaneously) in the ankle. This intervention can shorten healing time by almost half and allows the patient to return to full activity much sooner.<ref>[http://www.teibio.com/products/by-brand/surgimend/ Tei Biosciences]</ref> Open wounds, like tendons, do not spontaneously heal and can persist for long stretches of time. When ECM biomaterials are added in multiple layers to the ulcer, the wound begins to close quickly and generates host tissue. Although preliminary studies seem promising, little information is available on the success of and direct comparisons between different ECM biomaterial devices in human trials.<ref name=\"general source\" />\n\nAlloderm, an acellular dermis derived from the skin of donated [[cadavers]],<ref name=NYT2003>Naomi Freundlich for the New York Times.

These materials are typically cell-free, distinguishing them from classical [[allografts]] and [[xenografts]], can be integrated or incorporated into the body, and have been FDA approved for human use for more than 10 years in a wide range of clinical indications.<ref name=\"general source\">Cornwell, K.G., Landsman, A., James, K.S. ''Extracellular Matrix Biomaterials for Soft Tissue Repair.'' Clin Podiatr Med Surg 26 (2009) 507\u2013523 [http://www.podiatric.theclinics.com/article/S0891-8422(09)00068-8/abstract (Original Article)]</ref>\n\n==Harvesting and processing==\nAll ECM samples originate from mammalian tissues, such as dermis, pericardium, and small intestinal submucosa (SIS).<ref name=\"general source\" /> After explantation from the source, the ECM biomaterial retains some characteristics of the original tissue.<ref name=\"general source\" /> The ECM tissues can be harvested from varying stages in the developmental stages in mammalian species such as human, porcine, equine, and bovine.<ref name=\"general source\" /> Although they are similarly composed of fibril collagen, the microstructure, specific composition (including presence of noncollageous protein and glycosaminoglycans and ratio of different types of collagen), physical dimensions and mechanical properties can differ.<ref name=\"general source\" /> Depending on the developmental stage of the tissue during which harvesting occurred, the microstructure can vary within an organism. Additionally, keeping in mind the size and shape of the final tissue, the potential of the physical dimensions of the tissue of origin must be considered.<ref name=\"general source\" />\n\nDespite this \u201cmemory\u201d of the ECM tissue, methods have been engineered so that these innate characteristics can be modified, saved or removed.<ref name=\"general source\" /> The modification process varies depending on the material used in clinical setting. Some ECM biomaterials undergo a modification that removes all the cells but leaves the remainder of the other ECM components called [[decellularization]]. Another process that can be introduced into the biomaterial is artificial crosslinking. Artificial crosslinking has been shown to stabilize reconstituted collagen, which can rapidly degenerate in vivo.<ref name=\"general source\" /> Although mechanical strength is gained, the artificial crosslinks that are added increase the chance for a host-cell rejection, due to its foreign origin.<ref name = \"Host response\">[http://www.mirm.pitt.edu/badylak/projects/projects.Host.asp Badylak S. \"Host Response to Biomaterials\"]</ref> Due to this complication, intentional crosslinking is no longer practiced as more recent advancements have been made that increase the lifespan of the collagen without the use of artificial stabilization. Finally, to ensure the ECM biomaterial is without infectious [[bacteria]] and [[viruses]], most are terminally sterilized.<ref name=\"general source\" /> This can include ethylene oxide (EO) gas, gamma irradiation, or electron beam (e-beam) irradiation as the sterilizing agent.<ref name=\"general source\" /> In all, the small variances from origin, time of harvest, and processing method can direct the final properties of the ECM biomaterial.\n\nDecellularized ECM biomaterials can be further processed into a fine powder and then lyophilized ([[freeze-dried]]). This powder can then be mixed with [[collagenase]] to form an ECM derived hydrogel ([[self-healing hydrogels]]). These hydrogels are then used in cell culture to help maintain cell [[phenotype]] and increase cell proliferation. Cells cultured on ECM hydrogels maintain their phenotype better than cells cultured on other substrates such as [[matrigel]] or type 1 [[collagen]].<ref name=\"hydrogel1\">Wolf MT, et al. \"A hydrogel derived from decellularized dermal extracellular matrix\"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22789723]</ref><ref name=\"hydrogel2\">Sawkins MJ, et al. \"Hydrogels derived from demineralized and decellularized bone extracellular matrix\"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23624219]</ref> Though hydrogels do not yet have direct clinical relevance, they have shown promise as a method of assisting in organ regeneration.<ref name=\"hydrogel1\" /><ref name=\"hydrogel2\" /><ref>Barker TH \"The role of ECM proteins and protein fragments in guiding cell behavior in regenerative medicine\"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21515169]</ref>\n\nSimilarly, whole organs can be [[decellularized]] to create 3-D ECM scaffolds.<ref name=\"Denver\">Faulk DM, et al. \"Role of the extracellular matrix in whole organ engineering\" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24347365]</ref> These scaffolds can then be re-cellularized in an attempt to regenerate whole organs for transplant. This method works primarily for organs with a complex [[vasculature]], as it allows detergent to be fully perfused through the material.<ref name=\"Denver\" />\n\n==Host/implant interactions==\nWound healing of the skin and tendons is a complex coordinated process in the body that happens slowly over weeks or even years. A number of products in the market today aim to affect this process positively, although little data is available on their success. The majority of products are still in the development phases where the (often inflammatory) interactions between the host and the implanted devices are being assessed.\n\nImplanted ECM biomaterials fall into two general categories based on how they interact with the host. Incorporating devices eventually allow the growth of cells and passage of blood vessels through the matrix, whereas nonincorporating biomaterials are encapsulated by a wall of fused macrophages. In nonincorporating biomaterials such as Permacol, an acellular porcine dermal implant for hernia repair, it is important that the material is not degraded or infiltrated by the [[immune system]].<ref name=\"general source\" /><ref>Faulk DM, et al. \"ECM hydrogel coating mitigates the chronic inflammatory response to polypropylene mesh.\"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25043571]</ref> Encapsulated biomaterials that are recognized as foreign can be degraded and/or rejected by the body and migrate to the outside of the body.\nIn incorporated ECM biomaterials, infiltration by the immune system can occur in as few as seven days, leading to rapid degradation of the device volume. In the case of Graftjacket, an allograft from human dermis, the matrix is quickly populated by host cells as [[vasculature]]. The device itself decreased more than 60% in volume, and is replaced with host fibroblasts and macrophages.<ref name=\"general source\" /><ref>[Graft Jacket [http://www.graftjacketbykci.com/clinicalevidence.html]</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nECM biomaterials are used to promote healing in a number of tissues, especially the skin and tendons. Surgimend, a collagen matrix derived from fetal bovine dermis, can trigger the healing of tendons (which do not heal spontaneously) in the ankle. This intervention can shorten healing time by almost half and allows the patient to return to full activity much sooner.<ref>[http://www.teibio.com/products/by-brand/surgimend/ Tei Biosciences]</ref> Open wounds, like tendons, do not spontaneously heal and can persist for long stretches of time. When ECM biomaterials are added in multiple layers to the ulcer, the wound begins to close quickly and generates host tissue. Although preliminary studies seem promising, little information is available on the success of and direct comparisons between different ECM biomaterial devices in human trials.<ref name=\"general source\" />\n\nAlloderm, an acellular dermis derived from the skin of donated [[cadavers]],<ref name=NYT2003>Naomi Freundlich for the New York Times.
