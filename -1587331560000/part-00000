The Welsh word \"Croeso\" means welcome and as the Welsh are Celts I suspect that there is a link. Successively known as ''Crozenc'' in 1208, Crozent in 1277, Crousant (1512) and the modern form \"Crozant\". <br>\nThe rocky outcrop between the [[Creuse River|Creuse]] and its tributary, the S\u00e9delle has been occupied since prehistoric times. A fortress appears to have been built between 997 and 1018. But it was in the 13th century that the castle we know today was built. One of the remaining towers bears the name of [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]], widow of [[King John I of England]], subsequently the wife of Hugues X de Lusignan.<br>\nIn his book on the history of the region ([[County of La Marche|La Marche]]), Joullietton reported that the castle at Crozant was taken by Catholics in 1588, which ruined one of the towers. From 1606, the castle served as a source of building material for the local people. Notes prepared in 1640, by the king\u2019s inspector at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]], Voyer d'Argenson, noted that the castle was in a sad state. The remains of the stronghold, which had belonged to the Crown since the confiscation of all the property of [[Charles III, Duke of Bourbon]], [[Constable of France]] in 1527, was then acquired by Gabriel Beaupr\u00e9, governor of [[County of La Marche|La Marche]]. <br>\nThe ruins of the citadel cover a large part of the spur, with several successive ramparts, a square 15th-century [[donjon]] and two 13th-century towers plus a chapel and a \"tour de l\u2019eau\u2019\u2019 from where water could be raised from the river whilst covered and safe from attack.<br>\nAt the end of lengthy negotiations led by the mayor of Crozant, the ruins were acquired a few years ago by the commune. A major reconstruction programme was undertaken, with funding from the state, regional and local councils, resulting in the reopening of the site to the public (\u20ac2 adults - \u20ac1.50 concessions (2008)).\n\nFrom the nineteenth century, the area around Crozant inspired many painters. Perhaps the first was Paul Castans (1823\u20131892), who inspired [[Armand Guillaumin]] (1841\u20131927), to choose Crozant as his residence of choice. They give birth to the [[Crozant School]] (in French, L'Ecole de Crozant), for all those who found inspiration by the shores of the Creuse. Among them were: Pierre Ballue (1855-1928), Ernest Josephson (1851\u20131906), [[Alfred Smith (artist)|Alfred Smith]] (1854 - 1932), Fernand Maillaud (1862\u20131948), Paul Madeline, Clementine Ballot (1880\u20131924), the Leloir dynasty (particularly Mauritius Leloir (1853\u20131940)), Swede Walter Oetten ( 1897\u20131972), Solange Christauflour (1900\u20131953), Ernest Victor Hareux and so on. Not far from the church there is a bronze bust of Guillaumin.\nIn 1926, the demand for electricity generation led to the creation of the [[Eguzon dam]]. This created a new tourist attraction known as Lake Chambon after the hamlet bordering [[\u00c9guzon]]. The painters\u2019 landscapes now included the lake, which also has boats for hire and dinner cruises around it.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" class=\"center\" heights=\"250\" widths=\"250\" >\nFile:Lille PdBA castan soiree octobre.JPG|''Soir\u00e9e d'octobre'', by Gustave Eug\u00e8ne Castan (1864).\nFile:MuMA - Guillaumin - Paysage de neige \u00e0 Crozant.JPG|''Paysage de neige \u00e0 Crozant'' (''Snow at Crozant''), by [[Armand Guillaumin]] (1895).\nFile:Smith Alfred - Crozant La S\u00e9delle en octobre (c 1923).jpg|''La S\u00e9delle en octobre'', by [[Alfred Smith (artist)|Alfred Smith]] (c. 1923.]\n</gallery>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the bridge separating the Creuse from [[Indre]] at Crozant was dynamited.

major shows produced that took place on January 22 and January 23, 2011 in [[Korakuen Hall]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]]. The event was the first ever co-promoted events between Japanese [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) and the Mexican [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) and features matches with wrestlers from both promotions and both NJPW and CMLL championships being defended.\n\nOn the first night NJPW wrestler [[Ryusuke Taguchi]] defeated [[M\u00e1scara Dorada]] to win the [[CMLL World Welterweight Championship]], marking the first time that a NJPW wrestler had won that particular title. Night one also saw NJPW representatives successfully defend the [[CMLL World Middleweight Championship]] and the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] against CMLL challengers. On night two [[La Sombra (wrestler)|La Sombra]], M\u00e1scara Dorada and [[La Mascara (wrestler)|La Mascara]]  successfully defended the [[CMLL World Trios Championship]] on the undercard while [[Apollo 55]] ([[Prince Devitt]] and [[Ryusuke Taguchi]]) defeated [[Golden\u2606Lovers]] ([[Kota Ibushi]] and [[Kenny Omega]]) bringing the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship]] back to the promotion after being held by the [[Dramatic Dream Team|DDT]] team since October 2010. Also on night two [[Tiger Mask IV|Tiger Mask]] defeated longtime rival [[Tomohiro Ishii]] in a ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', forcing Ishii to have his hair shaved off.\n\n==Background==\nEach of the events featured six [[professional wrestling matches]], some with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[script (recorded media)|scripted]] feuds or [[narrative thread|storylines]] while other matches were the first time some wrestlers faced off. The Fantastica Mania events was the result of several years of co-operation between [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]], which had seen both companies exchange wrestlers for various events.<ref name=SL398>{{cite news | author= Flores, Manuel | title= NJPW CMLL Presents Fantasticamania 2011 | work=[[Super Luchas]] | pages= 3\u20137 | id = Issue 398 | date= January 24,

All classes generally wore the same clothing, although distinctions among the social hierarchy began to become more noticeable through ornamented garments. Common pieces of clothing worn by peasants and the working class included plain tunics, cloaks, [[Jacket|jackets]], pants, and shoes. According to rank, embellishments adorned the collar of the tunic, waist or border. Examples of these decorations included, as [[James Planch\u00e9]] states, \"gold and silver chains and crosses, bracelets of gold, silver or ivory, golden and jeweled belts, strings of amber and other beads, rings, brooches, [and] buckles\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=|title=History of British Medieval Costume: From the Earliest Period to the Close of the Eighteenth Century.

It is possible to ban certain types of clothing in the workplace, as exemplified by the European Court of Justice's verdict that \"a ban on Islamic headscarves at work can be lawful.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=8b582c90-97f7-48cc-855c-af52f8edf4d7|title=Dress Codes and Religious Symbols at Work in the EU {{!}} Lexology|last=Langdon|first=Vedder Price PC-Esther|last2=Maude|first2=Jonathan|website=www.lexology.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===The Americas===\nThe [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] had a complex social hierarchy which consisted of slaves, commoners and nobles, with dress codes indicating these social distinctions. [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people]] in 1802-1805, describes how, after some time living there, [[Maquinna]] and the chiefs decided that he must now be \"considered one of them, and conform to their customs\". Jewitt resented the imposition of this dress code, finding the loose untailored garments very cold, and attributed to them a subsequent illness of which he almost died. He was not allowed to cut his hair, and had to paint his face and body as a Nootka would.<ref>''A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives.''[http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?id=328920feff&doc=90038 digital full text here] p161 onwards</ref>\n\n=== Muslim World ===\n{{Main|Haram#Clothing and adornment}}\n[[Islam]], founded in the 7th century CE, laid out rules regarding attire of both men and women in public.  Gold adornments and silk clothes are [[Haram|prohibited]] for men to wear, as they are luxurious, but they are permissible for women.  Men are also required to wear the ''[[Ihram clothing|ihram]]'' clothing while on [[Hajj]], or annual pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nIt is recommended in Islam for women to wear a [[hijab]] at all times when in public, as part of the Islamic standard of modesty.\n\n=== Indian Subcontinent ===\n[[Sikhism]], which was founded in the Indian subcontinent around the end of the 15th century also requires a dress code. Male [[Sikhs]], who are members of the [[Khalsa]] are required to wear a turban at all times.\n\n==Laws and social norms==\n{{Main|Clothing laws by country}}\n[[File:DDR Nude Beach model.jpg|thumb|Model of a nude beach in the DDR Museum, Berlin]]\nEach country has its own set of cultural values and norms. Wherever you go these norms and laws regarding clothing are subject to change depending on the region and culture. For example nudity is something that changes in acceptability depending on where you are. In [[New Guinea]] and [[Vanuatu]], there are areas where it is customary for the men to wear nothing but penis sheaths in public. Women wear [[string skirt|string skirts.]] In remote areas of [[Bali]], women may go [[toplessness|topless]]. This is uncommon in more western countries. Although in America and some parts of Europe, there are [[nude beach]]es.\n\nIn the United States, The Gender Nondiscrimination Act, prohibits employers, health care providers, and housing authorities from discriminating against people on the basis of gender.\n\n==Private dress codes==\n[[File:Black Tie-Regular LGE.jpg|thumb|upright|A visual on what Black Tie dress code looks like. ]]\nMany place have their own private dress code; these organisations may insist on particular dress codes or standards in particular situations. Such as for weddings, funerals, religious gatherings, etc.  \n\n=== Workplace ===\nEmployees are sometimes required to wear a [[uniform]] or certain standards of dress, such as a business suit or tie. This may depend on particular situations, for example if they are expected to interact with customers. (see also [[International standard business attire]]) \n\nIn western countries, these policies vary depending on the industry with [[lawyers]], [[bankers]], and [[Executive (management)|executives]] often wearing suit and tie. Some businesses observe that anti-discrimination laws restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Requiring men and women to dress differently at the workplace can be challenged because the gender-specific dress codes would be based on one sex and could be considered stereotypical.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/employeedressandappearance.aspx|website=Society for Human Resource Management|accessdate=27 September 2017|title = Employee Dress and Appearance}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Most businesses have authority in determining and establishing what workplace clothes they can require of their workers. Generally, a carefully drafted dress code applied consistently does not violate anti-discrimination laws.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm |title = Dress Code Legal Issues|website =  Personnel Policy Services Inc|last = Thomas|first = Robin|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160314064207/http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm|archivedate = 14 March 2016}}</ref> So long as the dress code does not favor one gender over the other it is usually acceptable by law for employers to have a private dress code.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.employmentlawfirms.com/resources/employment/discrimination/illegal-workplace-policy.htm|title=Illegal Workplace Policies: Appearance, Dress Codes, and Grooming Policies|website=www.employmentlawfirms.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Formal wear ===\nIn western countries, a \"formal\" or [[white tie]] dress code typically means tailcoats for men and full-length evening dresses for women. \"Semi-formal\" has a much less precise definition but typically means an evening jacket and tie for men (known as [[black tie]]) and a dress for women. \"Business casual\" typically means not wearing [[Necktie|neckties]] or [[Suit (clothing)|suits]], but wearing instead collared shirts, and trousers (not black, but more ''relaxed'', including things such as [[corduroy]]). \"Casual\" typically just means clothing for the torso, legs and shoes. \"Wedding Casual\" defines yet another mode of dress, where guests dress respectfully, but not necessarily fancily.\n\n=== Business casual ===\n{{Main|Business casual}}''Business casual'' dress is a popular workplace dress code that emerged in [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] workplaces in [[Western world|Western countries]] in the 1990s, especially in the United States and Canada. Many [[information technology]] businesses in [[Silicon Valley]] were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s and [[necktie]]s (the [[international standard business attire]]), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers.\n\nThe [[job search engine]] [[Monster.com]] offers this definition, \"In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together.\" A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue [[jeans]] and denim cloth clothing varies \u2014 some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.\n\n==Education system ==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=September 2019}}\nMany schools around the world implement dress codes in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to help influence a safer and more professional environment. \n\n=== United States education ===\nIn 1996, former U. S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced his support for the idea of [[school uniform]]s by stating, \u201cSchool uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.\u201d Many [[school district]]s in the United States took up the idea.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Sherry|title=Should Kids Wear School Uniforms?|url=http://www.eduguide.org/article/should-kids-wear-school-uniforms|publisher=EduGuide|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEven though dress code was created to positively affect schools, a common held belief in the U.S. is that the rules actually impede on students' right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being the [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]. The case was held because students wore black [[armband]]s to protest the Vietnam war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://education.findlaw.com/student-rights/school-dress-codes.html|title=School Dress Codes - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2017-12-08}}</ref>\n\n====Dress code violations====\nNon-communicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc.<ref name=\"Herbon, Beth 2000\">Herbon, Beth, and Jane E.

Dress codes are created out of social perceptions and norms, and vary based on purpose, circumstances, and occasions. Different societies and cultures are likely to have different dress codes, [[Western dress codes]] being a prominent example.\n\nDress codes are symbolic indications of different social ideas, including [[social class]], [[cultural identity]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards comfort, tradition, and political or religious affiliations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Europe===\n\n{{See also|Western dress codes|Sumptuary laws|English medieval clothing}}In seventh through the ninth centuries, the [[:Category:European nobility|European royalty and nobility]] used a dress code to differentiate themselves from other classes of people. All classes generally wore the same clothing, although distinctions among the social hierarchy began to become more noticeable through ornamented garments. Common pieces of clothing worn by peasants and the working class included plain tunics, cloaks, [[Jacket|jackets]], pants, and shoes. According to rank, embellishments adorned the collar of the tunic, waist or border. Examples of these decorations included, as [[James Planch\u00e9]] states, \"gold and silver chains and crosses, bracelets of gold, silver or ivory, golden and jeweled belts, strings of amber and other beads, rings, brooches, [and] buckles\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=|title=History of British Medieval Costume: From the Earliest Period to the Close of the Eighteenth Century.

It is possible to ban certain types of clothing in the workplace, as exemplified by the European Court of Justice's verdict that \"a ban on Islamic headscarves at work can be lawful.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=8b582c90-97f7-48cc-855c-af52f8edf4d7|title=Dress Codes and Religious Symbols at Work in the EU {{!}} Lexology|last=Langdon|first=Vedder Price PC-Esther|last2=Maude|first2=Jonathan|website=www.lexology.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===The Americas===\nThe [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] had a complex social hierarchy which consisted of slaves, commoners and nobles, with dress codes indicating these social distinctions. [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people]] in 1802-1805, describes how, after some time living there, [[Maquinna]] and the chiefs decided that he must now be \"considered one of them, and conform to their customs\". Jewitt resented the imposition of this dress code, finding the loose untailored garments very cold, and attributed to them a subsequent illness of which he almost died. He was not allowed to cut his hair, and had to paint his face and body as a Nootka would.<ref>''A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives.''[http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?id=328920feff&doc=90038 digital full text here] p161 onwards</ref>\n\n=== Muslim World ===\n{{Main|Haram#Clothing and adornment}}\n[[Islam]], founded in the 7th century CE, laid out rules regarding attire of both men and women in public.  Gold adornments and silk clothes are [[Haram|prohibited]] for men to wear, as they are luxurious, but they are permissible for women.  Men are also required to wear the ''[[Ihram clothing|ihram]]'' clothing while on [[Hajj]], or annual pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nIt is recommended in Islam for women to wear a [[hijab]] at all times when in public, as part of the Islamic standard of modesty.\n\n=== Indian Subcontinent ===\n[[Sikhism]], which was founded in the Indian subcontinent around the end of the 15th century also requires a dress code. Male [[Sikhs]], who are members of the [[Khalsa]] are required to wear a turban at all times.\n\n==Laws and social norms==\n{{Main|Clothing laws by country}}\n[[File:DDR Nude Beach model.jpg|thumb|Model of a nude beach in the DDR Museum, Berlin]]\nEach country has its own set of cultural values and norms. Wherever you go these norms and laws regarding clothing are subject to change depending on the region and culture. For example nudity is something that changes in acceptability depending on where you are. In [[New Guinea]] and [[Vanuatu]], there are areas where it is customary for the men to wear nothing but penis sheaths in public. Women wear [[string skirt|string skirts.]] In remote areas of [[Bali]], women may go [[toplessness|topless]]. This is uncommon in more western countries. Although in America and some parts of Europe, there are [[nude beach]]es.\n\nIn the United States, The Gender Nondiscrimination Act, prohibits employers, health care providers, and housing authorities from discriminating against people on the basis of gender.\n\n==Private dress codes==\n[[File:Black Tie-Regular LGE.jpg|thumb|upright|A visual on what Black Tie dress code looks like. ]]\nMany place have their own private dress code; these organisations may insist on particular dress codes or standards in particular situations. Such as for weddings, funerals, religious gatherings, etc.  \n\n=== Workplace ===\nEmployees are sometimes required to wear a [[uniform]] or certain standards of dress, such as a business suit or tie. This may depend on particular situations, for example if they are expected to interact with customers. (see also [[International standard business attire]]) \n\nIn western countries, these policies vary depending on the industry with [[lawyers]], [[bankers]], and [[Executive (management)|executives]] often wearing suit and tie. Some businesses observe that anti-discrimination laws restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Requiring men and women to dress differently at the workplace can be challenged because the gender-specific dress codes would be based on one sex and could be considered stereotypical.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/employeedressandappearance.aspx|website=Society for Human Resource Management|accessdate=27 September 2017|title = Employee Dress and Appearance}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Most businesses have authority in determining and establishing what workplace clothes they can require of their workers.

Many [[information technology]] businesses in [[Silicon Valley]] were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s and [[necktie]]s (the [[international standard business attire]]), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers.\n\nThe [[job search engine]] [[Monster.com]] offers this definition, \"In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together.\" A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue [[jeans]] and denim cloth clothing varies \u2014 some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.\n\n==Education system ==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=September 2019}}\nMany schools around the world implement dress codes in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to help influence a safer and more professional environment. \n\n=== United States education ===\nIn 1996, former U. S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced his support for the idea of [[school uniform]]s by stating, \u201cSchool uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.\u201d Many [[school district]]s in the United States took up the idea.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Sherry|title=Should Kids Wear School Uniforms?|url=http://www.eduguide.org/article/should-kids-wear-school-uniforms|publisher=EduGuide|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEven though dress code was created to positively affect schools, a common held belief in the U.S. is that the rules actually impede on students' right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being the [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]. The case was held because students wore black [[armband]]s to protest the Vietnam war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://education.findlaw.com/student-rights/school-dress-codes.html|title=School Dress Codes - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2017-12-08}}</ref>\n\n====Dress code violations====\nNon-communicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc.<ref name=\"Herbon, Beth 2000\">Herbon, Beth, and Jane E.

{"title_page": "Trifles (play)", "text_new": "{{About|the play|the dessert|Trifle}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2019}}\n{{Italic title}}\n'''''Trifles''''' is a [[one-act play]] by [[Susan Glaspell]].  It was first performed by the [[Provincetown Players]] at the Wharf Theatre in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], on August 8, 1916.  In the original performance, Glaspell played the role of Mrs. Hale. The play is frequently anthologized in American literature textbooks. The play was soon followed by the short story, \"[[A Jury of Her Peers]]\", also written by Glaspell, which carries the same characters and plotline.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''George Henderson''' \u2013 The county attorney (originally played by [[Michael Hulgan]])\n* '''Henry Peters''' \u2013 Local sheriff and husband of Mrs. Peters (originally played by [[Robert Conville]])\n* '''Lewis Hale''' \u2013 Neighbor of the Wrights (originally played by [[George Cram Cook]])\n* '''Mrs. Peters''' \u2013 Wife of the sheriff (originally played by [[Alice Hall (actor)|Alice Hall]])\n* '''Mrs. Hale''' \u2013 Neighbor to the Wrights and wife of Lewis Hale (originally played by [[Susan Glaspell]], and later by Kim Base)\n* '''John Wright''' \u2013 The victim and owner of the house\n* '''Mrs. Minnie Wright''' \u2013 John Wright's wife and his suspected murderer\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe play begins as the men, followed by the women, enter the Wrights\u2019 empty farmhouse. On command from the county attorney, Mr. Hale recounts his visit to the house the previous day, when he found Mrs. Wright behaving strangely and her husband dead upstairs with a rope around his neck. Mr. Hale notes that when he questioned her, Mrs. Wright claimed that she was asleep when someone strangled her husband. While the county attorney, Mr. Hale, and Mr. Peters are searching the house for evidence, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters find clues in the kitchen and hallway to this unsolved mystery. The men find no clues upstairs in the Wright house that would prove Mrs. Wright guilty, but the women find a dead canary that cracks the case wide open. The wives realize Mr. Wright killed the bird, and that led to Mrs. Wright killing her husband. The wives piece together that Minnie was being abused by her husband, and they understand how it feels to be oppressed by men. Because they feel bad for Minnie, they hide the evidence against her and she is spared the punishment for killing her husband.\n\n== Background ==\nThe play is loosely based on the murder of John Hossack, which Glaspell reported on while working as a news journalist for the ''[[Des Moines Daily News]]''.  Hossack's wife, Margaret, was accused of killing her husband.  However, Margaret argued that an intruder had killed John with an axe.  She was convicted but it was overturned on appeal.<ref>Belasco & Johnson, The Bedford Anthology of American Literature, Volume II: 1865-Present, Bedford-St.Martin's Press, Boston, 2008, p.782</ref>\n<blockquote>\n''\"...years later ... the haunting image of Margaret Hossack's kitchen came rushing back to Glaspell.  In a span of ten days, Glaspell composed a one-act play, ''Trifles'' ... A year later, Glaspell reworked the material into a short story titled \"[[A Jury of Her Peers]].\"''<ref>Bryan, Patricia L. and Thomas Wolf. ''Midnight Assassin: A Murder in America's Heartland''. Chapel Hill, NC: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2005. xii-xiii</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Performance history==\n''Trifles'' premiered at the [[Wharf Theater (Provincetown)|Wharf Theater]] in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], in 1916.\n\n== Feminist drama ==\n\n''Trifles'' is seen as an example of early [[feminist]] drama.  The two female characters, Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale are able to sympathize with Minnie, the victim's wife, and understand her possible motive, which leads them to the evidence against her.  The men, meanwhile, are blinded by their cold, emotionless investigation of material facts. The female characters find the body of a canary, with its neck wrung, killed in the same way as John Wright, thus leading them to the conclusion that Minnie was the murderer. Clearly, the wife is represented by the caged bird, a common symbol of women's roles in society. The plot concludes with the two women hiding the evidence against Minnie.\n\nThe male characters are prejudiced in believing that nothing important can be discovered in areas of the house where Minnie spent most of her time. Their minds are clouded by prejudice and they disregard important clues as being mere \"trifles\" that women concern themselves with. They search the barn and the bedroom, places where men have dominance, rather than the kitchen, the only place where a woman would be in charge. One important line, spoken by the sheriff, says of the kitchen \"Nothing here but kitchen things.\"  This dismissal of the importance of a woman's life and the male reluctance to enter the \"women's sphere\" is key in the men's failure to discover the crucial evidence for the case. The most important evidence, the dead canary that the two women find, was hidden in Minnie's sewing basket. The men scorn the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], even kicking some of the items in contempt.\n\nThe two women, having pieced together the murder, face the moral dilemma of telling the men about the motive or protecting Minnie, whom they see as a victim.  Their choice raises questions about solidarity among women, the meaning of justice, and the role of women in society as a source of justice.\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the constant themes and focuses of the story is the divide between the [[psychology]] of men and women. Their respective [[social roles]] allow them to perceive very different aspects of Minnie's life. One of the differences in psychology shown in the play is that women need a sense of community and do not fare well with loneliness, while men seem to be able to cope with loneliness.\n\nThere is also a theme of justice within the play, as the wives of the men recognize that Minnie was abused by her husband, and hide the evidence against her so that she will not be found guilty. The women side with Minnie and understand why she chose to kill her husband. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/trifles/themes|title=Trifles Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-07}}</ref> Meanwhile, the men in the play do not see the years of abuse she went through and just want to gather the evidence against her and send Minnie to jail got the murder of her husband. \n\n== Symbolism ==\n\nAs the women note, Minnie used to sing before she married John Wright. Martha theorizes that after Minnie's marriage, she was prevented, by her husband, from singing or doing anything else which would have yielded her pleasure. Minnie's plight is represented by Martha as a spiritual death, symbolized in the strangling of her songbird companion.\n\nAnother point worth noting is that both Martha and Mrs. Peters express guilt over not having visited Minnie more often\u2014 which opens up the possibility that Martha's reading of the evidence is skewed by her own feelings that she should have helped Minnie.\n\nThe use of Minnie's name is also symbolic. When the women talk about her, they use the name Minnie only when talking about her past. When she was a free-spirited, single woman her name was Minnie. This represents her happiness. The Women refer to her as Mrs. Wright when talking about her more recently. They talk as if Minnie died when she was married and Mrs. Wright took her place. The free-spirit died and was replaced by an isolated wife. The use of her names varies to demonstrate this metaphorical death.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mai|first1=Sarah|title=A STUDY OF SYMBOLS IN SUSAN GLASPELL'S TRIFLES|url=http://download.portalgaruda.org/article.php?article=158362&val=5319&title=A%20STUDY%20OF%20SYMBOLS%20IN%20SUSAN%20GLASPELL|publisher=Universitas Pesantren Tinggi Darul Ulum Jombang|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMinnie is embodied in her kitchen and sewing things.  The cold weather freezes and breaks her preserve jars, symbolizing the cold environment of her home breaking her spirit, as well as the coldness which causes the characters to fail in human empathy towards each other. The cold weather can also symbolize how Mr. Wright treated Minnie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/trifles/shattered-preserves-symbol.html|title=Shattered Preserves in Trifles|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> The bare kitchen can be seen as a symbol of the lives of the former inhabitants.\n\nThe male characters are clear symbols of \"law\" and cold rationality, while the women display an intuitiveness representative of the [[psychoanalytic]] movement, evoking an interrogation of the value of superficial rational thought.\n\nMrs. Wright also acts as the \"invisible\" heroine for women's rights as the play was written and set during the suffragette movement.\n\n== Modern theatre ==\nThe main \"players\" in the murder, Minnie (the murderer) and John Wright (the murdered), are never seen on stage.  Their lives and personalities are fleshed out in the dialogue of other characters.  The small cast and understated scenery both serve to turn the audience to the inward lives of the characters.\n\n== Title ==\n\nThe title is derived from Lewis Hale's line \"Well, women are used to worrying over \"[[trifle]]s.\"\nThe title also suggests that women's actions and concerns are considered by the men as mere \"trifles\".\nTrifles are seen as a minor mishap. The women's actions do not matter to the men in this investigation.\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe play was adapted by James P. Cavanagh for an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which first aired on December 26, 1961, with the alternate title \u201cA Jury of Her Peers.\u201d  It was directed by Robert Florey, and its cast included Ann Harding, Philip Bourneuf, Frances Reid, Robert Bray, June Walker, and Ray Teal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508107/|website=IMDB|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref> Hitchcock added his usual disclaimer at the end, stating that the killer and her \u201caccomplices\u201d were caught and convicted.\n\n''Trifles'', a [[chamber opera]] in one act, premiered in [[Berkeley, California]], at the Live Oak Theatre on June 17 and 19, 2010.  It was composed by John G. Bilotta, and it is [[libretto]] was written by John F. McGrew.  The chamber opera is scored for five singers and [[Sextet|six instruments]], including a piano, and it requires some basic stage props.

It was first performed by the [[Provincetown Players]] at the Wharf Theatre in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], on August 8, 1916.  In the original performance, Glaspell played the role of Mrs. Hale. The play is frequently anthologized in American literature textbooks. The play was soon followed by the short story, \"[[A Jury of Her Peers]]\", also written by Glaspell, which carries the same characters and plotline.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''George Henderson''' \u2013 The county attorney (originally played by [[Michael Hulgan]])\n* '''Henry Peters''' \u2013 Local sheriff and husband of Mrs. Peters (originally played by [[Robert Conville]])\n* '''Lewis Hale''' \u2013 Neighbor of the Wrights (originally played by [[George Cram Cook]])\n* '''Mrs. Peters''' \u2013 Wife of the sheriff (originally played by [[Alice Hall (actor)|Alice Hall]])\n* '''Mrs. Hale''' \u2013 Neighbor to the Wrights and wife of Lewis Hale (originally played by [[Susan Glaspell]], and later by Kim Base)\n* '''John Wright''' \u2013 The victim and owner of the house\n* '''Mrs. Minnie Wright''' \u2013 John Wright's wife and his suspected murderer\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe play begins as the men, followed by the women, enter the Wrights\u2019 empty farm house. On command from the county attorney, Mr. Hale recounts his visit to the house the previous day, when he found Mrs. Wright behaving strangely and her husband dead upstairs with a rope around his neck. Mr. Hale notes that when he questioned her, Mrs. Wright claimed that she was asleep when someone strangled her husband. While the county attorney, Mr. Hale, and Mr. Peters are searching the house for evidence, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters find clues in the kitchen and hallway to this unsolved mystery. The men find no clues upstairs in the Wright house that would prove Mrs. Wright guilty, but the women find a dead canary that cracks the case wide open. The wives realize Mr. Wright killed the bird, and that led to Mrs. Wright killing her husband. The wives piece together that Minnie was being abused by her husband, and they understand how it feels to be oppressed by men. Because they feel bad for Minnie, they hide the evidence against her and she is spared the punishment for killing her husband.\n\n== Background ==\nThe play is loosely based on the murder of John Hossack, which Glaspell reported on while working as a news journalist for the ''[[Des Moines Daily News]]''.  Hossack's wife, Margaret, was accused of killing her husband.  However, Margaret argued that an intruder had killed John with an axe.  She was convicted but it was overturned on appeal.<ref>Belasco & Johnson, The Bedford Anthology of American Literature, Volume II: 1865-Present, Bedford-St.Martin's Press, Boston, 2008, p.782</ref>\n<blockquote>\n''\"...years later ... the haunting image of Margaret Hossack's kitchen came rushing back to Glaspell.  In a span of ten days, Glaspell composed a one-act play, ''Trifles'' ... A year later, Glaspell reworked the material into a short story titled \"[[A Jury of Her Peers]].\"''<ref>Bryan, Patricia L. and Thomas Wolf. ''Midnight Assassin: A Murder in America's Heartland''. Chapel Hill, NC: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2005. xii-xiii</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Performance history==\n''Trifles'' premiered at the [[Wharf Theater (Provincetown)|Wharf Theater]] in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], in 1916.\n\n== Feminist drama ==\n\n''Trifles'' is seen as an example of early [[feminist]] drama.  The two female characters, Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale, are able to sympathize with Minnie, the victim's wife, and understand her possible motive, which leads them to the evidence against her.  The men, meanwhile, are blinded by their cold, emotionless investigation of material facts. The female characters find the body of a canary, with its neck wrung, killed in the same way as John Wright, thus leading them to the conclusion that Minnie was the murderer. Clearly, the wife is represented by the caged bird, a common symbol of women's roles in society. The plot concludes with the two women hiding the evidence against Minnie.\n\nThe male characters are prejudiced in believing that nothing important can be discovered in areas of the house where Minnie spent most of her time. Their minds are clouded by prejudice and they disregard important clues as being mere \"trifles\" that women concern themselves with. They search the barn and the bedroom, places where men have dominance, rather than the kitchen, the only place where a woman would be in charge. One important line, spoken by the sheriff, says of the kitchen \"Nothing here but kitchen things.\"  This dismissal of the importance of a woman's life and the male reluctance to enter the \"women's sphere\" is key in the men's failure to discover the crucial evidence for the case. The most important evidence, the dead canary that the two women find, was hidden in Minnie's sewing basket. The men scorn the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], even kicking some of the items in contempt.\n\nThe two women, having pieced together the murder, face the moral dilemma of telling the men about the motive or protecting Minnie, whom they see as a victim.  Their choice raises questions about solidarity among women, the meaning of justice, and the role of women in society as a source of justice.\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the constant themes and focuses of the story is the divide between the [[psychology]] of men and women. Their respective [[social roles]] allow them to perceive very different aspects of Minnie's life. One of the differences in psychology shown in the play is that women need a sense of community and do not fare well with loneliness, while men seem to be able to cope with loneliness.\n\nThere is also a theme of justice within the play, as the wives of the men recognize that Minnie was abused by her husband, and hide the evidence against her so that she will not be found guilty. The women side with Minnie and understand why she chose to kill her husband. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/trifles/themes|title=Trifles Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-07}}</ref> Meanwhile, the men in the play do not see the years of abuse she went through and just want to gather the evidence against her and send Minnie to jail got the murder of her husband. \n\n== Symbolism ==\n\nAs the women note, Minnie used to sing before she married John Wright. Martha theorizes that after Minnie's marriage, she was prevented, by her husband, from singing or doing anything else which would have yielded her pleasure. Minnie's plight is represented by Martha as a spiritual death, symbolized in the strangling of her songbird companion.\n\nAnother point worth noting is that both Martha and Mrs. Peters express guilt over not having visited Minnie more often\u2014 which opens up the possibility that Martha's reading of the evidence is skewed by her own feelings that she should have helped Minnie.\n\nThe use of Minnie's name is also symbolic. When the women talk about her, they use the name Minnie only when talking about her past. When she was a free-spirited, single woman her name was Minnie. This represents her happiness. The Women refer to her as Mrs. Wright when talking about her more recently. They talk as if Minnie died when she was married and Mrs. Wright took her place. The free-spirit died and was replaced by an isolated wife. The use of her names varies to demonstrate this metaphorical death.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mai|first1=Sarah|title=A STUDY OF SYMBOLS IN SUSAN GLASPELL'S TRIFLES|url=http://download.portalgaruda.org/article.php?article=158362&val=5319&title=A%20STUDY%20OF%20SYMBOLS%20IN%20SUSAN%20GLASPELL|publisher=Universitas Pesantren Tinggi Darul Ulum Jombang|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMinnie is embodied in her kitchen and sewing things.  The cold weather freezes and breaks her preserve jars, symbolizing the cold environment of her home breaking her spirit, as well as the coldness which causes the characters to fail in human empathy towards each other. The cold weather can also symbolize how Mr. Wright treated Minnie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/trifles/shattered-preserves-symbol.html|title=Shattered Preserves in Trifles|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> The bare kitchen can be seen as symbol of the lives of the former inhabitants.\n\nThe male characters are clear symbols of \"law\" and cold rationality, while the women display an intuitiveness representative of the [[psychoanalytic]] movement, evoking an interrogation of the value of superficial rational thought.\n\nMrs. Wright also acts as the \"invisible\" heroine for women's rights as the play was written and set during the suffragette movement.\n\n== Modern theatre ==\nThe main \"players\" in the murder, Minnie (the murderer) and John Wright (the murdered), are never seen on stage.  Their lives and personalities are fleshed out in the dialogue of other characters.  The small cast and understated scenery both serve to turn the audience to the inward lives of the characters.\n\n== Title ==\n\nThe title is derived from Lewis Hale's line \"Well, women are used to worrying over \"[[trifle]]s.\"\nThe title also suggests that women's actions and concerns are considered by the men as mere \"trifles\".\nTrifles are seen as a minor mishap. The women's actions do not matter to the men in this investigation.\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe play was adapted by James P. Cavanagh for an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which first aired on December 26, 1961 with the alternate title \u201cA Jury of Her Peers.\u201d  It was directed by Robert Florey, and its cast included Ann Harding, Philip Bourneuf, Frances Reid, Robert Bray, June Walker, and Ray Teal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508107/|website=IMDB|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref> Hitchcock added his usual disclaimer at the end, stating that the killer and her \u201caccomplices\u201d were caught and convicted.\n\n''Trifles'', a [[chamber opera]] in one act, premiered in [[Berkeley, California]], at the Live Oak Theatre on June 17 and 19, 2010.  It was composed by John G. Bilotta, and its [[libretto]] was written by John F. McGrew.  The chamber opera is scored for five singers and [[Sextet|six instruments]], including a piano, and it requires some basic stage props.  As in the play, the central figures (Mr. and Mrs. Wright) are absent from the cast of characters.  Instead, through the libretto, Lewis Hale reenacts the events surrounding the discovery of Mr. Wright's murder, where he was present.\n\n== Literary criticism and significance ==\nPhyllis Mael analyzes \"Trifles\" in regards to developmental psychology.

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

Historically, the main entrance to the station was on Stephenson Street, just off New Street. As of 2020, the station has entrances on Stephenson Street, Smallbrook Queensway, Hill Street and Navigation Street.\n\nNew Street is the [[List of busiest railway stations in Great Britain|sixth busiest railway station]] in the UK and the busiest outside London, with 47.9 million passenger entries and exits between April 2018 and March 2019.

Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

An international co-production of the United States and Canada, the film was shot in [[black-and-white]] with a [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and currently used aspect ratios|1.19:1 aspect ratio]]. It stars [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Robert Pattinson]] as two lighthouse keepers who start to lose their sanity when a storm strands them on the remote island where they are stationed.\n\nAccording to Eggers, although the final story bears little resemblance to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s fragment \"[[The Light-House]]\", the film began as an attempt by his brother Max Eggers to do a contemporary take on the Poe story. When the project stalled, Eggers offered to work with his brother and the project evolved into a period thriller with the Poe elements largely removed. Dafoe and Pattinson were cast as the lead characters in February 2018. [[Principal photography]] began on April 9, 2018, and lasted a total of 34 days in Leif Erikson Park in [[Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia]], Canada, and inside a hangar at [[Yarmouth Airport]] in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival|72nd Cannes Film Festival]] on May 19, and was theatrically released on October 18, 2019, by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. The film was praised for its technical aspects (notably the cinematography and production design), Eggers' screenplay and direction, and the performances of the leads. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[92nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn the late 19th century, Ephraim Winslow ([[Robert Pattinson]]) serves a contract job as a [[Lighthouse keeper|wickie]] for four weeks on an isolated island off the coast of [[New England]], under the supervision of an irritable elderly man named Thomas Wake ([[Willem Dafoe]]). On the first day, Winslow notices a hole in his cot, finding a small [[scrimshaw]] of a [[mermaid]] within it and stuffing it in his jacket. Winslow observes Wake going up to the lighthouse's lantern room at night and stripping naked. Winslow begins experiencing visions and dreams of giant tentacles in the lighthouse, logs floating in the water and distant images of a mermaid.\n\nOver the course of his stay, Wake demands Winslow take the more taxing jobs\u2014refueling the light, carrying heavy [[kerosene]] containers, and disposing of the two men's [[chamber pot|chamber pots]], all the while refusing to let him enter the lantern room. As the weeks progress, Winslow repeatedly encounters an aggressive one-eyed [[gull]]. Wake warns Winslow that it is bad luck to kill a gull, as he is [[Sailors' superstitions|superstitious]] that they are reincarnated sailors. The weeks continue, and Winslow masturbates to the scrimshaw and continues to see Wake naked. One night at dinner, the two get to know each other and discuss Wake's previous wickie, whom Wake says died shortly after losing his sanity. Winslow reveals that he used to work in Canada as a [[Lumberjack|timberman]], but decided to change professions.\n\nThe day before Winslow is slated to leave, he notices the water pump is releasing bloody water and investigates. He checks the [[cistern]] to see a dying gull floating inside. The one-eyed seagull flies down and attacks Winslow, who grabs it and beats it to death. Soon after, the winds change direction and a storm hits the island that night. The next morning, the relief ferry does not arrive and Winslow sees a body washed up on the shore. He approaches it and realizes that it is a mermaid, which awakens and howls at him. He runs back into the cottage, where Wake informs him that their [[Military rations|rations]] were spoiled by the storm. Winslow inquires about the ferry, but Wake insists that weeks, in fact, have passed since it was due to arrive. They dig up a crate supposed to contain extra rations but find only more alcohol.\n\nMore days pass, the storm continues, and the two men grow closer while remaining adversarial. While mastubating to the mermaid scrimshaw, Winslow has visions of having sex with the mermaid, a [[lobster trap]] containing the severed, half-blinded head of Wake's previous wickie. One night, Winslow tells Wake that his real name is Thomas Howard and that he assumed the identity of Ephraim Winslow, his [[Supervisor|foreman]] who died in an accident Howard neglected to stop. Wake accuses Howard of \"spilling his beans\" and Howard tries to leave on a [[dory]], but Wake destroys it with an axe. Wake chases Howard into the cottage, but inside, Wake claims that it was Howard who attacked him. With no alcohol left, the two begin mixing spirits out of [[turpentine]] and [[honey]], and the storm becomes so powerful that waves crash through the cottage's windows.\n\nThe next morning, Howard finds Wake's logbook, in which Wake has written a critical report of Howard's performance and recommended he be sacked without pay. Wake chides Howard while Howard accuses him of gaslighting and begs him to see the light in the lantern room. Wake berates Howard and Howard attacks him. While seeing visions of the mermaid, Wake as a sea monster, and the real Winslow, Howard beats Wake into submission. Howard leashes Wake and buries him alive while he curses Howard to a \"[[Prometheus|Promethean]] fate.\" Howard takes the keys and prepares to go up to the lantern room, but Wake appears and strikes him with the axe. Howard disarms Wake and kills him before ascending the lighthouse. He approaches the [[Fresnel lens]], and it stops and opens up to him. Howard gazes into the mirrored interior in ecstasy and reaches in, letting out distorted screams as the light brightens before slipping, breaking his leg and falling down the steps. A still-alive Howard is finally seen lying naked on the rocks and missing an eye as several gulls peck at his innards.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''The Lighthouse'' began as an attempt by [[Max Eggers]] to adapt \"[[The Light-House]],\" an unfinished short story by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. [[Robert Eggers]] became aware of his brother's effort while trying to pitch his debut feature, ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'', to studios. Max's project stalled, after which Robert offered to work on it based on his own vision. The final story, co-written by Robert and Max, bears no resemblance to the Poe work apart from the title.<ref name=RS1025>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-interview-898545/ |title=Drunken Sailors and Movie Stars: Robert Eggers on Making 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=David |last=Fear |date=October 25, 2019 |accessdate=November 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe literature of [[Maine]]-based writer [[Sarah Orne Jewett]] served as a significant point of reference for the dialects used in ''The Lighthouse''. Maritime and surrealistic elements from the works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] also informed the writing of the film. According to Eggers, a 19th-century incident at [[Smalls Lighthouse]] in Wales involving two lighthouse keepers (both named Thomas, as in the film) was an additional source of inspiration - the story was made into the 2016 [[The Lighthouse (2016 film)|British film of the same name]].<ref name=RS1025/>\n\n===Casting===\nIn February 2018, it was announced [[Willem Dafoe]] had been cast in the film.<ref name=DL0207>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/ |title=Willem Dafoe Alights For Robert Eggers-Directed 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Mike |last=Fleming Jr. |date=February 7, 2018 |accessdate=April 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415093602/https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/|archive-date=April 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Dafoe had previously contacted Robert Eggers via email, expressing his admiration for ''The Witch'' and offering to work with the director in the future.

They\u2019re pushing each other\u2019s buttons out of fear and out of threat of who they are. And they\u2019re both guilty. They have a sense of guilt, of wrong.

As Wake is being led on all fours by Howard's rope, the scene mimics [[BDSM]] culture, but not sufficiently for Dry: \"It feels like a missed opportunity at best \u2014 and a spineless maneuver at worst \u2014 to invoke themes of dominance and submission, borrowing from queer [[fetish]] culture, without even so much as a genuine erotic exchange\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Psychoanalysis ===\nEggers admitted that he was heavily influenced by the work of [[Carl Jung]],<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/the-lighthouse-robert-eggers-meaning-explained-ending/|title=What the hell did 'The Lighthouse' even mean?|last=Joho|first=Jess|date=October 20, 2019|website=Mashable|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> and hoped that \"it\u2019s a movie where both Jung and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] would be furiously eating their popcorn\".<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Pattinson the [[Phallus|phallic]] imagery of the lighthouse is explicit, as Eggers described it as an erect penis in the script.<ref name=\":1\" /> The film was meant to include \u201ca very juvenile shot of a lighthouse moving like an erect penis and a match-cut to [Pattinson's] actual erect penis\u201d, although this cut was removed upon request by financiers.<ref name=\":2\" /> Winslow displays an [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] fixation on his boss Thomas, given his simultaneous fear and admiration of him. Pattinson commented on the father/son dynamic in the film, stating \"I was pretty conscious of how I wanted the relationship to come across. In a lot of ways, he sort of wants a daddy\".<ref name=\":1\" /> As the film progresses, Winslow is increasingly \"looking for Willem (Defoe)'s validation\" both as a boss and as a father figure.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dim9GE891gQ|title=Robert Pattinson & Robert Eggers Break Down a Scene from 'The Lighthouse' {{!}} Fandango All Access|last=Fandango All Access|first=|date=29 Oct 2019|website=Youtube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Mythology ===\nEggers was inspired by sailors myths and classical mythology. After finally obtaining the light, and the knowledge of what is in the light, Howard falls to his death down the stairs of the lighthouse and his organs are plucked out by seagulls, invoking the myth of [[Prometheus]]. For Jess Joho, the lighthouse can be seen as a symbol for man's hubris in trying to overcome or conquer nature's most powerful forces. Wake was modeled on [[Proteus]], a \"prophecy-telling ocean god who serves Poseidon\". Not only is he later shown with tentacles and sea creatures stuck to his body, but \"he also makes that uncannily accurate prediction for how Ephraim will die at the end of the movie\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nEggers explains his mythological inspiration for the film: it's \"partially because [[Herman Melville|[Herman] Melville]] goes there and partially because I'm sure our unhealthy Jungian leanings you get into classical mythology in this movie\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-lighthouse-movie-ending-explained-twist-robert-eggers|title=Director Robert Eggers Breaks Down the Mysteries of 'The Lighthouse'|last=Zuckerman|first=Esther|date=18 Oct 2019|website=Thrillist|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Alcoholism ===\nThe Lighthouse deals explicitly with [[alcoholism]]. Robert Pattinson described Winslow as being early in his sobriety at the start of the film.<ref name=\":5\" /> Although Winslow denies the liquor that Wake serves him on his first night, he soon realizes that the water on the island is undrinkable due to the contamination of the water system. He quickly turns to alcohol to cope with the immense labor and his aggressive relationship with Wake. Manohla Dargus of the ''New York Times'' notes that \"the men\u2019s sloppy, alcohol-saturated time together produces intimacy but also menace. They laugh, descending into riotous drunkenness and finding connection that both they and Eggers skitter around.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/movies/the-lighthouse-review.html|title=\u2018The Lighthouse\u2019 Review: Dark Nights, Troubled Souls, Hairy Men|date=16 Oct 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=28 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Lighthouse'' had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section on May 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/cannes-directors-fortnight-lineup-includes-wounds-netflix-1202600277/ |title=Cannes: Directors' Fortnight Includes Robert Pattinson Pic 'The Lighthouse', Takashi Miike, Netflix Film 'Wounds' & Luca Guadagnino Short |website=Deadline Hollywood |first=Andreas |last=Wiseman |date=April 23, 2019 |accessdate=April 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423123423/https://deadline.com/2019/04/cannes-directors-fortnight-lineup-includes-wounds-netflix-1202600277/|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], and the [[Atlantic Film Festival]] in September 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brent |title=Toronto Film Festival: 'Joker,' 'Ford v Ferrari,' 'Hustlers' Among Big Premieres |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/toronto-film-festival-joker-ford-v-ferrari-hustlers-lineup-1203275868/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=July 23, 2019 |date=July 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723140739/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/toronto-film-festival-joker-ford-v-ferrari-hustlers-lineup-1203275868/ |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film was distributed by [[A24 (company)|A24]] in North America and by [[Focus Features]] internationally.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hopewell |first1=John |title=Robert Pattinson, Willem Dafoe's 'The Lighthouse' Wins Cannes Critics' Award |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/robert-pattinson-willem-defoe-the-lighthouse-critics-award-cannes-film-festival-1203225940/ |accessdate=June 19, 2019 |work=Variety |publisher=Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media, LLC |date=May 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608234429/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/robert-pattinson-willem-defoe-the-lighthouse-critics-award-cannes-film-festival-1203225940/ |archive-date=June 8, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was released on October 18, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-lighthouse-trailer-robert-pattinson-willem-dafoe-1202161881/ |title='The Lighthouse' First Trailer: Robert Pattinson, Willem Dafoe Go Mad in A24 Psychodrama |website=[[IndieWire]] |first=Zack |last=Sharf |date=July 30, 2019 |accessdate=July 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730130858/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-lighthouse-trailer-robert-pattinson-willem-dafoe-1202161881/|archive-date=July 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn its limited opening weekend on October 18, the film grossed $419,764 from eight theaters, for an average of $52,471 per venue.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2019/10/maleficent-mistress-of-evil-zombieland-double-tap-weekend-box-office-1202763525/ |title= 'Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil' No Magic With $36M+, 'Joker' Still Stealing 2nd Place From 'Zombieland 2' With $28M+ |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=October 20, 2019 |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref> In its second weekend the film expanded to 586 theaters, grossing $3 million and finishing eighth at the box office.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2019/10/joker-maleficent-2-black-and-blue-countdown-halloween-box-office-weekend-1202769043/ |title= 'Joker' Has The Edge Over 'Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil' With $18.9M In Fierce Slow Pre-Halloween B.O.

An international co-production of the United States and Canada, the film was shot in [[black-and-white]] with a [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and currently used aspect ratios|1.19:1 aspect ratio]]. It stars [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Robert Pattinson]] as two lighthouse keepers who start to lose their sanity when a storm strands them on the remote island where they are stationed.\n\nAccording to Eggers, although the final story bears little resemblance to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s fragment \"[[The Light-House]]\", the film began as an attempt by his brother Max Eggers to do a contemporary take on the Poe story. When the project stalled, Eggers offered to work with his brother and the project evolved into a period thriller with the Poe elements largely removed. Dafoe and Pattinson were cast as the lead characters in February 2018. [[Principal photography]] began on April 9, 2018, and lasted a total of 34 days in Leif Erikson Park in [[Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia]], Canada, and inside a hangar at [[Yarmouth Airport]] in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival|72nd Cannes Film Festival]] on May 19, and was theatrically released on October 18, 2019, by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. The film was praised for its technical aspects (notably the cinematography and production design), Eggers' screenplay and direction, and the performances of the leads. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[92nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn the late 19th century, Ephraim Winslow ([[Robert Pattinson]]) serves a contract job as a [[Lighthouse keeper|wickie]] for four weeks on an isolated island off the coast of [[New England]], under the supervision of an irritable elderly man named Thomas Wake ([[Willem Dafoe]]). On the first day, Winslow notices a hole in his cot, finding a small [[scrimshaw]] of a [[mermaid]] within it and stuffing it in his jacket. Winslow observes Wake going up to the lighthouse's lantern room at night and stripping naked. Winslow begins experiencing visions and dreams of giant tentacles in the lighthouse, logs floating in the water and distant images of a mermaid.\n\nOver the course of his stay, Wake demands Winslow take the more taxing jobs\u2014refueling the light, carrying heavy [[kerosene]] containers, and disposing of the two men's [[chamber pot|chamber pots]], all the while refusing to let him enter the lantern room. As the weeks progress, Winslow repeatedly encounters an aggressive one-eyed [[gull]]. Wake warns Winslow that it is bad luck to kill a gull, as he is [[Sailors' superstitions|superstitious]] that they are reincarnated sailors. The weeks continue, and Winslow masturbates to the scrimshaw and continues to see Wake naked. One night at dinner, the two get to know each other and discuss Wake's previous wickie, whom Wake says died shortly after losing his sanity. Winslow reveals that he used to work in Canada as a [[Lumberjack|timberman]], but decided to change professions.\n\nThe day before Winslow is slated to leave, he notices the water pump is releasing bloody water and investigates. He checks the [[cistern]] to see a dying gull floating inside. The one-eyed seagull flies down and attacks Winslow, who grabs it and beats it to death. Soon after, the winds change direction and a storm hits the island that night. The next morning, the relief ferry does not arrive and Winslow sees a body washed up on the shore. He approaches it and realizes that it is a mermaid, which awakens and howls at him. He runs back into the cottage, where Wake informs him that their [[Military rations|rations]] were spoiled by the storm. Winslow inquires about the ferry, but Wake insists that weeks, in fact, have passed since it was due to arrive. They dig up a crate supposed to contain extra rations but find only more alcohol.\n\nMore days pass, the storm continues, and the two men grow closer while remaining adversarial. Winslow has visions of a [[lobster trap]] containing the severed, half-blinded head of Wake's previous wickie. One night, Winslow tells Wake that his real name is Thomas Howard and that he assumed the identity of Ephraim Winslow, his [[Supervisor|foreman]] who died in an accident Howard neglected to stop. Wake accuses Howard of \"spilling his beans\" and Howard tries to leave on a [[dory]], but Wake destroys it with an axe. Wake chases Howard into the cottage, but inside, Wake claims that it was Howard who attacked him. With no alcohol left, the two begin mixing spirits out of [[turpentine]] and [[honey]], and the storm becomes so powerful that waves crash through the cottage's windows.\n\nThe next morning, Howard finds Wake's logbook, in which Wake has written a critical report of Howard's performance and recommended he be sacked without pay. Wake chides Howard while Howard accuses him of gaslighting and begs him to see the light in the lantern room. Wake berates Howard and Howard attacks him. While seeing visions of the mermaid, Wake as a sea monster, and the real Winslow, Howard beats Wake into submission. Howard leashes Wake and buries him alive while he curses Howard to a \"[[Prometheus|Promethean]] fate.\" Howard takes the keys and prepares to go up to the lantern room, but Wake appears and strikes him with the axe. Howard disarms Wake and kills him before ascending the lighthouse. He approaches the [[Fresnel lens]], and it stops and opens up to him. Howard gazes into the mirrored interior in ecstasy and reaches in, letting out distorted screams as the light brightens before slipping, breaking his leg and falling down the steps. A still-alive Howard is finally seen lying naked on the rocks and missing an eye as several gulls peck at his innards.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''The Lighthouse'' began as an attempt by [[Max Eggers]] to adapt \"[[The Light-House]],\" an unfinished short story by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. [[Robert Eggers]] became aware of his brother's effort while trying to pitch his debut feature, ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'', to studios. Max's project stalled, after which Robert offered to work on it based on his own vision. The final story, co-written by Robert and Max, bears no resemblance to the Poe work apart from the title.<ref name=RS1025>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-interview-898545/ |title=Drunken Sailors and Movie Stars: Robert Eggers on Making 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=David |last=Fear |date=October 25, 2019 |accessdate=November 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe literature of [[Maine]]-based writer [[Sarah Orne Jewett]] served as a significant point of reference for the dialects used in ''The Lighthouse''. Maritime and surrealistic elements from the works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] also informed the writing of the film. According to Eggers, a 19th-century incident at [[Smalls Lighthouse]] in Wales involving two lighthouse keepers (both named Thomas, as in the film) was an additional source of inspiration - the story was made into the 2016 [[The Lighthouse (2016 film)|British film of the same name]].<ref name=RS1025/>\n\n===Casting===\nIn February 2018, it was announced [[Willem Dafoe]] had been cast in the film.<ref name=DL0207>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/ |title=Willem Dafoe Alights For Robert Eggers-Directed 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Mike |last=Fleming Jr. |date=February 7, 2018 |accessdate=April 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415093602/https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/|archive-date=April 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Dafoe had previously contacted Robert Eggers via email, expressing his admiration for ''The Witch'' and offering to work with the director in the future.

Barton interprets Howard's name change to his previous, deceased boss as indicative of a more intimate relationship: \"Considering the act of Tommy taking his name, this behavior suggests a tender and affectionate attitude, almost like the tradition of taking your partner's name after marriage\".<ref name=\":0\" /> When asked about the scene in which Winslow criticizes Wake's cooking, Wake's desperate need for validation of his lobster is a euphemism for his penis.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSexual fantasy and masturbation are recurring themes in the film. Winslow frequently masturbates to the mermaid figurine throughout the film. He fantasizes of a mermaid washed up on the shore.

Barton interprets his reaction, stating that it \"is fairly obvious \u2013 the mermaid was never Tommy\u2019s siren. His true siren is revealed a little later.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor Dafoe, the homoeroticism in the film is blatant, but it is also used to explore what it means to be a man: \"[[Toxic masculinity]]! They\u2019re pushing each other\u2019s buttons out of fear and out of threat of who they are. And they\u2019re both guilty. They have a sense of guilt, of wrong. There\u2019s no moral judgment in this story. It\u2019s just to watch these two guys struggling to find a way to survive themselves, really... It\u2019s a simple story, but it\u2019s got existential roots and identity things and things about masculinity and domination and submission. And for better and for worse. Then you see it flip-flop and it\u2019s kind of cool.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> After beating Wake into submission, Howard assumes a dominant role, calling Wake dog and dragging him on a leash. Commenting on this scene, Pattinson stated that, \"there\u2019s definitely a take where we were literally trying to pull each other\u2019s pants down. It literally almost looked like foreplay\u201d.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/jojo-rabbit-the-lighthouse-gay-subtext-1202182957/|title=Why the Gay Subplots in \u2018The Lighthouse\u2019 and \u2018Jojo Rabbit\u2019 Don\u2019t Go Far Enough|last=Dry|first=Jude|date=21 October 2019|website=IndieWire|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nJude Dry of IndieWire critiqued the film's queer subtext for not going far enough. As Wake is being led on all fours by Howard's rope, the scene mimics [[BDSM]] culture, but not sufficiently for Dry: \"It feels like a missed opportunity at best \u2014 and a spineless maneuver at worst \u2014 to invoke themes of dominance and submission, borrowing from queer [[fetish]] culture, without even so much as a genuine erotic exchange\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Psychoanalysis ===\nEggers admitted that he was heavily influenced by the work of [[Carl Jung]],<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/the-lighthouse-robert-eggers-meaning-explained-ending/|title=What the hell did 'The Lighthouse' even mean?|last=Joho|first=Jess|date=October 20, 2019|website=Mashable|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> and hoped that \"it\u2019s a movie where both Jung and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] would be furiously eating their popcorn\".<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Pattinson the [[Phallus|phallic]] imagery of the lighthouse is explicit, as Eggers described it as an erect penis in the script.<ref name=\":1\" /> The film was meant to include \u201ca very juvenile shot of a lighthouse moving like an erect penis and a match-cut to [Pattinson's] actual erect penis\u201d, although this cut was removed upon request by financiers.<ref name=\":2\" /> Winslow displays an [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] fixation on his boss Thomas, given his simultaneous fear and admiration of him. Pattinson commented on the father/son dynamic in the film, stating \"I was pretty conscious of how I wanted the relationship to come across. In a lot of ways, he sort of wants a daddy\".<ref name=\":1\" /> As the film progresses, Winslow is increasingly \"looking for Willem (Defoe)'s validation\" both as a boss and as a father figure.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dim9GE891gQ|title=Robert Pattinson & Robert Eggers Break Down a Scene from 'The Lighthouse' {{!}} Fandango All Access|last=Fandango All Access|first=|date=29 Oct 2019|website=Youtube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Mythology ===\nEggers was inspired by sailors myths and classical mythology. After finally obtaining the light, and the knowledge of what is in the light, Howard falls to his death down the stairs of the lighthouse and his organs are plucked out by seagulls, invoking the myth of [[Prometheus]]. For Jess Joho, the lighthouse can be seen as a symbol for man's hubris in trying to overcome or conquer nature's most powerful forces. Wake was modeled on [[Proteus]], a \"prophecy-telling ocean god who serves Poseidon\". Not only is he later shown with tentacles and sea creatures stuck to his body, but \"he also makes that uncannily accurate prediction for how Ephraim will die at the end of the movie\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nEggers explains his mythological inspiration for the film: it's \"partially because [[Herman Melville|[Herman] Melville]] goes there and partially because I'm sure our unhealthy Jungian leanings you get into classical mythology in this movie\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-lighthouse-movie-ending-explained-twist-robert-eggers|title=Director Robert Eggers Breaks Down the Mysteries of 'The Lighthouse'|last=Zuckerman|first=Esther|date=18 Oct 2019|website=Thrillist|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Alcoholism ===\nThe Lighthouse deals explicitly with [[alcoholism]]. Robert Pattinson described Winslow as being early in his sobriety at the start of the film.<ref name=\":5\" /> Although Winslow denies the liquor that Wake serves him on his first night, he soon realizes that the water on the island is undrinkable due to the contamination of the water system. He quickly turns to alcohol to cope with the immense labor and his aggressive relationship with Wake. Manohla Dargus of the ''New York Times'' notes that \"the men\u2019s sloppy, alcohol-saturated time together produces intimacy but also menace.

Each study performed that seeks to discover the number of adherents in a country may use different criteria, and be submitted to different populations. As such, some numbers may be inflated, and therefore inaccurate. Examples of this are Greece and Russia, where estimates of adherence to Eastern Orthodoxy may reach 80-98%, but where surveys found lower percentages professing Eastern Orthodoxy or belief in God. The likely reason for this disparity is that many people in these majority Eastern Orthodox countries will culturally identify with the Eastern Orthodox Church, especially if they were baptized as children, even if they are not currently practicing. This includes those who may be irreligious, yet culturally identify with the Eastern Orthodox Church, or for whom Eastern Orthodox Christianity is listed on official state records. Other cases of incongruent data also might be due to counting ethnic groups from Eastern Orthodox countries rather than actual adherents. A case of this is the United States, which has large numbers of immigrants from Eastern Orthodox countries. The Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions often reported large numbers of members, which together would total 2-3 million across the country. However, a 2010 study by Alexei Krindatch sought data from each parish, with the specific criteria of annual participation. This study produced the \"Atlas of American Orthodox Christian Churches\", and discovered that there were only about 817,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians actively practicing their faith (that is to say, attending church services on a regular basis) in the United States. The study explained that such a difference was due to a variety of circumstances, for example the higher numbers having counted all people who self-identify as Eastern Orthodox on a census regardless of active participation, or all people belonging to ethnic groups originating in Eastern Orthodox countries. This study, while initially controversial, proved groundbreaking, and has since been officially approved for use by the [[Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America]].\n\nAs such, any data used to figure the population of Eastern Orthodox per nation, should be understood as estimated rather than exact. Additionally, total numbers of Eastern Orthodox Christians throughout the world may be anywhere from 150 million to 300 million, depending on the studies and definitions which are used.\n\n<!-- NOTICE: The numbers in this section have been changed countless times in what can only be seen as a bout of pride from one or more anonymous users.

Each study performed that seeks to discover the number of adherents in a country may use different criteria, and be submitted to different populations. As such, some numbers may be inflated, and therefore inaccurate. Examples of this are Greece and Russia, where estimates of adherence to Eastern Orthodoxy may reach 80-98%, but where surveys found lower percentages professing Eastern Orthodoxy or belief in God. The likely reason for this disparity is that many people in these majority Eastern Orthodox countries will culturally identify with the Eastern Orthodox Church, especially if they were baptized as children, even if they are not currently practicing. This includes those who may be irreligious, yet culturally identify with the Eastern Orthodox Church, or for whom Eastern Orthodox Christianity is listed on official state records. Other cases of incongruent data also might be due to counting ethnic groups from Eastern Orthodox countries rather than actual adherents. A case of this is the United States, which has large numbers of immigrants from Eastern Orthodox countries. The Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions often reported large numbers of members, which together would total 2-3 million across the country. However, a 2010 study by Alexei Krindatch sought data from each parish, with the specific criteria of annual participation. This study produced the \"Atlas of American Orthodox Christian Churches\", and discovered that there were only about 817,000 Eastern Orthodox Christians actively practicing their faith (that is to say, attending church services on a regular basis) in the United States. The study explained that such a difference was due to a variety of circumstances, for example the higher numbers having counted all people who self-identify as Eastern Orthodox on a census regardless of active participation, or all people belonging to ethnic groups originating in Eastern Orthodox countries. This study, while initially controversial, proved groundbreaking, and has since been officially approved for use by the [[Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America]].\n\nAs such, any data used to figure the population of Eastern Orthodox per nation, should be understood as estimated rather than exact. Additionally, total numbers of Eastern Orthodox Christians throughout the world may be anywhere from 150 million to 300 million, depending on the studies and definitions which are used.\n\n<!-- NOTICE: The numbers in this section have been changed countless times in what can only be seen as a bout of pride from one or more anonymous users.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

The first is as the complement of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative adjunct (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French |journal=15th International Connference on HPSG |date=2008 |pages=358\u2013377 |url=http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/HPSG/2008/bonami-godard.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref> The verb phrase can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: ''\"They'll never make it!\" cried John to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried to Mary John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the simple present or the simple past.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\">Frederica Barbieri.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]].<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb.\n\nGloss: PL=Plural FUT=Future Tense PST=Past Tense OBL=Oblique Case IRR= Irregular\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\">Frederica Barbieri.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.
