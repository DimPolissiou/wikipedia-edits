This school had been established by Melbourne's first [[Church of England]] [[bishop]], [[Charles Perry (bishop)|Charles Perry]], who founded the [[Anglican Diocese of Melbourne|Diocese of Melbourne]], and had been opened to meet the growing educational needs of the young [[colony]].<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history.php |title=History |accessdate=2008-02-02 |work=About Us |publisher=Melbourne Grammar School |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114233504/http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history.php |archive-date=14 January 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1853, Bishop Perry commenced planning for the diocesan experimental school to become permanent, although on a larger site and not under his direct management, and so he set up a committee of eminent men to consider the task. The school however did not thrive and was suspended at the end of 1854.<ref name=HistoryMGS>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history_mgs.php |title=History of MGS |accessdate=2008-02-02 |work=About Us |publisher=Melbourne Grammar School |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501222626/http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history_mgs.php |archivedate=1 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe first board of governors was elected in 1854 to take over from the committee, and it set about drawing up a [[constitution]], finding a [[headmaster]] and a new site. Locations considered included [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]] and [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]].<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nPerry's dream of building a permanent, centrally located grammar school, based on the principles of the great [[England|English]] [[Public school (UK)|public schools]], was realised in 1855, with a grant from Governor [[Charles Hotham]] of {{convert|15|acre|m2}} on [[St Kilda Road, Melbourne|St Kilda Road]]. This is the inner South Yarra land now occupied by the Senior School and Wadhurst, next to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne|Royal Botanic Gardens]] and a short walk from the [[Melbourne city centre|city centre]]. At the time it was considered relatively isolated and remote. The governors chose [[architect]]s [[Charles Webb (architect)|Charles Webb]] and Thomas Taylor, well known Melbourne contractors [[George Cornwell|George Cornwell and Co.]] undertook the construction, and Bishop Perry laid the school's foundation stone on 30 July 1856.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n[[Image:MGS1876.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Melbourne Grammar School, 1876]]\nThe Melbourne Church of England Grammar School was finally opened on 7 April 1858 with 77 pupils, and with John E. Bromby as the first headmaster. Enrolments grew to 136 during the first year, with four students being the sons of Bromby, and about one quarter of them boarders.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nThe school's first 40 years proved to be a struggle, exacerbated in the 1890s by [[Recession|economic depression]], financial concerns and changes of headmaster. Senior school enrolments fell from 272 in 1889 to 117 in 1894 prompting a group of former students to do something to save the school. They formed The Old Melburnians Society in 1895 \"to be the means of bringing together many former schoolmates, reviving pleasant recollections, and at the same time benefiting the life of the School as it is today\".<ref name=HistoryMGS/><ref> At a meeting held at Melbourne Grammar School on 22 April 1895, called to inaugurate an organisation for former students which would amalgamate and oversee the activities of various sporting activities, such as the athletics, cricket and gymnastics clubs already established for \"old boys\" as well as any others that might be created in the future (e.g., football). After strong debate, with a number of suggested names, including \"Old Church of England Grammar School Boys' Association\", being rejected, the meeting (composed of \"old boys\" from all eras, including the 1860s) decided upon the name \"Old Melburnians\" for the \"old boys\" [[umbrella organization]] (see: [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/139709004 Old Boy, \"College Sports: Weekly Jottings\"], ''The Australasian'', 27 April 1895, p. 19.</ref><ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/935754 \"The Old Melburnians: Inaugural Reunion\"], ''The Argus'',  10 May 1895, p. 6.</ref>\n\nTwo significant developments of the late 19th century were, firstly, the recognition that with a limited site, one storey buildings were not a wise use of space. A move began, continued now, of adding second stories or replacing buildings with two- or three-level structures. The second was the dedication of the Chapel of St Peter in 1893, the first school chapel in the colony of Victoria.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nThe beginning of the new century saw the school's future assured, with enrolments increasing and the [[Golden Jubilee|Jubilee]] celebrated in 1908. Hundreds of former students enlisted in the [[World War I|Great War]] of 1914\u20131918, as they had in the [[Second Boer War|South African War]], and more than 200 did not return.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n[[Image:MGSChapel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Melbourne Grammar School Chapel, [[Circa|c.]]1893]]\nThe 1920s were a relatively stable time for the school, experiencing high academic and sporting results. The 1930s however were an unsettling time. The [[Great Depression]] put pressure on members of the Grammar community, while administrative instability affected the whole school. Between 1935 and 1938 the school had three headmasters and two acting headmasters, and the outbreak of war the following year meant building plans were put on hold. Some 3,500 old boys enlisted in the services, and school buildings were commandeered by Australian and American forces with some students dispatched to the country and others doubled up in crowded quarters.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nBy the 1950s it became clear that the school was seriously lacking adequate space, with expansions, extensions and renovations mostly crammed into Bromby's original {{convert|15|acre|m2}}. The School subsequently embarked upon a building program which it was thought could take 30 years to complete, with the Senior School, Wadhurst and Grimwade campuses all receiving attention. The Centenary Building Campaign of 1958 began this expansion. Another solution to this problem since this time has been the steady acquisition of neighbouring properties.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nIn 1986 the governors decided on a staged restructure of the school. Until then, Wadhurst, established as a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] in 1886 and Grimwade House, opened in 1918, had operated as two parallel [[feeder school]]s taking students through to Year 8. Grimwade's boarding house had closed in the mid-1970s, leading to debate on the best use of the newly available space. It was decided to introduce girls at primary levels at Grimwade House, and today Grimwade House caters for girls and boys up to Year 6 and Wadhurst for boys in Years 7 and 8.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s were times of further growth, with the [[Outdoor education|outdoor]] program expanded with three permanent campsites at Breakfast Creek near [[Licola, Victoria|Licola]], [[Woodend, Victoria|Woodend]] and [[Banksia Peninsula]] on the [[Gippsland Lakes]]. On 7 April 2008, as part of the celebrations of Melbourne Grammar's [[sesquicentenary]], the School officially opened the multimillion-dollar Nigel Peck Centre for Learning and Leadership on the Domain Road boundary, an event which was attended by the Premier of Victoria, [[John Brumby]], who is also an Old Melburnian.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\n==Headmasters==\n[[Image:MGS Witherby Tower.jpg|thumb|350px|Witherby Tower]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Period\n!Details\n|-\n|1858 \u2013 1875\n|[[John Edward Bromby]]\n|-\n|1875 \u2013 1883\n|[[Edward Ellis Morris]]\n|-\n|1883 \u2013 1885\n|Alexander Pyne\n|-\n|1885 \u2013 1893\n|[[Ambrose Wilson|Ambrose John Wilson]]\n|-\n|1894 \u2013 1898\n|Frederic Sergeant\n|-\n|1899 \u2013 1914\n|George Ernest Blanch\n|-\n|1915 \u2013 1936\n|[[Richard Penrose Franklin]]<br/>([[Henry Girdlestone]] acting 1917\u201319)\n|-\n|1937 \u2013 1938\n|David Stacey Colman\n|-\n|1938 \u2013 1949\n|Joseph Richard Sutcliffe\n|-\n|1950 \u2013 1970\n|Sir [[Brian William Hone]]\n|-\n|1970 \u2013 1987\n|Nigel Arthur Holloway Creese\n|-\n|1988 \u2013 1994\n|Antony James de Villiers Hill\n|-\n|1995 \u2013 2009\n|[[Paul Sheahan|Andrew Paul Sheahan]]\n|-\n|2009 \u2013 2019\n|Roy Kelley\n|-\n|2020 \u2013\n|Philip Grutzner\n|}\n\n==Campuses==\nMelbourne Grammar School features seven [[campus]]es, three used for everyday schooling, one for sporting activities, and three for the School's outdoor education program:\n[[Image:mgs 1.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo of Melbourne Grammar School and surrounds]]\n* Grimwade House \u2013 Caulfield (Co-educational; Prep to Year 6)\n* Wadhurst \u2013 South Yarra (All boys; Years 7 to 8)\n* Senior School \u2013 South Yarra (All boys; Years 9 to 12)\n* Edwin Flack Park \u2013 [[Port Melbourne]] (Sporting complex)\n* Camp Dowd \u2013 Gippsland Lakes (Camp; Year 8)\n* Robert Knox Camp \u2013 Woodend (Camp; Years 5 to 7)\n* L.G.Robertson Camp \u2013 Breakfast Creek, Licola (Camp; Years 9 to 12)\n\n==House system==\nIn 1914, headmaster George Earnest Blanch introduced a formal house structure to further encourage interest in sport and promote physical development. Six houses were originally established. In addition to School House (the traditional English name given to the boarding house), names of the others houses commented the first two headmasters of Melbourne Grammar School (Bromby and Morris), two benefactors (Rusden and Witherby), and two brilliant all-rounder Old Melburnians (Jack and Hugh Ross). A room was assigned to each house where they could gather for meetings and socialise.\n\nInitially, students were sorted into houses based on geographic distribution. Thus, boys from Toorak were put into Bromby House, while those from South Yarra and west of the Yarra River entered into Rusden House. Students from Malvern and Glen Iris joined Morris House, those from Brighton and other suburbs around Port Phillip Bay become members of Ross House, and Witherby House welcomed boys from Canterbury, Camberwell and other suburbs around the perimeter of Essendon.\n\nThe houses competed for the house championship and the prestige of being named \"[[Rooster|Cock]] House\". They competed against each other in cricket, rowing, football, boxing (until 1950), running, shooting (until 1937), tennis and swimming.\n\n=== Cock House Cup ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nFrom the earliest days, competition between the houses was fierce. The prize in question was the [[Rooster|Cock]] House Cup. A points system was put in place, and houses gathered points in a range of sports in their quest to be recognised as the reigning house.\n\nFirst presented in 1916 by Sir [[Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar|Ronald Munro Ferguson]], the sixth Governor General of Australia, the Cock House Cup was intended to stimulate interest in house games and to build the sense of the houses as individual entities.\n\nSchool House was the most successful competitor during the competition, securing the title 26 times between 1914 and 1956. Following each victory, the cup was passed around, according to School House tradition, so that each member of the house could drink from it.\n\n=== Hone reforms ===\nUpon becoming headmaster in 1951, Brian Hone initiated significant change in the purpose of the houses, shifting the focus from sporting prowess to pastoral care, house unity and the growth of the character of the students. The [[Rooster|Cock]] House Cup was thought to be impeding this vision, so it ceased to be awarded.\n\nSchool House, as the original boarding house, was perceived to be the backbone of life at the school. The 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were the era of the \"Long Dorm\", which saw justice meted out by the house captain and prefects. The North dormitory \"terrorised the school\", however, following the disruption to the school during the Second World War a shift in power occurred and the day boys \"got out from under\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Play together, dark blue twenty|last = Eagle|first = Chester|publisher = Trojan Press|year = 1986|isbn = |location = Melbourne|pages = }}</ref> Following the war, it was only the boarders who were still \"terrorised\", by this time it was by the East dormitory.<ref name=\":0\"/> It was Hone who gave the ''coup de gr\u00e2ce'' to the worst school house rituals that remained by the end of his first year.\n\n=== Expansion of the house system ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nThe house system continued to evolve over the next six decades, with the establishment of a further six houses. Perry House was founded in 1940 and established as the school's second boarding house in 1952. Bruce House was established in the same year, as a new house for day students. The next two houses were Deakin House and Miller House, both established in 1961, with Hone House following in 1979. The most recent addition was Creese House, established in 2005.\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[File:MGS Senior Campus.jpg|thumb|left|Senior campus]]\nMelbourne Grammar offers its Years 11 and 12 students the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]] (VCE), the main assessment program which ranks the students in the state.\n\nIn 2004, six Melbourne Grammar students achieved the maximum possible [[Equivalent National Tertiary Entrance Rank]] (ENTER) of 99.95; only 32 students in Victoria achieved this ENTER.

The strong performances of the 1st XI, as seen in 2014 and 2015, have partly been due to the guidance of [[Jesper Olsen]], former Manchester United and Danish International winger.\n\nSalvatore Sitch won the \"MVP\" award for the 1st XI in 2015. Lloyd Skinner won the same award in 2018, followed by Rowan Marshall in 2019.\n\nIn recent years, Melbourne Grammar School has produced A-League footballers including [[Stefan Nigro]] (Melbourne Victory), who received Man of The Match on debut against Brisbane Roar, and Yaren Sozer (Melbourne City FC) who played against EPL giants Manchester City.

Recent noteworthy players include Dane Pineau (recruited by St Marys College US), 2012 Captain and also Captain of the Australian under-19s national team, Daniel Fisher, who went on to attend American University on a scholarship and Victorian State and BigV men's players Jakob Cornelissen (recruited by University of Hawaii US) and Andrew Panyiotou.\n\n====Volleyball====\nMelbourne Grammar School's highest placing in the APS Volleyball Competition is 1st in 2016 and has forged a rich heritage of boys going on to play at University and State levels.\n\n'''Snowsports'''\n\nMelbourne Grammar School has won 18 out of the last 19 Victorian APS Snowsports Cups.\n\n'''Hockey'''\n\nThe varyingly successful MGS Hockey team has seen APS Hockey Competition victory over multiple years, most recently in 2016. Boys who play in a Premiership-winning team are awarded with a ceremonial wooden hockey stick to commemorate their efforts.\n\n'''Cricket'''\n\nMelbourne Grammar School competed in an annual cricket competition with [[Sydney Grammar School|Sydney Grammar]] from 1876 to 1998, which was dubbed \"The Bat\". The competition is the oldest interstate rivalry in Australia, predating even [[the Ashes]]. Melbourne Grammar has won the competition 61 times, and Sydney Grammar has won it 57 times, with 4 draws and 1 tie. In 1998 the competition was changed to include [[Brisbane Grammar School|Brisbane Grammar]] and named the Tri-Grammar Shield. Since the inception of the Shield, Melbourne Grammar has won 10 times, Bribane Grammar 6 times, and Sydney Grammar 5 times.\n\nThe 1st XI Cricket team tours the UK bi-annually.\n\n===Theatre===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Melbourne Grammar School Twelfth Night poster.jpg|thumb|left|The poster for the 2013 Quad Play, [[Twelfth Night]]]] -->\nMelbourne Grammar has a strong theatre department, especially within the Senior Campus, which produces four plays each school year. In Term One, the Quad Play, most commonly a Shakespeare play, but on occasion from other notable playwrights, is performed within the school's Quadrangle, and is open to students in Years 10 to 12. In 2014, the Quad Play celebrated its 40th anniversary with ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', celebrating a notable history of productions including ''[[The Crucible]]'', ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]].''\n\nThe school play, performed in August, is often the centrepiece of the year's theatrical calendar. These take place in the Memorial Hall, which was refurbished in the early 2000s. Staging and sets are constructed jointly by staff and students, often both current and former. These productions alternate between musicals and plays. Notable productions in recent history have included [[Tim Winton]]'s ''[[Cloudstreet]]'', [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s \"[[My Fair Lady]]\", [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'', and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s [[West Side Story]]. In 2014, Melbourne Grammar School performed [[Peter Shaffer]]'s [[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]] and ''[[One Man, Two Guvnors]]'' was presented in 2019.\n\nThe final performance for the year is the Spring Production, which is open to students in Years 9 and 10. These plays take place in late Term Four, off-campus to leave the Memorial Hall free for VCE exams. These productions in recent years have provided modern updates to classic stories, including ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd]]'', as well as performing modern plays such as [[Nick Enright]]'s ''Spurboard''. In 2013 [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]]'s ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'' was performed.\n\nAll of these plays are performed by the students of Melbourne Grammar in conjunction with students from the sister school, [[Melbourne Girls Grammar School]], whose campus is located nearby.\n\nWadhurst, Melbourne Grammar's middle school, also partakes in an annual production. This is performed either on the Wadhurst Deck or in the Wadhurst Hall. These productions usually take the form of a classic children's tale such as ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio|Pinocchio]]'' or ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. In 2008, to celebrate the school's sesquicentenary, the play ''Glimpses of the Generations'' was performed featuring 150 years of the school's history. In 2013, the Wadhurst Production took the form of a film, featuring a Melbourne Grammar twist on ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', produced by students.\n\nYear 8 students also have the opportunity to take part in the Year 8 Project, established in 2012 with a reimagining of [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]. Students from Melbourne Grammar and Melbourne Girls Grammar have the opportunity not only to act in a play but to take part in its development and production. The 2013 production was a surrealist modern update of [[Alan Ayckbourn]]'s ''Ernie's Incredible Illucinations''.\n\n==Crest and motto==\n[[Image:MGSCigcard.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Collectable School Cigarette card featuring the MGS colours & crest, [[Circa|c.]] 1910s]]\nThe school [[motto]], ''Ora et Labora'', which may be [[translated]] from [[Latin]] to \"Pray and Work\", was chosen by the second headmaster, Edward Morris, in 1875.<ref name=Crest>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history_crest.php |title=School Crest and Motto |accessdate=2008-02-02 |work=History |publisher=Melbourne Grammar School |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501222616/http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history_crest.php |archivedate=1 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An old boy of England's [[Rugby School]], Morris exemplified the way the principles of the English Public School system were adopted in Australia, including that education and religion should go hand in hand, as envisaged by Bishop Perry.

This school had been established by Melbourne's first [[Church of England]] [[bishop]], [[Charles Perry (bishop)|Charles Perry]], who founded the [[Anglican Diocese of Melbourne|Diocese of Melbourne]], and had been opened to meet the growing educational needs of the young [[colony]].<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history.php |title=History |accessdate=2008-02-02 |work=About Us |publisher=Melbourne Grammar School |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114233504/http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history.php |archive-date=14 January 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1853, Bishop Perry commenced planning for the diocesan experimental school to become permanent, although on a larger site and not under his direct management, and so he set up a committee of eminent men to consider the task. The school however did not thrive and was suspended at the end of 1854.<ref name=HistoryMGS>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history_mgs.php |title=History of MGS |accessdate=2008-02-02 |work=About Us |publisher=Melbourne Grammar School |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501222626/http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history_mgs.php |archivedate=1 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe first board of governors was elected in 1854 to take over from the committee, and it set about drawing up a [[constitution]], finding a [[headmaster]] and a new site. Locations considered included [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]] and [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]].<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nPerry's dream of building a permanent, centrally located grammar school, based on the principles of the great [[England|English]] [[Public school (UK)|public schools]], was realised in 1855, with a grant from Governor [[Charles Hotham]] of {{convert|15|acre|m2}} on [[St Kilda Road, Melbourne|St Kilda Road]]. This is the inner South Yarra land now occupied by the Senior School and Wadhurst, next to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne|Royal Botanic Gardens]] and a short walk from the [[Melbourne city centre|city centre]]. At the time it was considered relatively isolated and remote. The governors chose [[architect]]s [[Charles Webb (architect)|Charles Webb]] and Thomas Taylor, well known Melbourne contractors [[George Cornwell|George Cornwell and Co.]] undertook the construction, and Bishop Perry laid the school's foundation stone on 30 July 1856.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n[[Image:MGS1876.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Melbourne Grammar School, 1876]]\nThe Melbourne Church of England Grammar School was finally opened on 7 April 1858 with 77 pupils, and with John E. Bromby as the first headmaster. Enrolments grew to 136 during the first year, with four students being the sons of Bromby, and about one quarter of them boarders.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nThe school's first 40 years proved to be a struggle, exacerbated in the 1890s by [[Recession|economic depression]], financial concerns and changes of headmaster. Senior school enrolments fell from 272 in 1889 to 117 in 1894 prompting a group of former students to do something to save the school. They formed The Old Melburnians Society in 1895 \"to be the means of bringing together many former schoolmates, reviving pleasant recollections, and at the same time benefiting the life of the School as it is today\".<ref name=HistoryMGS/><ref> At a meeting held at Melbourne Grammar School on 22 April 1895, called to inaugurate an organisation for former students which would amalgamate and oversee the activities of various sporting activities, such as the athletics, cricket and gymnastics clubs already established for \"old boys\" as well as any others that might be created in the future (e.g., football). After strong debate, with a number of suggested names, including \"Old Church of England Grammar School Boys' Association\", being rejected, the meeting (composed of \"old boys\" from all eras, including the 1860s) decided upon the name \"Old Melburnians\" for the \"old boys\" [[umbrella organization]] (see: [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/139709004 Old Boy, \"College Sports: Weekly Jottings\"], ''The Australasian'', 27 April 1895, p. 19.</ref><ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/935754 \"The Old Melburnians: Inaugural Reunion\"], ''The Argus'',  10 May 1895, p. 6.</ref>\n\nTwo significant developments of the late 19th century were, firstly, the recognition that with a limited site, one storey buildings were not a wise use of space. A move began, continued now, of adding second stories or replacing buildings with two- or three-level structures. The second was the dedication of the Chapel of St Peter in 1893, the first school chapel in the colony of Victoria.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nThe beginning of the new century saw the school's future assured, with enrolments increasing and the [[Golden Jubilee|Jubilee]] celebrated in 1908. Hundreds of former students enlisted in the [[World War I|Great War]] of 1914\u20131918, as they had in the [[Second Boer War|South African War]], and more than 200 did not return.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n[[Image:MGSChapel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Melbourne Grammar School Chapel, [[Circa|c.]]1893]]\nThe 1920s were a relatively stable time for the school, experiencing high academic and sporting results. The 1930s however were an unsettling time. The [[Great Depression]] put pressure on members of the Grammar community, while administrative instability affected the whole school. Between 1935 and 1938 the school had three headmasters and two acting headmasters, and the outbreak of war the following year meant building plans were put on hold. Some 3,500 old boys enlisted in the services, and school buildings were commandeered by Australian and American forces with some students dispatched to the country and others doubled up in crowded quarters.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nBy the 1950s it became clear that the school was seriously lacking adequate space, with expansions, extensions and renovations mostly crammed into Bromby's original {{convert|15|acre|m2}}. The School subsequently embarked upon a building program which it was thought could take 30 years to complete, with the Senior School, Wadhurst and Grimwade campuses all receiving attention. The Centenary Building Campaign of 1958 began this expansion. Another solution to this problem since this time has been the steady acquisition of neighbouring properties.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nIn 1986 the governors decided on a staged restructure of the school. Until then, Wadhurst, established as a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] in 1886 and Grimwade House, opened in 1918, had operated as two parallel [[feeder school]]s taking students through to Year 8. Grimwade's boarding house had closed in the mid-1970s, leading to debate on the best use of the newly available space. It was decided to introduce girls at primary levels at Grimwade House, and today Grimwade House caters for girls and boys up to Year 6 and Wadhurst for boys in Years 7 and 8.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s were times of further growth, with the [[Outdoor education|outdoor]] program expanded with three permanent campsites at Breakfast Creek near [[Licola, Victoria|Licola]], [[Woodend, Victoria|Woodend]] and [[Banksia Peninsula]] on the [[Gippsland Lakes]]. On 7 April 2008, as part of the celebrations of Melbourne Grammar's [[sesquicentenary]], the School officially opened the multimillion-dollar Nigel Peck Centre for Learning and Leadership on the Domain Road boundary, an event which was attended by the Premier of Victoria, [[John Brumby]], who is also an Old Melburnian.<ref name=HistoryMGS/>\n\n==Headmasters==\n[[Image:MGS Witherby Tower.jpg|thumb|350px|Witherby Tower]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Period\n!Details\n|-\n|1858 \u2013 1875\n|[[John Edward Bromby]]\n|-\n|1875 \u2013 1883\n|[[Edward Ellis Morris]]\n|-\n|1883 \u2013 1885\n|Alexander Pyne\n|-\n|1885 \u2013 1893\n|[[Ambrose Wilson|Ambrose John Wilson]]\n|-\n|1894 \u2013 1898\n|Frederic Sergeant\n|-\n|1899 \u2013 1914\n|George Ernest Blanch\n|-\n|1915 \u2013 1936\n|[[Richard Penrose Franklin]]<br/>([[Henry Girdlestone]] acting 1917\u201319)\n|-\n|1937 \u2013 1938\n|David Stacey Colman\n|-\n|1938 \u2013 1949\n|Joseph Richard Sutcliffe\n|-\n|1950 \u2013 1970\n|Sir [[Brian William Hone]]\n|-\n|1970 \u2013 1987\n|Nigel Arthur Holloway Creese\n|-\n|1988 \u2013 1994\n|Antony James de Villiers Hill\n|-\n|1995 \u2013 2009\n|[[Paul Sheahan|Andrew Paul Sheahan]]\n|-\n|2009 \u2013 2019\n|Roy Kelley\n|-\n|2020 \u2013\n|Philip Grutzner\n|}\n\n==Campuses==\nMelbourne Grammar School features seven [[campus]]es, three used for everyday schooling, one for sporting activities, and three for the School's outdoor education program:\n[[Image:mgs 1.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo of Melbourne Grammar School and surrounds]]\n* Grimwade House \u2013 Caulfield (Co-educational; Prep to Year 6)\n* Wadhurst \u2013 South Yarra (All boys; Years 7 to 8)\n* Senior School \u2013 South Yarra (All boys; Years 9 to 12)\n* Edwin Flack Park \u2013 [[Port Melbourne]] (Sporting complex)\n* Camp Dowd \u2013 Gippsland Lakes (Camp; Year 8)\n* Robert Knox Camp \u2013 Woodend (Camp; Years 5 to 7)\n* L.G.Robertson Camp \u2013 Breakfast Creek, Licola (Camp; Years 9 to 12)\n\n==House system==\nIn 1914, headmaster George Earnest Blanch introduced a formal house structure to further encourage interest in sport and promote physical development. Six houses were originally established. In addition to School House (the traditional English name given to the boarding house), names of the others houses commented the first two headmasters of Melbourne Grammar School (Bromby and Morris), two benefactors (Rusden and Witherby), and two brilliant all-rounder Old Melburnians (Jack and Hugh Ross). A room was assigned to each house where they could gather for meetings and socialise.\n\nInitially, students were sorted into houses based on geographic distribution. Thus, boys from Toorak were put into Bromby House, while those from South Yarra and west of the Yarra River entered into Rusden House. Students from Malvern and Glen Iris joined Morris House, those from Brighton and other suburbs around Port Phillip Bay become members of Ross House, and Witherby House welcomed boys from Canterbury, Camberwell and other suburbs around the perimeter of Essendon.\n\nThe houses competed for the house championship and the prestige of being named \"[[Rooster|Cock]] House\". They competed against each other in cricket, rowing, football, boxing (until 1950), running, shooting (until 1937), tennis and swimming.\n\n=== Cock House Cup ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nFrom the earliest days, competition between the houses was fierce. The prize in question was the [[Rooster|Cock]] House Cup. A points system was put in place, and houses gathered points in a range of sports in their quest to be recognised as the reigning house.\n\nFirst presented in 1916 by Sir [[Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar|Ronald Munro Ferguson]], the sixth Governor General of Australia, the Cock House Cup was intended to stimulate interest in house games and to build the sense of the houses as individual entities.\n\nSchool House was the most successful competitor during the competition, securing the title 26 times between 1914 and 1956. Following each victory, the cup was passed around, according to School House tradition, so that each member of the house could drink from it.\n\n=== Hone reforms ===\nUpon becoming headmaster in 1951, Brian Hone initiated significant change in the purpose of the houses, shifting the focus from sporting prowess to pastoral care, house unity and the growth of the character of the students. The [[Rooster|Cock]] House Cup was thought to be impeding this vision, so it ceased to be awarded.\n\nSchool House, as the original boarding house, was perceived to be the backbone of life at the school. The 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were the era of the \"Long Dorm\", which saw justice meted out by the house captain and prefects. The North dormitory \"terrorised the school\", however, following the disruption to the school during the Second World War a shift in power occurred and the day boys \"got out from under\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Play together, dark blue twenty|last = Eagle|first = Chester|publisher = Trojan Press|year = 1986|isbn = |location = Melbourne|pages = }}</ref> Following the war, it was only the boarders who were still \"terrorised\", by this time it was by the East dormitory.<ref name=\":0\"/> It was Hone who gave the ''coup de gr\u00e2ce'' to the worst school house rituals that remained by the end of his first year.\n\n=== Expansion of the house system ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nThe house system continued to evolve over the next six decades, with the establishment of a further six houses. Perry House was founded in 1940 and established as the school's second boarding house in 1952. Bruce House was established in the same year, as a new house for day students. The next two houses were Deakin House and Miller House, both established in 1961, with Hone House following in 1979. \nThe most recent addition was Creese House, established in 2005.\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[File:MGS Senior Campus.jpg|thumb|left|Senior campus]]\nMelbourne Grammar offers its Years 11 and 12 students the [[Victorian Certificate of Education]] (VCE), the main assessment program which ranks the students in the state.\n\nIn 2004, six Melbourne Grammar students achieved the maximum possible [[Equivalent National Tertiary Entrance Rank]] (ENTER) of 99.95; only 32 students in Victoria achieved this ENTER.

In 2005 the orchestra toured Malaysia and Singapore and in 2006 travelled to China, performing in [[Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Guangzhou]]. In 2007 the orchestra toured [[Dubai]], [[Zagreb]], [[Ljubljana]] and [[Venice]], while in December 2008 the orchestra once again returned to [[Malaysia]] for Martin Rutherford's final orchestra tour.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 2009, Mark Drummond took over the orchestra and in 2010 it toured Japan, performing in [[Osaka]], [[Tokyo]] (at the Okuma Auditorium which is located at [[Waseda University]]) and [[Gamagori]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The MGSSO toured France and Belgium in 2012, then the USA in 2014, and Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic in 2016. In 2018, visited the UK, playing in London, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The orchestra is usually made up of around 100 students, the vast majority attendants of the school. \n\nAll campuses have their own choirs, concert bands and string orchestras. The chapel choir is the oldest of any Victorian private school and consists of about 40 select members. It sings at the weekly Eucharists along with occasional concerts with the like of the [[Australian Brandenburg Orchestra]].\n\nThe MGSSO has accompanied international soloists such as Ronald Farren-Price, [[Leslie Howard (musician)|Leslie Howard]] and Neville Taweel, and has premiered works by Australian and British composers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.amcoz.com.au/composers/composer.asp?id=4778| title=Martin Rutherford, Associate Composer, Australian Music Centre|accessdate=2007-08-14|year=2006|author=Martin Rutherford| publisher = Australian Music Centre}}</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n\n====Cordner-Eggleston Cup====\n{{Main|Cordner-Eggleston Cup}}\n[[Image:Tom wills statue.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Statue at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] of [[Tom Wills]] umpiring the first recorded match of Australian rules football between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar]]\nThe Cordner-Eggleston Cup is competed for each year by the 1st XVIII football teams of Melbourne Grammar School and the [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] and has been run since 1858, making it the longest running school football fixture in the world. It commemorates the first recorded game of [[Australian Rules Football]], which was played between the two schools on 7 August 1858, which ended in a 1-1 draw and is today commemorated by a statue depicting the game outside the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=64959|title=A Time Honoured Rivalry|author=AFL Website|accessdate=22 Nov 2009}}</ref> \n\n====Rose and Thistle Cup====\nThe Rose and Thistle Cup traditionally is the match of the Melbourne Grammar Soccer 1st XI and the Scotch College 1st XI. Inaugurated in 2008, it represents the Rose of England (symbolising Melbourne Grammar School's origins) and the Thistle of Scotland (symboling the roots of Scotch College). The Cup has an annual theme of 'Two Traditions, One Spirit.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotch.vic.edu.au/greatscot/2010sepGS/39.htm|title=Great Scot|website=www.scotch.vic.edu.au|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref>\n\n====Rowing====\nMelbourne Grammar has a proud rowing record, having claimed the Head of the River 28 times, the most recent being in 2016. In 2009 the school had an exceptional 1st VIII who broke the Head of the River record. They also won the National Schoolboy 8+ over the [[Sydney Church of England Grammar School|Shore School]] in a record time of 5:49. The 2016 MGS 1st VIII, having won the Head of the River title, went on to compete at the Henley Royal Regatta, UK, in the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup. The crew were inaugural winners of the Leander Club Challenge Cup.\n\n====Athletics====\nIn recent years, Melbourne Grammar School has become a force in athletics, winning the APS premiership for the first time in 48 years in 2010. Over the past seven years, the school has won the Victorian track relay titles.\n\n====Soccer====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nSoccer is currently one of the most played sports at the school, with 12 teams being fielded in the APS Soccer Competition.\n\nThe Melbourne Grammar 1st XI Soccer team is yet to win an APS premiership. Following the hiring of VIS youth coach Ernie Merrick in 2000, the 1st XI began a steady improvement in subsequent years, leading to a third placed finish in a tightly-contested 2014 season and subsequently missed out on winning the premiership cup following a draw against the reigning premiers, Brighton Grammar. The strong performances of the 1st XI, as seen in 2014 and 2015, have partly been due to the guidance of [[Jesper Olsen]], former Manchester United and Danish International winger.\n\nSalvatore Sitch won the \"MVP\" award for the 1st XI in 2015. Lloyd Skinner won the same award in 2018, followed by Rowan Marshall in 2019.\n\nIn recent years, Melbourne Grammar School has produced A-League footballers including [[Stefan Nigro]] (Melbourne Victory), who received Man of The Match on debut against Brisbane Roar, and Yaren Sozer (Melbourne City FC) who played against EPL giants Manchester City. Furthermore, Old Melbournians have signed for overseas clubs in Spain.\n\n====Basketball====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nMelbourne Grammar is an emerging force in the Victorian APS Basketball Competition, finishing 3rd in 2012 and 2014. Recent noteworthy players include Dane Pineau (recruited by St Marys College US), 2012 Captain and also Captain of the Australian under-19s national team, Daniel Fisher, who went on to attend American University on a scholarship and Victorian State and BigV men's players Jakob Cornelissen (recruited by University of Hawaii US) and Andrew Panyiotou.\n\n====Volleyball====\nMelbourne Grammar School's highest placing in the APS Volleyball Competition is 1st in 2016 and has forged a rich heritage of boys going on to play at University and State levels.\n\n'''Snowsports'''\n\nMelbourne Grammar School has won 18 out of the last 19 Victorian APS Snowsports Cups.\n\n'''Hockey'''\n\nThe varyingly successful MGS Hockey team has seen APS Hockey Competition victory over multiple years, most recently in 2016. Boys who play in a Premiership-winning team are awarded with a ceremonial wooden hockey stick to commemorate their efforts.\n\n'''Cricket'''\n\nMelbourne Grammar School competed in an annual cricket competition with [[Sydney Grammar School|Sydney Grammar]] from 1876 to 1998, which was dubbed \"The Bat\". The competition is the oldest interstate rivalry in Australia, predating even [[the Ashes]]. Melbourne Grammar has won the competition 61 times, and Sydney Grammar has won it 57 times, with 4 draws and 1 tie. In 1998 the competition was changed to include [[Brisbane Grammar School|Brisbane Grammar]] and named the Tri-Grammar Shield. Since the inception of the Shield, Melbourne Grammar has won 10 times, Bribane Grammar 6 times, and Sydney Grammar 5 times.\n\nThe 1st XI Cricket team tours the UK bi-annually.\n\n===Theatre===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Melbourne Grammar School Twelfth Night poster.jpg|thumb|left|The poster for the 2013 Quad Play, [[Twelfth Night]]]] -->\nMelbourne Grammar has a strong theatre department, especially within the Senior Campus, which produces four plays each school year. In Term One, the Quad Play, most commonly a Shakespeare play, but on occasion from other notable playwrights, is performed within the school's Quadrangle, and is open to students in Years 10 to 12. In 2014, the Quad Play celebrated its 40th anniversary with ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', celebrating a notable history of productions including ''[[The Crucible]]'', ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]].''\n\nThe school play, performed in August, is often the centrepiece of the year's theatrical calendar. These take place in the Memorial Hall, which was refurbished in the early 2000s. Staging and sets are constructed jointly by staff and students, often both current and former. These productions alternate between musicals and plays. Notable productions in recent history have included [[Tim Winton]]'s ''[[Cloudstreet]]'', [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s \"[[My Fair Lady]]\", [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'', and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s [[West Side Story]]. In 2014, Melbourne Grammar School performed [[Peter Shaffer]]'s [[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]] and ''[[One Man, Two Guvnors]]'' was presented in 2019.\n\nThe final performance for the year is the Spring Production, which is open to students in Years 9 and 10. These plays take place in late Term Four, off-campus to leave the Memorial Hall free for VCE exams. These productions in recent years have provided modern updates to classic stories, including ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd]]'', as well as performing modern plays such as [[Nick Enright]]'s ''Spurboard''. In 2013 [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]]'s ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'' was performed.\n\nAll of these plays are performed by the students of Melbourne Grammar in conjunction with students from the sister school, [[Melbourne Girls Grammar School]], whose campus is located nearby.\n\nWadhurst, Melbourne Grammar's middle school, also partakes in an annual production. This is performed either on the Wadhurst Deck or in the Wadhurst Hall. These productions usually take the form of a classic children's tale such as ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio|Pinocchio]]'' or ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. In 2008, to celebrate the school's sesquicentenary, the play ''Glimpses of the Generations'' was performed featuring 150 years of the school's history. In 2013, the Wadhurst Production took the form of a film, featuring a Melbourne Grammar twist on ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', produced by students.\n\nYear 8 students also have the opportunity to take part in the Year 8 Project, established in 2012 with a reimagining of [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]. Students from Melbourne Grammar and Melbourne Girls Grammar have the opportunity not only to act in a play but to take part in its development and production. The 2013 production was a surrealist modern update of [[Alan Ayckbourn]]'s ''Ernie's Incredible Illucinations''.\n\n==Crest and motto==\n[[Image:MGSCigcard.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Collectable School Cigarette card featuring the MGS colours & crest, [[Circa|c.]] 1910s]]\nThe school [[motto]], ''Ora et Labora'', which may be [[translated]] from [[Latin]] to \"Pray and Work\", was chosen by the second headmaster, Edward Morris, in 1875.<ref name=Crest>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history_crest.php |title=School Crest and Motto |accessdate=2008-02-02 |work=History |publisher=Melbourne Grammar School |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501222616/http://www.mgs.vic.edu.au/about/mgs_history_crest.php |archivedate=1 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An old boy of England's [[Rugby School]], Morris exemplified the way the principles of the English Public School system were adopted in Australia, including that education and religion should go hand in hand, as envisaged by Bishop Perry.

This typically occurs in the area overlying [[lymphoid tissue|lymphoid]] aggregates. These neutrophils, along with [[lymphocyte|mononuclear cells]], may infiltrate the [[Crypts of Lieberkuhn|crypts]], leading to inflammation (crypititis) or abscess (crypt abscess).\n\n[[Granuloma]]s, aggregates of macrophage derivatives known as giant cells, are found in 50% of cases and are most specific for Crohn's disease. The granulomas of Crohn's disease do not show \"caseation\", a cheese-like appearance on microscopic examination characteristic of granulomas associated with infections, such as [[tuberculosis]]. Biopsies may also show chronic mucosal damage, as evidenced by blunting of the intestinal [[Intestinal villus|villi]], atypical branching of the crypts, and a change in the tissue type ([[metaplasia]]).

It typically manifests in the gastrointestinal tract and can be categorized by the specific tract region affected. A disease of both the [[ileum]] (the last part of the small intestine that connects to the [[large intestine]]), and the large intestine, [[Ileocolic]] Crohn's accounts for fifty percent of cases. Crohn's ileitis, manifest in the ileum only, accounts for thirty percent of cases, while Crohn's colitis, of the large intestine, accounts for the remaining twenty percent of cases and may be particularly difficult to distinguish from ulcerative colitis.\n\nGastroduodenal Crohn's disease causes inflammation in the stomach and first part of the small intestine called the duodenum. Jejunoileitis causes spotty patches of inflammation in the top half of the small intestine, called the jejunum.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan WC, Allan RN | title = Diffuse jejunoileitis of Crohn's disease | journal = Gut | volume = 34 | issue = 10 | pages = 1374\u20138 | date = October 1993 | pmid = 8244104 | pmc = 1374544 | doi = 10.1136/gut.34.10.1374 }}</ref> The disease can attack any part of the digestive tract, from mouth to anus.

Stricturing disease causes narrowing of the bowel that may lead to bowel obstruction or changes in the caliber of the [[feces]].

Los Pollos Hermanos trucks were used to smuggle drugs manufactured by the show's fictional drug cartel across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. The company eventually became a subsidiary of fictional German shipping conglomerate, Madrigal Electromotive GmbH, whose connections Fring used to further increase the outreach of both his legal and illegal operations. After Fring's death at the hands of [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] and [[Hector Salamanca]], the chain was closed, with the flagship restaurant in Albuquerque reverting to Twisters, the same restaurant which is used as the filming set in real-life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.insider.com/netflix-el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-references-breakdown-2019-10 |title=30 details you may have missed in Netflix's 'Breaking Bad' movie |last=Acuna |first=Olivia Singh, Kirsten |date=October 18, 2019 |website=[[Insider (website)|Insider]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200418072122/https://www.insider.com/netflix-el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-references-breakdown-2019-10 |archive-date=April 18, 2020 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Real life history ==\n[[File:Breaking_Bad_Locations_(17351686340).jpg|thumb|left|The Twisters store in Albuquerque used for Los Pollos Hermanos during filming of ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nWhile ''Breaking Bad'' was still on air in 2013, Twisters claims to have received a 10% increase in revenue due to its association with ''Breaking Bad''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2013/02/26/a-breaking-bad-pilgrimage-to-twisters-the-real-los-pollos-hermanos-3515683/ |title=A Breaking Bad pilgrimage to the real Los Pollos Hermanos |last=Hooton |first=Christopher |date=February 26, 2013 |website=Metro |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191102123504/https://metro.co.uk/2013/02/26/a-breaking-bad-pilgrimage-to-twisters-the-real-los-pollos-hermanos-3515683/ |archive-date=November 2, 2019 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> In 2014, a [[Cook County, Illinois]] man was arrested and charged with several crimes including the manufacturing of methamphetamine, and wore a Los Pollos Hermanos shirt in his mugshot.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://time.com/10549/breaking-bad-t-shirt-meth-lab-arrest/ |title=Guy Wearing Breaking Bad Shirt Busted for Meth Lab |last=Nicks |first=Denver |date=February 26, 2014 |website=Time |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528040029/http://time.com/10549/breaking-bad-t-shirt-meth-lab-arrest/ |archive-date=May 28, 2016 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/02/man-wearing-breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-t-shirt-busted-for-meth-lab |title=Man Wearing 'Breaking Bad' Los Pollos Hermanos T-shirt Busted for Allegedly Running Meth Lab |last=Fields |first=Liz |date=February 26, 2014 |website=ABC News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522151645/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/02/man-wearing-breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-t-shirt-busted-for-meth-lab/ |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> ''Breaking Bad'' creator [[Vince Gilligan]] revealed on a 2013 [[Reddit AMA]] that there were talks at Sony to make Los Pollos Hermanos into a real restaurant.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/a-real-life-los-pollos-hermanos-restaurant-is-in-the-works-with-backing-from-breaking-bad-creator-10219360.html |title=A real life Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant is in the works |date=May 1, 2015 |website=The Independent |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217070831/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/a-real-life-los-pollos-hermanos-restaurant-is-in-the-works-with-backing-from-breaking-bad-creator-10219360.html |archive-date=February 17, 2018 |access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the restaurant's logo was the subject of a lawsuit brought by Humberto Puentes-Segura, the artist who created it, alleging that [[Sony]] infringed on his copyright by selling merchandise emblazoned with the image without permission.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-artist-sues-sony-942720 |title=Artist Behind 'Breaking Bad's' Los Pollos Hermanos Sues Sony |last=Cullins |first=Ashley |date=October 31, 2016 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215111736/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-artist-sues-sony-942720 |archive-date=December 15, 2016 |access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> \"Plaintiff did not, however, grant Defendant Topanga Productions or any other person or entity any ancillary rights in the Artwork, or the right to license, manufacture, distribute, or sell any merchandise bearing any reproduction of any portion of the Artwork, or any derivative works thereof,\" writes attorney Benjamin Feuchter in the complaint.\n\nIn 2017 Los Pollos Hermanos was a [[pop-up restaurant]] that toured several cities.

Brothers''') is a [[fried chicken]] fast food restaurant that originated in the television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[Better Call Saul]]''. In the fictional universe of ''Breaking Bad'', Los Pollos Hermanos is a [[front organization]] for [[Gus Fring]]'s meth manufacturing and distribution operation. The set used for the restaurant in the show was at a [[Twisters]] branch in [[South Valley, New Mexico]], and Twisters has seen an increase in business attributed to being associated with ''Breaking Bad''. Due to the shows' popularity, Los Pollos Hermanos has also appeared on numerous occasions and locations a real-life [[pop-up restaurant]].\n\n== In-universe history ==\nLos Pollos Hermanos was founded by Chilean nationals [[Gus Fring]] and [[Max Arciniega (Breaking Bad)|Max Arciniega]] in Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/breaking-bad-hermanos-1798169493 |title=Breaking Bad: \u201cHermanos\u201d |last=Bowman |first=Donna |date=September 4, 2011 |website=[[The A.V.

Eventually Gus emigrated to the United States and opened branches primarily in [[New Mexico]], and the chain grew to have over a dozen locations throughout the [[American Southwest]]. Los Pollos Hermanos trucks were used to smuggle drugs manufactured by the show's fictional drug cartel across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]]. The company eventually became a subsidiary of fictional German shipping conglomerate, Madrigal Electromotive GmbH, whose connections Fring used to further increase the outreach of both his legal and illegal operations. After Fring's death at the hands of [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] and [[Hector Salamanca]], the chain was closed, with the flagship restaurant in Albuquerque reverting to Twisters, the same restaurant which is used as the filming set in real-life.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.insider.com/netflix-el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-references-breakdown-2019-10 |title=30 details you may have missed in Netflix's 'Breaking Bad' movie |last=Acuna |first=Olivia Singh, Kirsten |date=October 18, 2019 |website=[[Insider (website)|Insider]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200418072122/https://www.insider.com/netflix-el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-references-breakdown-2019-10 |archive-date=April 18, 2020 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Real life history ==\n[[File:Breaking_Bad_Locations_(17351686340).jpg|thumb|left|The Twisters store in Albuquerque used for Los Pollos Hermanos during filming of ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nWhile ''Breaking Bad'' was still on air in 2013, Twisters claims to have received a 10% increase in revenue due to its association with ''Breaking Bad''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://metro.co.uk/2013/02/26/a-breaking-bad-pilgrimage-to-twisters-the-real-los-pollos-hermanos-3515683/ |title=A Breaking Bad pilgrimage to the real Los Pollos Hermanos |last=Hooton |first=Christopher |date=February 26, 2013 |website=Metro |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191102123504/https://metro.co.uk/2013/02/26/a-breaking-bad-pilgrimage-to-twisters-the-real-los-pollos-hermanos-3515683/ |archive-date=November 2, 2019 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> In 2014, a [[Cook County, Illinois]] man was arrested and charged with several crimes including the manufacturing of methamphetamine, and wore a Los Pollos Hermanos shirt in his mugshot.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://time.com/10549/breaking-bad-t-shirt-meth-lab-arrest/ |title=Guy Wearing Breaking Bad Shirt Busted for Meth Lab |last=Nicks |first=Denver |date=February 26, 2014 |website=Time |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528040029/http://time.com/10549/breaking-bad-t-shirt-meth-lab-arrest/ |archive-date=May 28, 2016 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/02/man-wearing-breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-t-shirt-busted-for-meth-lab |title=Man Wearing 'Breaking Bad' Los Pollos Hermanos T-shirt Busted for Allegedly Running Meth Lab |last=Fields |first=Liz |date=February 26, 2014 |website=ABC News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522151645/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2014/02/man-wearing-breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-t-shirt-busted-for-meth-lab/ |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> ''Breaking Bad'' creator [[Vince Gilligan]] revealed on a 2013 [[Reddit AMA]] that there were talks at Sony to make Los Pollos Hermanos into a real restaurant.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/a-real-life-los-pollos-hermanos-restaurant-is-in-the-works-with-backing-from-breaking-bad-creator-10219360.html |title=A real life Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant is in the works |date=May 1, 2015 |website=The Independent |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217070831/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/a-real-life-los-pollos-hermanos-restaurant-is-in-the-works-with-backing-from-breaking-bad-creator-10219360.html |archive-date=February 17, 2018 |access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the restaurant's logo was the subject of a lawsuit brought by Humberto Puentes-Segura, the artist who created it, alleging that Sony infringed on his copyright by selling merchandise emblazoned with the image without permission.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-artist-sues-sony-942720 |title=Artist Behind 'Breaking Bad's' Los Pollos Hermanos Sues Sony |last=Cullins |first=Ashley |date=October 31, 2016 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215111736/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/breaking-bad-los-pollos-hermanos-artist-sues-sony-942720 |archive-date=December 15, 2016 |access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> \"Plaintiff did not, however, grant Defendant Topanga Productions or any other person or entity any ancillary rights in the Artwork, or the right to license, manufacture, distribute, or sell any merchandise bearing any reproduction of any portion of the Artwork, or any derivative works thereof,\" writes attorney Benjamin Feuchter in the complaint.\n\nIn 2017 Los Pollos Hermanos was a [[pop-up restaurant]] that toured several cities.

He married Laura, daughter of Baron [[Hermann de Stern]] (of Portugal) and Julia, daughter of Aaron Asher Goldsmid, brother of Sir [[Isaac Lyon Goldsmid]], by whom he had one son and four daughters. He assumed the additional surnames and [[Coat of arms|arms]] of [[Goldsmid family|Goldsmid]] and [[Stern family|Stern]] in 1899.\n\nHe studied at [[University College, London|University College]], London and at [[Caius College, Cambridge]], gaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1874.<ref name=Venn>{{acad|id=SLMS870DL|name=Salomons (post Goldsmid-Stern-Salomons), David Lionel}}</ref> In the same year he was called to the bar at the [[Middle Temple]].<ref name=Venn />\n\n==Career==\nHe went on to produce several scientific works and pamphlets. He was a [[Justice of the Peace|JP]], [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] and [[High Sheriff of Kent|Sheriff]] (1880) of [[Kent]], mayor and [[alderman]] of [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[County council]]or for the [[Tonbridge]] division of Kent for 15 years, J.P. for London, [[Middlesex]], Sussex, and [[Westminster]], and chairman (1896\u20131900) and Joint managing director (1915\u201323) of the [[City of London Electric Lighting Company Limited]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Manual of Electrical Undertakings (Vols.2\u201327)|last=Garcke|first=|publisher=Garcke|year=1897\u20131924|isbn=|location=London|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==House==\nHis home north of [[Tunbridge Wells]], Broomhill, is preserved as the [[Salomons Museum]]. It is also a part of Markerstudy Group, and is a centre for postgraduate training, research and consultancy. Salomons was interested in electricity from an early age and when he inherited Broomhill in 1873, he set up large laboratories and workshops where he investigated electromotive force and electric conductors and carried out countless experiments. He took out patents for electric lamps, current meters and various improvements to electrical equipment. The workshops were said to contain some 60,000 tools, which could manufacture anything from a watch to a steam engine and also included a huge electromagnet.\n\nOne of the new technologies Salomons installed at Broomhill was electric light. He had his own coal-fired generator and could produce enough electricity for 1,000 sixteen candle-power (about 60 watt) light bulbs. Electricity was installed on a small scale at first, in the workshops in 1874, where it was used for an arc light and to drive motors. Domestic electric lighting did not come in until about 1877\u20131880 when [[Joseph Swan]] invented a light bulb that could be used in homes, and Broomhill became one of the first to be lit with electricity.\n\nSalomons also developed one of the first electric cooking devices, an electric butter churn and the first electric alarms, all made and installed by Salomons and his staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/salomons-museum/david-lionel-salomons.asp |title=David Lionel Salomons \u2013 Master of electricity |publisher=Canterbury Christ Church University |accessdate=11 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720144338/http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/salomons-museum/david-lionel-salomons.asp |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> There is also a [[Welte-Mignon|Welte Philharmonic organ]] from 1914.<ref name=\"ROM\">''WELTE restored''. Royal Academy of Music, 2011</ref>\n\n==Horology==\nIn addition to his many other achievements, he developed a lifelong passion for [[horology]] and became the leading authority in his lifetime on the work of the famed Swiss-French watchmaker [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]], who is generally acknowledged as the greatest watchmaker of all time. In 1921 he self-published the first major work on Breguet's life and career, including a detailed review of Breguet's inventions, and a timeline of production, with illustrations of major timepieces from his own collection.\n\nOver the course of his lifetime Salomons amassed the world's largest private collection of Breguet watches and clocks, comprising 124 pieces, including the two watches considered to be the pinnacle of Breguet's art\u2014the [[Marie Antoinette (watch)|\"Marie Antoinette\" (No. 160)]] and the \"Duc de Praslin\" (No. 92). In 1924 Salomons donated the \"Duc de Praslin\" to the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers]] in Paris, but it was subsequently stolen.

He married Laura, daughter of Baron [[Hermann de Stern]] (of Portugal) and Julia, daughter of Aaron Asher Goldsmid, brother of Sir [[Isaac Lyon Goldsmid]], by whom he had one son and four daughters. He assumed the additional surnames and [[Coat of arms|arms]] of [[Goldsmid family|Goldsmid]] and [[Stern family|Stern]] in 1899.\n\nHe studied at [[University College, London|University College]], London and at [[Caius College, Cambridge]], gaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1874.<ref name=Venn>{{acad|id=SLMS870DL|name=Salomons (post Goldsmid-Stern-Salomons), David Lionel}}</ref> In the same year he was called to the bar at the [[Middle Temple]].<ref name=Venn />\n\n==Career==\nHe went on to produce several scientific works and pamphlets. He was a [[Justice of the Peace|JP]], [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] and [[High Sheriff of Kent|Sheriff]] (1880) of [[Kent]], mayor and [[alderman]] of [[Tunbridge Wells]], [[County council]]or for the [[Tonbridge]] division of Kent for 15 years, J.P. for London, [[Middlesex]], Sussex, and [[Westminster]], and chairman (1896\u20131900) and Joint managing director (1915\u201323) of the [[City of London Electric Lighting Company Limited]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Manual of Electrical Undetakings (Vols.2\u201327)|last=Garcke|first=|publisher=Garcke|year=1897\u20131924|isbn=|location=London|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==House==\nHis home north of [[Tunbridge Wells]], Broomhill, is preserved as the [[Salomons Museum]]. It is also a part of Markerstudy Group, and is a centre for postgraduate training, research and consultancy. Salomons was interested in electricity from an early age and when he inherited Broomhill in 1873, he set up large laboratories and workshops where he investigated electromotive force and electric conductors and carried out countless experiments. He took out patents for electric lamps, current meters and various improvements to electrical equipment. The workshops were said to contain some 60,000 tools, which could manufacture anything from a watch to a steam engine and also included a huge electromagnet. \n\nOne of the new technologies Salomons installed at Broomhill was electric light. He had his own coal-fired generator and could produce enough electricity for 1,000 sixteen candle-power (about 60 watt) light bulbs. Electricity was installed on a small scale at first, in the workshops in 1874, where it was used for an arc light and to drive motors. Domestic electric lighting did not come in until about 1877\u20131880 when [[Joseph Swan]] invented a light bulb that could be used in homes, and Broomhill became one of the first to be lit with electricity. \n\nSalomons also developed one of the first electric cooking devices, an electric butter churn and the first electric alarms, all made and installed by Salomons and his staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/salomons-museum/david-lionel-salomons.asp |title=David Lionel Salomons \u2013 Master of electricity |publisher=Canterbury Christ Church University |accessdate=11 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720144338/http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/salomons-museum/david-lionel-salomons.asp |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}</ref> There is also a [[Welte-Mignon|Welte Philharmonic organ]] from 1914.<ref name=\"ROM\">''WELTE restored''.

In 1921 he self-published the first major work on Breguet's life and career, including a detailed review of Breguet's inventions, and a timeline of production, with illustrations of major timepieces from his own collection. \n\nOver the course of his lifetime Salomons amassed the world's largest private collection of Breguet watches and clocks, comprising 124 pieces, including the two watches considered to be the pinnacle of Breguet's art\u2014the [[Marie Antoinette (watch)|\"Marie Antoinette\" (No. 160)]] and the \"Duc de Praslin\" (No. 92). In 1924 Salomons donated the \"Duc de Praslin\" to the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers]] in Paris, but it was subsequently stolen. Fortunately, after three months of tinkering with the watch, the thief was apprehended and the watch recovered when he took it to a renowned Parisian watch specialist for repair.\n\nOn his death in 1925, Salomons' bequeathed 57 of his best Breguet pieces (including the \"Marie Antoinette\") to the [[L.A.

He won two [[Johnny Warren]] Medals, awarded to the best player in the Australian league and was top scorer on 5 occasions.  He established a reputation as a pacy, poaching goalscorer, which is notable for a player who started his career as a defender.\n\n==Early and personal life==\nMori was born in [[Box Hill North, Victoria]] in 1970. His father, Joseph Mori, was a footballer who emigrated from [[Slovenia]].<ref name=\"fox-interview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/simon-hill-chats-to-damian-mori-about-his-career-in-the-nsl-and-a-league-and-his-coaching-ambitions/story-e6frf4gl-1226564200399 | title=Simon Hill chats to Damian Mori about his career in the NSL and A-League and his coaching ambitions | work=Fox Sports Australia | date=29 January 2013 | accessdate=6 February 2014 | author=Hill, Simon}}</ref> His paternal grandfather was of [[Italian Australians|Italian]] ancestry.\n\n== Club career ==\nMori was successful at club level \u2013 mainly in the [[National Soccer League (Australia)|Australian domestic league]]. After developing into [[Adelaide City FC|Adelaide City]]'s most important and best player, he spent a single season (1996\u201397) overseas in Germany with [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]]. This move was characterised only by frustration. He appeared in only six games, and never played more than half a match. In those six games, he didn't score once. Mori returned home to become [[National Soccer League|NSL]] Top Goalscorer the following season.\n\nIn 1996, Mori held the world record for the [[Fastest goals in association football|fastest goal]] after he scored for City in just 3.69 seconds in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Sydney United]].\n\nIn 2000, Mori transferred to [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]] and enjoyed great success. The striking partnership with [[Bobby Despotovski]] was renowned as one of the most potent in the competition. Mori won the [[National Soccer League|NSL]] championship in 2002\u201303, scoring in the Grand Final. He was also part of the 2003\u201304 Perth Glory championship side.\n\nFollowing the end of the [[National Soccer League]] in 2004 he moved back to Adelaide City to play and coach in the South Australian Premier League. He was extremely successful here, winning the \"Coach of the Year\" award. However, many were surprised at the fact that the [[National Soccer League|NSL]] all-time top goalscorer was not on the shortlist of any [[A-League]] club.\n\nIt later emerged that a major stumbling block was Mori's desire for a part-time contract to allow him to manage business interests in [[Adelaide]]. Prior to round four of the A-League season, it was announced that Perth Glory had signed Mori on a short-term contract to replace injured defender [[David Tarka]].  Mori subsequently came on as a substitute in the Glory's 1 \u2013 0 away win over the [[New Zealand Knights]] on 22 September 2005. After some excellent displays, particularly a brace against [[Newcastle United Jets]] and a hat-trick against [[Adelaide United]], the club strongly desired a permanent deal. After some wrangling with Adelaide City chairman Bob D'Ottavi, Mori agreed to a one-year deal.\n\nOn 9 December 2005, it was announced that Mori would be appointed as assistant manager at Perth Glory. This appointment followed the elevation of [[Alan Vest]] to Manager after the departure of [[Steve McMahon (footballer)|Steve McMahon]]. After the completion of the [[2005\u201306 A-League|2005\u201306 A-League season]], Mori returned to Adelaide City as [[player-manager]].\n\nOn 27 September 2006, Mori signed with the [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]] on a short term deal to cover the loss of [[Nik Mrdja]] which was extended once. After the short term contract with the Mariners had expired, the [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]] did not allow Central Coast to re-sign him. On 21 November 2006, he was approached by new [[Queensland Roar]] manager [[Frank Farina]] and signed the following day on a short-term \"until the end of the season\" contract. After the Roar failed to make the playoffs, Mori returned to SA to be the player-coach once again of defending South Australian champions Adelaide City.\n\n== International career ==\nMori made his international debut against [[Solomon Islands national football team|Solomon Islands]] on 4 September 1992. In an international career that spanned over the next ten years, he was [[cap (football)|cap]]ped 45 times and scored 29 goals.\n\n'''International goals'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # !!

He won two [[Johnny Warren]] Medals, awarded to the best player in the Australian league and was top scorer on 5 occasions.  He established a reputation as a pacy, poaching goalscorer, which is notable for a player who started his career as a defender.\n\n==Early and personal life==\nMori was born in [[Box Hill North, Victoria]] in 1970. His father, Joseph Mori, was a footballer who emigrated from [[Slovenia]].<ref name=\"fox-interview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/simon-hill-chats-to-damian-mori-about-his-career-in-the-nsl-and-a-league-and-his-coaching-ambitions/story-e6frf4gl-1226564200399 | title=Simon Hill chats to Damian Mori about his career in the NSL and A-League and his coaching ambitions | work=Fox Sports Australia | date=29 January 2013 | accessdate=6 February 2014 | author=Hill, Simon}}</ref> His paternal grandfather was of [[Italian Australians|Italian]] ancestry.\n\n== Club career ==\nMori was successful at club level \u2013 mainly in the [[National Soccer League (Australia)|Australian domestic league]]. After developing into [[Adelaide City FC|Adelaide City]]'s most important and best player, he spent a single season (1996\u201397) overseas in Germany with [[Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach]]. This move was characterised only by frustration. He appeared in only six games, and never played more than half a match. In those six games, he didn't score once. Mori returned home to become [[National Soccer League|NSL]] Top Goalscorer the following season.\n\nIn 1996, Mori held the world record for the [[Fastest goals in association football|fastest goal]] after he scored for City in just 3.69 seconds in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Sydney United]].\n\nIn 2000, Mori transferred to [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]] and enjoyed great success. The striking partnership with [[Bobby Despotovski]] was renowned as one of the most potent in the competition. Mori won the [[National Soccer League|NSL]] championship in 2002\u201303, scoring in the Grand Final. He was also part of the 2003\u201304 Perth Glory championship side.\n\nFollowing the end of the [[National Soccer League]] in 2004 he moved back to Adelaide City to play and coach in the South Australian Premier League. He was extremely successful here, winning the \"Coach of the Year\" award. However, many were surprised at the fact that the [[National Soccer League|NSL]] all-time top goalscorer was not on the shortlist of any [[A-League]] club.\n\nIt later emerged that a major stumbling block was Mori's desire for a part-time contract to allow him to manage business interests in [[Adelaide]]. Prior to round four of the A-League season, it was announced that Perth Glory had signed Mori on a short-term contract to replace injured defender [[David Tarka]].  Mori subsequently came on as a substitute in the Glory's 1 \u2013 0 away win over the [[New Zealand Knights]] on 22 September 2005. After some excellent displays, particularly a brace against [[Newcastle United Jets]] and a hat-trick against [[Adelaide United]], the club strongly desired a permanent deal. After some wrangling with Adelaide City chairman Bob D'Ottavi, Mori agreed to a one-year deal.\n\nOn 9 December 2005, it was announced that Mori would be appointed as assistant manager at Perth Glory. This appointment followed the elevation of [[Alan Vest]] to Manager after the departure of [[Steve McMahon (footballer)|Steve McMahon]]. After the completion of the [[2005\u201306 A-League|2005\u201306 A-League season]], Mori returned to Adelaide City as [[player-manager]].\n\nOn 27 September 2006, Mori signed with the [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]] on a short term deal to cover the loss of [[Nik Mrdja]] which was extended once. After the short term contract with the Mariners had expired, the [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]] did not allow Central Coast to re-sign him. On 21 November 2006, he was approached by new [[Queensland Roar]] manager [[Frank Farina]] and signed the following day on a short-term \"until the end of the season\" contract. After the Roar failed to make the playoffs, Mori returned to SA to be the player-coach once again of defending South Australian champions Adelaide City.\n\n== International career ==\nMori made his international debut against [[Solomon Islands national football team|Solomon Islands]] on 4 September 1992. In an international career that spanned over the next ten years, he was [[cap (football)|cap]]ped 45 times and scored 29 goals.\n\n'''International goals'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! # !!
