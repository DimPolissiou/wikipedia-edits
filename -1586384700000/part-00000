Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor, raising concerns about [[nepotism]]. He also stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel.

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor, raising concerns about [[nepotism]]. He also stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel. Kushner had an influential role within the Trump administration in its response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which included advising Trump in the first two months of the outbreak that the media was exaggerating the threat of the virus, and later on helping to draft an error-riddled Oval Office address about the crisis.\n\n== Early life (1981\u20132007) ==\nKushner was born in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], to Seryl Kushner (n\u00e9e Stadtmauer) and [[Charles Kushner]], a real-estate developer and convicted felon.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |title=The Legacy |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=July 12, 2009 |first=Gabriel |last=Sherman |accessdate=January 3, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103120035/http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |archivedate=January 3, 2015 }}</ref> \n\nHis paternal grandparents, Reichel and [[Joseph Kushner]], were Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S. in 1949 from [[Navahrudak]], now in [[Belarus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |title=What Does Trump's Presidency Mean for Belarus? |last=Rudnik |first=Alesia |last2=Smok |first2=Vadzim |date=November 18, 2016 |website=BelarusDigest.com |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180709183434/https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |archive-date=July 9, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=July 9, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |title=The Young Trump: Jared Kushner's Rise to Unimaginable Power |first=Andrew |last=Rice |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=January 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115000329/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |archivedate=January 15, 2017 }}</ref> Morris Stadtmauer was Jared's [[maternal grandfather]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kushner Insider January 30, 2015 |url=https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |website=[[Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy]]/[[Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School]] |accessdate=July 7, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422084708/https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |archivedate=April 22, 2016  |date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> \n\nRaised in a [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox Jewish]] family,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |title=Jared Kushner once broke up with Ivanka Trump over 'religion issue' |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224132903/http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |archivedate=February 24, 2017 }}</ref> Kushner graduated from the [[Frisch School]], a Modern Orthodox [[Jewish day school|yeshiva high school]], in 1999.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n=Squadron History=\n\n==1950s==\n\n===Roots===\n[[File:Consolidated PB4Y-2 Naval Aviation Museum.jpg|left|thumb|PB4Y-2 BuNo 66261 (marked as BuNo 66304) in the collection of the [[National Naval Aviation Museum]] at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]].]]\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2 Privateers]]<ref name=\"Donald\">Donald</ref> from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden]], [[Schleswig Air Base|Schleswig], and [[RAF Hal Far|Malta]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cold War Museum|url = http://www.coldwar.org/histories/HistoryofUSNavyFleetAirReconnaissancePartTwo.asp|website = www.coldwar.org|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />. All sixteen aircrew were killed.\n# On 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> These EP-3s were converted from [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3A and P-3B]] airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. \n\nIn May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to [[Hellenikon Air Base|Athens]]. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flareups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. \n\nDespite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria, and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nAlthough the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps.\n# On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/> \n# On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America '']]  in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the [[Arresting gear]] when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The America's plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float forcing the ship to have one of its A-7A' strafe it to sink it as it was deemed a hazard to navigation<ref name=\"A3H\" /> \n# On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Lucius D.

At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]].

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

With the plane seeming to enter a stall, the pilot signalled for a crew bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed but at 1200 feet altitude. Again, just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the slat suddenly operated allowing a recovery at Ramstein. Although bailing out at a low altitude, the four back end crew survived.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E.

DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> These EP-3s were converted from [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3A and P-3B]] airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. \n\nIn May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to [[Hellenikon Air Base|Athens]]. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flareups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. \n\nDespite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria, and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nAlthough the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps.\n# On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/> \n# On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS America (CV-42)|USS ''America '']]  in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the [[Arresting gear]] when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The America's plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float forcing the ship to have one of its A-7A' strafe it to sink it as it was deemed a hazard to navigation<ref name=\"A3H\" /> \n# On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005. The relocation of VQ-2's six aircraft and 450 Sailors to the United States was in keeping with the Navy's ongoing transformation of forces in [[Europe]] and helped reduce costs and eliminate redundancies throughout its force structure worldwide. The move co-located the squadron with [[VQ-1]], already based at NAS Whidbey Island, and realized efficiency through the consolidation of personnel deployment practices, aircraft maintenance practices, and aircrew training for these unique Navy squadrons.<ref>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Scheduled for Homeport Change|url = http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=18681|website = www.navy.mil|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==2010s==\nThe squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012 ending 57 years of service.

He also served as a [[Military commander|commander]] of the [[Pakistan Army]]'s division to stop the first Baloch insurgency of 1948. Khan had also served as appointed ''Chief of National Security'' under [[Prime minister of Pakistan|prime minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. Under his guidance, the Army had quelled the Balochi Insurgency during the early and mid-1970s. In spite of his engaging military career, Khan is mostly known in [[Pakistan]] as the main conspirator of the first but failed coup attempt of 1951, which came to be known as the ''Rawalpindi Conspiracy''.\n\n==Early life and the army==\nAkbar Khan was born 1 December 1912<ref>January 1946 Half Yearly Army List</ref> in a fairly affluent [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] family. He was the son of Muhammad Akram Khan. He belonged to a village named [[Utmanzai, Charsadda|Utmanzai]] (Parichkhail Family)  in the district of [[Charsadda District, Pakistan|Charsadda]].\n\n==Waziristan War of 1937 and Second World War==\n\nHe took part in operations in [[Waziristan campaign 1936\u20131939|Waziristan war]] during 1937\u20131938. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] he served with the 14th battalion, [[13th Frontier Force Rifles]], part of [[100th Indian Infantry Brigade]] of the [[Indian 20th Infantry Division|20th Indian Division]] during active combat operations against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in [[Burma]]. As a Captain and temporary Major he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for conspicuous gallantry and leadership displayed during the [[Battle of Kwanlan Ywathit]].<ref>http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/may/war.htm</ref><ref>London Gazette 21 June 1945</ref>\n\n==Indo-Pakistan War 1947-1948==\nAt the time of  the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, Akbar Khan was a member of the sub-committee involved in the division of the armed forces between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].\n\nAkbar Khan's own book ''Raiders in Kashmir'' (National Book Foundation, Pakistan, 1975) gives a thorough account of his role in the Pakistani attack on Maharaja Hari Singh's princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir.]]  His original role was in arranging guns and devising strategies for the [[1947 Poonch Rebellion|Poonch rebels]] organised by [[Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan|Sardar Ibrahim]] with the assistance of the Pakistan Army.  He makes clear he had no involvement in the Pashtun lashkars organised by [[Khurshid Anwar (Major)|Khurshid Anwar]], which [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|invaded]] the state on 22 October 1947.\n\nLess than two months after Independence, fighting started in [[Kashmir]], the Indian Army landed in [[Srinagar]] and confronted the Pathan tribesmen who were advancing towards the valley. Akbar Khan, who was then a Brigadier, assumed command of the regulars and irregulars fighting against the Indian forces and was given the code name \"General Tariq\".\n\n== The Rawalpindi Conspiracy ==\n\n===Change of heart===\n\nIt was during this period that he first became dissatisfied with the moral and material support being given to the Pakistani fighters by [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]'s government. He also had a grudge against General [[Douglas David Gracey]], then Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army, who had put a brake on the deeper involvement of the Pakistani army on the Kashmir front. Akbar Khan was of the opinion&nbsp;\u2013 rightly or wrongly&nbsp;\u2013 that acceptance of the ceasefire in Kashmir when he was only four hours away from capturing [[Srinagar]] was a mistake, and the armed operation against the Indian Army should have been continued.\n\nThe constraints under which Akbar Khan had to conduct the battle in Kashmir made him a very frustrated and dissatisfied man. By nature he was extremely brave and, in fact, rather rash. He was also very ambitious. All these qualities and tendencies combined to propel him towards conjuring up a plan to remove the Liaquat government by means of a coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\n===The conspiracy begins===\nIn sheer frustration, Akbar Khan started discourses with other armed forces officers to form a group to stage a military coup. The government also became suspicious of his moves. Akbar Khan's wife, [[Begum Nasim]] (daughter of the famous Muslim League woman politician [[Begum Jahanara Shahnawaz]]), was quite indiscreet in her conversation, criticizing the Government and its policies before all and sundry, as did Akbar Khan himself, to some extent. He thus came under the watch of the intelligence agencies.\n\nBrigadier Akbar was now due for promotion on the basis of his seniority. In December, 1950, he was promoted to Major General and posted as [[Chief of General Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of General Staff]] in GHQ. In his book ''Friends, Not Masters'', General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] wrote that he (Ayub) decided to post Akbar in the GHQ so that, firstly Akbar should not have direct command over troops like a Division Commander, and secondly because he could be kept under close watch by General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] himself. Meanwhile, Akbar Khan continued his surreptitious meetings and discussions with various army officers and later with the civilians too.\n\n===The Communist Party connection===\nIn those days the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]] was under tremendous pressure from [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]'s government. It was not being allowed to function openly as a political party. Arrest warrants had been issued for all the top leaders of the party&nbsp;\u2014 all the members of the party's central committee had gone underground. Ordinary workers and even sympathizers were often arrested, beaten, sent to the fearful Lahore Fort for interrogation and threatened with dire consequences if they did not break all connections with the CP. This was the climate of oppression of the left at that time.\n\nAkbar Khan's wife Nasim had vast connections with political families and political personalities such as [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]], who was a committed sympathizer of the party. All these political connections brought together the [[Chief of General Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of General Staff]] and the CP leadership.\n\nApparently the general had promised the CP leadership that if he came to power he would stop the continuous governmental assault on the leftists; the CP would be allowed to function as a legitimate political party like any other party and to take part in the elections which General Akbar promised to hold a few months after consolidating his power. In return the CP and its affiliated trade unions, kissan ([[peasant]]) committees, etc., would welcome the military government. The [[Pakistan Times]], one of the leading newspapers of that period, whose editor was [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]], would lend editorial support to General Akbar's new dispensation.\n\n===The day and co-conspirators===\nOn 23 February 1951, a meeting was held at Major General Akbar Khan's house in which besides a number of military officers, three civilians were also present, namely Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Syed [[Sajjad Zaheer]] (General Secretary of the CP) and [[Mohammed Hussain Ata]]. In this meeting were also present Lt-Colonel [[Siddique Raja]] MC, and Major [[Mohammed Yousuf Sethi]] both of whom later obtained state pardon and became approvers in the case against the others. The Chief of General Staff Akbar Khan presented his plan in this meeting which was to arrest the Governor-General [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]] and the Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]], both of whom were expected to be in Rawalpindi after a week ([[Karachi]] being the capital at that time). The [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] was to be forced to announce the dismissal of the Liaquat Government and the formation of an interim government presumably under General Akbar Khan. General elections under the army's supervision were also promised but no timeframe was given. The general also spoke about [[Kashmir]], land reforms, eradication of corruption and nepotism and some such other topic.\n\n===The probable leak===\nAmong General Akbar's confidants was one [[Askar Ali Shah]], a police officer who was although not present at the meeting of 23 February 1951, had been informed beforehand by the general that he was going to convene such a meeting. This police officer had been a confidant of the general for over two years (or more) and had never leaked out any secret. But this time he got cold feet and blurted out to his [[IG Police]], who in turn informed the Governor NWFP about the meeting. The governor wasted no time in contacting the [[Prime Minister]].\n\n===The conspiracy foiled===\nThe first four persons to be arrested were the Chief of the General Staff Major General Akbar Khan, the Brigade Commander of Quetta, Brigadier M.A. Latif Khan, [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]] and Akbar's wife Nasim. Later some other people were also picked up. But one of the accused, [[Mohammed Hussain Ata]], who was underground eluded arrest for a long time. He was eventually arrested in East Pakistan about a month after the trial proceedings had commenced.\n\nMost of the accused were originally kept in various Lahore jails and later shifted to [[Hyderabad jail]] where a special compound inside the jail had been renovated and turned into the court premises. A [[special tribunal]] had been formed by the government to hear the case. The tribunal consisted of [[Justice Sir Abdul Rahman]] of the federal court, [[Justice Mohammed Sharif]] of the [[Punjab High Court]] and [[Justice Amir-ud-Din]] of the [[Dacca High Court]].\n\n===The trial===\nThe trial began on 15 June 1951 at 8.00 a.m. The prosecution was led by the formidable [[A.K. Brohi]] - this was one of his earlier cases. Later he was to achieve great fame and notoriety as a legal adviser of dictators and authoritarians. The incomparable [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] appeared on behalf of Brigadier Latif and [[Z.H. Lari]] on behalf of [[General Akbar]]. Other famous practitioners who appeared for the defence were [[Malik Faiz Mohammed]], [[Khawaja Abdul Rahim]], [[Sahibzada Nawazish Ali]] and [[Qazi Aslam]]. Gradually as the case proceeded and continued month after month, many of the counsel departed due to the inability of their clients to pay them. But credit goes to H.S. Suhrawardy who fought till the very end even when his client had stopped paying him anything more.\n\nThe basic charge against all the accused was one of \"Conspiracy to wage war against the King\". \"A careful scrutiny of the first charge\" said the judgement, \"shows that it relates to a conspiracy alleged by prosecution to have come into being for overthrowing the Government established by law in Pakistan by means of criminal force or show of criminal force.\" Other allegations, though punishable offences in themselves, were \"either the consequences of this conspiracy or merely means to achieve the object for which it was stated to have been entered into.\" The judgement was, therefore, directed mainly to examine whether the evidence produced by the prosecution was sufficient to establish \"(i) the existence of conspiracy ; and if that is found established, (ii) who are proved to have been parties to it?\" The evidence led by the prosecution to prove its case was both documentary and oral. The latter was of \"persons, who, without being either parties or willing parties to it, either deposed to the existence of the conspiracy or stated facts which might lead a court to draw a conclusion in favour of its existence; and (of) persons who were either, on their own statements, or on account of admissions of facts made by them, or due to existence of other reasonable grounds, held to be willing parties to the conspiracy.\"\n\nThe case as presented by the prosecution, relied basically on the evidence of the two approvers, and other witnesses who gave circumstantial evidence. It was not a false case at all. In general the bulk of the evidence was true. But there was a major falsehood which negated all the claims of the state of presenting a truthful case before the tribunal.\n\nThe prosecution induced the approvers to state that at the end of the crucial meeting of 23 February 1951 the people present had agreed to overthrow the government. They had to tell this lie because otherwise the allegation of conspiracy would have fallen flat. According to the penal code a conspiracy is only established 'when two or more persons agree to commit an illegal act or a legal act by illegal means'. If there is no agreement there is no conspiracy under the law.\n\nThe Conspirators claimed that after eight long hours of discussion, of arguments and counter-arguments, of high tension and near nervous breakdown, the group of persons assembled in Akbar Khan's house that day had agreed not to take any steps in pursuance of the plan presented by the Chief of General Staff. There was no agreement, and therefore no conspiracy!\nGeneral Akbar could have very well been punished under the Army Act for even presenting such a plan and for trying to subvert the loyalty of others.\n\nIn jail the military officers and the intellectual civilians managed to get along together reasonably well, in spite of wide differences in ideology and thinking between some individuals. Actually, General Akbar had somehow managed to gather quite a diverse bunch of characters.\n\nThere were Major General Nazir Ahmad, who was an [[Ahmadi]]; Air Commodore [[Mohammad Khan Janjua]] who was Pakistan's first Air Chief; Major [[Gul Hassan Khan|Hasan Khan]] was a  [[Shia]]; Brigadier Latif was into the [[Deobandi]] ideology and read a lot of religious books; Brigadier [[Sadiq]], Lt-Col Ziauddin and Captain Khizar Hayat had faith in [[Pir (Sufism)|pir]]s and [[murshid]]s; Lt-Col [[Niaz Mohammad Arbab]] was a good-natured person, belonging to an affluent and influential [[Arbab]] family of [[Tekhal Bala]], near [[Peshawar]]. He was totally uncommitted ideologically, so much so that much later he became a minister in General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]'s government.\n\n[[Syed Sajjad Zaheer]], [[Mohammed Hussain Ata]] and Faiz Ahmed Faiz were communists of varying degree. So was Major Ishaq Mohammed, but at that time he was still a beginner. Later, of course, Major Ishaq became a symbol of militant left-wing politics in Pakistan. He was a fearless person and used to argue with vehemence even with the judges of the Tribunal. After an exchange of hot words, Justice [[Sir Abdul Rahman]] thundered: \"I will set you right\", to which Ishaq boldly replied: \"Go ahead, my Lord!\" The Justice could then only mutter, \"I pity you\". Ishaq and Ata were both hot-tempered and indulged in blistering polemics when discussing politics in jail.\n\nThe two coolest customers in that circle were the senior members of the group, [[Syed Sajjad Zaheer]] and Faiz Ahmed Faiz.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOf the fifteen, the only woman, [[Begum Nasim]], was acquitted, while [[Major General Nazir Ahmad]] was dismissed from service and sentenced till the rising of the court. All the others received prison sentences ranging from a minimum of four years (civilians and junior officers) to a maximum of 12 years for Major General Akbar Khan.\n\nIn the words of the principal accused, Akbar Khan, it was General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (the Army C-in-C) who was the choreographer of this comic strip (conspiracy case) and who apparently had feared that Akbar Khan had about two divisions at his disposal, to support him. His ordeal after his arrest is best described in his own words:\n\n{{cquote|bgcolor=#F0FFF0|.... In the early hours of the morning on 9 March 1951 I was arrested and carried away the whole of that day, a long distance from Pindi, to jail. In the deserted suburbs of what looked like a dead town, distant and asleep, that cold night, at 11 p.m. the massive doors of the jail groaned creaked and opened slowly to swallow a motor convoy that was bringing me in seventeen hours had been taken by that convoy speeding across territory that I had not been permitted to see, so that neither the route nor the destination should be known to me or anyone else interested in following us. That morning while I had been sleeping peacefully, a hundred men had surrounded my house and successfully overpowered my one unarmed watchman. Then Major-General [[Mian Hayauddin]] knocked at my bedroom window and said that he had to see me about something most urgent. I had gone at once, without even putting on shoes, through the study door to meet him. But as I emerged, men with bayonets and sten guns had rushed at me from three sides&nbsp;\u2014 the front and both flanks. I had been rushed at before, during the war, by the Japanese in fighting&nbsp;\u2014 but never by 20 to one and not when I was unarmed. I had only a split second to think and I had let them come on. I think it had been the complete failure of this melodrama to impress me at all that had stopped the men mid-stride. No bayonet or sten gun had reached my body&nbsp;\u2014 and the few hands that had been laid at me had been quickly withdrawn. A mere telephone call would have sufficed to tell me that I was under arrest. But instead all troops had been alerted and these men had apparently expected to be gunned down by some sort of desperado}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] himself made the announcement from [[Lahore]] about the conspiracy which was generally regarded as treason and the conspiracy came to be known as \"The Rawalpindi Conspiracy\".\n\nThe UK [[High Commissioner]] in his 3rd report to his Government on the Rawalpindi Conspiracy ending 17 March 1951 on the question of evidence against the conspirators, stated that \"General Akbar Khan was a dangerous man, under the influence of an ambitious wife, and that he had been regarded as very anti-[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] before he went to the [[United Kingdom]] last year to attend the [[Joint Services Staff College (UK)|Joint Services Staff College]]. According to Gracey the Defence Secretary [[Iskander Mirza]] wished Akbar to go on to the [[Imperial Defence College]] to \"complete his education\". The impression was that on his return, he would be less anti-British, and it was felt that he might be sobered up by being given a responsible job under the eye of the Commander-in-Chief at GHQ. General Gracey also told Colonel Franklin that he had informed the Chief of the Imperial Staff of Akbar's tendencies before he had left for the course... According to an informant... the police have been investigating the activities of Akbar and his wife for the last two years, and General Gracey also maintains that these two, and certain of his friends, had been known as the \"[[Young Turk]] Party\".

He also served as a [[Military commander|commander]] of the [[Pakistan Army]]'s division to stop the first Baloch insurgency of 1948. Khan had also served as appointed ''Chief of National Security'' under [[Prime minister of Pakistan|prime minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. Under his guidance, the Army had quelled the Balochi Insurgency during the early and mid-1970s. In spite of his engaging military career, Khan is mostly known in [[Pakistan]] as the main conspirator of the first but failed coup attempt of 1951, which came to be known as the ''Rawalpindi Conspiracy''.\n\n==Early life and the army==\nAkbar Khan was born 1 December 1912<ref>January 1946 Half Yearly Army List</ref> in a fairly affluent [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] family. He was the son of Muhammad Akram Khan. He belonged to a village named [[Utmanzai, Charsadda|Utmanzai]] (Parichkhail Family)  in the district of [[Charsadda District, Pakistan|Charsadda]].\n\n==Waziristan War of 1937 and Second World War==\n\nHe took part in operations in [[Waziristan campaign 1936\u20131939|Waziristan war]] during 1937\u20131938. During the [[World War II|Second World War]] he served with the 14th battalion, [[13th Frontier Force Rifles]], part of [[100th Indian Infantry Brigade]] of the [[Indian 20th Infantry Division|20th Indian Division]] during active combat operations against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in [[Burma]]. As a Captain and temporary Major he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for conspicuous gallantry and leadership displayed during the [[Battle of Kwanlan Ywathit]].<ref>http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/may/war.htm</ref><ref>London Gazette 21 June 1945</ref>\n\n==Indo-Pakistan War 1947-1948==\nAt the time of  the [[Partition of India|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, Akbar Khan was a member of the sub-committee involved in the division of the armed forces between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].\n\nAkbar Khan's own book ''Raiders in Kashmir'' (National Book Foundation, Pakistan, 1975) gives a thorough account of his role in the Pakistani attack on Maharaja Hari Singh's princely state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir.]]  His original role was in arranging guns and devising strategies for the [[1947 Poonch Rebellion|Poonch rebels]] organised by [[Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan|Sardar Ibrahim]] with the assistance of the Pakistan Army.  He makes clear he had no involvement in the Pashtun lashkars organised by [[Khurshid Anwar (Major)|Khurshid Anwar]], which [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|invaded]] the state on 22 October 1947.\n\nLess than two months after Independence, fighting started in [[Kashmir]], the Indian Army landed in [[Srinagar]] and confronted the Pathan tribesmen who were advancing towards the valley. Akbar Khan, who was then a Brigadier, assumed command of the regulars and irregulars fighting against the Indian forces and was given the code name \"General Tariq\".\n\n== The Rawalpindi Conspiracy ==\n\n===Change of heart===\n\nIt was during this period that he first became dissatisfied with the moral and material support being given to the Pakistani fighters by [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]'s government. He also had a grudge against General [[Douglas David Gracey]], then Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army, who had put a brake on the deeper involvement of the Pakistani army on the Kashmir front. Akbar Khan was of the opinion&nbsp;\u2013 rightly or wrongly&nbsp;\u2013 that acceptance of the ceasefire in Kashmir when he was only four hours away from capturing [[Srinagar]] was a mistake, and the armed operation against the Indian Army should have been continued.\n\nThe constraints under which Akbar Khan had to conduct the battle in Kashmir made him a very frustrated and dissatisfied man. By nature he was extremely brave and, in fact, rather rash. He was also very ambitious. All these qualities and tendencies combined to propel him towards conjuring up a plan to remove the Liaquat government by means of a coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\n===The conspiracy begins===\nIn sheer frustration, Akbar Khan started discourses with other armed forces officers to form a group to stage a military coup. The government also became suspicious of his moves. Akbar Khan's wife, [[Begum Nasim]] (daughter of the famous Muslim League woman politician [[Begum Jahanara Shahnawaz]]), was quite indiscreet in her conversation, criticizing the Government and its policies before all and sundry, as did Akbar Khan himself, to some extent. He thus came under the watch of the intelligence agencies.\n\nBrigadier Akbar was now due for promotion on the basis of his seniority. In December, 1950, he was promoted to Major General and posted as [[Chief of General Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of General Staff]] in GHQ. In his book ''Friends, Not Masters'', General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] wrote that he (Ayub) decided to post Akbar in the GHQ so that, firstly Akbar should not have direct command over troops like a Division Commander, and secondly because he could be kept under close watch by General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] himself. Meanwhile, Akbar Khan continued his surreptitious meetings and discussions with various army officers and later with the civilians too.\n\n===The Communist Party connection===\nIn those days the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]] was under tremendous pressure from [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]'s government. It was not being allowed to function openly as a political party. Arrest warrants had been issued for all the top leaders of the party&nbsp;\u2014 all the members of the party's central committee had gone underground. Ordinary workers and even sympathizers were often arrested, beaten, sent to the fearful Lahore Fort for interrogation and threatened with dire consequences if they did not break all connections with the CP. This was the climate of oppression of the left at that time.\n\nAkbar Khan's wife Nasim had vast connections with political families and political personalities such as [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]], who was a committed sympathizer of the party. All these political connections brought together the [[Chief of General Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of General Staff]] and the CP leadership.\n\nApparently the general had promised the CP leadership that if he came to power he would stop the continuous governmental assault on the leftists; the CP would be allowed to function as a legitimate political party like any other party and to take part in the elections which General Akbar promised to hold a few months after consolidating his power. In return the CP and its affiliated trade unions, kissan ([[peasant]]) committees, etc., would welcome the military government. The [[Pakistan Times]], one of the leading newspapers of that period, whose editor was [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]], would lend editorial support to General Akbar's new dispensation.\n\n===The day and co-conspirators===\nOn 23 February 1951, a meeting was held at Major General Akbar Khan's house in which besides a number of military officers, three civilians were also present, namely Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Syed [[Sajjad Zaheer]] (General Secretary of the CP) and [[Mohammed Hussain Ata]]. In this meeting were also present Lt-Colonel [[Siddique Raja]] MC, and Major [[Mohammed Yousuf Sethi]] both of whom later obtained state pardon and became approvers in the case against the others. The Chief of General Staff Akbar Khan presented his plan in this meeting which was to arrest the Governor-General [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]] and the Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]], both of whom were expected to be in Rawalpindi after a week ([[Karachi]] being the capital at that time). The [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] was to be forced to announce the dismissal of the Liaquat Government and the formation of an interim government presumably under General Akbar Khan. General elections under the army's supervision were also promised but no timeframe was given. The general also spoke about [[Kashmir]], land reforms, eradication of corruption and nepotism and some such other topic.\n\n===The probable leak===\nAmong General Akbar's confidants was one [[Askar Ali Shah]], a police officer who was although not present at the meeting of 23 February 1951, had been informed beforehand by the general that he was going to convene such a meeting. This police officer had been a confidant of the general for over two years (or more) and had never leaked out any secret. But this time he got cold feet and blurted out to his [[IG Police]], who in turn informed the Governor NWFP about the meeting. The governor wasted no time in contacting the [[Prime Minister]].\n\n===The conspiracy foiled===\nThe first four persons to be arrested were the Chief of the General Staff Major General Akbar Khan, the Brigade Commander of Quetta, Brigadier M.A. Latif Khan, [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]] and Akbar's wife Nasim. Later some other people were also picked up. But one of the accused, [[Mohammed Hussain Ata]], who was underground eluded arrest for a long time. He was eventually arrested in East Pakistan about a month after the trial proceedings had commenced.\n\nMost of the accused were originally kept in various Lahore jails and later shifted to [[Hyderabad jail]] where a special compound inside the jail had been renovated and turned into the court premises. A [[special tribunal]] had been formed by the government to hear the case. The tribunal consisted of [[Justice Sir Abdul Rahman]] of the federal court, [[Justice Mohammed Sharif]] of the [[Punjab High Court]] and [[Justice Amir-ud-Din]] of the [[Dacca High Court]].\n\n===The trial===\nThe trial began on 15 June 1951 at 8.00 a.m. The prosecution was led by the formidable [[A.K. Brohi]] - this was one of his earlier cases. Later he was to achieve great fame and notoriety as a legal adviser of dictators and authoritarians. The incomparable [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]] appeared on behalf of Brigadier Latif and [[Z.H. Lari]] on behalf of [[General Akbar]]. Other famous practitioners who appeared for the defence were [[Malik Faiz Mohammed]], [[Khawaja Abdul Rahim]], [[Sahibzada Nawazish Ali]] and [[Qazi Aslam]]. Gradually as the case proceeded and continued month after month, many of the counsel departed due to the inability of their clients to pay them. But credit goes to H.S. Suhrawardy who fought till the very end even when his client had stopped paying him anything more.\n\nThe basic charge against all the accused was one of \"Conspiracy to wage war against the King\". \"A careful scrutiny of the first charge\" said the judgement, \"shows that it relates to a conspiracy alleged by prosecution to have come into being for overthrowing the Government established by law in Pakistan by means of criminal force or show of criminal force.\" Other allegations, though punishable offences in themselves, were \"either the consequences of this conspiracy or merely means to achieve the object for which it was stated to have been entered into.\" The judgement was, therefore, directed mainly to examine whether the evidence produced by the prosecution was sufficient to establish \"(i) the existence of conspiracy ; and if that is found established, (ii) who are proved to have been parties to it?\" The evidence led by the prosecution to prove its case was both documentary and oral. The latter was of \"persons, who, without being either parties or willing parties to it, either deposed to the existence of the conspiracy or stated facts which might lead a court to draw a conclusion in favour of its existence; and (of) persons who were either, on their own statements, or on account of admissions of facts made by them, or due to existence of other reasonable grounds, held to be willing parties to the conspiracy.\"\n\nThe case as presented by the prosecution, relied basically on the evidence of the two approvers, and other witnesses who gave circumstantial evidence. It was not a false case at all. In general the bulk of the evidence was true. But there was a major falsehood which negated all the claims of the state of presenting a truthful case before the tribunal.\n\nThe prosecution induced the approvers to state that at the end of the crucial meeting of 23 February 1951 the people present had agreed to overthrow the government. They had to tell this lie because otherwise the allegation of conspiracy would have fallen flat. According to the penal code a conspiracy is only established 'when two or more persons agree to commit an illegal act or a legal act by illegal means'. If there is no agreement there is no conspiracy under the law.\n\nThe Conspirators claimed that after eight long hours of discussion, of arguments and counter-arguments, of high tension and near nervous breakdown, the group of persons assembled in Akbar Khan's house that day had agreed not to take any steps in pursuance of the plan presented by the Chief of General Staff. There was no agreement, and therefore no conspiracy!\nGeneral Akbar could have very well been punished under the Army Act for even presenting such a plan and for trying to subvert the loyalty of others.\n\nIn jail the military officers and the intellectual civilians managed to get along together reasonably well, in spite of wide differences in ideology and thinking between some individuals. Actually, General Akbar had somehow managed to gather quite a diverse bunch of characters.\n\nThere were Major General Nazir Ahmad, who was an [[Ahmadi]]; Air Commodore [[Mohammad Khan Janjua]] who was Pakistan's first Air Chief; Major [[Gul Hassan Khan|Hasan Khan]] was a  [[Shia]]; Brigadier Latif was into the [[Deobandi]] ideology and read a lot of religious books; Brigadier [[Sadiq]], Lt-Col Ziauddin and Captain Khizar Hayat had faith in [[Pir (Sufism)|pir]]s and [[murshid]]s; Lt-Col [[Niaz Mohammad Arbab]] was a good-natured person, belonging to an affluent and influential [[Arbab]] family of [[Tekhal Bala]], near [[Peshawar]]. He was totally uncommitted ideologically, so much so that much later he became a minister in General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]'s government.\n\n[[Syed Sajjad Zaheer]], [[Mohammed Hussain Ata]] and Faiz Ahmed Faiz were communists of varying degree. So was Major Ishaq Mohammed, but at that time he was still a beginner. Later, of course, Major Ishaq became a symbol of militant left-wing politics in Pakistan. He was a fearless person and used to argue with vehemence even with the judges of the Tribunal. After an exchange of hot words, Justice [[Sir Abdul Rahman]] thundered: \"I will set you right\", to which Ishaq boldly replied: \"Go ahead, my Lord!\" The Justice could then only mutter, \"I pity you\". Ishaq and Ata were both hot-tempered and indulged in blistering polemics when discussing politics in jail.\n\nThe two coolest customers in that circle were the senior members of the group, [[Syed Sajjad Zaheer]] and Faiz Ahmed Faiz.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOf the fifteen, the only woman, [[Begum Nasim]], was acquitted, while [[Major General Nazir Ahmad]] was dismissed from service and sentenced till the rising of the court. All the others received prison sentences ranging from a minimum of four years (civilians and junior officers) to a maximum of 12 years for Major General Akbar Khan.\n\nIn the words of the principal accused, Akbar Khan, it was General [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (the Army C-in-C) who was the choreographer of this comic strip (conspiracy case) and who apparently had feared that Akbar Khan had about two divisions at his disposal, to support him. His ordeal after his arrest is best described in his own words:\n\n{{cquote|bgcolor=#F0FFF0|.... In the early hours of the morning on 9 March 1951 I was arrested and carried away the whole of that day, a long distance from Pindi, to jail. In the deserted suburbs of what looked like a dead town, distant and asleep, that cold night, at 11 p.m. the massive doors of the jail groaned creaked and opened slowly to swallow a motor convoy that was bringing me in seventeen hours had been taken by that convoy speeding across territory that I had not been permitted to see, so that neither the route nor the destination should be known to me or anyone else interested in following us. That morning while I had been sleeping peacefully, a hundred men had surrounded my house and successfully overpowered my one unarmed watchman. Then Major-General [[Mian Hayauddin]] knocked at my bedroom window and said that he had to see me about something most urgent. I had gone at once, without even putting on shoes, through the study door to meet him. But as I emerged, men with bayonets and sten guns had rushed at me from three sides&nbsp;\u2014 the front and both flanks. I had been rushed at before, during the war, by the Japanese in fighting&nbsp;\u2014 but never by 20 to one and not when I was unarmed. I had only a split second to think and I had let them come on. I think it had been the complete failure of this melodrama to impress me at all that had stopped the men mid-stride. No bayonet or sten gun had reached my body&nbsp;\u2014 and the few hands that had been laid at me had been quickly withdrawn. A mere telephone call would have sufficed to tell me that I was under arrest. But instead all troops had been alerted and these men had apparently expected to be gunned down by some sort of desperado}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] himself made the announcement from [[Lahore]] about the conspiracy which was generally regarded as treason and the conspiracy came to be known as \"The Rawalpindi Conspiracy\".\n\nThe UK [[High Commissioner]] in his 3rd report to his Government on the Rawalpindi Conspiracy ending 17 March 1951 on the question of evidence against the conspirators, stated that \"General Akbar Khan was a dangerous man, under the influence of an ambitious wife, and that he had been regarded as very anti-[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] before he went to the [[United Kingdom]] last year to attend the [[Joint Services Staff College (UK)|Joint Services Staff College]]. According to Gracey the Defence Secretary [[Iskander Mirza]] wished Akbar to go on to the [[Imperial Defence College]] to \"complete his education\". The impression was that on his return, he would be less anti-British, and it was felt that he might be sobered up by being given a responsible job under the eye of the Commander-in-Chief at GHQ. General Gracey also told Colonel Franklin that he had informed the Chief of the Imperial Staff of Akbar's tendencies before he had left for the course... According to an informant... the police have been investigating the activities of Akbar and his wife for the last two years, and General Gracey also maintains that these two, and certain of his friends, had been known as the \"[[Young Turk]] Party\". In spite of all this those in charge were, last December, quite happy to appoint the General to a key post in the Pakistan Army\".\n\nAkbar Khan was also one of three generals (the others being Lt. Gen. S.G.M. Pirzada and [[Tikka Khan]]) who met with Pakistani President [[Yahya Khan]] on 20 February 1971 to plan \"[[Operation Searchlight]]\"; he was appointed Chief of National Security in December, 1971 by Pakistan's new Prime Minister, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]].\n\n== Death ==\nMuhammad Akbar Khan died in 1993 at the age of 81 in Karachi.

Most of the characters are [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphizations]] of dogs, hence the title of the cartoon; although there are a few exceptions, most notably Dogtanian's two sidekicks Pip the mouse and Planchet the bear, among several others.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Phil |last1=De Semlyen |first2=Ali |last2=Plumb |first3=Helen |last3=O'hara |first4=James |last4=Dyer |url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/classic-kids-tv-shows-still-rock-world/ |title=Classic Kids' TV Shows That Still Rock Our World, Feature |website=Empireonline.com |date=2015-10-09 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story, set in 17th-century [[France]], follows a young Dogtanian (Darutaniyan (\u30c0\u30eb\u30bf\u30cb\u30e4\u30f3) in the original Japanese version and voiced by Satomi Majima (\u9593\u5d8b \u91cc\u7f8e) and D'Artacan in the Spanish version) who travels from [[B\u00e9arn]] to [[Paris]] in order to become one of King [[Louis XIII of France]]'s [[musketeer]]s. (Note: that they are referred to as musketeers throughout the cartoon and only the title calls them muskehounds.) He quickly befriends three musketeers (Porthos, Athos and Aramis) saving Juliette, a maid-in-waiting for Queen [[Anne of Austria]]. A key difference between the ''Dogtanian'' adaptions and Dumas' novel is that the character traits of [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]] and [[Porthos]] were interchanged, making Athos the extrovert and Porthos the secretive noble of the group.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was produced in 1981 by [[Nippon Animation]]<ref name=\"credits\"/> and [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] in [[Japan]], where it began airing on October 9, 1981.<ref name=\"credits\"/> One year after its premiere, it was exported to [[Spain]] and other countries by [[BRB International]], broadcasting for the first time on [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]] in October 1982,<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\"/> and is currently still being broadcast on different platforms such as [[YouTube]] and [[Netflix]].\n\nThe series was dubbed into English by Intersound USA in 1985.

It picks up ten years after the original story ends, with Dogtanian and Juliette now married and living together on the outskirts of Paris with their two children, Philippe and Fleur. The Muskehounds are reunited by queen Anne when her husband starts acting suspiciously. Cardinal Richelieu is still featured, along with Milady and Widimer still loyal to him.\n\nThe story is loosely based on the novel ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'' also by Alexandre Dumas, itself building on the myth of [[Man in the Iron Mask|The Man in the Iron Mask]].\n\n[[Dave Mallow]] and [[Doug Stone]], who co-adapted the original scripts to English and co-directed, took over as the voices of Dogtanian, and Porthos, respectively.

It includes an English version of the theme song that uses the second series opening lyrics, but the music is similar to the original opening, in this version Dogtanian however is referred to as Dartacan, his Spanish name, and the theme is sung with very high voices, similar to the original opening, and rendered in a style reminiscent of the French dub. An insert song in Spanish which has been replicated twice (Richelieu and Bulibu, probably an error on Amazon's part or that of the record company) and a few instrumental tracks that are heard in the show itself and one unused instrumental track.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dartacan-Soundtrack/dp/B002Z5MGKU |title=Dartacan Soundtrack |publisher=amazon.co.uk |accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Planned revival==\nAccording to their main website, BRB Internacional was planning a new CGI movie to be released in 2016, but it has been delayed for unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brb.es/en/productions/feature-films/dogtanian-and-trhee-muskehounds |title=DOGTANIAN AND THE THREE MUSKEHOUNDS &#124; BRB Internacional |publisher=Brb.es|accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milipictures.com/en/production.html |title=Mili Productions |publisher=[[Mili Pictures Worldwide]]|accessdate=2016-09-27}}</ref> In April 2019, it was announced that Apolo Films has since taken over production of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/apolo-films-kicks-off-dogtanian-production/|title=Apolo Films Kicks Off \u2018Dogtanian\u2019 Production|first=Mercedes|last=Milligan|date=23 April 2019|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2019}}</ref> On February 11, 2020, the first image of the film was revealed.

(Note: that they are referred to as musketeers throughout the cartoon and only the title calls them muskehounds.) He quickly befriends three musketeers (Porthos, Athos and Aramis) saving Juliette, a maid-in-waiting for Queen [[Anne of Austria]]. A key difference between the ''Dogtanian'' adaptions and Dumas' novel is that the character traits of [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]] and [[Porthos]] were interchanged, making Athos the extrovert and Porthos the secretive noble of the group.\n\n==Production==\nThe series was produced in [[1981]] by [[Nippon Animation]]<ref name=\"credits\"/> and [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] in [[Japan]], where it began airing on October 9, 1981<ref name=\"credits\"/>. One year after its premiere, it was exported to [[Spain]] and other countries by [[BRB International]], broadcasting for the first time on [[Televisi\u00f3n_Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]] in October [[1982]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1982\"/>, and is currently still being broadcast on different platforms such as [[YouTube]] and [[Netflix]].\n\nThe series was dubbed into English by Intersound USA in 1985.

The Muskehounds are reunited by queen Anne when her husband starts acting suspiciously.

{"title_page": "Polylogarithm", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|polylogarithmic function}}\n{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Special mathematical function}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''polylogarithm''' (also known as '''Jonqui\u00e8re's function''', for Alfred Jonqui\u00e8re) is a [[special function]] Li<sub>''s''</sub>(''z'') of order ''s'' and argument ''z''. Only for special values of ''s'' does the polylogarithm reduce to an [[elementary function]] such as the [[natural logarithm]] or [[rational function]]s. In [[quantum statistics]], the polylogarithm function appears as the closed form of [[integral]]s of the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution]] and the [[Bose\u2013Einstein distribution]], and is also known as the '''Fermi\u2013Dirac integral''' or the '''Bose\u2013Einstein integral'''. In [[quantum electrodynamics]], polylogarithms of positive [[integer]] order arise in the calculation of processes represented by higher-order [[Feynman diagram]]s.\n\nThe polylogarithm function is equivalent to the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] \u2014 either [[Function (mathematics)|function]] can be expressed in terms of the other \u2014 and both functions are special cases of the [[Lerch transcendent]]. Polylogarithms should not be confused with [[polylogarithmic function]]s nor with the [[offset logarithmic integral]] which has a similar notation.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\" caption=\"Different polylogarithm functions in the complex plane\">\nFile:Complex polylogminus3.jpg|Li<sub>\u22123</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylogminus2.jpg|Li<sub>\u22122</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylogminus1.jpg|Li<sub>\u22121</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylog0.jpg|Li<sub>0</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylog1.jpg|Li<sub>1</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylog2.jpg|Li<sub>2</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylog3.jpg|Li<sub>3</sub>(''z'')\n</gallery>\nThe polylogarithm function is defined by a [[power series]] in ''z'', which is also a [[Dirichlet series]] in ''s'':\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_s(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty {z^k \\over k^s} = z + {z^2 \\over 2^s} + {z^3 \\over 3^s} + \\cdots \\,.\n</math>\n\nThis definition is valid for arbitrary [[Complex numbers|complex]] order ''s'' and for all complex arguments ''z'' with |''z''| < 1; it can be extended to |''z''| \u2265 1 by the process of [[analytic continuation]]. The special case ''s'' = 1 involves the ordinary [[natural logarithm]], Li<sub>1</sub>(''z'') = \u2212ln(1\u2212''z''), while the special cases ''s'' = 2 and ''s'' = 3 are called the [[dilogarithm]] (also referred to as Spence's function) and trilogarithm respectively. The name of the function comes from the fact that it may also be defined as the repeated [[indefinite integral|integral]] of itself:\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_{s+1}(z) = \\int_0^z \\frac {\\operatorname{Li}_s(t)}{t}\\,dt \\,;\n</math>\n\nthus the dilogarithm is an integral of a function involving the logarithm, and so on. For nonpositive integer orders ''s'', the polylogarithm is a [[rational function]].\n\n==Properties==\n\nIn the case where the polylogarithm order <math>s</math>  is an integer, it will be represented by <math>n</math> (or <math>-n</math> when negative). It is often convenient to define <math>\\mu=\\ln(z)</math> where <math>\\ln(z)</math> is the [[principal branch]] of the [[complex logarithm]] <math>\\operatorname{Ln}( z )</math> so that  <math>-\\pi< \\operatorname{Im}(\\mu) \\le \\pi </math>. Also, all exponentiation will be assumed to be single-valued: <math>z^s  = \\exp( s  \\ln( z ))</math>.\n\nDepending on the order <math>s</math>, the polylogarithm may be multi-valued. The ''principal branch'' of <math>\\operatorname{Li}_s( z)</math> is taken to be given for <math>| z | < 1</math> by the above series definition and taken to be continuous except on the positive real axis, where a cut is made from <math>z  = 1</math> to <math>\\infty</math> such that the axis is placed on the lower half plane of <math>z</math>. In terms of <math>\\mu</math>, this amounts to <math>-\\pi < \\operatorname{arg}(-\\mu)\\le \\pi </math>. The discontinuity of the polylogarithm in dependence on <math>\\mu</math> can sometimes be confusing.\n\nFor real argument <math>z</math>, the polylogarithm of real order <math>s</math> is real if <math>z  < 1</math>, and its imaginary part for <math>z \\ge 1</math> is {{harv|Wood|1992|loc=\u00a7 3}}:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Im}\\left( \\operatorname{Li}_s(z) \\right) = -{{\\pi \\mu^{s-1}}\\over{\\Gamma(s)}} \\,.</math>\n\nGoing across the cut, if ''\u03b5'' is an infinitesimally small positive real number, then:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Im}\\left( \\operatorname{Li}_s(z+i\\epsilon) \\right) = {{\\pi \\mu^{s-1}}\\over{\\Gamma(s)}} \\,.</math>\n\nBoth can be concluded from the series expansion ([[#Series representations|see below]]) of Li<sub>''s''</sub>(''e''<sup>''\u00b5''</sup>) about ''\u00b5'' = 0.\n\nThe derivatives of the polylogarithm follow from the defining power series:\n\n:<math>z \\,{\\partial \\operatorname{Li}_s(z) \\over \\partial z} = \\operatorname{Li}_{s-1}(z)</math>\n:<math>{\\partial \\operatorname{Li}_s(e^\\mu) \\over \\partial \\mu} = \\operatorname{Li}_{s-1}(e^\\mu) \\,.</math>\n\nThe square relationship is seen from the series definition, and is related to the [[duplication formula]] (see also {{harvtxt|Clunie|1954}}, {{harvtxt|Schr\u00f6dinger|1952}}):\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_s(-z) + \\operatorname{Li}_s(z) = 2^{1-s} \\,\\operatorname{Li}_s(z^2) \\,.\n</math>\n\n[[Kummer's function]] obeys a very similar duplication formula. This is a special case of the [[multiplication formula]], for any positive integer ''p'':\n\n:<math>\n\\sum_{m=0}^{p-1}\\operatorname{Li}_s(z \\,e^{2\\pi i m/p}) = p^{1-s} \\,\\operatorname{Li}_s(z^p) \\,,\n</math>\n\nwhich can be proved using the series definition of the polylogarithm and the orthogonality of the exponential terms (see e.g. [[discrete Fourier transform]]).\n\nAnother important property, the inversion formula, involves the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] or the [[Bernoulli polynomials]] and is found under [[#Relationship to other functions|relationship to other functions]] below.\n\n==Particular values==\n[[File:Polylogarithm plot negative.svg|right]]\n\nFor particular cases, the polylogarithm may be expressed in terms of other functions ([[#Relationship to other functions|see below]]). Particular values for the polylogarithm may thus also be found as particular values of these other functions.\n\n'''1.''' For integer values of the polylogarithm order, the following explicit expressions are obtained by repeated application of ''z''\u00b7\u2202/\u2202''z'' to Li<sub>1</sub>(''z''):\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_{1}(z)  = -\\ln(1-z)</math>\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_{0}(z)  = {z \\over 1-z}</math>\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_{-1}(z) = {z \\over (1-z)^2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_{-2}(z) = {z \\,(1+z) \\over (1-z)^3}</math>\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_{-3}(z) = {z \\,(1+4z+z^2) \\over (1-z)^4}</math>\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_{-4}(z) = {z \\,(1+z) (1+10z+z^2) \\over (1-z)^5} \\,.</math>\n\nAccordingly the polylogarithm reduces to a ratio of polynomials in ''z'', and is therefore a [[rational function]] of ''z'', for all nonpositive integer orders. The general case may be expressed as a finite sum:\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_{-n}(z) = \\left( z \\,{\\partial \\over \\partial z} \\right)^n {z \\over {1-z}} =\n</math>\n\n:<math>\n= \\sum_{k=0}^n k! \\,S(n + 1, k + 1) \\left({z \\over {1-z}} \\right)^{k+1} \\qquad (n=0,1,2,\\ldots) \\,,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''S''(''n'',''k'') are the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]]. Equivalent formulae applicable to negative integer orders are {{harv|Wood|1992|loc=\u00a7 6}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_{-n}(z) = (-1)^{n+1} \\sum_{k=0}^n k! \\,S(n + 1, k + 1) \\left({{-1} \\over {1-z}} \\right)^{k+1} \\qquad (n=1,2,3,\\ldots) \\,,\n</math>\n\nand:\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_{-n}(z) = {1 \\over (1-z)^{n+1}} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\left\\langle {n \\atop k} \\right\\rangle z^{n-k} \\qquad (n=1,2,3,\\ldots) \\,,\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle \\left\\langle {n \\atop k} \\right\\rangle</math> are the [[Eulerian numbers]]. All roots of Li<sub>\u2212''n''</sub>(''z'') are distinct and real; they include ''z'' = 0, while the remainder is negative and centered about ''z'' = \u22121 on a logarithmic scale. As ''n'' becomes large, the numerical evaluation of these rational expressions increasingly suffers from cancellation {{harv|Wood|1992|loc=\u00a7 6}}; full accuracy can be obtained, however, by computing Li<sub>\u2212''n''</sub>(''z'') via the general relation with the Hurwitz zeta function ([[#Relationship to other functions|see below]]).\n\n'''2.''' Some particular expressions for half-integer values of the argument ''z'' are:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_1(\\tfrac12) = \\ln 2</math>\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_2(\\tfrac12) = \\tfrac1{12} \\pi^2 - \\tfrac12 (\\ln 2)^2</math>\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_3(\\tfrac12) = \\tfrac16 (\\ln 2)^3 - \\tfrac1{12} \\pi^2 \\ln 2 + \\tfrac78 \\,\\zeta(3) \\,,</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b6'' is the [[Riemann zeta function]]. No formulae of this type are known for higher integer orders {{harv|Lewin|1991|p=2}}, but one has for instance {{harv|Borwein|Borwein|Girgensohn|1995}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_4(\\tfrac12) = \\tfrac1{360}\\pi^4 - \\tfrac1{24}(\\ln 2)^4 + \\tfrac1{24} \\pi^2 (\\ln 2)^2 - \\tfrac12 \\,\\zeta(\\bar3, \\bar1) \\,,\n</math>\n\nwhich involves the alternating double sum <math>\\scriptstyle \\zeta(\\bar3, \\bar1) ~= \\,\\sum_{m>n>0} \\,(-1)^{m+n} m^{-3} n^{-1}</math>. In general one has for integer orders ''n'' \u2265 2  {{harv|Broadhurst|1996|p=9}}:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_n(\\tfrac12) = -\\zeta(\\bar1, \\bar1, \\left\\{ 1 \\right\\}^{n-2}) \\,,</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b6''(''s''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''s''<sub>''k''</sub>) is the [[multiple zeta function]]; for example:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Li}_5(\\tfrac12) = -\\zeta(\\bar1, \\bar1, 1,1,1) \\,.</math>\n\n'''3.''' As a straightforward consequence of the series definition, values of the polylogarithm at the ''p''th complex [[roots of unity]] are given by the [[discrete Fourier transform|Fourier sum]]:\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_s(e^{2 \\pi i m/p}) = p^{-s} \\sum_{k=1}^p \ne^{2 \\pi i m k/p} \\,\\zeta(s, \\tfrac {k}{p}) \n\\qquad (m = 1, 2, \\dots, p-1) \\,,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b6'' is the [[Hurwitz zeta function]]. For Re(''s'') > 1, where Li<sub>''s''</sub>(1) is finite, the relation also holds with ''m'' = 0 or ''m'' = ''p''. While this formula is not as simple as that implied by the more general relation with the Hurwitz zeta function listed under [[#Relationship to other functions|relationship to other functions]] below, it has the advantage of applying to non-negative integer values of ''s'' as well. As usual, the relation may be inverted to express \u03b6(''s'', <sup>''m''</sup>\u2044<sub>''p''</sub>) for any ''m'' = 1, ..., ''p'' as a Fourier sum of Li<sub>''s''</sub>(exp(2''\u03c0i'' <sup>''k''</sup>\u2044<sub>''p''</sub>)) over ''k'' = 1, ..., ''p''.\n\n==Relationship to other functions==\n\n* For ''z'' = 1 the polylogarithm reduces to the [[Riemann zeta function]]\n\n::<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_s(1) = \\zeta(s) \\qquad (\\operatorname{Re}(s)>1) \\,.\n</math>\n\n* The polylogarithm is related to [[Dirichlet eta function]] and the [[Dirichlet beta function]]:\n\n::<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_s(-1) = -\\eta(s) \\,,\n</math>\n\n:where ''\u03b7''(''s'') is the Dirichlet eta function.

Introducing an explicit expression for the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind]] into the finite sum for the polylogarithm of nonpositive integer order ([[#Particular values|see above]]) one may write:\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_{-n}(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\left( {-z \\over 1-z} \\right)^{k+1} ~\\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^{j+1} {k \\choose j} (j+1)^n \\qquad (n=0,1,2,\\ldots) \\,.\n</math>\n\nThe infinite series obtained by simply extending the outer summation to \u221e {{harv|Guillera|Sondow|2008|loc=Theorem 2.1}}:\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_s(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( {-z \\over 1-z} \\right)^{k+1} ~\\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^{j+1} {k \\choose j} (j+1)^{-s} \\,,\n</math>\n\nturns out to converge to the polylogarithm for all complex ''s'' and for complex ''z'' with Re(''z'') < <sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub>, as can be verified for |<sup>\u2212''z''</sup>\u2044<sub>(1\u2212''z'')</sub>| < <sup>1</sup>\u2044<sub>2</sub> by reversing the order of summation and using:\n\n:<math>\n\\sum_{k=j}^\\infty {k \\choose j} \\left( {-z \\over 1-z} \\right)^{k+1} = \\left[ \\left( {-z \\over 1-z} \\right)^{-1} -1 \\right]^{-j-1} = (-z)^{j+1} \\,.\n</math>\n\nThe inner coefficients of these series can be expressed by [[Stirling numbers of the first kind|Stirling-number-related]] formulas involving the generalized [[harmonic numbers]].

Only for special values of ''s'' does the polylogarithm reduce to an [[elementary function]] such as the [[natural logarithm]] or [[rational function]]s. In [[quantum statistics]], the polylogarithm function appears as the closed form of integrals of the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution]] and the [[Bose\u2013Einstein distribution]], and is also known as the '''Fermi\u2013Dirac integral''' or the '''Bose\u2013Einstein integral'''. In [[quantum electrodynamics]], polylogarithms of positive integer order arise in the calculation of processes represented by higher-order [[Feynman diagram]]s.\n\nThe polylogarithm function is equivalent to the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] \u2014 either function can be expressed in terms of the other \u2014 and both functions are special cases of the [[Lerch transcendent]]. Polylogarithms should not be confused with [[polylogarithmic function]]s nor with the [[offset logarithmic integral]] which has a similar notation.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\" caption=\"Different polylogarithm functions in the complex plane\">\nFile:Complex polylogminus3.jpg|Li<sub>\u22123</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylogminus2.jpg|Li<sub>\u22122</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylogminus1.jpg|Li<sub>\u22121</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylog0.jpg|Li<sub>0</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylog1.jpg|Li<sub>1</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylog2.jpg|Li<sub>2</sub>(''z'')\nFile:Complex polylog3.jpg|Li<sub>3</sub>(''z'')\n</gallery>\nThe polylogarithm function is defined by a [[power series]] in ''z'', which is also a [[Dirichlet series]] in ''s'':\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_s(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty {z^k \\over k^s} = z + {z^2 \\over 2^s} + {z^3 \\over 3^s} + \\cdots \\,.\n</math>\n\nThis definition is valid for arbitrary [[complex numbers|complex]] order ''s'' and for all complex arguments ''z'' with |''z''| < 1; it can be extended to |''z''| \u2265 1 by the process of [[analytic continuation]]. The special case ''s'' = 1 involves the ordinary [[natural logarithm]], Li<sub>1</sub>(''z'') = \u2212ln(1\u2212''z''), while the special cases ''s'' = 2 and ''s'' = 3 are called the [[dilogarithm]] (also referred to as Spence's function) and trilogarithm respectively. The name of the function comes from the fact that it may also be defined as the repeated [[indefinite integral|integral]] of itself:\n\n:<math>\n\\operatorname{Li}_{s+1}(z) = \\int_0^z \\frac {\\operatorname{Li}_s(t)}{t}\\,dt \\,;\n</math>\n\nthus the dilogarithm is an integral of a function involving the logarithm, and so on. For nonpositive [[integer]] orders ''s'', the polylogarithm is a [[rational function]].\n\n==Properties==\n\nIn the case where the polylogarithm order <math>s</math>  is an integer, it will be represented by <math>n</math> (or <math>-n</math> when negative). It is often convenient to define <math>\\mu=\\ln(z)</math> where <math>\\ln(z)</math> is the [[principal branch]] of the [[complex logarithm]] <math>\\operatorname{Ln}( z )</math> so that  <math>-\\pi< \\operatorname{Im}(\\mu) \\le \\pi </math>. Also, all exponentiation will be assumed to be single-valued: <math>z^s  = \\exp( s  \\ln( z ))</math>.\n\nDepending on the order <math>s</math>, the polylogarithm may be multi-valued. The ''principal branch'' of <math>\\operatorname{Li}_s( z)</math> is taken to be given for <math>| z | < 1</math> by the above series definition and taken to be continuous except on the positive real axis, where a cut is made from <math>z  = 1</math> to <math>\\infty</math> such that the axis is placed on the lower half plane of <math>z</math>.

Denoting these two by ''m''<sub>0</sub> and ''m''<sub>1</sub>, the monodromy group has the [[group presentation]]\n:<math>\n\\langle m_0, m_1 \\,\\vert\\, w = m_0 m_1 m^{-1}_0 m^{-1}_1, \\,w m_1 = m_1 w \\rangle.\n</math>\n\nFor the special case of the dilogarithm, one also has that ''wm''<sub>0</sub> = ''m''<sub>0</sub>''w'', and the monodromy group becomes the [[Heisenberg group]] (identifying ''m''<sub>0</sub>, ''m''<sub>1</sub> and ''w'' with ''x'', ''y'', ''z'') {{harv|Vepstas|2008}}.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | last= Abel | first= N.H. | author-link= Niels Henrik Abel | contribution= Note sur la fonction <math>\\scriptstyle \\psi x \\,= \\,x+ \\frac{x^2}{2^2}+ \\frac{x^3}{3^2}+ \\cdots+ \\frac{x^n}{n^2}+ \\cdots</math> | language= French | contribution-url= http://www.abelprisen.no/nedlastning/verker/oeuvres_1881_del2/oeuvres_completes_de_abel_nouv_ed_2_kap14_opt.pdf | contribution-format= PDF | editor1-last= Sylow | editor1-first= L. | editor2-last= Lie | editor2-first= S. | title= \u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de Niels Henrik Abel \u2212 Nouvelle \u00e9dition, Tome II | location= Christiania [Oslo] | publisher= Gr\u00f8ndahl & S\u00f8n | origyear= 1826 | year= 1881 | pages= 189\u2013193 | ref= harv}} (this 1826 manuscript was only published posthumously.)\n* {{cite book | last1= Abramowitz | first1= M. | last2= Stegun | first2= I.A. | title= Handbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical Tables | location= New York | publisher= Dover Publications | year= 1972 | isbn= 978-0-486-61272-0 | ref= harv| title-link= Abramowitz and Stegun }}\n* {{dlmf | id= 25.12 | first= T.M. | last= Apostol | ref= harv}}\n* {{cite journal | last1= Bailey | first1= D.H. | author1-link= David H.
