The initial twelve-member cast included [[Matthew Morrison]] as club director and Spanish teacher [[Will Schuester]], [[Jane Lynch]] as cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]], [[Jayma Mays]] as guidance counselor [[Emma Pillsbury]], [[Jessalyn Gilsig]] as Will's wife [[Terri Schuester|Terri]], and [[Dianna Agron]], [[Chris Colfer]], [[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]], [[Lea Michele]], [[Cory Monteith]], [[Amber Riley]], [[Mark Salling]], and [[Jenna Ushkowitz]] as eight club members.

The three wrote all of the show's episodes for the first two seasons, and Murphy and Falchuk initially served as the show's main directors. The [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]] was broadcast on May 19, 2009, and the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] aired from September 9, 2009, to June 8, 2010.

The music of ''Glee'' has been a commercial success, with over thirty-six million digital single sales and eleven million album sales worldwide through October 2011. The series' merchandise also includes DVD and Blu-ray releases, an [[iPad]] application, and karaoke games for the [[Wii]]. There were live concert tours by the show's cast after the first and second seasons completed shooting; a [[concert film]] based on the 2011 tour, ''[[Glee: The 3D Concert Movie]]'', was produced by Murphy and Fox and directed by [[Kevin Tancharoen]].\n\nDuring its first season, ''Glee'' received generally favorable reviews from critics, with [[Metacritic]]'s weighted average of 77 out of 100 based on eighteen critical reviews.

A major focus of the series is the students in the glee club: their relationships as couples, their love of singing and desire for popularity coming into conflict due to their membership in the low-status club, and the many vicissitudes of life in high school and as a teenager.\n\n<!-- it is important to mention all the social issues in each season's \"short summary\", as every season contains additional issues-->\n[[Glee (season 1)|Season 1]] features the fictional high school show choir New Directions competing for the first time on the show choir circuit, winning at the Sectionals competition (episode 13) but losing at Regionals (season finale/episode 22), while its members and faculty deal with [[sex]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[homosexuality]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[disabilities]], [[acceptance]] and other social issues. The central characters are [[glee club]] director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), Will's wife [[Terri Schuester|Terri]] ([[Jessalyn Gilsig]]), guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), and glee club members [[Rachel Berry|Rachel]] ([[Lea Michele]]), [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] ([[Cory Monteith]]), [[Artie Abrams|Artie]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]), [[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), [[Mercedes Jones|Mercedes]] ([[Amber Riley]]), [[Tina Cohen-Chang|Tina]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]), [[Puck (Glee)|Puck]] ([[Mark Salling]]), and [[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] ([[Dianna Agron]]).\n\n[[Glee (season 2)|Season 2]] follows the club through wins at the Sectionals (episode 9) and Regionals (episode 16) competitions before losing at the Nationals competition in New York City (season finale/episode 22), while its members and faculty deal with relationships, [[religion]], [[homophobia]], [[bullying]], [[rumors]], teenage drinking, death and other social issues. The season's stories revolve around the same Glee club members as first season, with [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) and [[Brittany Pierce]] ([[Heather Morris]]) added to the main cast, along with Kurt's father [[Burt Hummel|Burt]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]).\n\n[[Glee (season 3)|Season 3]] follows the club through wins at Sectionals (episode 8) and Regionals competitions (episode 14), before they win the Nationals competition (episode 21) in [[Chicago]]. The characters deal with [[gender identity]], [[adoption]], [[domestic abuse]], [[teenage suicide]], bullying, disabilities, [[texting while driving]], [[college]] and other social issues. Glee club members added to the main cast were [[Mike Chang]] ([[Harry Shum Jr.]]) and transfer student [[Blaine Anderson]] ([[Darren Criss]]), while Jessalyn Gilsig as Terri Schuester was written out of the series and Mike O'Malley as Burt returned to recurring status. The McKinley High class of 2012 graduates at the end of the season.\n\n[[Glee (season 4)|Season 4]] continues in Lima with a new generation of students but also follows some of the McKinley graduates from the third season, notably to the fictional New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts (NYADA) in New York City. The season follows the club through a loss at the Sectionals competition (episode 9) and subsequent reinstatement when the winning Dalton Academy Warblers were found to have used banned substances (human growth hormone) (episode 12) before winning at the Regionals competition (episode 22), which meant they would be attending their third consecutive National show choir competition. In the meantime, Rachel Berry and Kurt Hummel navigate NYADA and their lives as aspiring performers, plus their relationships with Finn and Blaine. Issues during the season include sex, [[bulimia]], gender identity, [[child molestation]], [[dyslexia]], [[school violence]], and [[false pregnancy|pregnancy scares]]. Former main cast members Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) were credited as guest stars, while previously recurring glee club member [[Sam Evans]] ([[Chord Overstreet]]) was promoted to the main cast.\n\n[[Glee (season 5)|Season 5]], unlike previous seasons, continues the school year begun in the previous season. The season shows the reigning champion glee club finishing second at Nationals competition ([[City of Angels (Glee)|episode 11]]) before the club is permanently disbanded by Sue Sylvester, now school principal, for budgetary reasons ([[100 (Glee)|episode 12]]), leaving the focus on graduation. The show then jumps several months forward in time and deals entirely with the alumni's lives in [[New York City]] for the remainder of the season, including Rachel's successful Broadway debut. Throughout this season, the club and its alumni deal with relationships; death and [[mourning]]; [[body image]], [[gay bashing]], intimacy, and other social issues. Several main cast members dropped to recurring guest stars as of this season: Amber Riley as Mercedes, Mark Salling as Puck, Harry Shum Jr. as Mike and Heather Morris as Brittany. New main cast members included glee club members introduced in the fourth season: [[Melissa Benoist]] as [[Marley Rose]], [[Alex Newell]] as [[Wade \"Unique\" Adams|Unique Adams]], [[Blake Jenner]] as [[Ryder Lynn]], [[Jacob Artist]] as [[Jake Puckerman]], and [[Becca Tobin]] as [[Kitty Wilde]]. Actor Cory Monteith died during summer before the fifth season was shot; his character, Finn Hudson, died in the season's third episode, [[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]].\n\n[[Glee (season 6)|Season 6]] focuses on Rachel Berry, who returns to McKinley after her television pilot fails. She decides to reconstitute the glee club with all-new McKinley students and with Kurt's help. Will Schuester is now coaching rival club Vocal Adrenaline, while Blaine is coaching the Dalton Academy Warblers. All of the new main cast members from the fifth season have returned to guest star status in this final season when they appear; Amber Riley as Mercedes rejoins the main cast, and [[Dot-Marie Jones]] as [[Beiste (Glee)|Coach Beiste]] joins the main cast for the first time. The cast members deal with [[gay marriage]], gender identity, [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] and other social issues. The newly reconstituted club wins the Nationals competition, Sue is fired as principal and Will is hired to be the principal of a McKinley High repurposed as a [[magnet school|magnet arts school]], with Sam as the new director of New Directions. The finale jumps five years into the future: Rachel has married [[Jesse St. James]] ([[Jonathan Groff]]), wins a Tony Award, and is a surrogate mother for Kurt and Blaine (who are themselves Broadway stars). Artie has directed Tina in a film, Mercedes is a highly successful recording artist, and Sue has just been re-elected Vice President of the United States. The McKinley auditorium is renamed after Finn.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Glee characters}}\nIn casting ''Glee'', Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found [[Matthew Morrison]], who had previously starred on stage in ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'' and ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]''; [[Lea Michele]], who starred in ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]''; and [[Jenna Ushkowitz]], who had been in the Broadway revival of ''[[The King and I]]''.<ref name=\"rewrite\" />\n\n[[File:Matthew Morrison Peabody 2010 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Matthew Morrison]] was cast after Murphy spent three months observing actors on Broadway.]]\n\nActors without any theatrical experience needed to demonstrate, during their auditions, that they could also sing and dance. [[Chris Colfer]] had no previous professional experience, but Murphy wrote in the character [[Kurt Hummel]] for him.<ref name=\"rewrite\"/> [[Jayma Mays]] auditioned with the song \"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\" from ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', while [[Cory Monteith]] initially submitted a tape of himself acting only, and was requested to submit a second, musical tape, in which he sang \"a cheesy, '80s music-video-style version\" of [[REO Speedwagon]]'s \"[[Can't Fight This Feeling]]\".<ref name=\"rewrite\" /> [[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]] came from a boy-band background, having previously been part of the group [[NLT (band)|Not Like Them]]. He explained that the diversity of the cast's backgrounds reflects the range of different musical styles within the show itself: \"It's a mix of everything: classic rock, current stuff, R&B. Even the musical theatre stuff is switched up. You won't always recognize it.\"<ref name=\"rewrite\" /> [[Jane Lynch]] was originally supposed to have a recurring role as [[Sue Sylvester]],<ref name=\"Trio promoted to series regulars\"/> but was made a series regular when a [[Damon Wayans]] pilot she was working on for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] fell through.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> The cast is contracted for a potential three ''Glee'' films,<ref name=\"Glee The Movie Coming Soon\"/> with their contract stating that \"[The actor] hereby grants Fox three exclusive, irrevocable options to engage [the actor] in up to, respectively, three feature-length motion pictures.\"<ref name=\"'Glee' movies?

Rachel has an on-and-off relationship with [[Finn Hudson]] starting in season one; they become engaged in season three.<ref name=\"NYPost\" /> Monteith played Finn, star quarterback of the school's football team who risks alienation by his friends after joining the glee club.<ref name=\"NYPost\" /> Also in the club are [[Amber Riley]] as [[Mercedes Jones]], a fashion-conscious diva who initially resents having to sing back-up; Colfer as [[Kurt Hummel]], a fashionable gay male [[countertenor]];<ref name=\"kurt-bio\"/> McHale as [[Artie Abrams]], a guitar player and paraplegic; and Ushkowitz as [[Tina Cohen-Chang]], an Asian American student with a fake [[speech impediment]].

[[Mark Salling]] plays [[Puck (Glee)|Noah \"Puck\" Puckerman]], a good friend of Finn's on the football team who at first disapproves of Finn joining the glee club, but later joins it himself. [[Naya Rivera]] and [[Heather Morris]], who portray Cheerios and glee club vocalists [[Santana Lopez]] and [[Brittany Pierce]] respectively, were originally recurring actors, but were promoted to series regulars in the second season.<ref name=\"wightman\"/> [[Mike O'Malley]], who plays Kurt's father [[Burt Hummel]], also became a series regular on season two.<ref name=\"ghosh\"/> Gilsig and O'Malley no longer appeared on the list of starring actors at the beginning of the third season, though O'Malley was a recurring guest star in at least six episodes during the season.<ref name=\"stack\"/> Two actors were promoted to series regulars as of the third season: [[Harry Shum Jr.]] as football player and glee club member [[Mike Chang]] and [[Darren Criss]] as former Dalton Academy Warbler and new club member [[Blaine Anderson]], both of whom started as recurring actors, Shum in the first season and Criss in the second.<ref name=\"ausiello\"/> For the fourth season, [[Chord Overstreet]], who started as a recurring actor in the second season, playing glee club member [[Sam Evans]], was promoted to the main cast,<ref name=\"HR723\"/> while Agron and Mays were credited as recurring guest stars.\n\nMany of the original characters graduated from McKinley High at the end of the third season. Murphy said, \"We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience.\"<ref name=\"fowler\"/> Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series,<ref name=\"'Glee' kids to graduate next year\"/> though according to Falchuk, some students\u2014Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular\u2014would likely remain on the show after they graduate.<ref name=\"MicheleMonteithColferStaying\"/> In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, \"A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show \u2014 they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [tweet,] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them.\" He then continued: \"They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes.\"<ref name=\"Murphy Talks the Fate of GLEE's Seniors\"/>\n\nOn June 28, 2013, the media reported that Morris, Riley, Salling, and Shum would be changing from starring status to guest starring roles for the fifth season, and on the following day that [[Jacob Artist]], [[Melissa Benoist]], [[Blake Jenner]], [[Alex Newell]] and [[Becca Tobin]], who play [[Jake Puckerman]], [[Marley Rose]], [[Ryder Lynn]], [[Wade \"Unique\" Adams]] and [[Kitty Wilde]], respectively, were all being promoted to the show's main cast.<ref name=\"UPDATED ''Glee'' Exclusive: 4 Original Cast Members Not Returning as Series Regulars for Season 5; Plus \u2014 Who's Getting Promoted?\"/>\n\nOn July 13, 2013, Cory Monteith was found dead in his room at the [[Fairmont Pacific Rim]] hotel in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], after failing to check out.

An autopsy completed on July 15 indicated that he died of [[Alcohol intoxication|alcohol]] and [[Opioid overdose|heroin overdose]].<ref name=\"vpd\"/><ref name=\"Cory Monteith dies in Vancouver at 31\"/> On July 20, 2013, Ryan Murphy said in various media outlets that Cory would have a tribute in season five's third episode, which would deal with the death of Monteith's character, Finn.<ref name=\"dos\"/>\n\nOn July 30, 2013, Mays confirmed that she would depart the show after the fifth season to work on other projects, but stated that she would be open to returning as a guest star in the future.<ref name=\"Jayma Mays Leaving ''Glee'' \u2014 Actress Confirms Departure From FOX Series\"/>\n\nOn July 7, 2014, it was confirmed that Rivera would be placed on a recurring status for the sixth and final season, by her request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/07/07/naya-rivera-glee-season-6-staying-or-leaving/|title=Naya Rivera: 'Glee' Season 6 \u2014 Is She Staying or Leaving? - TVLine|date=July 7, 2014|work=TVLine|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> On August 28, a website revealed that Amber Riley would once again become a regular along with [[Dot-Marie Jones]] while Jayma Mays would be on a recurring status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/glees-final-season-details-revealed-728512?|title='Glee's' Final Season Details Revealed|date=August 27, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\n[[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] conceived ''Glee'' based on his own experience as a member of the [[Prospect High School (Illinois)|Prospect High School]] show choir in [[Mount Prospect, Illinois]].<ref name=\"dailyherald1\"/> He initially envisioned ''Glee'' as a film, rather than a television series, and wrote the first draft in August 2005 with the aid of ''Screenwriting [[for Dummies]]''.<ref name=\"dailyherald1\" /> He completed the script in 2005, but could not generate interest in the project for several years.<ref name=\"DH\"/> Mike Novick, a television producer and a friend of Brennan's from Los Angeles, was a member of the same gym as Ryan Murphy, and gave him a copy of Brennan's script.<ref name=\"LAT\"/> Murphy had been in a show choir in college and felt he could relate to the script. Murphy and his ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' colleague Brad Falchuk suggested that ''Glee'' be produced as a television show. The script was entirely rewritten,<ref name=\"DH\" /> and was picked up by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] within fifteen hours of being received. Murphy attributed that, in part, to the network's success with ''[[American Idol]]''. \"It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein\", he said.<ref name=\"Variety\" /> Murphy and Falchuk became the show's executive producers and showrunners, Brennan became a co-executive producer and Novick a producer.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> Brennan, Falchuk and Murphy started by writing \"all the episodes\".<ref name=\"We're All Gleeks&nbsp;\u2014 10 Questions for Glee Co-Creator Brad Falchuk\"/>\n\n''Glee'' is set at the fictional William McKinley High School in [[Lima, Ohio]].<ref name=\"'Glee' series set in a Lima high school has Toledo connection too\"/> Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself grew up in [[Indiana]], and recalled childhood visits to Ohio to the [[Kings Island]] theme park.<ref name=\"The Heldenfiles&nbsp;\u2014 Glee-ful Ohio\"/> Although set in Lima, the show is filmed at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] and [[Helen Bernstein High School]] in Hollywood.<ref name=\"Meet Cory Monteith & Naya Rivera of Glee\"/>\n\nMurphy has said that he has never seen a ''[[High School Musical (film series)|High School Musical]]'' film, to which ''Glee'' has been compared, and that his interest lay in creating a \"postmodern musical\", rather than \"doing a show where people burst into song\", drawing more heavily on the format of ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]''.<ref name=\"HSM\" /> Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism. \"There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why ''Idol'' worked. It's pure escapism,\" he said.<ref name=\"Variety\" /> Murphy intended to make a family show to appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads,<ref name=\"Variety\" /> and as of October 2009 he had already mapped out plans for the series covering three years of broadcast.<ref name=\"BB\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe three creators\u2014Murphy, Falchuk, and Brennan\u2014plan the stories together. For the first two seasons, they were the only writers, and after taking joint credit for the pilot episode and the episode that opened the fall 2009 season, they began rotating taking a single auctorial credit, based in large part on the person \"who\u2019s taken the lead in story breaking or who wrote a draft\". Brennan noted that the writing process is \"fast and loose, with the emphasis on fast\", and quotes Murphy as having said, in terms of their roles in episode creation, \"I'm sort of the brain. Brad's sort of the heart. Ian's sort of the funny bone\", which Brennan says \"is true in a lot of ways\". Some of the characters are written more by one writer than by the others. Brennan writes most of Sue's material, and Falchuk frequently writes the scenes between Kurt and Burt Hummel, though Murphy contributes a great deal to Kurt.<ref name=\"AVClub\"/>\n\nStarting with season three, a writing staff of six was hired: [[Ali Adler]], [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]], [[Marti Noxon]], [[Michael Hitchcock]], Matt Hodgson and Ross Maxwell.<ref name=\"andreeva\"/> The season's fourth episode, \"[[Pot o' Gold (Glee)|Pot o' Gold]]\", was written by Adler, the first not credited to the show's three creators.<ref name=\"HR\"/><ref name=\"Pot\"/>\n\nAdler and Noxon did not return for the show's fourth season and instead ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' writers [[Russel Friend]] and [[Garrett Lerner]], and Stacy Traub were hired.\n\n===Music and choreography===\n{{Main|List of songs in Glee|Glee albums discography|Glee songs discography}}\nThe series features numerous song [[cover version|covers]] sung onscreen by the characters.<ref name=\"DN\"/> Ryan Murphy was responsible for selecting all of the songs used, and has said that he strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: \"I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important\u2014the balancing of that.\"<ref name=\"LAT\" /> According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, \"Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along.\"<ref name=\"From 'Cabaret' to Kanye, Songs of 'Glee' Are a Hit\"/> In a 2010 interview with [[Allison Kugel]], [[Chris Colfer]] noted that \"there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (''Glee'' creator) and told him a couple of things that have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don\u2019t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us.\"<ref name=\"colferkugeltwo\"/> For the second season, a shift toward using more [[Top 40]] songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the [[Nielsen ratings#Demographics|18\u201349 demographic]].<ref name=\"lifeline\"/>\n\nMurphy was surprised at the ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained: \"I think the key to it is they loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids, for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience.\"<ref name=\"DN\" /> A minority of those approached refused to allow their music to be used, including [[Bryan Adams]], [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Coldplay]]; however, in June 2010, Coldplay reversed their decision, allowing ''Glee'' the rights to their catalog.<ref name=\"Coldplay bows to irresistible force of Glee\"/> Adams posted on his Twitter account that the producers of ''Glee'' had never requested permission from him and urged them to \"pick up the phone\".<ref name=\"kingstonherald\"/> Composer and musician [[Billy Joel]] offered many of his songs for use on the show,<ref name=\"afternoon\"/> and other artists have offered use of their songs for free.<ref name=\"'Glee' gets songs for free\"/> A series of ''Glee'' soundtrack albums have been released through [[Columbia Records]]. Songs featured on the show are available for [[music download|digital download]] through iTunes up to two weeks before new episodes air, and through other digital outlets and mobile carriers a week later.<ref name=\"BB\" /> ''Glee'' music producers [[Adam Anders]] and [[Peer Astrom]] have begun to add original music to the show, including two original songs, \"[[Loser Like Me]]\" and \"[[Get It Right (Glee Cast song)|Get It Right]]\", on the March 15, 2011 episode.<ref name=\"'Glee': Music producer Adam Anders spills details on the show's upcoming original music \u2013 EXCLUSIVE\"/>\n\n''Glee'' is choreographed by [[Zach Woodlee]] and features four to eight production numbers per episode.<ref name=\"USAToday\" /> Once Murphy selects a song, rights are cleared with its publishers by music supervisor P. J. Bloom, and music producers Adam Anders and Peer Astrom rearrange it for the ''Glee'' cast.<ref name=\"BB\" /> Numbers are pre-recorded by the cast, while Woodlee constructs the accompanying dance moves, which are then taught to the cast and filmed.<ref name=\"LAT\" /> Studio recordings of tracks are then made. The process begins six to eight weeks before each episode is filmed, and can end as late as the day before filming begins.<ref name=\"BB\" /> Each episode costs at least $3&nbsp;million to produce,<ref name=\"LAT\" /> and can take up to ten days to film as a result of the elaborate choreography.<ref name=\"HSM\"/> In late 2010, Bloom reported the process has been even shorter; \"as quick as a few weeks\".<ref name=\"lifeline\" /> For the second season, the creators were offered listens of upcoming songs in advance by publishers and record labels, with production occurring even before song rights are cleared.<ref name=\"lifeline\" />\n\n===Promotion===\n{{further|Glee Live!

And it isn't good for families.\"<ref name=\"parentstv\"/>\n\nThe promotional posters for the first season have the show's stars using their right hands to make an \"L\" to fill in the ''L'' of the word ''Glee''. The second season's promotional posters have the stars throwing slushies at the camera in pairs. The third season's promotional posters have the stars getting dodgeballs thrown at them by Sue Sylvester. While the cast concert tour, [[Glee Live!

It centers on the fictional William McKinley High School [[glee club]], the New Directions, which competes on the show choir competition circuit while its disparate members deal with [[social issue]]s, especially regarding [[human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Race (human classification)|race]], relationships, and teamwork. The initial twelve-member cast included [[Matthew Morrison]] as club director and Spanish teacher [[Will Schuester]], [[Jane Lynch]] as cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]], [[Jayma Mays]] as guidance counselor [[Emma Pillsbury]], [[Jessalyn Gilsig]] as Will's wife [[Terri Schuester|Terri]], and [[Dianna Agron]], [[Chris Colfer]], [[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]], [[Lea Michele]], [[Cory Monteith]], [[Amber Riley]], [[Mark Salling]], and [[Jenna Ushkowitz]] as eight club members.

The three wrote all of the show's episodes for the first two seasons, and Murphy and Falchuk initially served as the show's main directors. The [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]] was broadcast on May 19, 2009, and the [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] aired from September 9, 2009, to June 8, 2010. Subsequent seasons aired in September through May.

Songs covered in the show were released through the [[iTunes Store]] during the week of broadcast, and a series of ''Glee'' albums have been released by [[Columbia Records]]. The music of ''Glee'' has been a commercial success, with over thirty-six million digital single sales and eleven million album sales worldwide through October 2011. The series' merchandise also includes DVD and Blu-ray releases, an [[iPad]] application, and karaoke games for the [[Wii]]. There were live concert tours by the show's cast after the first and second seasons completed shooting; a [[concert film]] based on the 2011 tour, ''[[Glee: The 3D Concert Movie]]'', was produced by Murphy and Fox and directed by [[Kevin Tancharoen]].\n\nDuring its first season, ''Glee'' received generally favorable reviews from critics, with [[Metacritic]]'s weighted average of 77 out of 100 based on eighteen critical reviews. The season was nominated for 19 [[Emmy Award]]s, four [[Golden Globe Awards]], six [[Satellite Awards]] and 57 other awards, with wins including the 2010 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], and Emmy awards for Jane Lynch, guest-star [[Neil Patrick Harris]] and Murphy's direction of the [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]]. In 2011, the show once again won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series, and Jane Lynch and Chris Colfer won Golden Globes for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actress]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor]] respectively, and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] won the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

With a rag-tag group of misfit teenagers, Will attempts to restore the glee club to its former glory while tending to his developing feelings for his co-worker, guidance counselor [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]), as well as defending the glee club's existence from the conniving cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]). A major focus of the series is the students in the glee club: their relationships as couples, their love of singing and desire for popularity coming into conflict due to their membership in the low-status club, and the many vicissitudes of life in high school and as a teenager.\n\n<!-- it is important to mention all the social issues in each season's \"short summary\", as every season contains additional issues-->\n[[Glee (season 1)|Season 1]] features the fictional high school show choir New Directions competing for the first time on the show choir circuit, winning at the Sectionals competition (episode 13) but losing at Regionals (season finale/episode 22), while its members and faculty deal with [[sex]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[homosexuality]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[disabilities]], [[acceptance]] and other social issues. The central characters are [[glee club]] director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), Will's wife [[Terri Schuester|Terri]] ([[Jessalyn Gilsig]]), guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), and glee club members [[Rachel Berry|Rachel]] ([[Lea Michele]]), [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] ([[Cory Monteith]]), [[Artie Abrams|Artie]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]), [[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), [[Mercedes Jones|Mercedes]] ([[Amber Riley]]), [[Tina Cohen-Chang|Tina]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]), [[Puck (Glee)|Puck]] ([[Mark Salling]]), and [[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] ([[Dianna Agron]]).\n\n[[Glee (season 2)|Season 2]] follows the club through wins at the Sectionals (episode 9) and Regionals (episode 16) competitions before losing at the Nationals competition in New York City (season finale/episode 22), while its members and faculty deal with relationships, [[religion]], [[homophobia]], [[bullying]], [[rumors]], teenage drinking, death and other social issues. The season's stories revolve around the same Glee club members as first season, with [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) and [[Brittany Pierce]] ([[Heather Morris]]) added to the main cast, along with Kurt's father [[Burt Hummel|Burt]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]).\n\n[[Glee (season 3)|Season 3]] follows the club through wins at Sectionals (episode 8) and Regionals competitions (episode 14), before they win the Nationals competition (episode 21) in [[Chicago]]. The characters deal with [[gender identity]], [[adoption]], [[domestic abuse]], [[teenage suicide]], bullying, disabilities, [[texting while driving]], [[college]] and other social issues. Glee club members added to the main cast were [[Mike Chang]] ([[Harry Shum Jr.]]) and transfer student [[Blaine Anderson]] ([[Darren Criss]]), while Jessalyn Gilsig as Terri Schuester was written out of the series and Mike O'Malley as Burt returned to recurring status. The McKinley High class of 2012 graduates at the end of the season.\n\n[[Glee (season 4)|Season 4]] continues in Lima with a new generation of students but also follows some of the McKinley graduates from the third season, notably to the fictional New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts (NYADA) in New York City. The season follows the club through a loss at the Sectionals competition (episode 9) and subsequent reinstatement when the winning Dalton Academy Warblers were found to have used banned substances (human growth hormone) (episode 12) before winning at the Regionals competition (episode 22), which meant they would be attending their third consecutive National show choir competition. In the meantime, Rachel Berry and Kurt Hummel navigate NYADA and their lives as aspiring performers, plus their relationships with Finn and Blaine. Issues during the season include sex, [[bulimia]], gender identity, [[child molestation]], [[dyslexia]], [[school violence]], and [[false pregnancy|pregnancy scares]]. Former main cast members Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) were credited as guest stars, while previously recurring glee club member [[Sam Evans]] ([[Chord Overstreet]]) was promoted to the main cast.\n\n[[Glee (season 5)|Season 5]], unlike previous seasons, continues the school year begun in the previous season. The season shows the reigning champion glee club finishing second at Nationals competition ([[City of Angels (Glee)|episode 11]]) before the club is permanently disbanded by Sue Sylvester, now school principal, for budgetary reasons ([[100 (Glee)|episode 12]]), leaving the focus on graduation. The show then jumps several months forward in time and deals entirely with the alumni's lives in [[New York City]] for the remainder of the season, including Rachel's successful Broadway debut. Throughout this season, the club and its alumni deal with relationships; death and [[mourning]]; [[body image]], [[gay bashing]], intimacy, and other social issues. Several main cast members dropped to recurring guest stars as of this season: Amber Riley as Mercedes, Mark Salling as Puck, Harry Shum Jr. as Mike and Heather Morris as Brittany. New main cast members included glee club members introduced in the fourth season: [[Melissa Benoist]] as [[Marley Rose]], [[Alex Newell]] as [[Wade \"Unique\" Adams|Unique Adams]], [[Blake Jenner]] as [[Ryder Lynn]], [[Jacob Artist]] as [[Jake Puckerman]], and [[Becca Tobin]] as [[Kitty Wilde]]. Actor Cory Monteith died during summer before the fifth season was shot; his character, Finn Hudson, died in the season's third episode, [[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]].\n\n[[Glee (season 6)|Season 6]] focuses on Rachel Berry, who returns to McKinley after her television pilot fails. She decides to reconstitute the glee club with all-new McKinley students and with Kurt's help. Will Schuester is now coaching rival club Vocal Adrenaline, while Blaine is coaching the Dalton Academy Warblers. All of the new main cast members from the fifth season have returned to guest star status in this final season when they appear; Amber Riley as Mercedes rejoins the main cast, and [[Dot-Marie Jones]] as [[Beiste (Glee)|Coach Beiste]] joins the main cast for the first time. The cast members deal with [[gay marriage]], gender identity, [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] and other social issues. The newly reconstituted club wins the Nationals competition, Sue is fired as principal and Will is hired to be the principal of a McKinley High repurposed as a [[magnet school|magnet arts school]], with Sam as the new director of New Directions. The finale jumps five years into the future: Rachel has married [[Jesse St. James]] ([[Jonathan Groff]]), wins a Tony Award, and is a surrogate mother for Kurt and Blaine (who are themselves Broadway stars). Artie has directed Tina in a film, Mercedes is a highly successful recording artist, and Sue has just been re-elected Vice President of the United States. The McKinley auditorium is renamed after Finn.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Glee characters}}\nIn casting ''Glee'', Murphy sought out actors who could identify with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found [[Matthew Morrison]], who had previously starred on stage in ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'' and ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]''; [[Lea Michele]], who starred in ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]''; and [[Jenna Ushkowitz]], who had been in the Broadway revival of ''[[The King and I]]''.<ref name=\"rewrite\" />\n\n[[File:Matthew Morrison Peabody 2010 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Matthew Morrison]] was cast after Murphy spent three months observing actors on Broadway.]]\n\nActors without any theatrical experience needed to demonstrate, during their auditions, that they could also sing and dance.

Murphy and his ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' colleague Brad Falchuk suggested that ''Glee'' be produced as a television show. The script was entirely rewritten,<ref name=\"DH\" /> and was picked up by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] within fifteen hours of being received. Murphy attributed that, in part, to the network's success with ''[[American Idol]]''. \"It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein\", he said.<ref name=\"Variety\" /> Murphy and Falchuk became the show's executive producers and showrunners, Brennan became a co-executive producer and Novick a producer.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> Brennan, Falchuk and Murphy started by writing \"all the episodes\".<ref name=\"We're All Gleeks&nbsp;\u2014 10 Questions for Glee Co-Creator Brad Falchuk\"/>\n\n''Glee'' is set at the fictional William McKinley High School in [[Lima, Ohio]].<ref name=\"'Glee' series set in a Lima high school has Toledo connection too\"/> Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself grew up in [[Indiana]], and recalled childhood visits to Ohio to the [[Kings Island]] theme park.<ref name=\"The Heldenfiles&nbsp;\u2014 Glee-ful Ohio\"/> Although set in Lima, the show is filmed at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] and [[Helen Bernstein High School]] in Hollywood.<ref name=\"Meet Cory Monteith & Naya Rivera of Glee\"/>\n\nMurphy has said that he has never seen a ''[[High School Musical (film series)|High School Musical]]'' film, to which ''Glee'' has been compared, and that his interest lay in creating a \"postmodern musical\", rather than \"doing a show where people burst into song\", drawing more heavily on the format of ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]''.<ref name=\"HSM\" /> Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism. \"There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why ''Idol'' worked. It's pure escapism,\" he said.<ref name=\"Variety\" /> Murphy intended to make a family show to appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads,<ref name=\"Variety\" /> and as of October 2009 he had already mapped out plans for the series covering three years of broadcast.<ref name=\"BB\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe three creators\u2014Murphy, Falchuk, and Brennan\u2014plan the stories together. For the first two seasons, they were the only writers, and after taking joint credit for the pilot episode and the episode that opened the fall 2009 season, they began rotating taking a single auctorial credit, based in large part on the person \"who\u2019s taken the lead in story breaking or who wrote a draft\". Brennan noted that the writing process is \"fast and loose, with the emphasis on fast\", and quotes Murphy as having said, in terms of their roles in episode creation, \"I'm sort of the brain. Brad's sort of the heart. Ian's sort of the funny bone\", which Brennan says \"is true in a lot of ways\". Some of the characters are written more by one writer than by the others. Brennan writes most of Sue's material, and Falchuk frequently writes the scenes between Kurt and Burt Hummel, though Murphy contributes a great deal to Kurt.<ref name=\"AVClub\"/>\n\nStarting with season three, a writing staff of six was hired: [[Ali Adler]], [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]], [[Marti Noxon]], [[Michael Hitchcock]], Matt Hodgson and Ross Maxwell.<ref name=\"andreeva\"/> The season's fourth episode, \"[[Pot o' Gold (Glee)|Pot o' Gold]]\", was written by Adler, the first not credited to the show's three creators.<ref name=\"HR\"/><ref name=\"Pot\"/>\n\nAdler and Noxon did not return for the show's fourth season and instead ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' writers [[Russel Friend]] and [[Garrett Lerner]], and Stacy Traub were hired.\n\n===Music and choreography===\n{{Main|List of songs in Glee|Glee albums discography|Glee songs discography}}\nThe series features numerous song [[cover version|covers]] sung onscreen by the characters.<ref name=\"DN\"/> Ryan Murphy was responsible for selecting all of the songs used, and has said that he strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: \"I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important\u2014the balancing of that.\"<ref name=\"LAT\" /> According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, \"Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along.\"<ref name=\"From 'Cabaret' to Kanye, Songs of 'Glee' Are a Hit\"/> In a 2010 interview with [[Allison Kugel]], [[Chris Colfer]] noted that \"there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (''Glee'' creator) and told him a couple of things that have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don\u2019t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us.\"<ref name=\"colferkugeltwo\"/> For the second season, a shift toward using more [[Top 40]] songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the [[Nielsen ratings#Demographics|18\u201349 demographic]].<ref name=\"lifeline\"/>\n\nMurphy was surprised at the ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained: \"I think the key to it is they loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids, for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience.\"<ref name=\"DN\" /> A minority of those approached refused to allow their music to be used, including [[Bryan Adams]], [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Coldplay]]; however, in June 2010, Coldplay reversed their decision, allowing ''Glee'' the rights to their catalog.<ref name=\"Coldplay bows to irresistible force of Glee\"/> Adams posted on his Twitter account that the producers of ''Glee'' had never requested permission from him and urged them to \"pick up the phone\".<ref name=\"kingstonherald\"/> Composer and musician [[Billy Joel]] offered many of his songs for use on the show,<ref name=\"afternoon\"/> and other artists have offered use of their songs for free.<ref name=\"'Glee' gets songs for free\"/> A series of ''Glee'' soundtrack albums have been released through [[Columbia Records]]. Songs featured on the show are available for [[music download|digital download]] through iTunes up to two weeks before new episodes air, and through other digital outlets and mobile carriers a week later.<ref name=\"BB\" /> ''Glee'' music producers [[Adam Anders]] and [[Peer Astrom]] have begun to add original music to the show, including two original songs, \"[[Loser Like Me]]\" and \"[[Get It Right (Glee Cast song)|Get It Right]]\", on the March 15, 2011 episode.<ref name=\"'Glee': Music producer Adam Anders spills details on the show's upcoming original music \u2013 EXCLUSIVE\"/>\n\n''Glee'' is choreographed by [[Zach Woodlee]] and features four to eight production numbers per episode.<ref name=\"USAToday\" /> Once Murphy selects a song, rights are cleared with its publishers by music supervisor P. J. Bloom, and music producers Adam Anders and Peer Astrom rearrange it for the ''Glee'' cast.<ref name=\"BB\" /> Numbers are pre-recorded by the cast, while Woodlee constructs the accompanying dance moves, which are then taught to the cast and filmed.<ref name=\"LAT\" /> Studio recordings of tracks are then made. The process begins six to eight weeks before each episode is filmed, and can end as late as the day before filming begins.<ref name=\"BB\" /> Each episode costs at least $3&nbsp;million to produce,<ref name=\"LAT\" /> and can take up to ten days to film as a result of the elaborate choreography.<ref name=\"HSM\"/> In late 2010, Bloom reported the process has been even shorter; \"as quick as a few weeks\".<ref name=\"lifeline\" /> For the second season, the creators were offered listens of upcoming songs in advance by publishers and record labels, with production occurring even before song rights are cleared.<ref name=\"lifeline\" />\n\n===Promotion===\n{{further|Glee Live!

And it isn't good for families.\"<ref name=\"parentstv\"/>\n\nThe promotional posters for the first season have the show's stars using their right hands to make an \"L\" to fill in the ''L'' of the word ''Glee''. The second season's promotional posters have the stars throwing slushies at the camera in pairs. The third season's promotional posters have the stars getting dodgeballs thrown at them by Sue Sylvester. While the cast concert tour, [[Glee Live! In Concert!]], began on May 15, 2010, and presented concerts in four cities in the US that month, the second edition, with an almost-entirely new set list, toured for four weeks in the US and Canada from May 21 through June 18, 2011, and followed with twelve days in England and Ireland, from June 22 through July 3, 2011.<ref name=\"Glee Live Tour 2011: Performance Dates\"/> The cast also performed on the [[The X Factor (UK series 7)|seventh season of ''The X Factor'']] on December 5, 2010.<ref name=\"Glee cast on X Factor semi-finals\"/>\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe [[Glee (season 1)|first season]] of ''Glee'' consists of twenty-two episodes.<ref name=\"Episodes\"/> The [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]] was originally broadcast on May 19, 2009.<ref name=\"foxflash\"/> The series returned on September 9, 2009,<ref name=\"Mitovich\"/> airing an additional twelve episodes on Wednesdays in the 9:00&nbsp;pm timeslot until December 9, 2009, for a total of thirteen episodes.<ref name=\"Fox 2012\u201313 Primetime Schedule Announced: 'Touch' & 'Fringe' Friday, 'Bones' & 'Mob Doctor' Monday, 'Glee' To Thursday, 4 Comedy Tuesday\" /> On September 21, 2009, nine more episodes were ordered for the first season by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]],<ref name=\"The Futon Critic\"/> and the first of these episodes was broadcast on April 13, 2010.

[...] The students lie, they cheat, they steal, they lust, they lace the bake-sale cupcakes with pot in order to give the student body a severe case of the munchies. Nearly all the [[Ten Commandments]] get violated at one point or another, while the audience is invited to laugh at people's pain and folly and humiliation. [...] It insults kids to suggest that simply watching Characters Behaving Badly onscreen means they'll take that as permission to do the same themselves. [...] And it's set in high school, meaning it's about a journey not just to college and career but to identity and conviction, the price of popularity, the compromises we must make between what we want and what we need.<ref name=\"The Gospel of Glee\"/></blockquote>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Brian Lowry was critical of the show's early episodes, highlighting acting and characterization issues and deeming the adult cast \"over-the-top buffoons\", with the exception of Mays' Emma, who he felt offered \"modest redemption\".<ref name=\"Glee3\"/> Though he praised Colfer and Michele's performances, Lowry wrote that the show's talent was squandered by its \"jokey, cartoonish, wildly uneven tone\", deeming the series a \"one-hit wonder\".<ref name=\"Variety2\"/> Following the show's mid-season finale, Lowry wrote that while ''Glee'' \"remains a frustrating mess at times\", its \"vibrant musical numbers and talented cast have consistently kept it on [his] [[TiVo]] must list\" conceding that \"even with its flaws, TV would be poorer without ''Glee''.\"<ref name=\"2009: No room for error\"/>\n\nAs ''Glee''{{'s}} initial success pulled in a large audience, John Doyle of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' wrote that the early shows \"felt fresh, mainly because the motley crew of kids had a kind of square na\u00efvet\u00e9.\" Doyle notes that the early success took ''Glee'' away from its original characters and plot, focusing more on celebrity guests. \"The gaiety is gone from ''Glee''. You should have set it in its prime, mere months ago\".<ref name=\"These Days, I'm Watching Glee with Dread\"/> Matthew Gilbert of [[Boston Globe]] similarly wrote that \"It has become a powerful, promotional machine, long on hype and short on the human feeling--the glee--that once made it so addictive\".<ref name=\"Lip-sunk\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe show's 754 musical performances, with each performance delivering an individual song or a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of two or more songs in a single performance, have led to commercial success, with over thirty-six million copies of ''Glee'' cast single releases purchased digitally, and over eleven million albums purchased worldwide through October 2011.<ref name=\"''Glee'' hits a musical milestone with an incredible 300 performances\"/> In 2009, the ''Glee'' cast had twenty-five singles chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the most by any artist since [[The Beatles]] had thirty-one songs in the chart in 1964;<ref name=\"Best Of 2009: By-The-Numbers\"/> in 2010, it placed eighty singles on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, far outstripping the previous record.<ref name=\"Chart Beat: Best Of 2010: Part 4\"/> In February 2011, ''Glee'' surpassed [[Elvis Presley]] as the act with the most songs placed on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, though fewer than one-fourth of them have charted for more than one week.<ref name=\"Weekly Chart Notes: Rihanna, Gwyneth Paltrow, the Beatles\"/> The cast performance of \"[[Don't Stop Believin']]{{-\"}} was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] on October 13, 2009, achieving over 500,000 digital sales,<ref name=\"Reuters\"/> and on March 16, 2011, received platinum certification for having sales of over a million.<ref name=\"riaa\"/> The series' cover version had a positive effect on sales of [[Rihanna]]'s \"[[Take a Bow (Rihanna song)|Take a Bow]]\", which increased by 189&nbsp;percent after the song was covered in the ''Glee'' episode \"Showmance\".<ref name=\"Reuters\" />\n\nHowever, there has also been critical condemnation of the cast performances. Jon Dolan of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented that [[Matthew Morrison]] \"couldn't rap his way out of a [[98 Degrees|98\u00b0]] rehearsal\", and Allmusic's Andrew Leahey wrote that [[Cory Monteith]] and [[Dianna Agron]] \"can't sing nearly as well as their co-stars\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> [[E!

He praised Murphy for his selection and resurrection of \"forgotten\" pop songs and compared the show's uniqueness to \"MTV in its prime\" as the embodiment of [[popular culture]].<ref name=\"Sheffield: How 'Glee' Became a Pop-Culture Juggernaut\"/>\n\nSome artists, including [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Kings of Leon]] and [[Foo Fighters]], have declined to have their songs used on the show. Murphy has been publicly critical of these refusals, which has led to exchanges in the press between him and a number of artists.<ref name=\"garvey\"/> A slated cover of [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]]'s \"[[Baby Got Back]]\" in the season four episode \"[[Sadie Hawkins (Glee)|Sadie Hawkins]]\" has been criticized for blatantly copying a rendition of the song by [[Jonathan Coulton]] without his permission, without giving creative credit.<ref name=\"Did Glee Rip Off a Jonathan Coulton Cover of 'Baby Got Back'?\"/><ref name=\"jonathan-coulton-vs-glee-and-fox-update\"/> Side-by-Side comparison shows the waveforms appear remarkably similar.
