The AAF was a component of the [[United States Army]], which on 2 March 1942<ref name=\":0\" /> was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces: the [[Army Ground Forces]], the [[Services of Supply]] (which in 1943 became the [[Army Service Forces]]), and the Army Air Forces. Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]].\n\nThe AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Air Corps, General Headquarters Air Force, and the ground forces' corps area commanders, and thus became the first air organization of the U.S. Army to control its own installations and support personnel. The peak size of the AAF during the [[World War II|Second World War]] was over 2.4 million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft by 1944, and 783 domestic bases in December 1943.<ref>Nalty (1997), pp. 176 and 378. Also, see growth tables above.</ref> By \"[[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]]\", the Army Air Forces had 1.25 million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide.<ref>''AAF Statistical Digest'', Table 215 \u2013 Airfields in CONUS 1941\u20131945; Table 217 \u2013 Airfields outside CONUS 1941\u20131945.</ref>\n\nThe Army Air Forces was created in June 1941 to provide the air arm a greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently, to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force, and to end an increasingly divisive administrative battle within the Army over control of aviation doctrine and organization that had been ongoing since the creation of an [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps|aviation section]] within the [[United States Army Signal Corps|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in 1914. The AAF succeeded both the Air Corps, which had been the statutory military aviation branch since 1926, and the GHQ Air Force, which had been activated in 1935 to quiet the demands of airmen for an independent Air Force similar to the [[Royal Air Force]] which had already been established in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nAlthough other nations already had separate air forces independent of their army or navy (such as the British [[Royal Air Force]] and the German [[Luftwaffe]]), the AAF remained a part of the Army until a defense reorganization in the post-war period resulted in the passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[National Security Act of 1947]] with the creation of an independent [[United States Air Force]] in September 1947.\n\nIn its expansion and conduct of the war, the AAF became more than just an arm of the greater organization. By the end of World War II, the Army Air Forces had become virtually an independent service. By regulation and executive order, it was a subordinate agency of the [[United States Department of War]] (as were the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces) tasked only with organizing, training, and equipping combat units, and limited in responsibility to the continental United States. In reality, Headquarters AAF controlled the conduct of all aspects of the air war in every part of the world, determining air policy and issuing orders without transmitting them through the Army Chief of Staff. This \"contrast between theory and fact is...fundamental to an understanding of the AAF.\"<ref name=\"legacy\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, pp. 28\u201329</ref>\n\n==Creation==\n\n===Unity of command problems in the Air Corps===\nThe roots of the Army Air Forces arose in the formulation of theories of [[strategic bombing]] at the [[Air Corps Tactical School]] that gave new impetus to arguments for an independent air force, beginning with those espoused by Brig. Gen. [[Billy Mitchell]] that led to his later [[court-martial]]. Despite a perception of resistance and even obstruction then by the bureaucracy in the War Department [[General Staff]] (WDGS), much of which was attributable to lack of funds, the Air Corps later made great strides in the 1930s, both organizationally and in doctrine. A strategy stressing precision bombing of industrial targets by heavily armed, long-range bombers emerged, formulated by the men who would become its leaders.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 112-113.</ref>\n\nA major step toward a separate air force came in March 1935, when command of all combat air units within the Continental United States (CONUS) was centralized under a single organization called the ''\"General Headquarters Air Force\"''. Since 1920, control of aviation units had resided with commanders of the [[corps area]]s (a peacetime ground forces administrative echelon), following the model established by commanding General [[John J. Pershing]] during World War I. In 1924, the General Staff planned for a wartime activation of an Army general headquarters (GHQ), similar to the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] model of [[World War I]], with a GHQ Air Force as a subordinate component. Both were created in 1933 when a small conflict with Cuba seemed possible following a coup d'\u00e9tat, but were not activated.\n\nActivation of GHQ Air Force represented a compromise between strategic airpower advocates and ground force commanders who demanded that the Air Corps mission remain tied to that of the land forces. Airpower advocates achieved a centralized control of air units under an air commander, while the WDGS divided authority within the air arm and assured a continuing policy of support of ground operations as its primary role.<ref>Nalty (1997), p.130.</ref> GHQ Air Force organized combat groups administratively into a strike force of three wings deployed to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], Pacific, and [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coasts]] but was small in comparison to European air forces. Lines of authority were difficult, at best, since GHQ Air Force controlled only operations of its combat units while the Air Corps was still responsible for doctrine, acquisition of aircraft, and training. Corps area commanders continued to exercise control over airfields and administration of personnel, and in the overseas departments, operational control of units as well.<ref group=n>Three examples of the negative effects of this long-ingrained policy, even after creation of the AAF, occurred in Hawaii in the six months preceding the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], where neither the Air Corps nor the AFCC had any command jurisdiction. First, Maj. Gen. [[Walter C. Short]], commanding general of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army's]] [[Hawaiian Department]], held the opinion that the [[Seventh Air Force|Hawaiian Air Force]] was grossly overstaffed and mandated in July 1941 that its non-flying AAF personnel complete infantry training, a program that took them from their primary jobs for a period of six to eight weeks. Second, efforts in October and November to complete gunnery training for B-17 gunners were stifled when aircrew were used by the Hawaiian Department to guard warehouses in [[Honolulu]]. Finally, after the War Department issued a war warning to Pacific commands on 27 November, Short insisted despite objections from his air commanders that aircraft be parked close together on open ramps as a security measure against [[sabotage]] rather than being dispersed in revetments for protection against air attack. (Arakaki and Kuborn, pp. 5\u20136, 38)</ref> Between March 1935 and September 1938, the commanders of GHQ Air Force and the Air Corps, Major Generals [[Frank Maxwell Andrews|Frank M. Andrews]] and [[Oscar Westover]] respectively, clashed philosophically over the direction in which the air arm was moving, exacerbating the difficulties.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 131-133.</ref>\n\nThe expected activation of Army General Headquarters prompted [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[George C. Marshall]] to request a reorganization study from Chief of the Air Corps Maj. Gen. [[Henry H. Arnold]] resulting on 5 October 1940 in a proposal for creation of an air staff, unification of the air arm under one commander, and equality with the ground and supply forces. Arnold's proposal was immediately opposed by the General Staff in all respects, rehashing its traditional doctrinal argument that, in the event of war, the Air Corps would have no mission independent of support of the ground forces. Marshall implemented a compromise that the Air Corps found entirely inadequate, naming Arnold as acting \"Deputy Chief of Staff for Air\" but rejecting all organizational points of his proposal. GHQ Air Force instead was assigned to the control of Army General Headquarters, although the latter was a training and not an operational component, when it was activated in November 1940. A division of the GHQ Air Force into four geographical air defense districts on 19 October 1940 was concurrent with the creation of air forces to defend [[Hawaii]] and the [[Panama Canal]]. The air districts were converted in March 1941 into numbered air forces with a subordinate organization of 54 groups.<ref name=\"goss3\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\n===Army Air Forces created===\n[[File:021002-O-9999G-013.jpg|right|thumb|General of the Army [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry H. (\"Hap\") Arnold]]]]\n{{see also|Air warfare of World War II}}\nThe likelihood of U.S. participation in [[World War II]] prompted the most radical reorganization of the [[aviation]] branch in its history, developing a structure that both unified command of all air elements and gave it total autonomy and equality with the ground forces by March 1942.\n\nIn the spring of 1941, the success in Europe of air operations conducted under centralized control (as exemplified by the British [[Royal Air Force]] and the German [[Wehrmacht]]'s military air arm, the [[Luftwaffe]]) made clear that the splintering of authority in the American air forces, characterized as \"[[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]]-headed\" by one congressman,<ref group=n>Rep. [[James G. Scrugham]] (D-Nev). (Craven and Cate Vol. 6, p. 24)</ref> had caused a disturbing lack of clear channels of command. Less than five months after the rejection of Arnold's reorganization proposal, a joint U.S.-British strategic planning agreement ([[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC-1]]) refuted the General Staff's argument that the Air Corps had no wartime mission except to support ground forces.<ref>Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 20</ref> A struggle with the General Staff over control of air defense of the United States had been won by airmen and vested in four command units called \"numbered air forces\", but the bureaucratic conflict threatened to renew the dormant struggle for an independent United States Air Force. Marshall had come to the view that the air forces needed a \"simpler system\" and a unified command. Working with Arnold and [[Robert A. Lovett]], recently appointed to the long-vacant position of Assistant Secretary of War for Air, he reached a consensus that quasi-autonomy for the air forces was preferable to immediate separation.<ref name=\"goss\"/>\n\nOn 20 June 1941, to grant additional autonomy to the air forces and to avoid binding legislation from Congress, the War Department revised the army regulation governing the organization of Army aviation, AR 95-5.<ref name=\"goss\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 293</ref> Arnold assumed the title of ''Chief of the Army Air Forces'', creating an echelon of command over all military aviation components for the first time and ending the dual status of the Air Corps and GHQ Air Force, which was renamed ''Air Force Combat Command'' (AFCC) in the new organization. The AAF gained the formal \"Air Staff\" long opposed by the General Staff,<ref group=n>These staff positions were designated A-1 through A-5 and corresponded to the WDGS positions of G-1 through G-5. The AAF began the war with this air staff but replaced it in the March 1942 reorganization.</ref> and a single air commander,<ref name=\"goss\"/> but still did not have equal status with the Army ground forces, and air units continued to report through two chains of command.<ref name=\"Nalty, p.181\">Nalty (1997), p.181.</ref> The commanding general of AFCC gained control of his stations and court martial authority over his personnel,<ref name=\"csm7\"/> but under the new field manual FM-5 the Army General Headquarters had the power to detach units from AFCC at will by creating task forces, the WDGS still controlled the AAF budget and finances, and the AAF had no jurisdiction over units of the [[Army Service Forces]] providing \"housekeeping services\" as support<ref group=n>This issue was not completely resolved until November 1943 when the units of those services (Quartermaster, Signal, Ordnance, etc.), amounting to 600,000 personnel, were transferred from the ASF into the AAF.

(Mooney 1946, p. 42)</ref> Marshall, a strong proponent of airpower, left understood that the Air Force would likely achieve its independence following the war. Soon after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, in recognition of importance of the role of the Army Air Forces, Arnold was given a seat on the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the planning staff that served as the focal point of American strategic planning during the war, in order that the United States would have an air representative in staff talks with their British counterparts on the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff|Combined Chiefs]]. In effect the head of the AAF gained equality with Marshall. While this step was never officially recognized by the [[United States Navy]], and was bitterly disputed behind the scenes at every opportunity, it nevertheless succeeded as a pragmatic foundation for the future separation of the Air Force.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 179-181.</ref>\n\n===Reorganizations of the AAF===\n\n====Circular No. 59 reorganization====\n[[File:USAAF.jpg|thumb|right|USAAF [[recruitment poster]] ]]\nUnder the revision of AR 95-5, the Army Air Forces consisted of three major components: Headquarters AAF, Air Force Combat Command, and the Air Corps. Yet the reforms were incomplete, subject to reversal with a change of mood at the War Department, and of dubious legality.<ref group=n>Two changes were possibly in conflict with the [[National Defense Act of 1920|National Defense Act]]: the creation of an air staff as an \"unnecessary duplication...in the work of\" the WDGS, and the \"superimposition of a level of authority above\" that of the Chief of the Air Corps. (Mooney 1946, p. 43)</ref> By November 1941, on the eve of U.S. entry into the war, the division of authority within the Army as a whole, caused by the activation of Army GHQ a year before, had led to a \"battle of memos\" between it and the WDGS over administering the AAF, prompting Marshall to state that he had \"the poorest command post in the Army\" when defense commands showed a \"disturbing failure to follow through on orders\".<ref name=\"csm7\"/> To streamline the AAF in preparation for war, with a goal of centralized planning and decentralized execution of operations, in October 1941 Arnold submitted to the WDGS essentially the same reorganization plan it had rejected a year before, this time crafted by Chief of Air Staff Brig. Gen. [[Carl A. Spaatz]].<ref name=\"goss\"/><ref name=\"Nalty, p.181\"/><ref>Wolk (1996), p. 4</ref> When this plan was not given any consideration, Arnold reworded the proposal the following month which, in the face of Marshall's dissatisfaction with Army GHQ, the War Plans Division accepted. Just before Pearl Harbor, Marshall recalled an Air Corps officer, Brig. Gen. [[Joseph T. McNarney]], from an observer group in England and appointed him to chair a \"War Department Reorganization Committee\" within the War Plans Division, using Arnold's and Spaatz's plan as a blueprint.<ref name=\"hw6\"/><ref>Mooney and Williamson (1956), p. 8</ref>\n\nAfter war began, Congress enacted the [[War Powers Act of 1941|First War Powers Act]] on 18 December 1941 endowing President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] with virtual ''carte blanche'' to reorganize the [[executive branch]] as he found necessary.<ref>Mooney (1946), p. 47</ref> Under it, on 28 February 42 Roosevelt issued [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16227 Executive Order 9082], based on Marshall's recommendation and the work of McNarney's committee. The EO changed Arnold's title to ''Commanding General, Army Air Forces'' effective 9 March 1942, making him co-equal with the commanding generals of the new [[Army Ground Forces]] and [[Services of Supply]], the other two components of the [[Army of the United States]]. The War Department issued Circular No. 59 on 2 March that carried out the executive order,<ref name=\"mc3241\">McClendon (1996), pp. 132\u2013141. The three documents referenced, AR 95-5, EO 9082, and WD Circular 59, are reproduced in their entirety.</ref> intended (as with the creation of the [[United States Army Air Service|Air Service]] in World War I) as a wartime expedient to expire six months after the end of the war.<ref name=\"hw6\">Wolk (1996), p, 6</ref><ref>Correll, \"GHQ Air Force\", p.68.</ref> The three components replaced a multiplicity of branches and organizations, reduced the WDGS greatly in size, and proportionally increased the representation of the air forces members on it to 50%.<ref name=\"mc3241\"/><ref>Mooney (1946), p. 49</ref>\n\nIn addition to dissolving both Army General Headquarters and the chiefs of the [[combat arms]], and assigning their training functions to the Army Ground Forces, War Department Circular 59 reorganized the Army Air Forces, disbanding both Air Force Combat Command and the Office of Chief of the Air Corps (OCAC), eliminating all its training and organizational functions, which removed an entire layer of authority.<ref>Cline (1990), p. 92.</ref><ref group=n>The Air Corps itself was a statutory entity and could not be legally discontinued except by act of Congress, but executive abolition of the OCAC under authority of the First War Powers Act gave the AAF legal standing. The chiefs of the other combat arms, including Infantry, were also abolished.</ref> Taking their former functions were eleven numbered air forces (later raised to sixteen) and six support commands (which became eight in January 1943). The circular also restated the mission of the AAF, in theory removing from it responsibility for strategic planning and making it only a Zone of Interior \"training and supply agency\", but from the start AAF officers viewed this as a \"paper\" restriction negated by Arnold's place on both the Joint and Combined Chiefs, which gave him strategic planning authority for the AAF,<ref>Mooney (1946), pp.49\u201350</ref><ref>Mooney and Williamson (1956), p. 10</ref><ref>McClendon (1996), p. 98</ref> a viewpoint that was formally sanctioned by the War Department in mid-1943 and endorsed by the president.<ref>Mooney (1946), pp.57\u201358</ref><ref>McClendon (1996), pp. 99\u2013100</ref><ref group=n>FM 100-20 ''Command and Employment of Air Power'' (Field Service Regulations), issued by the War Department on 21 July 1943, was viewed by the senior leadership of the Army Ground Forces as the Army Air Forces' \"Declaration of Independence.\" (Greenfield 1948, p. 47)</ref>\n\nThe Circular No. 59 reorganization directed the AAF to operate under a complex division of administrative control performed by a policy staff, an operating staff, and the support commands (formerly \"field activities\" of the OCAC). The former field activities operated under a \"bureau\" structure, with both policy and operating functions vested in staff-type officers who often exercised command and policy authority without responsibility for results, a system held over from the Air Corps years. The concept of an \"operating staff\", or directorates, was modeled on the RAF system that had been much admired by the observer groups sent over in 1941, and resulted from a desire to place experts in various aspects of military aviation into key positions of implementation. However functions often overlapped, communication and coordination between the divisions failed or was ignored, policy prerogatives were usurped by the directorates, and they became overburdened with detail, all contributing to the diversion of the directorates from their original purpose. The system of directorates in particular handicapped the developing operational training program (see [[United States Army Air Forces#Combat units|''Combat units'']] below), preventing establishment of an OTU command and having a tendency to micromanage because of the lack of centralized control.<ref name=\"mel223\">Layman (1946), pp. 22\u201323</ref> Four main directorates\u2014Military Requirements, Technical Services, Personnel, and Management Control\u2014were created, each with multiple sub-directorates, and eventually more than thirty offices were authorized to issue orders in the name of the commanding general.<ref name=\"afhra10\"/>\n\n====March 1943 reorganization====\n[[File:USAAF Reorganization Chart, 29March1943.pdf|thumb|March 29, 1943 reorganization of the United States Army Air Forces]]\n[[File:Winning Your Wings.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=16:03|The recruiting film ''[[Winning Your Wings]]'' (1942) helped enlist 150,000 pilots]]\nA \"strong and growing dissatisfaction\" with the organization led to an attempt by Lovett in September 1942 to make the system work by bringing the Directorate of Management Control<ref group=n>Management Control coordinated all the other directorates through the activities of organizational and legislative planning, statistical control, and the Adjutant General, who under the operating staff system was chief of administrative services rather than the issuer of orders and directives as he had been under the Chief of the Air Corps.</ref> and several traditional offices that had been moved to the operating staff, including the Air Judge Advocate and Budget Officer, back under the policy staff umbrella. When this adjustment failed to resolve the problems, the system was scrapped and all functions combined into a single restructured air staff.<ref>Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 42</ref> The hierarchical \"command\" principle, in which a single commander has direct final accountability but delegates authority to staff, was adopted AAF-wide in a major reorganization and consolidation on 29 March 1943. The four main directorates and seventeen subordinate directorates (the \"operating staff\")<ref>Mooney and Williamson (1956), chart p. 30</ref> were abolished as an unnecessary level of authority, and execution of policies was removed from the staffs to be assigned solely to field organizations along functional lines. The policy functions of the directorates were reorganized and consolidated into offices regrouped along conventional military lines under six assistant chiefs of air staff (AC/AS): Personnel; Intelligence; Operations, Commitments, and Requirements (OC&R); Materiel, Maintenance, and Distribution (MM&D);<ref group=n>MM&D became \"Materiel and Services\" (M&S) on 17 July 1944 in conjunction with the planned consolidation of the Air Materiel and Air Service Commands.</ref> Plans; and Training. Command of Headquarters AAF resided in a Chief of Air Staff and three deputies.<ref name=\"afhra10\">Mooney and Williamson (1956), pp. 29, 33, 40, 41, 43, and 68.</ref>\n\nThis wartime structure remained essentially unchanged for the remainder of hostilities. In October 1944 Arnold, to begin a process of reorganization for reducing the structure, proposed to eliminate the AC/AS, Training and move his office into OC&R, changing it to Operations, Training and Requirements (OT&R)<ref group=n>\"Commitments\" would be consolidated as part of AC/AS, Plans.</ref> but the mergers were never effected. On 23 August 1945, after the capitulation of Japan, realignment took place with the complete elimination of OC&R.

In May 1945, 88 per cent of officers serving in the Army Air Forces were commissioned in the Air Corps, while 82 per cent of enlisted members assigned to AAF units and bases had the Air Corps as their combat arm branch.<ref>Correll, \"But What About the Air Corps?\", pp. 64\u201365.</ref>  While officially the air arm was the ''Army Air Forces'', the term ''Air Corps'' persisted colloquially among the public as well as veteran airmen; in addition, the singular ''Air Force'' often crept into popular and even official use, reflected by the designation ''Air Force Combat Command'' in 1941\u201342.<ref group=n>The term \"air force\" had appeared officially as early as 1923, when Training Regulation TR 440-15 and Army Regulation 95-10 used \"air force aviation\" to denote combat air units in contrast to \"air service aviation\" (auxiliary units to support ground forces).

[[Jimmy Stewart]], a [[Hollywood]] movie star serving as an AAF pilot, used the terms \"Air Corps\" and \"Air Forces\" interchangeably in the narration of the 1942 recruiting short ''\"[[Winning Your Wings]]\"''. The term \"Air Force\" also appeared prominently in [[Frank Capra]]'s 1945 War Department indoctrination film ''\"[[War Comes to America]]\"'', of the famous iconic  ''\"[[Why We Fight]]\"'' series, as an animated map graphic of equal prominence to that of the Army and Navy.<ref group=n>By 1945 the term had also found its way into feature cinema, such as ''\"[[They Were Expendable]]\"'', in which a naval officer ([[John Wayne]]) and an AAF pilot ([[Louis Jean Heydt]]) chide each other about lack of reinforcement from their respective services. Wayne's character asks, \"And where is the Air Force?\"</ref>\n\n==Expansion==\nThe Air Corps at the direction of President Roosevelt began a rapid expansion from the spring of 1939 forward, partly from the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] created at the end of 1938, with the goal of providing an adequate air force for defense of the Western Hemisphere. An initial \"25-group program\", announced in April 1939, called for 50,000 men. However, when war broke out in September 1939 the Air Corps still had only 800 first-line combat aircraft and 76 bases, including 21 major installations and depots.<ref>Futrell, Historical Study 69, pp. 2\u20137.</ref> American fighter aircraft were inferior to the British [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]], and German [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] and [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|109]].

The need for an offensive strategy to defeat the [[Axis Powers]] required further enlargement and modernization of all the military services, including the new AAF. In addition, the invasion produced a new [[Lend lease]] partner in Russia, creating even greater demands on an already struggling American aircraft production.<ref>Nalty (1997), p.173.</ref>\n\nAn offensive strategy required several types of urgent and sustained effort. In addition to the development and manufacture of aircraft in massive numbers, the Army Air Forces had to establish a global logistics network to supply, maintain, and repair the huge force; recruit and train personnel; and sustain the health, welfare, and morale of its troops. The process was driven by the pace of aircraft production, not the training program,<ref>Nalty (1997), p.231.</ref> and was ably aided by the direction of Lovett, who for all practical purposes became \"Secretary of the Air Corps\".<ref>Tate (1998), p. 189.</ref><ref group=n>The assistant secretary position had been vacant for eight years, since Roosevelt's inauguration in March 1933.

distributed worldwide to prosecute the war, plus a general air force within the continental United States to support the whole and provide air defense.<ref>Bowman (1997), p.16.</ref><ref group=n>The Twentieth Air Force was numbered beyond sequence to be symbolic of a global strategic air force not subordinate to any theater command.

In 1946 its mission changed and it became the [[Strategic Air Command]]. (Craven and Cate, Vol. 1, p. 75)</ref>\n\nHalf of the numbered air forces were created ''de novo'' as the service expanded during the war. Some grew out of earlier commands as the service expanded in size and hierarchy (for example, the ''V Air Support Command'' became the [[United States Air Forces Central Command|Ninth Air Force]] in April 1942),<ref group=n>V Air Support Command was one of five organizations created in September 1941. Its responsibility was to direct and coordinate the training activities of National Guard observation squadrons inducted into federal service with those of light bomber units training with the [[Army Ground Forces]]. It was not a part of or related to any \"numbered air force\" but part of Air Force Combat Command, the former GHQ Air Force. It became superfluous for its purpose and was discontinued in April 1942, redesignated \"9th Air Force\" as the basis for the future tactical air force.</ref> and higher echelons such as [[United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF) in Europe<ref group=n>The ''U.S. Strategic Air Forces'' was created in February 1944 from the headquarters of the previous Eighth Air Force, the designation of which was then given to its former VIII Bomber Command. In August 1945, USSTAF became the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] (USAFE).</ref> and [[U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific]] became necessary to control the whole.\n\nA subordinate organizational tier within the numbered air force, the ''operational command'', was created to segregate units of similar functions (fighters and bombers) for administrative control. The numbering of the operational command was designated by the Roman numeral of its parent numbered air force. For instance, the Eighth Air Force listed the VIII Bomber Command and the [[VIII Fighter Command]] as subordinate operational commands. Roman numbered commands within numbered air forces also included \"support\", \"base\", and other services commands to support the operational units, such as the VIII Air Force Service and VIII Air Force Composite Commands<ref group=n>VIII Air Force Composite Command was a combined training and special operations organization,</ref> also part of Eighth Air Force during its history. The use of Roman-numeral commands was nonstandard within the AAF; the [[Tenth Air Force|Tenth]], [[Fourteenth Air Force|Fourteenth]], and [[Fifteenth Air Force]]s did not field subordinate commands during World War II.<ref group=n>The Fifteenth Air Force organized a temporary fighter headquarters in August 1944 when it created a provisional fighter wing to separate control of its P-38 groups from its P-51 groups. This headquarters was referred to as \"XV Fighter Command (Provisional)\".</ref>\n\nEight ''air divisions'' served as an additional layer of [[command and control]] for the vast organization, capable of acting independently if the need arose.\n\nInclusive within the air forces, commands and divisions were administrative headquarters called ''[[Wing (military aviation unit)|wings]]'' to control ''groups'' (operational units; see section below). As the number of groups increased, the number of wings needed to control them multiplied, with 91 ultimately activated, 69 of which were still active at the end of the war. As part of the Air Service and Air Corps, wings had been composite organizations, that is, composed of groups with different types of missions. Most of the wings of World War II, however, were composed of groups with like functions (denoted as ''bombardment'', ''fighter'', ''reconnaissance'', ''training'', ''antisubmarine'', ''troop carrier'', and ''replacement'').<ref name=\"maurer8\"/><ref group=n>\"Composite\" organizations continued to be fielded at the wing and group level. The [[24th Composite Wing]] was in essence a fighter organization and served in Iceland between December 1942 and June 1944, when it was disbanded. The [[69th Composite Wing|68th]] and [[69th Air Division|69th Composite Wings]] were bomber/fighter task forces activated in China in September 1943 which had Chinese fighter squadrons attached for operations. Both served in combat through the end of the war. (Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 388 and 404)</ref>\n\nThe six ''support commands'' organized between March 1941 and April 1942 to support and supply the numbered air forces remained on the same [[chain of command]] echelon as the numbered air forces, under the direct control of Headquarters Army Air Forces. At the end of 1942 and again in the spring of 1943 the AAF listed nine support commands before it began a process of consolidation that streamlined the number to five at the end of the war.<ref>Bowman (1997), p.17-18.</ref><ref>Reither (1944), p. 10 (organizational chart)</ref>\n\n[[File:Army Air Forces Training Command - Patch.png|thumb|right|AAF Training Command patch]]\nThese commands were:\n;Support commands active on 15 September 1945\n:[[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]]<ref group=n>Created 10 June 1942 from an expanded Air Corps Ferrying Command established 19 May 1941.

On 7 December 1941 the number of activated combat groups had reached 67, with 49 still within the Continental United States. Of the CONUS groups (the \"strategic reserve\"), 21 were engaged in operational training or still being organized and were unsuitable for deployment.<ref>Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 485</ref><ref>Spaatz, \"Strategic Airpower in the European War\".</ref><ref group=n>Spaatz calculated combat-ready groups, both overseas and in the strategic reserve, at 43.5 at the end of January 1942.</ref> Of the 67 combat groups, 26 were classified as bombardment: 13 ''Heavy Bomb'' groups ([[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[B-24 Liberator]]), and the rest ''Medium'' and ''Light'' groups ([[B-25 Mitchell]], [[B-26 Marauder]], and [[A-20 Havoc]]). The balance of the force included 26 ''Pursuit'' groups (renamed ''[[Fighter aircraft|fighter group]]'' in May 1942), 9 ''Observation'' (renamed ''Reconnaissance'') groups, and 6 ''Transport'' (renamed ''Troop Carrier'' or ''Combat Cargo'') groups.<ref name=\"maurer8\">Maurer, ''Combat Units'', p. 8.</ref><ref group=n>In May 1942 \"transport\" became the designation for non-combat groups that were part of Air Transport Command.</ref> After the operational deployment of the [[B-29 Superfortress]] bomber, ''Very Heavy Bombardment'' units were added to the force array.\n\nIn the first half of 1942 the Army Air Forces expanded rapidly as the necessity of a much larger air force than planned was immediately realized. Authorization for the total number of combat groups required to fight the war nearly doubled in February to 115. In July it jumped to 224, and a month later to 273. When the U.S. entered the war, however, the number of groups actually trained to a standard of combat proficiency had barely surpassed the total originally authorized by the first expansion program in 1940.<ref>White (1949), p. 8.</ref> The extant training establishment, in essence a \"self-training\" system, was inadequate in assets, organization, and [[pedagogy]] to train units wholesale. Individual training of freshly minted pilots occupied an inordinate amount of the available time to the detriment of unit proficiency. The ever-increasing numbers of new groups being formed had a deleterious effect on operational training and threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the old Air Corps groups to provide experienced cadres or to absorb graduates of the expanded training program to replace those transferred. Since 1939 the overall level of experience among the combat groups had fallen to such an extent that when the demand for replacements in combat was factored in, the entire operational training system was threatened.<ref name=\"cc600\"/>\n\n[[File:US roundel 1943-1947.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|USAAF insignia from July 1943 to January 1947]]\nTo avoid this probable crisis, an Operational Training Unit (OTU) system was adopted as it had been by the RAF. Under the American OTU concept, certain experienced groups were authorized as overstrength \"parent\" groups. A parent group (OTU unit) provided approximately 20% of its seasoned personnel as cadre to a newly activated, or \"satellite\", group. Cadres detached to the newly activated satellite group were first provided with special instruction on their training responsibilities, initially by the responsible air forces, but after 9 October 1942, by the [[Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics]] (AAFSAT) to standardize curriculum and instruction.<ref name=\"cc600\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, pp. 600\u2013602.</ref> New graduates of training schools fleshed out the satellite group and also restored the parent group to its overstrength size. The parent group was responsible for the organization and training of its satellite, normally a process six months in length that began the day of detachment of the cadre, the first half of the process bringing the new unit up to strength, the second half devoted to flying training, with the final six weeks concentrating on fighting as a unit.<ref>White (1949), p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe plan was first adopted in February 1942 by the AFCC's [[Second Air Force|Second]] and [[Third Air Force]]s, which had only training responsibilities during World War II.<ref>Layman (1946), p. 14</ref> The creation of an \"operating staff\" in the 9 March 1942 reorganization of the AAF and the dissolution of the AFCC halted the planned establishment of an Operational Training Command to oversee the program. Spaatz, last commanding general of the AFCC, was temporarily given supervisory responsibility for OTU while the new directorates were brought up to speed,<ref>Layman (1946), p. 23</ref> but after April 1942 the sub-directorates having jurisdiction over the training<ref group=n>Subordinate to the Directorate of Military Requirements, they were the Directorate of Bombardment (heavy and medium bombers) and Directorate of Air Defense (fighters). A third sub-directorate, Ground-Air Support (observation and light/dive bombers), had less influence on the process due to a confused status over its role. (White, p. 20)</ref> tended to tell the air forces not only what to do, but how to do it. When the operating staff and its directorates were abolished in March 1943, control of OTU/RTU activities was placed under the ''Assistant Chief of Air Staff, Training'' and administered by the ''Unit Training Division''.<ref>Layman (1946), pp. 38\u201340</ref><ref>White (1949), p. 20</ref>\n\nIn May 1942 the plan was extended to all four continental air forces but not until early 1943 were most developmental problems resolved.<ref group=n>An example of early difficulties with the \"parent and satellite\" plan was the [[33rd Operations Group|33rd Fighter Group]] at [[Mitchel Field]], which was the first complete parent unit formed in June 1942. It began the training of the [[324th Fighter Group|324th]], [[325th Operations Group|325th]], and [[327th Aircraft Sustainment Wing|327th Fighter Groups]] but was assigned to [[Operation Torch]] and the [[Twelfth Air Force]] on 19 September 1942. The barely organized 327th FG had to assume the OTU duties formerly conducted by the 33rd. (Mayock, p. 47)</ref>  Before the system matured, each air force became predominant in one type of OTU training, heavy bomber in the Second Air Force, medium and light bomber in the Third, and fighters in the [[First Air Force|First]] and [[Fourth Air Force|Fourth]] (which also had an air defense responsibility), but eventually both fighter and bombardment OTU were conducted in all four. When the bulk of new groups (and several parent groups) had been sent overseas, replacement training (RTU)<ref group=n>Begun in May 1942 with the designation of one 4AF fighter group to be overstrength as a pool for fighter pilot replacements, RTUs were also overstrength groups (most of the 32 OTUs eventually became RTUs) that instructed new air crew in transition and team training. RTUs distributed graduates as individual replacements or replacement crews to combat units and thereby obviated having such replacements drawn from organized units or training staffs in the United States, as was done for infantry replacements.

Staff functions in the base units were performed by directors of administration, operations, and materiel. The units were commonly seen in designations as \"AAF Base Units\". Personnel from discontinued OTU and RTU groups were merged into base units as \"Combat Crew Training Stations\".

Its forecast figures, despite planning errors from lack of accurate information about weather and the German economic commitment to the war, were within 2 percent of the units and 5.5 percent of the personnel ultimately mobilized,<ref>Griffith (1999), p.78.</ref> and it accurately predicted the time frame when [[Operation Overlord|the invasion of Europe by the Allies]] would take place.<ref name=\"Griffith, The Quest, p.77\">Griffith (1999), p.77.</ref>\n\nAWPD/1 called for an air defense of the Western hemisphere, a strategic defense against Japan in the Pacific, and strategic bombardment by 6,800 bombers against Germany, identifying 154 key targets of the German economic infrastructure it considered vulnerable to a sustained campaign.<ref name=\"Nalty, p.188\">Nalty (1997), p.188.</ref>  A strategic bomber requirement of 7,500 aircraft, which included the intercontinental [[B-36]]<ref name=\"Nalty, p.188\"/>  (then still in the design phase), was far too large for American industry to achieve to be practical, and an interim plan to attack Germany with 3,800 bombers was included in AWPD/1.<ref name=\"Nalty, p.188\"/>\n\nAWPD/1 was approved by Marshall and [[Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]] in September 1941.<ref name=\"Nalty, p.190\">Nalty (1997), p.190.</ref> Although war began before the plan could be presented to Roosevelt, it became the foundation for establishing aircraft production and training requirements used during the war, and the concept of a strategic bomber offensive against Germany became policy of the U.S. government,<ref>Bowman (1997), pp.19\u201320.</ref> in accordance with United States strategic policy stated in [[Rainbow 5]], as the only means available to the United States to take the war to Germany.<ref name=\"Nalty, p.190\"/>\n\nIn August 1942 Roosevelt called for a revision of proposed air requirements. AWPD/42 was presented on 6 September 1942, and although never accepted by the U.S. Navy, its revised estimates (which more than doubled production requirements to nearly 150,000 aircraft of all types, including those of the Navy and exports to allies) guided the Roosevelt Administration in 1943. The estimate was later reduced to 127,000, of which 80,000 were combat aircraft.\n\nLike its predecessor, AWPD/42 laid out a strategic plan for the daylight bombing of Germany by unescorted heavy bombers, but also included a similar plan for attacks on Japan. Unfortunately the B-17 bomber command of the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]] had only flown six relatively unopposed missions when AWPD/42 was drawn up, and the prior mistake in AWPD/1 of disregarding the need and feasibility of long-range fighter escorts was repeated.\n\nBoth plans called for the destruction of the German Air Force (GAF) as a necessary requirement before campaigns against priority economic targets. AWPD/1 established four target sets in order of priority: electrical power production, inland transportation, petroleum production, and Berlin;<ref name=\"wp1\">Griffith (1999), pp. 67.</ref> while AWPD/42 revised the priorities, placing [[U-Boat]] facilities first, followed by transportation, electricity production, petroleum production, and rubber production.<ref name=\"wp2\">Griffith (1999), pp. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\n===Combat crew rotation===\nTo prevent or alleviate the effects of [[Combat stress reaction|combat fatigue]], the AAF developed policies for rotating combat crews between the theaters of operations and the United States.<ref>Little (1968), p. 24</ref> Replacement limitations and operational requirements caused the modification of basic AAF policy several times during the war. On 1 July 1942 the War Department first set a one-year tour of duty for all AAF combat crews, but a simple, uniform policy service-wide was unrealistic and never put into effect. Instead field commanders developed their own criteria for determining completion of tours.  While varying substantially between theaters, most of these programs attempted to establish fixed tours based on numbers of missions and other quantifiable factors. Nonetheless, Headquarters AAF did not interfere with theater programs but did prohibit any rotation unless replacements had first arrived in the unit.<ref name=\"Little 1968, p. 25\">Little (1968), p. 25</ref> After studying the situation, the War Department rescinded the one-year tour policy on 29 May 1943 and changed procedures for assignment of replacements to include both attrition and rotation purposes. However a continuing shortage forced commanders to lengthen the tours they had established, to the detriment of aircrew morale.<ref>Little (1968), pp. 8-9</ref>\n\nBy January 1944 nearly all active tactical units had been programmed for deployment and the overall loss rate in the AAF was less than predicted. Arnold began to build reserves in tactical units to provide enough personnel for multiple crews for each aircraft but was hampered by the rotation policies, particularly among those fighting in Europe. Rotated personnel also believed that they were permanently exempt from further combat service, which was never the case at any time during World War II.<ref>Little (1968), pp. 11-12</ref> He ordered the revocation on 16 February 1944 of policies that arbitrarily set fixed \"goals\" for completion of combat tours and directed that the impression that no airman would be required to serve more than one tour of combat be \"unmistakably corrected\".<ref>Little (1968), p. 13</ref>\n\nThe use of in-theater rest camps as a short term measure for relief of stress only served to delay the onset of combat fatigue. The AAF approved in April 1944 the use of 30 days leave in the United States on a limited basis as a substitute for rotation but by August found it counterproductive for rehabilitative purposes.<ref>Little (1968), pp. 14-16</ref> In September 1944 Arnold, without rescinding his \"no fixed tours\" order, notified field commands that his objective was to provide enough replacement crews that rotation \"based on war weariness\" became unnecessary. This resulted in a revision of rotation policies whose \"guidelines\" had the effect of again setting fixed limits for a tour of duty for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\"Little 1968, p. 25\"/>\n\n===Operations summary===\nThe Air Force Historical Studies Office summarizes the execution of USAAF strategy during World War II:<ref name=\"sum\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Arnold's staff made the first priority in the war to launch a strategic bombing offensive in support of the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] against Germany. The Eighth Air Force, sent to England in 1942, took on that job. After a slow and often costly effort to bring the necessary strength to bear, joined in 1944 by the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] stationed in Italy, strategic bombing finally began to get results, and by the end of the war, the German economy had been dispersed and pounded to rubble.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Tactical air forces supported the ground forces in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean]] and [[European Theater of Operations|European theaters]], where the enemy found Allied [[air supremacy]] a constant frustration. In the war against Japan, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] made his advance along [[New Guinea]] by [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|leap frogging]] his air forces forward and using [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] forces to open up new bases. The AAF also supported Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]]'s [[aircraft carrier]]s in their island-hopping across the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Central Pacific]] and assisted Allied forces in [[Burma]] and China.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Arnold directly controlled the [[Twentieth Air Force]], equipped with the new long-range B-29 Superfortresses used for bombing Japan's [[Japanese Archipelago|home islands]], first from China and then from the [[Marianas]]. Devastated by [[air raids on Japan|fire-raids]], Japan was so weakened by August 1945 that Arnold believed neither the [[atomic bomb]] nor the planned [[Operation Downfall|invasion]] would be necessary to win the war. The fact that AAF B-29s [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped the atomic bombs]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], nevertheless, demonstrated what air power could do in the future. The [[Strategic Bombing Survey]] provided ammunition for the leaders of the AAF in the postwar debates over armed forces unification and national strategy.\"</blockquote>\n\n===USAAF statistical summary===\nThe United States Army Air Forces incurred 12% of the Army's 936,000 battle casualties in World War II. 88,119 airmen died in service. 52,173 were battle casualty deaths: 45,520 [[killed in action]], 1,140 died of wounds, 3,603 were [[missing in action]] and declared dead, and 1,910 were non-hostile battle deaths.

Spaatz]]]]\nWith the defeat of Japan, the entire United States military establishment immediately began a drastic [[demobilization]], as it had at the end of World War I. The AAF was hit as hard or harder as the older services by demobilization. Officers and members were discharged, installations were closed, and aircraft were stored or sold. Between August 1945 and April 1946, its strength fell from 2.25 million men to just 485,000, and a year later to 304,000. The [[Air Transport Command]], which retained its mission to support the entire military establishment worldwide, was trimmed from nine to three divisions and by the end of 1946 its personnel reduced by 80%. Aircraft inventory dropped from 79,000 to less than 30,000, many of them in storage. Permanent installations were reduced from 783 to 177, just 21 more than pre-war.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 378.</ref><ref>Futrell, Historical Study 69, p. 156.</ref><ref group=n>Installations closed because of demobilization included main bases, sub (satellite) bases, and auxiliary airfields.</ref>\n\nBy July 1946, the Army Air Forces had only 2 combat-ready groups out of 52 that remained on the list of active units.  A rebuilt air force of 70 groups, the authorized peacetime strength, was anticipated, with reserve and national guard forces to be available for active duty in an emergency. However considerable opposition to a large peacetime military establishment, and to the financial cost of such an establishment, resulted in planning cuts to 48 groups.\n\nIn February 1946, ill health forced the retirement of Arnold before he could fulfill his goal of achieving independence of the Air Force as a service equal with the Army and Navy. Spaatz replaced Arnold as the only other commanding general of the USAAF, and he oversaw both the demobilization of the largest air force in military history and its rebirth as envisioned by Mitchell and Arnold.\n\nArnold left the AAF with two important legacies, based on his experiences in World War II, which shaped the post-war USAAF and their independent successor. The first was a requirement that the command staff of the service must include [[staff officer]]s of varying expertise besides pilots. The second was the belief that despite the unqualified success of training methods that had expanded the Air Forces, the United States would never again have the time to mobilize and train the [[Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States|reserve components]] as they had in 1940, necessitating that reservists and National Guardsmen be immediately ready for service in case of national emergency.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 374.</ref>\n\nFor his part, Spaatz consulted closely with the new Army Chief of Staff, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and reorganized the AAF into ''major commands'' including three for combat operations ([[Strategic Air Command]], [[Tactical Air Command]], and [[Air Defense Command]])<ref group=n>The remainder of the AAF was reorganized into the Air Materiel, Air Training, Air Transport, Air Proving Ground, and Air University Commands. (Craven and Cate, Vol. 7, p. 576)</ref> that would not require a second restructuring once the Air Force became independent.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 375.</ref> He also re-structured the reserve components to conform with Arnold's concepts, including creation of the [[Air National Guard]] in April 1946.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 377.</ref>\n{{quote box |width=32em |align=left |bgcolor=#B0C4DE\n|title=\n|quote=In such a manner for the first time in the history of American aviation the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces definitely took a stand in favor of an independent military air arm. Though far from providing the initial impulse, [[Harry S. Truman|the President]]'s message of 19 December 1945 contributed considerable impetus to a series of developments within the executive and legislative branches of the  government which led directly, if belatedly, to the adoption of the National Security Act of 1947. \u2014R. Earl McClendon, ''Autonomy of the Air Arm''<ref name=\"Mac108\">McClendon (1996), p. 108</ref>\n}}\nOn 11 April 1945, at the conclusion of a ten-month study that took them to every major theater to interview 80 \"key military and naval personnel\", the Joint Chiefs of Staff Special Committee for the Reorganization of National Defense recommended that the armed forces of United States be organized into a single cabinet department, and that \"three coordinate combat branches, Army, Navy, and Air\" comprise the operational services. The committee reported that the statutory creation of a United States Air Force would merely recognize a situation that had evolved during World War II with the Army Air Forces, acknowledging that naval/marine aviation and some aspects of army aviation would remain in place. The committee also reported that its recommendation was approved by \"Generals of the Army Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower, Fleet Admirals Chester W. Nimitz and William F. Halsey and numerous other leading military and naval personnel\".<ref name=\"mac104107\"/>\n\nThe Navy Department remained opposed to a single department of defense and, at the recommendation of the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, created a panel using naval personnel to study the feasibility of a coordinating agency without executive powers as an alternative. The \"Eberstadt report\" made such a recommendation, but also endorsed the concept of an Air Force as a separate service. The Navy Department did not acknowledge its own findings and continued to oppose creation of a separate Air Force during hearings for unification bills introduced in October 1945. When the hearings failed to submit a report, President [[Harry S. Truman]] on 19 December 1945 came out strongly in support of an air force on a parity with ground and naval forces, reminding Congress that prior to the war independent Army and Navy Departments had often failed to work collectively or in coordination to the best interest of the nation.  He asserted that wartime expedients that had overcome these defects proved to be the difference between victory and defeat.<ref name=\"mac104107\">McClendon (1996), pp. 104\u2013108</ref>\n\nCongress, at the recommendation of Truman, created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] with enactment of the National Security Act of 1947 (61 ''Stat''. 495), 26 July 1947. The act established the '''[[United States Air Force]]''', a completely separate branch of the U.S. military, and abolished both the Army Air Forces and the Air Corps, effective 18 September 1947.<ref>[http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/224/Article/104613/the-us-air-force.aspx \"The Air Force Fact Sheet\"] (AF.mil) Retrieved 25 April 2016.</ref> The transfer of personnel and assets from the AAF to the USAF was effected by Transfer Order 1, Office of the Secretary of Defense, 26 September 1947.<ref name=\"natarc\" />\n\nThe initial delineation of service roles, Executive Order 9877, was supplanted on 21 April 1948, by the approval by Truman of the [[Key West Agreement]], which outlined the air assets that each service would be permitted to maintain. The Air Force was assigned the bulk of strategic, tactical, and transport aircraft, but the issue remained divisive well into the 1950s.<ref>Nalty (1997), pp. 418\u2013424.</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nThe ''Army Air Forces in World War II'', the official history of the AAF, summarized its significance as the final step to independence for the Air Force:\n<blockquote>By the close of the war (the AAF) had emerged as virtually a third independent service. Officially, the AAF never became anything other than a subordinate agency of the War Department charged to organize, train, and equip air units for assignment to combat theaters. Its jurisdiction was wholly limited to the Zone of Interior ''(today called the [[CONUS]])'', and it could communicate with air organizations in combat theaters only through channels extending up to the Chief of Staff, and then down through the theater commander to his subordinate air commander. The position of the AAF, in other words, was no different from that of the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces, the other two of the three coordinate branches into which the Army had been divided. So, at any rate, read the regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Actually, the Commanding General, Army Air Forces ... functioned on a level parallel to that of the Chief of Staff. ... He moved at the very highest levels of command in the wartime coalition with Britain. He chose the commanders of the combat air forces. ... He communicated regularly (with the air commanders overseas). ... He exerted a powerful influence on the development of strategy, tactics, and doctrine wherever AAF units fought. ... A world-wide system of air transport moved at his command through all theaters, (denying their) commanders their traditional prerogative of controlling everything within their area of responsibility. Throughout the war (he ran) the air war in whatever part of the world there seemed to be need for attention by Headquarters. The contrast between theory and fact is...fundamental to an understanding of the AAF.<ref name=\"legacy\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Uniforms===\n\n====Service dress====\n[[File:Richard Bong photo portrait head and shoulders.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Medal of Honor]] recipient Major [[Richard Bong]] in Officer's Service Dress]]\nUSAAF uniforms for all members consisted of a winter service uniform of [[olive drab]] wool worn in temperate weather and a tropical weather summer service uniform of [[khaki (color)|khaki]] cotton the same as those of other U.S. Army forces. In addition to the service uniforms usually worn for dress purposes and on pass from posts there were a variety of fatigue and flying uniforms.

The [[garrison cap]], commonly called the \"flight cap\" in the air forces, had been authorized for all ranks since 1926 to facilitate the wearing of radio headsets during flights. The \"curtain\" had piping for enlisted men in the USAAF branch colors of orange and ultramarine blue. The caps of [[warrant officer]]s were piped with black and silver cord; commissioned officers had black and gold piping except for general officer caps, which used gold cord.<ref>AR 600-35 (para. 12).</ref> The oval [[Peaked cap|service cap]] was fitted with a spring stiffening device called a [[grommet]], and prior to World War II uniform regulations authorized officers to remove the grommet to permit the use of headsets.

In the summer of 1943 the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC) replaced the WAAC. Although female auxiliary organizations such as the WAAC, [[Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron]] (WAFS) and [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASP) performed valuable service to the AAF, only the ANC and the WAC were official members of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the AAF servicewomen became unofficially known as \"Air WACs\".<ref name=\"ccxxxvi\"/>\n\nNurses attached to the AAF wore Army hospital whites, or prior to 1943, the ANC winter service uniform consisting of the ANC pattern dark blue cap or garrison cap with maroon piping, suit jacket with maroon cuff braid and gold army buttons, light blue or white shirt, black tie and light blue skirt, shoes were black or white. The ANC summer service uniform consisted of a similar suit in beige with maroon shoulder strap piping and cuff braid, beige ANC cap or beige garrison cap with maroon piping, white shirt, and black four-in-hand tie. During World War II the first flight nurses uniform consisted of a blue wool battle dress jacket, blue wool trousers and a blue wool men's style maroon piped garrison cap. The uniform was worn with either the ANC light blue or white shirt and black tie. After 1943 the ANC adopted olive drab service uniforms similar to the newly formed WAC.<ref>Smith (2001), p. 241.</ref>\n\n[[File:Women's Army Corps, Randolph Field, Texas, 1944.jpg|upright|thumb|Female service dress in OD shade 33 at [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph Field]], 1944]]\nFemale service dress went through an evolution of patterns over the course of the war years, however throughout the period the service uniforms both summer and winter generally consisted of the WAC pattern hat or women's garrison cap, suit coat (winter only for enlisted women), shirtwaist, four-in-hand tie, skirt, russet leather women's service shoes and hand bag. The women's olive drab wool \"Ike jacket\" was also worn as were women's service trousers. The colors essentially mirrored those of their male counterparts of corresponding rank in the equivalent service uniform although fabrics differed. There were also special off duty dresses of summer beige and winter tan. The new olive drab ANC uniforms were the same as those for WAC officers except for the ANC pattern hat and the ANC pattern handbag. The off duty dress was a separate ANC pattern in olive drab shade 51 or beige. The ANC beige summer service uniform with maroon trim was retained except that the tie was changed to maroon.<ref>AR 600-37 16 April 1945</ref> Sage green fatigue uniforms of [[Herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]] cotton [[twill]] for women, along with women's combat boots, field jackets and flight clothing, were manufactured by the U.S. Army during World War II. However, when women's versions of these items were not available, as was often the case during the war, men's issue items were used instead.\n\n====Flight clothing====\n[[File:P-40 64FS 57FG pilots.jpg|thumb|left|USAAF flight crew]]\nFlight clothing varied widely by [[European Theater of Operations#A theater of operations|theater of operation]] and type of mission. Innovative aviation flight suits, boots, leather helmets, goggles, and gloves were issued as early as 1928 to the Air Corps, and at least one style, the Type A-3 flight suit, continued in service until 1944.<ref name=\"Bowman, USAAF Handbook, p. 171\"/> However, [[A-2 Jacket|A-2 flight jackets]], made standard issue on 9 May 1931, became one of the best known symbols of the AAF. Made of [[seal brown]] horsehide leather (later supplemented by goatskin) with a beige [[silk|spun silk]] lining (cotton after 1939), the jackets featured an officer's stand-up collar, [[shoulder strap]]s, knit waistbands and cuffs, a zipper closing, and unit insignia.<ref>Bowman (1997), p. 172.</ref> Heavy, sheepskin-lined B-3 and B-6 [[flight jacket]]s, A-3 winter flying trousers, and B-2 \"gunner's\" caps, all in seal brown [[shearling]], proved insufficient for the extreme cold temperatures of high altitude missions in unpressurized aircraft, and were supplemented by a variety of one-piece electrically heated flying suits manufactured by [[General Electric]]. In addition to men's flight clothing, flight nurses wore specially manufactured women's lightweight and intermediate weight flight jackets and pants.<ref>Smith (2001), pp. 244\u2013246.</ref> Flight clothing such as the A-2 jacket was not authorized to be worn off the camp or post unless required for flight duty.<ref>AR 600-40 (Section IId, para. 9)</ref> The same sage green fatigue uniforms of herringbone cotton twill, and wind-resistant [[poplin]] field jackets used by Army ground troops, were also worn by AAF troops depending on duty assignment.<ref>Risch and Pitkin, p. .</ref>\n\nIn early 1943 the AAF did not renew its contracts for leather flight garments and began production of flight jackets and flying trousers made of cotton twill and [[nylon]] blends with [[alpaca]] pile linings. The AAF standardized the sage green or light olive drab B-10 flight jacket on 22 July 1943, accompanied by matching A-9 flying trousers with built-in suspenders, and the combination became widespread in the Eighth Air Force by early 1944. The heavier B-15 jacket followed at the end of the year, with the A-11 trousers issued in the last months of the war. Most jackets featured a [[Sheepskin#Mouton fur|Mouton fur]] or shearling collar, but a popular variation known as the \"tanker jacket\" had a wool knit collar that was less confining. These new jackets were lighter in weight than their leather predecessors while just as warm. Hooded variants designated B-9 and B-11 also appeared in early 1944 but because they were bulky and their fur-lined hoods impractical in combat, these were worn primarily by noncombat personnel or during ground duties.\n\n===Badges, insignia, and emblems===\n{{see also|United States military aircraft national insignia}}\nAAF uniforms were subject to Army Regulations, specifically AR 600-35 and AR 600-40, authorizing the wearing of badges, insignia, and emblems on the uniform. The vast size of the service saw the wearing of many custom-made variants of authorized badges, insignia, and emblems, and numerous examples of unauthorized insignia and emblems appeared throughout the forces, particularly in combat units overseas.\n\n====Badges====\n{{Main article|Obsolete badges of the United States military}}\nTo denote the special training and qualifications required for air crew and technical personnel in the USAAF, in most categories known as being [[U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Ratings|rated]], the following [[Military badges of the United States|military badges]] (known familiarly but ubiquitously throughout the service as \"wings\") were authorized for wear by members of the Army Air Forces:<ref>Bowman (1997), p. 156.

Most aviation badges were made of sterling silver or were given a silver finish, and various devices were used to attach them to uniforms. These included the traditional pin and safety catch and, later, clutch-back fasteners. Most USAAF badges of World War II became obsolete, having been superseded by later designs or with their aeronautical rating discontinued, and were not authorized for wear on the uniform after 1955.\n\n====Identification patch for flying personnel in combat areas====\nIn order to recognize and differentiate combat aircrews from other airmen in Europe, on March 29, 1943 the European Theater Headquarters of the U.S. Army created an ultramarine blue cloth patch 1\" \u00d7 3.25\" to be sewn on the service coat behind the aviation badge. According to General Order 18 Hq ETOUSA the patch was to be worn by  personnel of the Army Air Forces who held currently effective aeronautical ratings or who were authorized to wear the aviation badge for air crew members, during the time such personnel were currently assigned to combat flight duty. The patch was to be promptly removed when the individual ceased to serve in such capacity or left the theater.\n<ref>National Archives, Headquarters, European Theater of Operations, U.S. Army, General Order 18, 29 March 1943</ref>\n\n====Insignia of ranks and grades====\nThe rank structure and insignia of the U.S. Army Air Forces was that of the United States Army of World War II.\n\n=====Officer=====\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 11th Grade\n! 10th Grade\n! 9th Grade\n! 8th Grade\n! 7th Grade\n! 6th Grade\n! 5th Grade\n! 4th Grade\n! 3rd Grade\n! 2nd Grade\n! 1st Grade\n|-\n| |[[File:US-O11 insignia.svg|90px]]\n| [[File:US-O10 insignia.svg|135px]]\n| [[File:US-O9 insignia.svg|100px]]\n| [[File:US-O8 insignia.svg|65px]]\n| [[File:US-O7 insignia.svg|32px]]\n| [[File:US-O6 insignia.svg|70px]]\n| [[File:US-O5 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:US-O4 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:US-O3 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:US-O2 insignia.svg|22px]]\n| [[File:US-O1 insignia.svg|22px]]\n|-\n!

The AAF was a component of the [[United States Army]], which on 2 March 1942<ref name=\":0\" /> was divided functionally by executive order into three autonomous forces: the [[Army Ground Forces]], the [[Services of Supply]] (which in 1943 became the [[Army Service Forces]]), and the Army Air Forces. Each of these forces had a commanding general who reported directly to the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]].\n\nThe AAF administered all parts of military aviation formerly distributed among the Air Corps, General Headquarters Air Force, and the ground forces' corps area commanders, and thus became the first air organization of the U.S. Army to control its own installations and support personnel. The peak size of the AAF during the [[World War II|Second World War]] was over 2.4 million men and women in service and nearly 80,000 aircraft by 1944, and 783 domestic bases in December 1943.<ref>Nalty (1997), pp. 176 and 378. Also, see growth tables above.</ref> By \"[[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]]\", the Army Air Forces had 1.25 million men stationed overseas and operated from more than 1,600 airfields worldwide.<ref>''AAF Statistical Digest'', Table 215 \u2013 Airfields in CONUS 1941\u20131945; Table 217 \u2013 Airfields outside CONUS 1941\u20131945.</ref>\n\nThe Army Air Forces was created in June 1941 to provide the air arm a greater autonomy in which to expand more efficiently, to provide a structure for the additional command echelons required by a vastly increased force, and to end an increasingly divisive administrative battle within the Army over control of aviation doctrine and organization that had been ongoing since the creation of an [[Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps|aviation section]] within the [[United States Army Signal Corps|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in 1914. The AAF succeeded both the Air Corps, which had been the statutory military aviation branch since 1926, and the GHQ Air Force, which had been activated in 1935 to quiet the demands of airmen for an independent Air Force similar to the [[Royal Air Force]] which had already been established in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nAlthough other nations already had separate air forces independent of their army or navy (such as the British [[Royal Air Force]] and the German [[Luftwaffe]]), the AAF remained a part of the Army until a defense reorganization in the post-war period resulted in the passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[National Security Act of 1947]] with the creation of an independent [[United States Air Force]] in September 1947.\n\nIn its expansion and conduct of the war, the AAF became more than just an arm of the greater organization. By the end of World War II, the Army Air Forces had become virtually an independent service. By regulation and executive order, it was a subordinate agency of the [[United States Department of War]] (as were the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces) tasked only with organizing, training, and equipping combat units, and limited in responsibility to the continental United States. In reality, Headquarters AAF controlled the conduct of all aspects of the air war in every part of the world, determining air policy and issuing orders without transmitting them through the Army Chief of Staff. This \"contrast between theory and fact is...fundamental to an understanding of the AAF.\"<ref name=\"legacy\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, pp. 28\u201329</ref>\n\n==Creation==\n\n===Unity of command problems in the Air Corps===\nThe roots of the Army Air Forces arose in the formulation of theories of [[strategic bombing]] at the [[Air Corps Tactical School]] that gave new impetus to arguments for an independent air force, beginning with those espoused by Brig. Gen. [[Billy Mitchell]] that led to his later [[court-martial]]. Despite a perception of resistance and even obstruction then by the bureaucracy in the War Department [[General Staff]] (WDGS), much of which was attributable to lack of funds, the Air Corps later made great strides in the 1930s, both organizationally and in doctrine. A strategy stressing precision bombing of industrial targets by heavily armed, long-range bombers emerged, formulated by the men who would become its leaders.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 112-113.</ref>\n\nA major step toward a separate air force came in March 1935, when command of all combat air units within the Continental United States (CONUS) was centralized under a single organization called the ''\"General Headquarters Air Force\"''. Since 1920, control of aviation units had resided with commanders of the [[corps area]]s (a peacetime ground forces administrative echelon), following the model established by commanding General [[John J. Pershing]] during World War I. In 1924, the General Staff planned for a wartime activation of an Army general headquarters (GHQ), similar to the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] model of [[World War I]], with a GHQ Air Force as a subordinate component. Both were created in 1933 when a small conflict with Cuba seemed possible following a coup d'\u00e9tat, but were not activated.\n\nActivation of GHQ Air Force represented a compromise between strategic airpower advocates and ground force commanders who demanded that the Air Corps mission remain tied to that of the land forces. Airpower advocates achieved a centralized control of air units under an air commander, while the WDGS divided authority within the air arm and assured a continuing policy of support of ground operations as its primary role.<ref>Nalty (1997), p.130.</ref> GHQ Air Force organized combat groups administratively into a strike force of three wings deployed to the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], Pacific, and [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coasts]] but was small in comparison to European air forces. Lines of authority were difficult, at best, since GHQ Air Force controlled only operations of its combat units while the Air Corps was still responsible for doctrine, acquisition of aircraft, and training. Corps area commanders continued to exercise control over airfields and administration of personnel, and in the overseas departments, operational control of units as well.<ref group=n>Three examples of the negative effects of this long-ingrained policy, even after creation of the AAF, occurred in Hawaii in the six months preceding the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], where neither the Air Corps nor the AFCC had any command jurisdiction. First, Maj. Gen. [[Walter C. Short]], commanding general of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army's]] [[Hawaiian Department]], held the opinion that the [[Seventh Air Force|Hawaiian Air Force]] was grossly overstaffed and mandated in July 1941 that its non-flying AAF personnel complete infantry training, a program that took them from their primary jobs for a period of six to eight weeks. Second, efforts in October and November to complete gunnery training for B-17 gunners were stifled when aircrew were used by the Hawaiian Department to guard warehouses in [[Honolulu]]. Finally, after the War Department issued a war warning to Pacific commands on 27 November, Short insisted despite objections from his air commanders that aircraft be parked close together on open ramps as a security measure against [[sabotage]] rather than being dispersed in revetments for protection against air attack. (Arakaki and Kuborn, pp. 5\u20136, 38)</ref> Between March 1935 and September 1938, the commanders of GHQ Air Force and the Air Corps, Major Generals [[Frank Maxwell Andrews|Frank M. Andrews]] and [[Oscar Westover]] respectively, clashed philosophically over the direction in which the air arm was moving, exacerbating the difficulties.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 131-133.</ref>\n\nThe expected activation of Army General Headquarters prompted [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[George C. Marshall]] to request a reorganization study from Chief of the Air Corps Maj. Gen. [[Henry H. Arnold]] resulting on 5 October 1940 in a proposal for creation of an air staff, unification of the air arm under one commander, and equality with the ground and supply forces. Arnold's proposal was immediately opposed by the General Staff in all respects, rehashing its traditional doctrinal argument that, in the event of war, the Air Corps would have no mission independent of support of the ground forces. Marshall implemented a compromise that the Air Corps found entirely inadequate, naming Arnold as acting \"Deputy Chief of Staff for Air\" but rejecting all organizational points of his proposal. GHQ Air Force instead was assigned to the control of Army General Headquarters, although the latter was a training and not an operational component, when it was activated in November 1940. A division of the GHQ Air Force into four geographical air defense districts on 19 October 1940 was concurrent with the creation of air forces to defend [[Hawaii]] and the [[Panama Canal]]. The air districts were converted in March 1941 into numbered air forces with a subordinate organization of 54 groups.<ref name=\"goss3\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\n===Army Air Forces created===\n[[File:021002-O-9999G-013.jpg|right|thumb|General of the Army [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry H. (\"Hap\") Arnold]]]]\n{{see also|Air warfare of World War II}}\nThe likelihood of U.S. participation in [[World War II]] prompted the most radical reorganization of the [[aviation]] branch in its history, developing a structure that both unified command of all air elements and gave it total autonomy and equality with the ground forces by March 1942.\n\nIn the spring of 1941, the success in Europe of air operations conducted under centralized control (as exemplified by the British [[Royal Air Force]] and the German [[Wehrmacht]]'s military air arm, the [[Luftwaffe]]) made clear that the splintering of authority in the American air forces, characterized as \"[[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]]-headed\" by one congressman,<ref group=n>Rep. [[James G. Scrugham]] (D-Nev). (Craven and Cate Vol. 6, p. 24)</ref> had caused a disturbing lack of clear channels of command. Less than five months after the rejection of Arnold's reorganization proposal, a joint U.S.-British strategic planning agreement ([[U.S.\u2013British Staff Conference (ABC\u20131)|ABC-1]]) refuted the General Staff's argument that the Air Corps had no wartime mission except to support ground forces.<ref>Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 20</ref> A struggle with the General Staff over control of air defense of the United States had been won by airmen and vested in four command units called \"numbered air forces\", but the bureaucratic conflict threatened to renew the dormant struggle for an independent United States Air Force. Marshall had come to the view that the air forces needed a \"simpler system\" and a unified command. Working with Arnold and [[Robert A. Lovett]], recently appointed to the long-vacant position of Assistant Secretary of War for Air, he reached a consensus that quasi-autonomy for the air forces was preferable to immediate separation.<ref name=\"goss\"/>\n\nOn 20 June 1941, to grant additional autonomy to the air forces and to avoid binding legislation from Congress, the War Department revised the army regulation governing the organization of Army aviation, AR 95-5.<ref name=\"goss\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 293</ref> Arnold assumed the title of ''Chief of the Army Air Forces'', creating an echelon of command over all military aviation components for the first time and ending the dual status of the Air Corps and GHQ Air Force, which was renamed ''Air Force Combat Command'' (AFCC) in the new organization. The AAF gained the formal \"Air Staff\" long opposed by the General Staff,<ref group=n>These staff positions were designated A-1 through A-5 and corresponded to the WDGS positions of G-1 through G-5. The AAF began the war with this air staff but replaced it in the March 1942 reorganization.</ref> and a single air commander,<ref name=\"goss\"/> but still did not have equal status with the Army ground forces, and air units continued to report through two chains of command.<ref name=\"Nalty, p.181\">Nalty (1997), p.181.</ref> The commanding general of AFCC gained control of his stations and court martial authority over his personnel,<ref name=\"csm7\"/> but under the new field manual FM-5 the Army General Headquarters had the power to detach units from AFCC at will by creating task forces, the WDGS still controlled the AAF budget and finances, and the AAF had no jurisdiction over units of the [[Army Service Forces]] providing \"housekeeping services\" as support<ref group=n>This issue was not completely resolved until November 1943 when the units of those services (Quartermaster, Signal, Ordnance, etc.), amounting to 600,000 personnel, were transferred from the ASF into the AAF.

(Mooney 1946, p. 42)</ref> Marshall, a strong proponent of airpower, left understood that the Air Force would likely achieve its independence following the war. Soon after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941, in recognition of importance of the role of the Army Air Forces, Arnold was given a seat on the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the planning staff that served as the focal point of American strategic planning during the war, in order that the United States would have an air representative in staff talks with their British counterparts on the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff|Combined Chiefs]]. In effect the head of the AAF gained equality with Marshall. While this step was never officially recognized by the [[United States Navy]], and was bitterly disputed behind the scenes at every opportunity, it nevertheless succeeded as a pragmatic foundation for the future separation of the Air Force.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 179-181.</ref>\n\n===Reorganizations of the AAF===\n\n====Circular No. 59 reorganization====\n[[File:USAAF.jpg|thumb|right|USAAF [[recruitment poster]] ]]\nUnder the revision of AR 95-5, the Army Air Forces consisted of three major components: Headquarters AAF, Air Force Combat Command, and the Air Corps. Yet the reforms were incomplete, subject to reversal with a change of mood at the War Department, and of dubious legality.<ref group=n>Two changes were possibly in conflict with the [[National Defense Act of 1920|National Defense Act]]: the creation of an air staff as an \"unnecessary duplication...in the work of\" the WDGS, and the \"superimposition of a level of authority above\" that of the Chief of the Air Corps. (Mooney 1946, p. 43)</ref> By November 1941, on the eve of U.S. entry into the war, the division of authority within the Army as a whole, caused by the activation of Army GHQ a year before, had led to a \"battle of memos\" between it and the WDGS over administering the AAF, prompting Marshall to state that he had \"the poorest command post in the Army\" when defense commands showed a \"disturbing failure to follow through on orders\".<ref name=\"csm7\"/> To streamline the AAF in preparation for war, with a goal of centralized planning and decentralized execution of operations, in October 1941 Arnold submitted to the WDGS essentially the same reorganization plan it had rejected a year before, this time crafted by Chief of Air Staff Brig. Gen. [[Carl A. Spaatz]].<ref name=\"goss\"/><ref name=\"Nalty, p.181\"/><ref>Wolk (1996), p. 4</ref> When this plan was not given any consideration, Arnold reworded the proposal the following month which, in the face of Marshall's dissatisfaction with Army GHQ, the War Plans Division accepted. Just before Pearl Harbor, Marshall recalled an Air Corps officer, Brig. Gen. [[Joseph T. McNarney]], from an observer group in England and appointed him to chair a \"War Department Reorganization Committee\" within the War Plans Division, using Arnold's and Spaatz's plan as a blueprint.<ref name=\"hw6\"/><ref>Mooney and Williamson (1956), p. 8</ref>\n\nAfter war began, Congress enacted the [[War Powers Act of 1941|First War Powers Act]] on 18 December 1941 endowing President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] with virtual ''carte blanche'' to reorganize the [[executive branch]] as he found necessary.<ref>Mooney (1946), p. 47</ref> Under it, on 28 February 42 Roosevelt issued [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16227 Executive Order 9082], based on Marshall's recommendation and the work of McNarney's committee. The EO changed Arnold's title to ''Commanding General, Army Air Forces'' effective 9 March 1942, making him co-equal with the commanding generals of the new [[Army Ground Forces]] and [[Services of Supply]], the other two components of the [[Army of the United States]]. The War Department issued Circular No. 59 on 2 March that carried out the executive order,<ref name=\"mc3241\">McClendon (1996), pp. 132\u2013141. The three documents referenced, AR 95-5, EO 9082, and WD Circular 59, are reproduced in their entirety.</ref> intended (as with the creation of the [[United States Army Air Service|Air Service]] in World War I) as a wartime expedient to expire six months after the end of the war.<ref name=\"hw6\">Wolk (1996), p, 6</ref><ref>Correll, \"GHQ Air Force\", p.68.</ref> The three components replaced a multiplicity of branches and organizations, reduced the WDGS greatly in size, and proportionally increased the representation of the air forces members on it to 50%.<ref name=\"mc3241\"/><ref>Mooney (1946), p. 49</ref>\n\nIn addition to dissolving both Army General Headquarters and the chiefs of the [[combat arms]], and assigning their training functions to the Army Ground Forces, War Department Circular 59 reorganized the Army Air Forces, disbanding both Air Force Combat Command and the Office of Chief of the Air Corps (OCAC), eliminating all its training and organizational functions, which removed an entire layer of authority.<ref>Cline (1990), p. 92.</ref><ref group=n>The Air Corps itself was a statutory entity and could not be legally discontinued except by act of Congress, but executive abolition of the OCAC under authority of the First War Powers Act gave the AAF legal standing.

The circular also restated the mission of the AAF, in theory removing from it responsibility for strategic planning and making it only a Zone of Interior \"training and supply agency\", but from the start AAF officers viewed this as a \"paper\" restriction negated by Arnold's place on both the Joint and Combined Chiefs, which gave him strategic planning authority for the AAF,<ref>Mooney (1946), pp.49\u201350</ref><ref>Mooney and Williamson (1956), p. 10</ref><ref>McClendon (1996), p. 98</ref> a viewpoint that was formally sanctioned by the War Department in mid-1943 and endorsed by the president.<ref>Mooney (1946), pp.57\u201358</ref><ref>McClendon (1996), pp. 99\u2013100</ref><ref group=n>FM 100-20 ''Command and Employment of Air Power'' (Field Service Regulations), issued by the War Department on 21 July 1943, was viewed by the senior leadership of the Army Ground Forces as the Army Air Forces' \"Declaration of Independence.\" (Greenfield 1948, p. 47)</ref>\n\nThe Circular No. 59 reorganization directed the AAF to operate under a complex division of administrative control performed by a policy staff, an operating staff, and the support commands (formerly \"field activities\" of the OCAC). The former field activities operated under a \"bureau\" structure, with both policy and operating functions vested in staff-type officers who often exercised command and policy authority without responsibility for results, a system held over from the Air Corps years. The concept of an \"operating staff\", or directorates, was modeled on the RAF system that had been much admired by the observer groups sent over in 1941, and resulted from a desire to place experts in various aspects of military aviation into key positions of implementation. However functions often overlapped, communication and coordination between the divisions failed or was ignored, policy prerogatives were usurped by the directorates, and they became overburdened with detail, all contributing to the diversion of the directorates from their original purpose. The system of directorates in particular handicapped the developing operational training program (see [[United States Army Air Forces#Combat units|''Combat units'']] below), preventing establishment of an OTU command and having a tendency to micromanage because of the lack of centralized control.<ref name=\"mel223\">Layman (1946), pp. 22\u201323</ref> Four main directorates\u2014Military Requirements, Technical Services, Personnel, and Management Control\u2014were created, each with multiple sub-directorates, and eventually more than thirty offices were authorized to issue orders in the name of the commanding general.<ref name=\"afhra10\"/>\n\n====March 1943 reorganization====\n[[File:USAAF Reorganization Chart, 29March1943.pdf|thumb|March 29, 1943 reorganization of the United States Army Air Forces]]\n[[File:Winning Your Wings.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=16:03|The recruiting film ''[[Winning Your Wings]]'' (1942) helped enlist 150,000 pilots]]\nA \"strong and growing dissatisfaction\" with the organization led to an attempt by Lovett in September 1942 to make the system work by bringing the Directorate of Management Control<ref group=n>Management Control coordinated all the other directorates through the activities of organizational and legislative planning, statistical control, and the Adjutant General, who under the operating staff system was chief of administrative services rather than the issuer of orders and directives as he had been under the Chief of the Air Corps.</ref> and several traditional offices that had been moved to the operating staff, including the Air Judge Advocate and Budget Officer, back under the policy staff umbrella. When this adjustment failed to resolve the problems, the system was scrapped and all functions combined into a single restructured air staff.<ref>Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, p. 42</ref> The hierarchical \"command\" principle, in which a single commander has direct final accountability but delegates authority to staff, was adopted AAF-wide in a major reorganization and consolidation on 29 March 1943. The four main directorates and seventeen subordinate directorates (the \"operating staff\")<ref>Mooney and Williamson (1956), chart p. 30</ref> were abolished as an unnecessary level of authority, and execution of policies was removed from the staffs to be assigned solely to field organizations along functional lines. The policy functions of the directorates were reorganized and consolidated into offices regrouped along conventional military lines under six assistant chiefs of air staff (AC/AS): Personnel; Intelligence; Operations, Commitments, and Requirements (OC&R); Materiel, Maintenance, and Distribution (MM&D);<ref group=n>MM&D became \"Materiel and Services\" (M&S) on 17 July 1944 in conjunction with the planned consolidation of the Air Materiel and Air Service Commands.</ref> Plans; and Training.

In October 1944 Arnold, to begin a process of reorganization for reducing the structure, proposed to eliminate the AC/AS, Training and move his office into OC&R, changing it to Operations, Training and Requirements (OT&R)<ref group=n>\"Commitments\" would be consolidated as part of AC/AS, Plans.</ref> but the mergers were never effected. On 23 August 1945, after the capitulation of Japan, realignment took place with the complete elimination of OC&R.

In May 1945, 88 per cent of officers serving in the Army Air Forces were commissioned in the Air Corps, while 82 per cent of enlisted members assigned to AAF units and bases had the Air Corps as their combat arm branch.<ref>Correll, \"But What About the Air Corps?\", pp. 64\u201365.</ref>  While officially the air arm was the ''Army Air Forces'', the term ''Air Corps'' persisted colloquially among the public as well as veteran airmen; in addition, the singular ''Air Force'' often crept into popular and even official use, reflected by the designation ''Air Force Combat Command'' in 1941\u201342.<ref group=n>The term \"air force\" had appeared officially as early as 1923, when Training Regulation TR 440-15 and Army Regulation 95-10 used \"air force aviation\" to denote combat air units in contrast to \"air service aviation\" (auxiliary units to support ground forces). (Futrell, Historical Study 139, p. 40) In a letter of farewell to all members of the Air Corps on 27 February 1933, outgoing Assistant Secretary of War (Air) [[F. Trubee Davison]] wrote: \"Ours may not be the biggest air force in the world, but, my gracious, it is one of the best!\" (''Air Corps News Letter'' 24 February 1933, Vol. XVII No. 2)</ref> This misnomer was also used on official recruiting posters (see image above) and was important in promoting the idea of an \"Air Force\" as an independent service. [[Jimmy Stewart]], a [[Hollywood]] movie star serving as an AAF pilot, used the terms \"Air Corps\" and \"Air Forces\" interchangeably in the narration of the 1942 recruiting short ''\"[[Winning Your Wings]]\"''. The term \"Air Force\" also appeared prominently in [[Frank Capra]]'s 1945 War Department indoctrination film ''\"[[War Comes to America]]\"'', of the famous iconic  ''\"[[Why We Fight]]\"'' series, as an animated map graphic of equal prominence to that of the Army and Navy.<ref group=n>By 1945 the term had also found its way into feature cinema, such as ''\"[[They Were Expendable]]\"'', in which a naval officer ([[John Wayne]]) and an AAF pilot ([[Louis Jean Heydt]]) chide each other about lack of reinforcement from their respective services. Wayne's character asks, \"And where is the Air Force?\"</ref>\n\n==Expansion==\nThe Air Corps at the direction of President Roosevelt began a rapid expansion from the spring of 1939 forward, partly from the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] created at the end of 1938, with the goal of providing an adequate air force for defense of the Western Hemisphere. An initial \"25-group program\", announced in April 1939, called for 50,000 men.

In 1946 its mission changed and it became the [[Strategic Air Command]]. (Craven and Cate, Vol. 1, p. 75)</ref>\n\nHalf of the numbered air forces were created ''de novo'' as the service expanded during the war. Some grew out of earlier commands as the service expanded in size and hierarchy (for example, the ''V Air Support Command'' became the [[United States Air Forces Central Command|Ninth Air Force]] in April 1942),<ref group=n>V Air Support Command was one of five organizations created in September 1941. Its responsibility was to direct and coordinate the training activities of National Guard observation squadrons inducted into federal service with those of light bomber units training with the [[Army Ground Forces]]. It was not a part of or related to any \"numbered air force\" but part of Air Force Combat Command, the former GHQ Air Force. It became superfluous for its purpose and was discontinued in April 1942, redesignated \"9th Air Force\" as the basis for the future tactical air force.</ref> and higher echelons such as [[United States Strategic Air Forces]] (USSTAF) in Europe<ref group=n>The ''U.S. Strategic Air Forces'' was created in February 1944 from the headquarters of the previous Eighth Air Force, the designation of which was then given to its former VIII Bomber Command. In August 1945, USSTAF became the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] (USAFE).</ref> and [[U.S. Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific]] became necessary to control the whole.\n\nA subordinate organizational tier within the numbered air force, the ''operational command'', was created to segregate units of similar functions (fighters and bombers) for administrative control. The numbering of the operational command was designated by the Roman numeral of its parent numbered air force. For instance, the Eighth Air Force listed the VIII Bomber Command and the [[VIII Fighter Command]] as subordinate operational commands. Roman numbered commands within numbered air forces also included \"support\", \"base\", and other services commands to support the operational units, such as the VIII Air Force Service and VIII Air Force Composite Commands<ref group=n>VIII Air Force Composite Command was a combined training and special operations organization,</ref> also part of Eighth Air Force during its history. The use of Roman-numeral commands was nonstandard within the AAF; the [[Tenth Air Force|Tenth]], [[Fourteenth Air Force|Fourteenth]], and [[Fifteenth Air Force]]s did not field subordinate commands during World War II.<ref group=n>The Fifteenth Air Force organized a temporary fighter headquarters in August 1944 when it created a provisional fighter wing to separate control of its P-38 groups from its P-51 groups.

As the number of groups increased, the number of wings needed to control them multiplied, with 91 ultimately activated, 69 of which were still active at the end of the war. As part of the Air Service and Air Corps, wings had been composite organizations, that is, composed of groups with different types of missions. Most of the wings of World War II, however, were composed of groups with like functions (denoted as ''bombardment'', ''fighter'', ''reconnaissance'', ''training'', ''antisubmarine'', ''troop carrier'', and ''replacement'').<ref name=\"maurer8\"/><ref group=n>\"Composite\" organizations continued to be fielded at the wing and group level. The [[24th Composite Wing]] was in essence a fighter organization and served in Iceland between December 1942 and June 1944, when it was disbanded. The [[69th Composite Wing|68th]] and [[69th Air Division|69th Composite Wings]] were bomber/fighter task forces activated in China in September 1943 which had Chinese fighter squadrons attached for operations. Both served in combat through the end of the war.

On 7 December 1941 the number of activated combat groups had reached 67, with 49 still within the Continental United States.

Authorization for the total number of combat groups required to fight the war nearly doubled in February to 115. In July it jumped to 224, and a month later to 273. When the U.S. entered the war, however, the number of groups actually trained to a standard of combat proficiency had barely surpassed the total originally authorized by the first expansion program in 1940.<ref>White (1949), p. 8.</ref> The extant training establishment, in essence a \"self-training\" system, was inadequate in assets, organization, and [[pedagogy]] to train units wholesale. Individual training of freshly minted pilots occupied an inordinate amount of the available time to the detriment of unit proficiency. The ever-increasing numbers of new groups being formed had a deleterious effect on operational training and threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the old Air Corps groups to provide experienced cadres or to absorb graduates of the expanded training program to replace those transferred. Since 1939 the overall level of experience among the combat groups had fallen to such an extent that when the demand for replacements in combat was factored in, the entire operational training system was threatened.<ref name=\"cc600\"/>\n\n[[File:US roundel 1943-1947.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|USAAF insignia from July 1943 to January 1947]]\nTo avoid this probable crisis, an Operational Training Unit (OTU) system was adopted as it had been by the RAF. Under the American OTU concept, certain experienced groups were authorized as overstrength \"parent\" groups. A parent group (OTU unit) provided approximately 20% of its seasoned personnel as cadre to a newly activated, or \"satellite\", group. Cadres detached to the newly activated satellite group were first provided with special instruction on their training responsibilities, initially by the responsible air forces, but after 9 October 1942, by the [[Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics]] (AAFSAT) to standardize curriculum and instruction.<ref name=\"cc600\">Craven and Cate, Vol. 6, pp. 600\u2013602.</ref> New graduates of training schools fleshed out the satellite group and also restored the parent group to its overstrength size. The parent group was responsible for the organization and training of its satellite, normally a process six months in length that began the day of detachment of the cadre, the first half of the process bringing the new unit up to strength, the second half devoted to flying training, with the final six weeks concentrating on fighting as a unit.<ref>White (1949), p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe plan was first adopted in February 1942 by the AFCC's [[Second Air Force|Second]] and [[Third Air Force]]s, which had only training responsibilities during World War II.<ref>Layman (1946), p. 14</ref> The creation of an \"operating staff\" in the 9 March 1942 reorganization of the AAF and the dissolution of the AFCC halted the planned establishment of an Operational Training Command to oversee the program.

When the operating staff and its directorates were abolished in March 1943, control of OTU/RTU activities was placed under the ''Assistant Chief of Air Staff, Training'' and administered by the ''Unit Training Division''.<ref>Layman (1946), pp. 38\u201340</ref><ref>White (1949), p. 20</ref>\n\nIn May 1942 the plan was extended to all four continental air forces but not until early 1943 were most developmental problems resolved.<ref group=n>An example of early difficulties with the \"parent and satellite\" plan was the [[33rd Operations Group|33rd Fighter Group]] at [[Mitchel Field]], which was the first complete parent unit formed in June 1942.

Its forecast figures, despite planning errors from lack of accurate information about weather and the German economic commitment to the war, were within 2 percent of the units and 5.5 percent of the personnel ultimately mobilized,<ref>Griffith (1999), p.78.</ref> and it accurately predicted the time frame when [[Operation Overlord|the invasion of Europe by the Allies]] would take place.<ref name=\"Griffith, The Quest, p.77\">Griffith (1999), p.77.</ref>\n\nAWPD/1 called for an air defense of the Western hemisphere, a strategic defense against Japan in the Pacific, and strategic bombardment by 6,800 bombers against Germany, identifying 154 key targets of the German economic infrastructure it considered vulnerable to a sustained campaign.<ref name=\"Nalty, p.188\">Nalty (1997), p.188.</ref>  A strategic bomber requirement of 7,500 aircraft, which included the intercontinental [[B-36]]<ref name=\"Nalty, p.188\"/>  (then still in the design phase), was far too large for American industry to achieve to be practical, and an interim plan to attack Germany with 3,800 bombers was included in AWPD/1.<ref name=\"Nalty, p.188\"/>\n\nAWPD/1 was approved by Marshall and [[Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]] in September 1941.<ref name=\"Nalty, p.190\">Nalty (1997), p.190.</ref> Although war began before the plan could be presented to Roosevelt, it became the foundation for establishing aircraft production and training requirements used during the war, and the concept of a strategic bomber offensive against Germany became policy of the U.S. government,<ref>Bowman (1997), pp.19\u201320.</ref> in accordance with United States strategic policy stated in [[Rainbow 5]], as the only means available to the United States to take the war to Germany.<ref name=\"Nalty, p.190\"/>\n\nIn August 1942 Roosevelt called for a revision of proposed air requirements. AWPD/42 was presented on 6 September 1942, and although never accepted by the U.S. Navy, its revised estimates (which more than doubled production requirements to nearly 150,000 aircraft of all types, including those of the Navy and exports to allies) guided the Roosevelt Administration in 1943. The estimate was later reduced to 127,000, of which 80,000 were combat aircraft.\n\nLike its predecessor, AWPD/42 laid out a strategic plan for the daylight bombing of Germany by unescorted heavy bombers, but also included a similar plan for attacks on Japan. Unfortunately the B-17 bomber command of the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]] had only flown six relatively unopposed missions when AWPD/42 was drawn up, and the prior mistake in AWPD/1 of disregarding the need and feasibility of long-range fighter escorts was repeated.\n\nBoth plans called for the destruction of the German Air Force (GAF) as a necessary requirement before campaigns against priority economic targets. AWPD/1 established four target sets in order of priority: electrical power production, inland transportation, petroleum production, and Berlin;<ref name=\"wp1\">Griffith (1999), pp. 67.</ref> while AWPD/42 revised the priorities, placing [[U-Boat]] facilities first, followed by transportation, electricity production, petroleum production, and rubber production.<ref name=\"wp2\">Griffith (1999), pp. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\n===Combat crew rotation===\nTo prevent or alleviate the effects of [[Combat stress reaction|combat fatigue]], the AAF developed policies for rotating combat crews between the theaters of operations and the United States.<ref>Little (1968), p. 24</ref> Replacement limitations and operational requirements caused the modification of basic AAF policy several times during the war. On 1 July 1942 the War Department first set a one-year tour of duty for all AAF combat crews, but a simple, uniform policy service-wide was unrealistic and never put into effect. Instead field commanders developed their own criteria for determining completion of tours.  While varying substantially between theaters, most of these programs attempted to establish fixed tours based on numbers of missions and other quantifiable factors. Nonetheless, Headquarters AAF did not interfere with theater programs but did prohibit any rotation unless replacements had first arrived in the unit.<ref name=\"Little 1968, p. 25\">Little (1968), p. 25</ref> After studying the situation, the War Department rescinded the one-year tour policy on 29 May 1943 and changed procedures for assignment of replacements to include both attrition and rotation purposes. However a continuing shortage forced commanders to lengthen the tours they had established, to the detriment of aircrew morale.<ref>Little (1968), pp. 8-9</ref>\n\nBy January 1944 nearly all active tactical units had been programmed for deployment and the overall loss rate in the AAF was less than predicted. Arnold began to build reserves in tactical units to provide enough personnel for multiple crews for each aircraft but was hampered by the rotation policies, particularly among those fighting in Europe. Rotated personnel also believed that they were permanently exempt from further combat service, which was never the case at any time during World War II.<ref>Little (1968), pp. 11-12</ref> He ordered the revocation on 16 February 1944 of policies that arbitrarily set fixed \"goals\" for completion of combat tours and directed that the impression that no airman would be required to serve more than one tour of combat be \"unmistakably corrected\".<ref>Little (1968), p. 13</ref>\n\nThe use of in-theater rest camps as a short term measure for relief of stress only served to delay the onset of combat fatigue. The AAF approved in April 1944 the use of 30 days leave in the United States on a limited basis as a substitute for rotation but by August found it counterproductive for rehabilitative purposes.<ref>Little (1968), pp. 14-16</ref> In September 1944 Arnold, without rescinding his \"no fixed tours\" order, notified field commands that his objective was to provide enough replacement crews that rotation \"based on war weariness\" became unnecessary. This resulted in a revision of rotation policies whose \"guidelines\" had the effect of again setting fixed limits for a tour of duty for the remainder of the war.<ref name=\"Little 1968, p. 25\"/>\n\n===Operations summary===\nThe Air Force Historical Studies Office summarizes the execution of USAAF strategy during World War II:<ref name=\"sum\"/>\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Arnold's staff made the first priority in the war to launch a strategic bombing offensive in support of the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] against Germany. The Eighth Air Force, sent to England in 1942, took on that job. After a slow and often costly effort to bring the necessary strength to bear, joined in 1944 by the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] stationed in Italy, strategic bombing finally began to get results, and by the end of the war, the German economy had been dispersed and pounded to rubble.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Tactical air forces supported the ground forces in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean]] and [[European Theater of Operations|European theaters]], where the enemy found Allied [[air supremacy]] a constant frustration. In the war against Japan, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] made his advance along [[New Guinea]] by [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|leap frogging]] his air forces forward and using [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] forces to open up new bases. The AAF also supported Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]]'s [[aircraft carrier]]s in their island-hopping across the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Central Pacific]] and assisted Allied forces in [[Burma]] and China.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Arnold directly controlled the [[Twentieth Air Force]], equipped with the new long-range B-29 Superfortresses used for bombing Japan's [[Japanese Archipelago|home islands]], first from China and then from the [[Marianas]]. Devastated by [[air raids on Japan|fire-raids]], Japan was so weakened by August 1945 that Arnold believed neither the [[atomic bomb]] nor the planned [[Operation Downfall|invasion]] would be necessary to win the war. The fact that AAF B-29s [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped the atomic bombs]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], nevertheless, demonstrated what air power could do in the future. The [[Strategic Bombing Survey]] provided ammunition for the leaders of the AAF in the postwar debates over armed forces unification and national strategy.\"</blockquote>\n\n===USAAF statistical summary===\nThe United States Army Air Forces incurred 12% of the Army's 936,000 battle casualties in World War II. 88,119 airmen died in service. 52,173 were battle casualty deaths: 45,520 [[killed in action]], 1,140 died of wounds, 3,603 were [[missing in action]] and declared dead, and 1,910 were non-hostile battle deaths.

Spaatz]]]]\nWith the defeat of Japan, the entire United States military establishment immediately began a drastic [[demobilization]], as it had at the end of World War I. The AAF was hit as hard or harder as the older services by demobilization. Officers and members were discharged, installations were closed, and aircraft were stored or sold. Between August 1945 and April 1946, its strength fell from 2.25 million men to just 485,000, and a year later to 304,000. The [[Air Transport Command]], which retained its mission to support the entire military establishment worldwide, was trimmed from nine to three divisions and by the end of 1946 its personnel reduced by 80%. Aircraft inventory dropped from 79,000 to less than 30,000, many of them in storage. Permanent installations were reduced from 783 to 177, just 21 more than pre-war.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 378.</ref><ref>Futrell, Historical Study 69, p. 156.</ref><ref group=n>Installations closed because of demobilization included main bases, sub (satellite) bases, and auxiliary airfields.</ref>\n\nBy July 1946, the Army Air Forces had only 2 combat-ready groups out of 52 that remained on the list of active units.  A rebuilt air force of 70 groups, the authorized peacetime strength, was anticipated, with reserve and national guard forces to be available for active duty in an emergency. However considerable opposition to a large peacetime military establishment, and to the financial cost of such an establishment, resulted in planning cuts to 48 groups.\n\nIn February 1946, ill health forced the retirement of Arnold before he could fulfill his goal of achieving independence of the Air Force as a service equal with the Army and Navy. Spaatz replaced Arnold as the only other commanding general of the USAAF, and he oversaw both the demobilization of the largest air force in military history and its rebirth as envisioned by Mitchell and Arnold.\n\nArnold left the AAF with two important legacies, based on his experiences in World War II, which shaped the post-war USAAF and their independent successor. The first was a requirement that the command staff of the service must include [[staff officer]]s of varying expertise besides pilots. The second was the belief that despite the unqualified success of training methods that had expanded the Air Forces, the United States would never again have the time to mobilize and train the [[Reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States|reserve components]] as they had in 1940, necessitating that reservists and National Guardsmen be immediately ready for service in case of national emergency.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 374.</ref>\n\nFor his part, Spaatz consulted closely with the new Army Chief of Staff, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], and reorganized the AAF into ''major commands'' including three for combat operations ([[Strategic Air Command]], [[Tactical Air Command]], and [[Air Defense Command]])<ref group=n>The remainder of the AAF was reorganized into the Air Materiel, Air Training, Air Transport, Air Proving Ground, and Air University Commands. (Craven and Cate, Vol. 7, p. 576)</ref> that would not require a second restructuring once the Air Force became independent.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 375.</ref> He also re-structured the reserve components to conform with Arnold's concepts, including creation of the [[Air National Guard]] in April 1946.<ref>Nalty (1997), p. 377.</ref>\n{{quote box |width=32em |align=left |bgcolor=#B0C4DE\n|title=\n|quote=In such a manner for the first time in the history of American aviation the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces definitely took a stand in favor of an independent military air arm. Though far from providing the initial impulse, [[Harry S. Truman|the President]]'s message of 19 December 1945 contributed considerable impetus to a series of developments within the executive and legislative branches of the  government which led directly, if belatedly, to the adoption of the National Security Act of 1947. \u2014R. Earl McClendon, ''Autonomy of the Air Arm''<ref name=\"Mac108\">McClendon (1996), p. 108</ref>\n}}\nOn 11 April 1945, at the conclusion of a ten-month study that took them to every major theater to interview 80 \"key military and naval personnel\", the Joint Chiefs of Staff Special Committee for the Reorganization of National Defense recommended that the armed forces of United States be organized into a single cabinet department, and that \"three coordinate combat branches, Army, Navy, and Air\" comprise the operational services. The committee reported that the statutory creation of a United States Air Force would merely recognize a situation that had evolved during World War II with the Army Air Forces, acknowledging that naval/marine aviation and some aspects of army aviation would remain in place. The committee also reported that its recommendation was approved by \"Generals of the Army Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower, Fleet Admirals Chester W. Nimitz and William F. Halsey and numerous other leading military and naval personnel\".<ref name=\"mac104107\"/>\n\nThe Navy Department remained opposed to a single department of defense and, at the recommendation of the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, created a panel using naval personnel to study the feasibility of a coordinating agency without executive powers as an alternative. The \"Eberstadt report\" made such a recommendation, but also endorsed the concept of an Air Force as a separate service. The Navy Department did not acknowledge its own findings and continued to oppose creation of a separate Air Force during hearings for unification bills introduced in October 1945. When the hearings failed to submit a report, President [[Harry S. Truman]] on 19 December 1945 came out strongly in support of an air force on a parity with ground and naval forces, reminding Congress that prior to the war independent Army and Navy Departments had often failed to work collectively or in coordination to the best interest of the nation.  He asserted that wartime expedients that had overcome these defects proved to be the difference between victory and defeat.<ref name=\"mac104107\">McClendon (1996), pp. 104\u2013108</ref>\n\nCongress, at the recommendation of Truman, created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] with enactment of the National Security Act of 1947 (61 ''Stat''. 495), 26 July 1947. The act established the '''[[United States Air Force]]''', a completely separate branch of the U.S. military, and abolished both the Army Air Forces and the Air Corps, effective 18 September 1947.<ref>[http://www.af.mil/AboutUs/FactSheets/Display/tabid/224/Article/104613/the-us-air-force.aspx \"The Air Force Fact Sheet\"] (AF.mil) Retrieved 25 April 2016.</ref> The transfer of personnel and assets from the AAF to the USAF was effected by Transfer Order 1, Office of the Secretary of Defense, 26 September 1947.<ref name=\"natarc\" />\n\nThe initial delineation of service roles, Executive Order 9877, was supplanted on 21 April 1948, by the approval by Truman of the [[Key West Agreement]], which outlined the air assets that each service would be permitted to maintain. The Air Force was assigned the bulk of strategic, tactical, and transport aircraft, but the issue remained divisive well into the 1950s.<ref>Nalty (1997), pp. 418\u2013424.</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nThe ''Army Air Forces in World War II'', the official history of the AAF, summarized its significance as the final step to independence for the Air Force:\n<blockquote>By the close of the war (the AAF) had emerged as virtually a third independent service. Officially, the AAF never became anything other than a subordinate agency of the War Department charged to organize, train, and equip air units for assignment to combat theaters. Its jurisdiction was wholly limited to the Zone of Interior ''(today called the [[CONUS]])'', and it could communicate with air organizations in combat theaters only through channels extending up to the Chief of Staff, and then down through the theater commander to his subordinate air commander. The position of the AAF, in other words, was no different from that of the Army Ground Forces and the Army Service Forces, the other two of the three coordinate branches into which the Army had been divided. So, at any rate, read the regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Actually, the Commanding General, Army Air Forces ... functioned on a level parallel to that of the Chief of Staff. ... He moved at the very highest levels of command in the wartime coalition with Britain. He chose the commanders of the combat air forces. ... He communicated regularly (with the air commanders overseas). ... He exerted a powerful influence on the development of strategy, tactics, and doctrine wherever AAF units fought. ... A world-wide system of air transport moved at his command through all theaters, (denying their) commanders their traditional prerogative of controlling everything within their area of responsibility. Throughout the war (he ran) the air war in whatever part of the world there seemed to be need for attention by Headquarters. The contrast between theory and fact is...fundamental to an understanding of the AAF.<ref name=\"legacy\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Uniforms===\n\n====Service dress====\n[[File:Richard Bong photo portrait head and shoulders.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Medal of Honor]] recipient Major [[Richard Bong]] in Officer's Service Dress]]\nUSAAF uniforms for all members consisted of a winter service uniform of [[olive drab]] wool worn in temperate weather and a tropical weather summer service uniform of [[khaki (color)|khaki]] cotton the same as those of other U.S. Army forces.

Officers could wear trousers matching the color and fabric of the coat, or optionally they were allowed taupe colored, officially called \"drab shade 54\", trousers of the same material as the coat, nicknamed \"pinks\", leading to the nickname \"pinks and greens\" for the iconic combination.<ref>AR 600-35 31 March 1944 (Section I, para. 2; Section II, para. 9, 19).</ref> Officers were also authorized to use the more durable olive drab shade 33 serge uniforms, except for the enlisted men's four pocket service coat, as long as they were not mixed with OD Shade 51 or Drab Shade 54 clothing.<ref>Army Officers Guide 1942, pp. 132.</ref> An officer's OD overcoat and taupe rain coat were also authorized. Officers wore same cotton khaki shade No. 1 or olive drab wool light shade No. 33 shirts as enlisted men except with the addition of shoulder straps. Officers also had additional shirt color and fabric options, OD dark shade No. 50 or No. 51 and in 1944 drab shade No. 54.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOfficers wore black and khaki neckties until after February 1942 when neckties of wool cotton blend khaki shade 5 were authorized.<ref name=\"AR 600-35 Section I, para. 2a3\"/> Male officer's summer service uniforms usually consisted of the wash-and-wear cotton khaki shade 1 uniforms like those of the enlisted men, the main difference being that the shirts had shoulder straps. An OD wool shirt and cotton khaki trouser combination was also authorized. However, for dress purposes they also had the option of purchasing a khaki shade 1 summer service uniform of tropical weight suiting fabric. This uniform was identical in cut to the winter officers' uniform except for the color and cloth. However, the cloth belt of the winter coat was omitted.<ref>AR 600-35 (Section I, para. 2a2).</ref>\n\nPersonnel stationed in Europe, and after 1944 in the U.S., were authorized to wear a wool waist-length jacket, in either OD Shade 51 (for officers only) or OD Shade 33, nicknamed the [[United States Army uniforms in World War II#The Eisenhower Jacket|\"Ike jacket\"]] and eventually standardized as the M-1944 Field Jacket, in lieu of the full-length tunic of the service dress uniform.<ref>War Department Cir. No. 391 30 September 1944 Sec. VII.</ref>\n\nHeadgear for service uniforms consisted of two types, similar to those in use in the Army's ground forces, in olive drab for winter wear and khaki for summer. The [[garrison cap]], commonly called the \"flight cap\" in the air forces, had been authorized for all ranks since 1926 to facilitate the wearing of radio headsets during flights. The \"curtain\" had piping for enlisted men in the USAAF branch colors of orange and ultramarine blue. The caps of [[warrant officer]]s were piped with black and silver cord; commissioned officers had black and gold piping except for general officer caps, which used gold cord.<ref>AR 600-35 (para. 12).</ref> The oval [[Peaked cap|service cap]] was fitted with a spring stiffening device called a [[grommet]], and prior to World War II uniform regulations authorized officers to remove the grommet to permit the use of headsets. This style became widely popular during World War II as a symbol of being a combat veteran, and was known as a \"50-mission crush\" cap.<ref name=\"Bowman, USAAF Handbook, p. 171\">Bowman (1997), p. 171.</ref> The service cap however was no longer generally issued to enlisted men after 1942.<ref>Risch and Pitkin, p. 80,81.</ref>\n\nLeather items, including shoes, were [[Russet (color)|russet]] in color, and the AAF became known as the \"Brown Shoe Air Force\" after the United States Air Force became a separate service.<ref>Daly-Benarek (1995), p. 27.</ref><ref group=n>By extension \"brown shoe\" refers to any practice or idea that harks back to the Army Air Forces era.

In the summer of 1943 the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC) replaced the WAAC. Although female auxiliary organizations such as the WAAC, [[Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron]] (WAFS) and [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASP) performed valuable service to the AAF, only the ANC and the WAC were official members of the U.S. Armed Forces. In the AAF servicewomen became unofficially known as \"Air WACs\".<ref name=\"ccxxxvi\"/>\n\nNurses attached to the AAF wore Army hospital whites, or prior to 1943, the ANC winter service uniform consisting of the ANC pattern dark blue cap or garrison cap with maroon piping, suit jacket with maroon cuff braid and gold army buttons, light blue or white shirt, black tie and light blue skirt, shoes were black or white. The ANC summer service uniform consisted of a similar suit in beige with maroon shoulder strap piping and cuff braid, beige ANC cap or beige garrison cap with maroon piping, white shirt, and black four-in-hand tie. During World War II the first flight nurses uniform consisted of a blue wool battle dress jacket, blue wool trousers and a blue wool men's style maroon piped garrison cap. The uniform was worn with either the ANC light blue or white shirt and black tie. After 1943 the ANC adopted olive drab service uniforms similar to the newly formed WAC.<ref>Smith (2001), p. 241.</ref>\n\n[[File:Women's Army Corps, Randolph Field, Texas, 1944.jpg|upright|thumb|Female service dress in OD shade 33 at [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph Field]], 1944]]\nFemale service dress went through an evolution of patterns over the course of the war years, however throughout the period the service uniforms both summer and winter generally consisted of the WAC pattern hat or women's garrison cap, suit coat (winter only for enlisted women), shirtwaist, four-in-hand tie, skirt, russet leather women's service shoes and hand bag. The women's olive drab wool \"Ike jacket\" was also worn as were women's service trousers. The colors essentially mirrored those of their male counterparts of corresponding rank in the equivalent service uniform although fabrics differed. There were also special off duty dresses of summer beige and winter tan. The new olive drab ANC uniforms were the same as those for WAC officers except for the ANC pattern hat and the ANC pattern handbag. The off duty dress was a separate ANC pattern in olive drab shade 51 or beige. The ANC beige summer service uniform with maroon trim was retained except that the tie was changed to maroon.<ref>AR 600-37 16 April 1945</ref> Sage green fatigue uniforms of [[Herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]] cotton [[twill]] for women, along with women's combat boots, field jackets and flight clothing, were manufactured by the U.S. Army during World War II. However, when women's versions of these items were not available, as was often the case during the war, men's issue items were used instead.\n\n====Flight clothing====\n[[File:P-40 64FS 57FG pilots.jpg|thumb|left|USAAF flight crew]]\nFlight clothing varied widely by [[European Theater of Operations#A theater of operations|theater of operation]] and type of mission. Innovative aviation flight suits, boots, leather helmets, goggles, and gloves were issued as early as 1928 to the Air Corps, and at least one style, the Type A-3 flight suit, continued in service until 1944.<ref name=\"Bowman, USAAF Handbook, p. 171\"/> However, [[A-2 Jacket|A-2 flight jackets]], made standard issue on 9 May 1931, became one of the best known symbols of the AAF. Made of [[seal brown]] horsehide leather (later supplemented by goatskin) with a beige [[silk|spun silk]] lining (cotton after 1939), the jackets featured an officer's stand-up collar, [[shoulder strap]]s, knit waistbands and cuffs, a zipper closing, and unit insignia.<ref>Bowman (1997), p. 172.</ref> Heavy, sheepskin-lined B-3 and B-6 [[flight jacket]]s, A-3 winter flying trousers, and B-2 \"gunner's\" caps, all in seal brown [[shearling]], proved insufficient for the extreme cold temperatures of high altitude missions in unpressurized aircraft, and were supplemented by a variety of one-piece electrically heated flying suits manufactured by [[General Electric]]. In addition to men's flight clothing, flight nurses wore specially manufactured women's lightweight and intermediate weight flight jackets and pants.<ref>Smith (2001), pp. 244\u2013246.</ref> Flight clothing such as the A-2 jacket was not authorized to be worn off the camp or post unless required for flight duty.<ref>AR 600-40 (Section IId, para. 9)</ref> The same sage green fatigue uniforms of herringbone cotton twill, and wind-resistant [[poplin]] field jackets used by Army ground troops, were also worn by AAF troops depending on duty assignment.<ref>Risch and Pitkin, p. .</ref>\n\nIn early 1943 the AAF did not renew its contracts for leather flight garments and began production of flight jackets and flying trousers made of cotton twill and [[nylon]] blends with [[alpaca]] pile linings. The AAF standardized the sage green or light olive drab B-10 flight jacket on 22 July 1943, accompanied by matching A-9 flying trousers with built-in suspenders, and the combination became widespread in the Eighth Air Force by early 1944. The heavier B-15 jacket followed at the end of the year, with the A-11 trousers issued in the last months of the war. Most jackets featured a [[Sheepskin#Mouton fur|Mouton fur]] or shearling collar, but a popular variation known as the \"tanker jacket\" had a wool knit collar that was less confining. These new jackets were lighter in weight than their leather predecessors while just as warm. Hooded variants designated B-9 and B-11 also appeared in early 1944 but because they were bulky and their fur-lined hoods impractical in combat, these were worn primarily by noncombat personnel or during ground duties.\n\n===Badges, insignia, and emblems===\n{{see also|United States military aircraft national insignia}}\nAAF uniforms were subject to Army Regulations, specifically AR 600-35 and AR 600-40, authorizing the wearing of badges, insignia, and emblems on the uniform. The vast size of the service saw the wearing of many custom-made variants of authorized badges, insignia, and emblems, and numerous examples of unauthorized insignia and emblems appeared throughout the forces, particularly in combat units overseas.\n\n====Badges====\n{{Main article|Obsolete badges of the United States military}}\nTo denote the special training and qualifications required for air crew and technical personnel in the USAAF, in most categories known as being [[U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Ratings|rated]], the following [[Military badges of the United States|military badges]] (known familiarly but ubiquitously throughout the service as \"wings\") were authorized for wear by members of the Army Air Forces:<ref>Bowman (1997), p. 156.

Most aviation badges were made of sterling silver or were given a silver finish, and various devices were used to attach them to uniforms. These included the traditional pin and safety catch and, later, clutch-back fasteners. Most USAAF badges of World War II became obsolete, having been superseded by later designs or with their aeronautical rating discontinued, and were not authorized for wear on the uniform after 1955.\n\n====Identification patch for flying personnel in combat areas====\nIn order to recognize and differentiate combat aircrews from other airmen in Europe, on March 29, 1943 the European Theater Headquarters of the U.S. Army created an ultramarine blue cloth patch 1\" \u00d7 3.25\" to be sewn on the service coat behind the aviation badge. According to General Order 18 Hq ETOUSA the patch was to be worn by  personnel of the Army Air Forces who held currently effective aeronautical ratings or who were authorized to wear the aviation badge for air crew members, during the time such personnel were currently assigned to combat flight duty. The patch was to be promptly removed when the individual ceased to serve in such capacity or left the theater.\n<ref>National Archives, Headquarters, European Theater of Operations, U.S. Army, General Order 18, 29 March 1943</ref>\n\n====Insignia of ranks and grades====\nThe rank structure and insignia of the U.S. Army Air Forces was that of the United States Army of World War II.\n\n=====Officer=====\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! 11th Grade\n! 10th Grade\n! 9th Grade\n! 8th Grade\n! 7th Grade\n! 6th Grade\n! 5th Grade\n! 4th Grade\n! 3rd Grade\n! 2nd Grade\n! 1st Grade\n|-\n| |[[File:US-O11 insignia.svg|90px]]\n| [[File:US-O10 insignia.svg|135px]]\n| [[File:US-O9 insignia.svg|100px]]\n| [[File:US-O8 insignia.svg|65px]]\n| [[File:US-O7 insignia.svg|32px]]\n| [[File:US-O6 insignia.svg|70px]]\n| [[File:US-O5 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:US-O4 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:US-O3 insignia.svg|60px]]\n| [[File:US-O2 insignia.svg|22px]]\n| [[File:US-O1 insignia.svg|22px]]\n|-\n!
