This order applied particularly to the [[New York City Subway]], which was the most severely affected by dilapidated infrastructure, causing overcrowding and delays. With many parts of the system approaching or exceeding 100 years of age, general deterioration could be seen in many subway stations. By 2017, only 65% of weekday trains reached their destinations on time, the lowest rate since a transit crisis in the 1970s. To a lesser extent, [[MTA Regional Bus Operations|New York City buses]] operated by the MTA were also affected. Both the subway and the buses are run by the [[New York City Transit Authority]] (NYCTA), a subsidiary of the MTA. A separate crisis at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] affected the routes of the three railroad agencies that provided service into the station.\n\nThere were myriad causes attributed to the transit crisis. The subway was affected by a lack of funds, signal slowdowns, and broken-down infrastructure. The buses were also affected by a lack of funds, but individual routes had additional problems including low frequencies, slow speeds, and winding routes. Money from the MTA in general was withheld due to actions from politicians at both the city and state levels, from both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. These issues caused delays for passengers for both systems, ranging from moderate to severe, as well as resulted in thousands of hours of lost time for passengers. Additionally, ridership on the subway started declining for the first time in several years, and ridership on buses continued a gradual decline that had started before the crisis.\n\nSeveral solutions were proposed. In July 2017, MTA chairman [[Joe Lhota]] created a multifaceted \"Subway Action Plan\" that consisted of a short-term solution to improve reliability and increase capacity, as well as long-term solutions that implemented improvement ideas from a public \"Genius Challenge\". A corresponding \"Bus Action Plan\" was released in April 2018. Later that year, the [[Regional Plan Association]] released a report that advocated for large investments to the subway system. Governor Cuomo also proposed implementing [[congestion pricing in New York City]] in order to fund the MTA. In 2018, the MTA hired [[Andy Byford]] from the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] as the new NYCTA chief in an attempt to solve the transit crisis. Byford presented a report titled \"Fast Forward: The Plan to Modernize New York City Transit\" to tackle the issues plaguing the transit system.\n\n== Declaration of crisis ==\nOn June 27, 2017, thirty-nine people were injured when an [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] train derailed at [[125th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|125th Street]]<ref name=\"NY120173\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/transit/2017/06/27/a-train-derailment-cause-mta.html|title=MTA: Unsecure Rail Stored on Tracks Caused Harlem Subway Derailment|date=June 28, 2017|accessdate=June 29, 2017|agency=[[NY1]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628092936/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/transit/2017/06/27/a-train-derailment-cause-mta.html|archive-date=June 28, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> because the emergency brakes were activated after the train hit an improperly secured piece of replacement rail.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/mta-train-derailment-caused-by-improperly-secured-rail/2017/06/28/84743d9a-5bb8-11e7-aa69-3964a7d55207_story.html|title=l Supervisors suspended amid NYC subway derailment probe|last1=Armstrong|first1=Kiley|date=June 28, 2017|accessdate=June 29, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628053715/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/mta-train-derailment-caused-by-improperly-secured-rail/2017/06/28/84743d9a-5bb8-11e7-aa69-3964a7d55207_story.html|archivedate=June 28, 2017|url-status=dead|agency=[[The Washington Post]]|last2=Eltman|first2=Frank}}</ref><ref name=\":022\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/nyregion/subway-train-derails-in-manhattan.html|title=Subway Derailment in Manhattan Injures Dozens|last=Santora|first=Marc|date=June 27, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 25, 2017|last2=Fitzsimmons|first2=Emma G.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The next day, Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the subway system.<ref name=NYTimes-StateofEmergency-Jun2017/> This state of emergency had also arisen after several track fires<ref name=\":262\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/nyregion/subway-track-fire-sends-9-to-hospital-and-snarls-morning-commute.html|title=Subway Track Fire Sends 9 to Hospital and Snarls Morning Commute|last=Fitzsimmons|first=Emma G.|date=July 17, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 26, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/track-fire-disrupts-subway-service.html|title=Track Fire Is the Latest Subway Disaster|last=Kirby|first=Jen|date=July 17, 2017|work=Daily Intelligencer|access-date=July 26, 2017|language=en}}</ref> and overcrowding incidents.<ref name=\":262\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-subway-a-train-delay-trash-fire-2017-7|title=These photos sum up just how bad New York's commuter nightmare has gotten|last=Muoio|first=Danielle|date=July 16, 2017|work=Business Insider|access-date=July 26, 2017|language=en}}</ref> As part of the order, he ordered MTA Chairman [[Joe Lhota]] to come up with a reorganization plan within 30 days.<ref name=\"NYTimes-StateofEmergency-Jun2017\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/nyregion/cuomo-declares-a-state-of-emergency-for-the-subway.html|title=Cuomo Declares a State of Emergency for New York City Subways|last=Fitzsimmons|first=Emma G.|date=June 29, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 25, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> A day later, the MTA officially announced the Genius Transit Challenge, where contestants could submit ideas to improve signals, communications infrastructure, or rolling stock.

Other actions by city and state politicians, according to the ''Times'', included overspending; overpaying unions and interest groups; advertising superficial improvement projects while ignoring more important infrastructure; and agreeing to high-interest loans that would have been unnecessary without these politicians' other interventions.<ref name=\":5\"/> In December of the same year, the ''Times'' reported that the $12 billion [[East Side Access]] project, which would extend the MTA's [[Long Island Rail Road]] to [[Grand Central Terminal]] upon its completion, was the most expensive of its kind in the world, with a projected price of $3.5 billion per mile ({{convert|3.5|$/mi|$/km|disp=number}} billion per kilometer) of track. Over the years, the projected cost of East Side Access had risen by billions of dollars due to unnecessary expenses. In addition to overpaying workers and overspending, politicians and [[Labor unions in the United States|trade unions]] had forced the MTA to hire more workers than was needed. In 2010, an accountant found that the project was hiring 200 extra workers, at a cost of $1,000 per worker per day, for no apparent reason. The bidding process for MTA construction contracts also raised costs because, in some cases, only one or two contractors would bid on a project. Similar construction projects in New York City, such as the [[Second Avenue Subway]] and [[7 Subway Extension]], had been more expensive than comparable projects elsewhere for the same reasons, even though other cities' transit systems faced similar, or greater, problems compared to the MTA.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-construction-costs.html|title=The Most Expensive Mile of Subway Track on Earth|last=Rosenthal|first=Brian M.|date=December 28, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 29, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n{{-}}\n\n=== Signal and work-zone slowdowns ===\nThe transit crisis was influenced partly by modifications to [[Signaling of the New York City Subway|New York City Subway signals]] and work-zone policies that forced trains to reduce their average speeds.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/09/nyregion/subway-crisis-mta-decisions-signals-rules.html|title=How 2 M.T.A.

Some of the locations included the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Lexington}}) between [[14th Street\u2013Union Square (New York City Subway)|14th Street\u2013Union Square]] and [[Bowling Green (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Bowling Green]]; the [[IRT Eastern Parkway Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Eastern west}}) between [[Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center (New York City Subway)|Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center]] and [[Franklin Avenue/Botanic Garden (New York City Subway)|Franklin Avenue]]; the [[IND Fulton Street Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Fulton}}) between [[Jay Street\u2013MetroTech (New York City Subway)|Jay Street\u2013MetroTech]] and [[Hoyt\u2013Schermerhorn Streets (IND Lines)|Hoyt\u2013Schermerhorn Streets]]; and the [[BMT Jamaica Line]] and [[BMT Nassau Street Line]] ({{NYCS trains|Jamaica west}}) between [[Hewes Street (BMT Jamaica Line)|Hewes Street]] and [[Bowery (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Bowery]]. Signal timers were added across the system since the fatal [[1995 Williamsburg Bridge subway crash]], so that trains would be spaced further apart, thereby increasing safety. Some timers were installed in places where extra train spacing was unnecessary, increasing delays and reducing capacity. In addition, some timers had stopped functioning properly, forcing train operators to operate more slowly to ensure that their train did not activate the [[train stop|automatic braking system]] if they passed the signals at too high a speed. As part of Byford's plan, New York City Transit would ensure that signal timers are being cleaned and are functioning. In fall 2018, two new initiatives would begin on selected lines to reduce delays. The first initiative would ensure that train crews will be at the terminal to allow their train to leave on time, while the second would add countdown clocks for train operators so they can maintain speeds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-metro-andy-byford-signals-delays-20180720-story.html#|title=Byford vows to speed up trains, cutting 10,000 delays a month \u2013 NY Daily News|last=Rivoli|first=Dan|date=July 22, 2018|work=New York Daily News|access-date=July 23, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nUnder the ''Fast Forward'' report, New York City Transit would conduct a one-year [[pilot program]] in which it would increase off-peak bus frequencies on the [[Q6 (New York City bus)|Q6]], [[Q69 and Q100 buses|Q69]], [[B17 (New York City bus)|B17]], [[B65 (New York City bus)|B65]], and [[S93 (New York City bus)|S93]] bus routes in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island.

This order applied particularly to the [[New York City Subway]], which was the most severely affected by dilapidated infrastructure, causing overcrowding and delays. With many parts of the system approaching or exceeding 100 years of age, general deterioration could be seen in many subway stations. By 2017, only 65% of weekday trains reached their destinations on time, the lowest rate since a transit crisis in the 1970s. To a lesser extent, [[MTA Regional Bus Operations|New York City buses]] operated by the MTA were also affected. Both the subway and the buses are run by the [[New York City Transit Authority]] (NYCTA), a subsidiary of the MTA. A separate crisis at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] affected the routes of the three railroad agencies that provided service into the station.\n\nThere were myriad causes attributed to the transit crisis. The subway was affected by a lack of funds, signal slowdowns, and broken-down infrastructure. The buses were also affected by a lack of funds, but individual routes had additional problems including low frequencies, slow speeds, and winding routes. Money from the MTA in general was withheld due to actions from politicians at both the city and state levels, from both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. These issues caused delays for passengers for both systems, ranging from moderate to severe, as well as resulted in thousands of hours of lost time for passengers. Additionally, ridership on the subway started declining for the first time in several years, and ridership on buses continued a gradual decline that had started before the crisis.\n\nSeveral solutions were proposed. In July 2017, MTA chairman [[Joe Lhota]] created a multifaceted \"Subway Action Plan\" that consisted of a short-term solution to improve reliability and increase capacity, as well as long-term solutions that implemented improvement ideas from a public \"Genius Challenge\". A corresponding \"Bus Action Plan\" was released in April 2018. Later that year, the [[Regional Plan Association]] released a report that advocated for large investments to the subway system. Governor Cuomo also proposed implementing [[congestion pricing in New York City]] in order to fund the MTA. In 2018, the MTA hired [[Andy Byford]] from the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] as the new NYCTA chief in an attempt to solve the transit crisis. Byford presented a report titled \"Fast Forward: The Plan to Modernize New York City Transit\" to tackle the issues plaguing the transit system.\n\n== Declaration of crisis ==\nOn June 27, 2017, thirty-nine people were injured when an [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] train derailed at [[125th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|125th Street]]<ref name=\"NY120173\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/transit/2017/06/27/a-train-derailment-cause-mta.html|title=MTA: Unsecure Rail Stored on Tracks Caused Harlem Subway Derailment|date=June 28, 2017|accessdate=June 29, 2017|agency=[[NY1]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628092936/http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/transit/2017/06/27/a-train-derailment-cause-mta.html|archive-date=June 28, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> because the emergency brakes were activated after the train hit an improperly secured piece of replacement rail.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/mta-train-derailment-caused-by-improperly-secured-rail/2017/06/28/84743d9a-5bb8-11e7-aa69-3964a7d55207_story.html|title=l Supervisors suspended amid NYC subway derailment probe|last1=Armstrong|first1=Kiley|date=June 28, 2017|accessdate=June 29, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628053715/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/mta-train-derailment-caused-by-improperly-secured-rail/2017/06/28/84743d9a-5bb8-11e7-aa69-3964a7d55207_story.html|archivedate=June 28, 2017|url-status=dead|agency=[[The Washington Post]]|last2=Eltman|first2=Frank}}</ref><ref name=\":022\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/nyregion/subway-train-derails-in-manhattan.html|title=Subway Derailment in Manhattan Injures Dozens|last=Santora|first=Marc|date=June 27, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 25, 2017|last2=Fitzsimmons|first2=Emma G.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The next day, Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the subway system.<ref name=NYTimes-StateofEmergency-Jun2017/> This state of emergency had also arisen after several track fires<ref name=\":262\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/nyregion/subway-track-fire-sends-9-to-hospital-and-snarls-morning-commute.html|title=Subway Track Fire Sends 9 to Hospital and Snarls Morning Commute|last=Fitzsimmons|first=Emma G.|date=July 17, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 26, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/track-fire-disrupts-subway-service.html|title=Track Fire Is the Latest Subway Disaster|last=Kirby|first=Jen|date=July 17, 2017|work=Daily Intelligencer|access-date=July 26, 2017|language=en}}</ref> and overcrowding incidents.<ref name=\":262\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-subway-a-train-delay-trash-fire-2017-7|title=These photos sum up just how bad New York's commuter nightmare has gotten|last=Muoio|first=Danielle|date=July 16, 2017|work=Business Insider|access-date=July 26, 2017|language=en}}</ref> As part of the order, he ordered MTA Chairman [[Joe Lhota]] to come up with a reorganization plan within 30 days.<ref name=\"NYTimes-StateofEmergency-Jun2017\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/nyregion/cuomo-declares-a-state-of-emergency-for-the-subway.html|title=Cuomo Declares a State of Emergency for New York City Subways|last=Fitzsimmons|first=Emma G.|date=June 29, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=July 25, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> A day later, the MTA officially announced the Genius Transit Challenge, where contestants could submit ideas to improve signals, communications infrastructure, or rolling stock.

Other actions by city and state politicians, according to the ''Times'', included overspending; overpaying unions and interest groups; advertising superficial improvement projects while ignoring more important infrastructure; and agreeing to high-interest loans that would have been unnecessary without these politicians' other interventions.<ref name=\":5\"/> In December of the same year, the ''Times'' reported that the $12 billion [[East Side Access]] project, which would extend the MTA's [[Long Island Rail Road]] to [[Grand Central Terminal]] upon its completion, was the most expensive of its kind in the world, with a projected price of $3.5 billion per mile ({{convert|3.5|$/mi|$/km|disp=number}} billion per kilometer) of track. Over the years, the projected cost of East Side Access had risen by billions of dollars due to unnecessary expenses. In addition to overpaying workers and overspending, politicians and [[Labor unions in the United States|trade unions]] had forced the MTA to hire more workers than was needed. In 2010, an accountant found that the project was hiring 200 extra workers, at a cost of $1,000 per worker per day, for no apparent reason. The bidding process for MTA construction contracts also raised costs because, in some cases, only one or two contractors would bid on a project. Similar construction projects in New York City, such as the [[Second Avenue Subway]] and [[7 Subway Extension]], had been more expensive than comparable projects elsewhere for the same reasons, even though other cities' transit systems faced similar, or greater, problems compared to the MTA.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-construction-costs.html|title=The Most Expensive Mile of Subway Track on Earth|last=Rosenthal|first=Brian M.|date=December 28, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 29, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n{{-}}\n\n=== Signal and work-zone slowdowns ===\nThe transit crisis was influenced partly by modifications to [[Signaling of the New York City Subway|New York City Subway signals]] and work-zone policies that forced trains to reduce their average speeds.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/09/nyregion/subway-crisis-mta-decisions-signals-rules.html|title=How 2 M.T.A.

These signals, referred to as \"time signals\", forced operators to slow train speeds so that they would only pass through the signal block after the timer elapsed.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/03/13/the-trains-are-slower-because-they-slowed-the-trains-down/|title=\u2018The Trains Are Slower Because They Slowed the Trains Down\u2019|last=Lee|first=Christina|date=March 13, 2018|website=Village Voice|access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref> Some of these time signals malfunctioned: they prevented trains from passing even if the operator had slowed down the train to the speed that was indicated, and so some operators slowed trains further in case a time signal forced trains to wait for longer than was indicated.<ref name=\":2\" /> This resulted in overcrowded trains, since fewer trains per hour were able to proceed on certain sections of track.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/nyregion/new-york-subway-system-failure-delays.html|title=How Politics and Bad Decisions Starved New York\u2019s Subways|last=Rosenthal|first=Brian M.|date=November 18, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 14, 2018|last2=Fitzsimmons|first2=Emma G.|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=LaForgia|first3=Michael}}</ref> By 2012, over 1,200 signals had been modified,<ref name=\":02\" /> and by 2018, that number had grown to 1,800.<ref name=\":2\" /> Exacerbating the signal problems, some of the oldest block signals in the system were 80 years old {{As of|2017|alt=as of 2017}}, and they also broke down frequently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-subway-relies-decades-old-outmoded-signals-switches-article-1.3184666|title=NYC subway relies on decades-old, outmoded signals and switches|last=Rivoli|first=Dan|date=May 22, 2017|website=NY Daily News|access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSubway trains were also forced to slow down due to work-zone rules.<ref name=\":2\" /> These rules were created by a task force, which was implemented in 2007 after a series of worker deaths.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/nyregion/02workers.html|title=Safety Violations Cited for Deaths in Subway Work|last=Neuman|first=William|date=August 2, 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 9, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Prior to 2007, even if one track was out of service, trains on adjacent tracks could operate at normal speeds. Under the new rules, if a track was directly adjacent to a track in a work-zone, trains on the adjacent track also had to slow down to 10 miles per hour or less. As a result, the proportion of delays caused by track work increased by 10% between 2013 and 2014, even though there were roughly the same number of track work in both years.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Bus problems ===\n\nA corresponding bus crisis was not covered as heavily in the media.

The least reliable route, the [[2 (New York City Subway service)|2]] train, reached its terminus on-schedule only 32% of the time. The subway's 65% average on-time performance was the lowest among all major cities' transit systems, ranking behind the Hong Kong [[MTR]] (100%), [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] (99%), San Francisco's [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] (86%), and [[Mexico City Metro]] (71%).

During the time this study was conducted, the closest the line ever came to meeting its printed schedule was 88 out of 90 trains during the a.m. rush hour, and 83 out of 88 trains during the p.m. rush hour. Officials have often blamed overcrowding for the reasons why trains are canceled, and Chairman Lhota has stated that maintaining space between trains was more of a priority for him than meeting the schedules was.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/nyregion/new-yorks-subways-are-not-just-delayed-some-trains-dont-run-at-all.html|title=New York\u2019s Subways Are Not Just Delayed.

Signal timers were added across the system since the fatal [[1995 Williamsburg Bridge subway crash]], so that trains would be spaced further apart, thereby increasing safety. Some timers were installed in places where extra train spacing was unnecessary, increasing delays and reducing capacity. In addition, some timers had stopped functioning properly, forcing train operators to operate more slowly to ensure that their train did not activate the [[train stop|automatic braking system]] if they passed the signals at too high a speed. As part of Byford's plan, New York City Transit would ensure that signal timers are being cleaned and are functioning. In fall 2018, two new initiatives would begin on selected lines to reduce delays. The first initiative would ensure that train crews will be at the terminal to allow their train to leave on time, while the second would add countdown clocks for train operators so they can maintain speeds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-metro-andy-byford-signals-delays-20180720-story.html#|title=Byford vows to speed up trains, cutting 10,000 delays a month \u2013 NY Daily News|last=Rivoli|first=Dan|date=July 22, 2018|work=New York Daily News|access-date=July 23, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nUnder the ''Fast Forward'' report, New York City Transit would conduct a one-year [[pilot program]] in which it would increase off-peak bus frequencies on the [[Q6 (New York City bus)|Q6]], [[Q69 and Q100 buses|Q69]], [[B17 (New York City bus)|B17]], [[B65 (New York City bus)|B65]], and [[S93 (New York City bus)|S93]] bus routes in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island.

Rittenband]]. Wells was not an attorney of record on the case but was an attorney for the State of California, which was a party to the case. Thus, the communication with Wells was a one-sided external communication, which is prohibited by ethics laws. Wells allegedly showed the judge a photo of Polanski at [[Oktoberfest]] 1977 with his arms around some ostensibly underage girls,<ref>http://time.com/2901712/roman-polanski-venus-in-fur/</ref> and convinced Rittenband that Polanski should not be released.

I expressly stated that I was aware that the court lacked authority to order Mr. Polanski deported directly or as a condition of probation. However, based on the facts before me, I believed that the safety and welfare of the citizens of California required that Mr. Polanski be kept out of circulation for more than 90 days. However, since Mr. Polanski is an alien who had pleaded guilty to an act of moral turpitude, I believe that the interests of the citizens of California could be adequately safeguarded by a shorter jail term if Mr. Polanski would thereafter absent himself from the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1500003.html|title=FindLaw's California Court of Appeal case and opinions.|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPolanski fled initially to London on 1 February 1978, where he maintained a residence.

Mr. Polanski's team may do so by arguing either that his crime does not qualify for extradition, because he was originally to have been sentenced to less than a year in prison, or that he has already effectively served his sentence, during a 42-day psychiatric evaluation.</blockquote>\n\nOn 21 October, after Swiss authorities had rejected Polanski's initial pleas to be released on bail pending the result of any extradition hearing, one of his lawyers, Georges Kiejman, floated the idea of a possible voluntary return to the United States in an interview with the radio station Europe 1: \"If this process drags on, it is not completely impossible that Roman Polanski could choose to go finally to explain himself in the United States where the arguments in his favor exist.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Doreen|last=Carvajal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/world/europe/22polanski.html?hp|title=Polanski May Choose to Face Charges|work=New York Times|date=21 October 2009|accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 November, the [[Federal Criminal Court of Switzerland]] accepted Roman Polanski's plea to be freed on US$4.5[[Million|M]] bail.

The Court reasoned that since Polanski had adequate legal remedies in 1977 and at present in 2009, there was no reason to carve out a special exception to the fugitive disentitlement doctrine. In arriving at that holding, the Court pointed out that neither side had realized that Polanski had the option of simply asking to be sentenced ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', which would result in a hearing where Polanski could directly attack the trial judge's alleged malfeasance in 1977. On 6 January 2010, upon [[Remand (court procedure)|remand]] to the [[superior court]], Polanski's lawyers followed the appellate court's advice and presented a notarized letter from Polanski in which he asked to be sentenced ''in absentia''. The court asked the parties to brief the issue and scheduled a hearing for 25 January.

Polanski was no longer subject to [[electronic tagging|house arrest]], or any monitoring by Swiss authorities. In a press conference held by Swiss Justice Minister [[Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf]], she stated that Polanski's extradition to the U.S. was rejected, in part, because U.S. officials failed to produce certain documents, specifically \"confidential testimony from a January 2010 hearing on Mr. Polanski's original sentencing agreement.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} According to Swiss officials, the records were required to determine if Polanski's 42-day court-ordered psychiatric evaluation at [[Chino State Prison]] constituted Polanski's whole sentence according to the now-deceased Judge Rittenband.

Rittenband]]. Wells was not an attorney of record on the case but was an attorney for the State of California, which was a party to the case. Thus, the communication with Wells was a one-sided external communication, which is prohibited by ethics laws. Wells allegedly showed the judge a photo of Polanski at [[Oktoberfest]] 1977 with his arms around some ostensibly underage girls,<ref>http://time.com/2901712/roman-polanski-venus-in-fur/</ref> and convinced Rittenband that Polanski should not be released.

I expressly stated that I was aware that the court lacked authority to order Mr. Polanski deported directly or as a condition of probation. However, based on the facts before me, I believed that the safety and welfare of the citizens of California required that Mr. Polanski be kept out of circulation for more than 90 days. However, since Mr. Polanski is an alien who had pleaded guilty to an act of moral turpitude, I believe that the interests of the citizens of California could be adequately safeguarded by a shorter jail term if Mr. Polanski would thereafter absent himself from the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1500003.html|title=FindLaw's California Court of Appeal case and opinions.|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPolanski fled initially to London on 1 February 1978, where he maintained a residence.

[[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]] was crowned a [[Tsar]] at the Declaration of Independence, mainly because of his military plans and for seeking options for unification of all lands in the [[Balkans]] region with an ethnic Bulgarian majority (lands that had been seized from Bulgaria and given to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]).\n\nThe state was almost constantly at war throughout its existence, lending to its nickname as \"the Balkan [[Prussia]]\". For several years Bulgaria mobilized an army of more than 1 million people from its population of about 5 million and in the 1910s it engaged in three wars&nbsp;\u2013 the [[First Balkan War|First]] and [[Second Balkan War|Second]] [[Balkan Wars]], and the [[First World War]]. Following the First World War, the Bulgarian army was disbanded and forbidden to exist by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], and all plans for national unification of the Bulgarian lands failed. Less than two decades later Bulgaria once again went to war for national unification as part of the [[Second World War]], and once again found itself on the losing side, until it switched sides to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1944. In 1946, the monarchy was abolished, its final [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar]] was sent into exile and the Kingdom was replaced by the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]].\n\n==Formation==\n{{main|Bulgarian Declaration of Independence}}\n[[File:Tzar Ferdinand at proclamation of Bulgarian-independence.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] at the proclamation of Bulgarian independence, 1908]] \nDespite the establishment of the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] (subject to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] suzerainty) in 1878, and the subsequent Bulgarian control over Eastern Rumelia after 1885, there was still a substantial Bulgarian population in the Balkans living under Ottoman rule, particularly in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. To complicate matters, [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] too made claims over parts of Macedonia, while Serbia, as a Slavic nation, also considered [[Macedonian Slavs]] as belonging to the Serbian nation. Thus began a three-sided struggle for control of these areas which lasted until [[World War I]]. In 1903, [[Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising|there was a Bulgarian insurrection]] in Ottoman Macedonia and war seemed likely. \n\nIn 1908, Ferdinand used the struggles among the Great Powers to declare Bulgaria an independent kingdom with himself as Tsar. He did this on 5 October (though celebrated on 22 September, as Bulgaria remained officially on the [[Julian Calendar]] until 1916) in the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|St Forty Martyrs Church]] in [[Veliko Tarnovo]]. Even before then, however, Bulgaria had only acknowledged the overlordship of the sultan in a formal way. Since 1878, Bulgaria had had its own constitution, flag and anthem, and conducted a separate foreign policy.\n\nFerdinand took the Bulgarian title \"Tsar\" in honor of the rulers of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|First]] and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Second]] Bulgarian Empires. However, while previous Bulgarian \"tsars\" were reckoned as emperors, Ferdinand and his successors were called \"king\" outside Bulgaria.  The [[Tarnovo Constitution]] was retained, with the word \"tsar\" replacing the word \"prince.\"\n\n==The Balkan Wars==\n{{main|Balkan Wars}}\n\nIn 1911, the Nationalist Prime Minister [[Ivan Evstratiev Geshov|Ivan Geshov]] set about forming an alliance with Greece and Serbia, and the three allies agreed to put aside their rivalries to plan a joint attack on the Ottomans.\n[[Image:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912\u20131913)]] \n[[Image:Bulgarians in 1912.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Areas where [[Bulgarians|ethnic Bulgarians]] were the majority of the population (in light green) in 1912]]\nIn February 1912 a secret treaty was signed between Bulgaria and Serbia, and in May 1912 a similar treaty was signed with Greece. [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] was also brought into the pact. The treaties provided for the partition of Macedonia and [[Thrace]] between the allies, although the lines of partition were left dangerously vague. After the Ottomans refused to implement reforms in the disputed areas, the [[First Balkan War]] broke out in October 1912. (See [[Balkan Wars]] for details.)\n\nThe allies had an astonishing success. The Bulgarian army inflicted several crushing defeats on the Ottoman forces and advanced threateningly against [[Constantinople]], while the Serbs and the Greeks took control of Macedonia. The Ottomans sued for peace in December. Negotiations broke down, and fighting resumed in February 1913. The Ottomans lost Adrianople to a Bulgarian task force. A second armistice followed in March, with the Ottomans losing all their European possessions west of the Midia-Enos line, not far from Istanbul. Bulgaria gained possession of most of Thrace, including Adrianople and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] port of Dedeagach (today [[Alexandroupoli]]). Bulgaria also gained a slice of Macedonia, north and east of [[Thessaloniki]], but only some small areas along her western borders.\n\nBulgaria sustained the heaviest casualties of any of the allies, and on this basis felt entitled to the largest share of the spoils. The Serbs in particular did not see things this way, and refused to vacate any of the territory they had seized in northern Macedonia (that is, the territory roughly corresponding to the modern [[Republic of North Macedonia]]), stating that the Bulgarian army had failed to accomplish its pre-war goals at Adrianople (i.e., failing to capture it without Serbian help) and that the pre-war agreements on the division of Macedonia had to be revised. Some circles in Bulgaria inclined toward going to war with Serbia and Greece on this issue. In June 1913 Serbia and Greece formed a new alliance, against Bulgaria. The Serbian Prime Minister, [[Nikola Pasic]], told Greece it could have Thrace if Greece helped Serbia keep Bulgaria out of Serbian part of Macedonia, and the Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] agreed. Seeing this as a violation of the pre-war agreements, and discreetly encouraged by [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria\u2013Hungary]], Tsar Ferdinand declared war on Serbia and Greece and the Bulgarian army attacked on June 29. The Serbian and the Greek forces were initially on the retreat on the western border, but they soon took the upper hand and forced Bulgaria into retreat. The fighting was very harsh, with many casualties, especially during the key [[Battle of Bregalnica]]. Soon Romania entered the war and attacked Bulgaria from the north. The Ottoman Empire also attacked from the south-east. The war was now definitely lost for Bulgaria, which had to abandon most of her claims of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, while the revived Ottomans retook Adrianople. [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] took possession of [[southern Dobruja]].\n\n== World War I ==\n{{main|Bulgaria during World War I}}{{see also|Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Macedonian Front}}\n[[File:WWI BG MAP.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The largest territorial extent of the Kingdom of Bulgaria during [[World War I]] (including occupied territories)]]\n[[File:Vladimir Vazov at Furka 20 February 1917.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Bulgarian officers on the Macedonian Front]]\nIn the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them.  Bulgaria, Romania and Greece were content to sit on the fence and observe the fortunes of war before deciding whether to declare their sympathies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Glenny |first=Misha |date=2012 |title=The Balkans |location=USA |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-670-85338-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/balkansnationali00mish }}</ref> \nThe government of [[Vasil Radoslavov]] aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria\u2013Hungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] and France) were all in possession of lands perceived in Bulgaria as Bulgarian.  Bulgaria, recuperating from the Balkan Wars, sat out the first year of [[World War I]], but when Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the Treaty of San Stefano, Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. The UK, [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] then declared war on Bulgaria.\n\nBulgaria, in alliance with Germany, Austria\u2013Hungary and the Ottomans, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, taking much of Macedonia (taking [[Skopje]] in October), advancing into Greek Macedonia, and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916. However, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered great economic hardship and also disliked fighting their fellow Orthodox Christians in alliance with the Muslim Ottomans. The Agrarian Party leader, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]], was imprisoned for his opposition to the war.  The [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution]] of February 1917 had a great effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities. In June Radoslavov's government resigned. Mutinies broke out in the army, Stamboliyski was released and a republic was proclaimed.\n\nIn September 1918, the French, Serbs, British, Italians and Greeks broke through on the Macedonian front and Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace. Stamboliyski favoured democratic reforms, not a revolution. In order to head off the revolutionaries, he persuaded Ferdinand to abdicate in favour of his son [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]]. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline to Greece and part of its Macedonian territory to the new state of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], and had to give Dobruja back to the [[Kingdom of Romania]] (see also [[Dobruja]], [[Western Outlands]], [[Western Thrace]]). [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1920|Elections in March 1920]] gave the Agrarians a large majority, and Stamboliyski formed Bulgaria's first genuinely democratic government.\n\n==The interwar years==\n\n[[File:BASA-3K-7-342-28-Boris III of Bulgaria.jpeg|left|thumb|250px|[[Boris III of Bulgaria]], who reigned from 1918 to 1943]]\n\n====Political history====\n\n[[File:Map of Bulgaria after Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Sein\u0435-en.svg|right|thumb|250px|Territorial changes after the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]]]\n\nAlthough it had not lost large amounts of territory, the nation had again struggled hard for nothing. The lost territories, especially the Dobroujea and Macedonia, were considered integral parts of Bulgaria and the pressure to retake them became an ultimately fatal obsession that drove the country into the arms of Nazi Germany. However, unlike the other defeated Eastern European state, Hungary, Bulgaria continued with essentially the same government as before.\n\nStamboliyski faced huge social problems in what was still a poor country, inhabited mostly by peasant smallholders. Bulgaria was saddled with huge war reparations to Yugoslavia and Romania, and had to deal with the problem of refugees as pro-Bulgarian Macedonians had to leave the Yugoslav Macedonia. Nevertheless, Stamboliyski was able to carry through many social reforms, although opposition from the Tsar, the landlords and the officers of the much-reduced but still influential army was powerful. Another bitter enemy was the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (VMRO), which favoured a war to regain Macedonia for Bulgaria. Faced with this array of enemies, Stamboliyski allied himself with the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] and opened relations with the [[Soviet Union]].\n[[File:StamboliskiEnLaConferenciaDeG\u00e9nova1922-2.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|[[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]]]]\nThe Bulgarian government had the same handicap as most constitutional monarchies, which was not drawing a clear line between what powers were granted to the king and what were granted to Parliament. The 1879 constitution was intended to put power in the hands of the latter, but still allowed a clever enough monarch to gain control of the machinery of government. Such was the case with the wily Tsar Ferdinand, who however had been forced to abdicate after the back-to-back losses of the Balkan Wars and World War I. His son Boris then succeeded him to the throne, but the young king could not replace the power his father had built through decades of intrigue. As such, Parliament came to dominate after Boris appointed Alexander Stamboliyski as prime minister. Stamboliyski's Agrarian Party soon dominated Parliament with over half the seats. The rest of the seats were taken by the Bulgarian Communist Party, which was the country's second largest political party and the only other one of any significance (there were a dozen or so minor parties, but they had no representation in Parliament or any real significance). The Agrarian Party chiefly represented peasants, and especially those who were disgruntled with the government in Sofia since Ferdinand's reign saw extensive corruption and theft of money from the peasantry. Also while most of the lower classes in Bulgaria supported annexation of Macedonia, they were disgruntled about the heavy bloodshed incurred in two unsuccessful wars to retake it. Indeed, Stamboliyski actually spent the war years in jail due to his vociferous criticism of it. As for the BCP, it was mainly staffed by intelligentsia and urban professionals, but its chief constituents were the poorest peasants and other minorities. The AP by comparison represented better-off peasants. Under this climate, Stamboliyski hastily enacted a land reform in 1920, which was designed to break up some state properties, church lands, and the holdings of wealthier peasants. Predictably, it gave him widespread support and forced the BCP into an alliance with the AP mainly to gain a voice in Parliament.\n\nHowever, Stamboliyski was a convinced anti-communist and sought to create an international movement to combat Marxism. This was his so-called \"Green International\", a counter to the communist \"Red International\". He traveled to Eastern European capitals promoting his view of a peasant alliance. But trouble began when he tried to spread it in Yugoslavia, a country that had very similar conditions to Bulgaria (i.e. very little industry and a large communist presence). Stamboliyski was well-liked in Belgrade because of supporting a peaceful solution to the Macedonia problem. He also advocated uniting all the Slavic-speaking nations in Eastern Europe into one large Yugoslav confederation. But he got into trouble because of the militant IMRO faction at home. Many Macedonian leaders had lived in Sofia since the failed 1903 revolt against the Ottoman Empire, and now they were joined by others who fled the Yugoslavian government (which maintained as its official position that Macedonians were ethnic Serbs). Since Bulgaria had been forced to limit the size of its armed forces after World War I, IMRO chieftains gained control of much of the border area with Yugoslavia.\n\n[[File:Aleksandar Tsankov.png|left|thumb|150px|[[Aleksandar Tsankov]]]]\n\nIn March 1923, Stamboliyski signed an agreement with Yugoslavia recognizing the new border and agreeing to suppress IMRO. This triggered a nationalist reaction, and on [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1923|9 June there was a coup]] organized by the armed forces under General [[Ivan Valkov]]'s Military Union with support from the Tsar and other right wing elements of the Tsardom after the AP controlled 87% of Parliament in the elections that year. The Bulgarian government could only muster a handful of troops to resist, and even worse was a peasant mob with no guns rallied by Stamboliyski. Despite this, the streets of Sofia erupted in chaos and the hapless prime minister was lynched in addition to attacks on unarmed peasants. The whole affair seriously tarbrushed Bulgaria's international image. A right wing government under [[Aleksandar Tsankov]] took power, backed by the Tsar, the army and the VMRO, who waged a [[White Terror (Bulgaria)|White terror]] against the Agrarians and the Communists. The Communist leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]] fled to the Soviet Union. There was savage repression in 1925 following the second of two failed attempts on the Tsar's life in the [[St Nedelya Church assault|bomb attack on Sofia Cathedral]] (the first attempt took place in the mountain pass of Arabakonak). But in 1926 the Tsar persuaded Tsankov to resign and a more moderate government under [[Andrey Lyapchev]] took office. An amnesty was proclaimed, although the Communists remained banned. The Agrarians reorganised and won [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1931|elections in 1931]] under the leadership of [[Nikola Mushanov]].\n\n[[File:Georgi Kyoseivanov1.png|right|thumb|150px|[[Georgi Kyoseivanov]]]]\n\nJust when political stability had been restored, the full effects of the [[Great Depression]] hit Bulgaria, and social tensions rose again. In May 1934 there was [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1934|another coup]] by the military organization [[Zveno]], and an authoritarian regime headed by Colonel [[Kimon Georgiev]] was established. They dissolved all parties and trade unions and suppressed the IMRO. Their government introduced a corporatist economy, similar to that of Benito Mussolini's Italy. After participating in the Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1934, Zveno supporters declared their intention to immediately form an alliance with France and to seek the unification of Bulgaria into an Integral Yugoslavia.<ref>Khristo Angelov Khristov. ''Bulgaria, 1300 years''. Sofia, Bulgaria: Sofia Press, 1980. p. 192.</ref>\n\nIn April 1935 Boris III staged a counter-coup with the help of monarchist Zveno member General [[Pencho Zlatev]] and took power himself. The political process was controlled by the Tsar, but a form of parliamentary rule was re-introduced, without the restoration of the political parties, prime ministers were appointed by the monarch.<ref>\"[http://www.sofiaecho.com/balkans-and-world-war-1/p_31/ Balkans and World War I]\" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712083123/http://www.sofiaecho.com/balkans-and-world-war-1/p_31/ |date=12 July 2007 }} SofiaEcho.com</ref> With the rise of the \"King's government\" in 1935, Bulgaria entered an era of prosperity and astounding growth, which deservedly qualifies it as the Golden Age of the Third Bulgarian Kingdom.<ref>''King of Mercy'', by Pashanko Dimitroff, Great Britain, 1986</ref> It lasted nearly five years, governed by prime minister [[Georgi Kyoseivanov]]. Kyoseivanov's Premiership oversaw the trials of the instigators of the 1934 military coup and also concluded pacts with Yugoslavia and Greece as Nazi Germany undertook a policy of economic isolation of the Balkans. His government also oversaw a policy of rearmament after a [[Salonika Agreement|treaty]] concluded with Ioannis Metaxas overturned the military clauses of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine and the Treaty of Lausanne. Although the signing of the Salonika Agreement of 1938 restored good relations with Yugoslavia and Greece, the territorial issue continued to simmer.\n\n====Economy====\nInterwar Bulgaria was highly backwards from an economic standpoint. [[Heavy industry]] was almost nonexistent due to a lack of major natural resources, and whatever manufacturing did exist consisted almost exclusively of [[textile]]s and [[handicraft]]s. Even these required extensive tariff protection to survive. Some natural resources did exist, but bad internal communications made it impossible to exploit them and nearly all important manufactured implements were imported. Farm machinery and chemical fertilizers were nearly unheard of. Agricultural products were almost the only thing Bulgaria could export and after 1929 it became very hard to do this.\n\n[[File:BASA-2072K-1-320-7-Viticulture in Bulgaria.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Bulgarian peasant girl in the 1930s]]\n\nBulgarian agriculture was almost entirely one of small farmers and peasants. Plots were small and almost exclusively under 50 acres, but they were working intensively and even the tiniest 5-acre farms often produced crops for market sale. As elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Bulgarian peasants traditionally grew [[grain]]s for their landowners which after the war could not be effectively marketed due to competition from the United States and Western Europe. However, they were able to switch with little difficulty to garden crops and [[tobacco]] in contrast to other countries where the peasantry suffered harder due to continued reliance on [[corn]] and [[wheat]].\n\nWhile more successful than the rest of Eastern Europe, Bulgarian agriculture still suffered from the handicaps of backwards technology and especially rural overpopulation and scattered plots (due to the traditional practice of a peasant dividing his land equally among all surviving sons). And all agricultural exports were harmed by the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. On the other hand, an underdeveloped economy meant that Bulgaria had little trouble with debt and inflation. Just under half of industry was owned by foreign companies in contrast to the nearly 80% of Romanian industry.\n\n====Demographics====\nSince the population was 85% ethnic Bulgarians, there was relatively little social strife aside from the conflict between the haves and have-nots. Most inhabitants of Sofia maintained close ties to the countryside, but this did not prevent a rift between the peasants and urban class (i.e. Sofia versus everyone else), although some was the result of deliberate manipulation by politicians seeking to take advantage of traditional peasant distrust of the \"effeminate city slicker\". Mostly however, it was due to a quarrel between the rulers and the ruled. Around 14% of the population were Muslims, mostly Turks (i.e. the remnant of the landowning class), but also a handful of so-called \"[[Pomak]]s\" (ethnic Bulgarians who practiced Islam). The Muslim population was alienated from the dominant Orthodox Christians both due to religious and historical reasons. They neither pressed for minority rights nor tried to set up their own schools, and instead asked nothing more than to be left alone to mind their own business. The Bulgarian government obliged except for a great willingness to assist them in emigrating back to Turkey.\n\n[[File:Sof.University~1935.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Sofia University]] in 1935]]\n\nBy comparison to economics, Bulgaria's educational system was highly successful and less than half the population were illiterate. Eight years of schooling were required and over 80% of children attended. For the few special students who went past elementary school, the high schools were based on the German gymnasium. Competitive examinations were used to judge college applicants, and Bulgaria had a number of technical and specialized schools in addition to the University of Sofia. Many Bulgarian students also went abroad, primarily to Germany and Austria (educational ties with Russia ended in 1917). Overall, education reached more of the lower classes than anywhere else in Eastern Europe, but on the downside all too many students obtained degrees in the liberal arts and other abstract subjects and could not find work anywhere except in the government bureaucracy. Many of them gravitated towards the Bulgarian Communist Party.\n\n==World War II==\n{{main|Military history of Bulgaria during World War II}}\nThe government of the Kingdom of Bulgaria under Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov declared a position of neutrality upon the outbreak of World War II. Bulgaria was determined to observe it until the end of the war; but it hoped for bloodless territorial gains in order to recover the territories lost in the Second Balkan War and World War I, as well as gain other lands with a significant Bulgarian population occupied by neighboring countries. However, it was clear that the central geopolitical position of Bulgaria in the Balkans would inevitably lead to strong external pressure by both World War II factions. On 15 February 1940, following the resignation of Georgi Kyoseivanov, [[Bogdan Filov]] was appointed Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. On 7 September 1940, Bulgaria succeeded in negotiating the recovery of [[Southern Dobruja]] in the Axis-sponsored [[Treaty of Craiova]].\n\n[[File:KingdomOfBulgaria1941-1944.png|thumbnail|upright=1.5|Bulgaria during [[World War II]]]]\n[[File:BASA-3K-7-436-9-Photo of South Dobruja, 1940.JPG|left|thumb|Bulgarian troops entering [[Southern Dobruja]]]]\nOn 1 March 1941, Bulgaria formally signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], becoming an ally of [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Empire of Japan]], and the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. German troops entered the country in preparation for the German invasions of the [[Kingdom of Greece]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. When Yugoslavia and Greece were defeated, Bulgaria was allowed to occupy all of Greek Thrace and most of Macedonia. Bulgaria declared war on [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]], but resisted German pressure to declare war on the [[Soviet Union]], fearful of pro-Russian sentiment in the country.\n\nIn August 1943 Tsar Boris died suddenly after returning from Germany (possibly assassinated, although this has never been proved) and was succeeded by his six-year-old son [[Simeon II of Bulgaria|Simeon II]]. Power was held by a council of regents headed by the young Tsar's uncle, Prince Kirill. The new Prime Minister, [[Dobri Bozhilov]], was in most respects a German puppet.\n\nResistance to the Germans and the Bulgarian regime was widespread by 1943, co-ordinated mainly by the Communists. Together with the Agrarians, now led by [[Nikola Petkov]], the Social Democrats and even with many army officers they founded the [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]]. Partisans operated in the mountainous west and south. By 1944 it was obvious that Germany was losing the war and the regime began to look for a way out. Bozhilov resigned in May, and his successor [[Ivan Ivanov Bagryanov]] tried to arrange negotiations with the western Allies.\n\nMeanwhile, the capital Sofia was [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|bombed by Allied aircraft]] in late 1943 and early 1944, with raids on other major cities following later. But it was the Soviet army which was rapidly advancing towards Bulgaria. In August Bulgaria unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the war and asked the German troops to leave: Bulgarian troops were hastily withdrawn from Greece and Yugoslavia. In September the Soviets crossed the northern border. The government, desperate to avoid a Soviet occupation, declared war on Germany, but the Soviets could not be put off, and on September 8 they declared war on Bulgaria \u2013 which thus found itself for a few days at war with both Germany and the Soviet Union. On September 16, the Soviet army entered Sofia.\n\n==Communist coup==\nThe Fatherland Front took office in Sofia [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944|following a coup d'\u00e9tat]], setting up a broad coalition under the former ruler Kimon Georgiev and including the Social Democrats and the Agrarians. Under the terms of the peace settlement, Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but formally renounced all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory. 150,000 Bulgarians were expelled from Greek [[Thrace]]. The Communists deliberately took a minor role in the new government at first, but the Soviet representatives were the real power in the country. A Communist-controlled People's Militia was set up, which harassed and intimidated non-Communist parties.\n\nOn 1 February 1945, the new realities of power in Bulgaria were shown when [[Regent]] [[Prince Kiril of Bulgaria|Prince Kiril]], former Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], and hundreds of other officials of the old regime were arrested on charges of war crimes. By June, Kirill and the other Regents, twenty-two former ministers, and many others had been executed. In September 1946, the monarchy was abolished by [[Bulgarian republic referendum, 1946|plebiscite]], and young Tsar Simeon was sent into exile. The Communists now openly took power, with [[Vasil Kolarov]] becoming President and Dimitrov becoming Prime Minister. [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1946|Free elections promised for 1946]] were blatantly rigged and were boycotted by the opposition. The Agrarians refused to co-operate with the new regime, and in June 1947 their leader [[Nikola Petkov]] was arrested. Despite strong international protests he was executed in September. This marked the final establishment of a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Communist regime in Bulgaria]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]]\n*[[Boris III of Bulgaria]]\n*[[Simeon II of Bulgaria]]\n*[[Balkan Wars]]\n*[[History of Bulgaria]]\n*[[History of Bulgaria (1878\u20131946)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*Khristo Angelov Khristov.

[[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]] was crowned a [[Tsar]] at the Declaration of Independence, mainly because of his military plans and for seeking options for unification of all lands in the [[Balkans]] region with an ethnic Bulgarian majority (lands that had been seized from Bulgaria and given to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]).\n\nThe state was almost constantly at war throughout its existence, lending to its nickname as \"the Balkan [[Prussia]]\". For several years Bulgaria mobilized an army of more than 1 million people from its population of about 5 million and in the 1910s it engaged in three wars&nbsp;\u2013 the [[First Balkan War|First]] and [[Second Balkan War|Second]] [[Balkan Wars]], and the [[First World War]]. Following the First World War, the Bulgarian army was disbanded and forbidden to exist by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], and all plans for national unification of the Bulgarian lands failed. Less than two decades later Bulgaria once again went to war for national unification as part of the [[Second World War]], and once again found itself on the losing side, until it switched sides to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1944. In 1946, the monarchy was abolished, its final [[List of Bulgarian monarchs|Tsar]] was sent into exile and the Kingdom was replaced by the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]].\n\n==Formation==\n{{main|Bulgarian Declaration of Independence}}\n[[File:Tzar Ferdinand at proclamation of Bulgarian-independence.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]] at the proclamation of Bulgarian independence, 1908]] \nDespite the establishment of the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] (subject to [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] suzerainty) in 1878, and the subsequent Bulgarian control over Eastern Rumelia after 1885, there was still a substantial Bulgarian population in the Balkans living under Ottoman rule, particularly in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. To complicate matters, [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] too made claims over parts of Macedonia, while Serbia, as a Slavic nation, also considered [[Macedonian Slavs]] as belonging to the Serbian nation. Thus began a three-sided struggle for control of these areas which lasted until [[World War I]]. In 1903, [[Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising|there was a Bulgarian insurrection]] in Ottoman Macedonia and war seemed likely. \n\nIn 1908, Ferdinand used the struggles among the Great Powers to declare Bulgaria an independent kingdom with himself as Tsar. He did this on 5 October (though celebrated on 22 September, as Bulgaria remained officially on the [[Julian Calendar]] until 1916) in the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|St Forty Martyrs Church]] in [[Veliko Tarnovo]]. Even before then, however, Bulgaria had only acknowledged the overlordship of the sultan in a formal way. Since 1878, Bulgaria had had its own constitution, flag and anthem, and conducted a separate foreign policy.\n\nFerdinand took the Bulgarian title \"Tsar\" in honor of the rulers of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|First]] and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Second]] Bulgarian Empires. However, while previous Bulgarian \"tsars\" were reckoned as emperors, Ferdinand and his successors were called \"king\" outside Bulgaria.  The [[Tarnovo Constitution]] was retained, with the word \"tsar\" replacing the word \"prince.\"\n\n==The Balkan Wars==\n{{main|Balkan Wars}}\n\nIn 1911, the Nationalist Prime Minister [[Ivan Evstratiev Geshov|Ivan Geshov]] set about forming an alliance with Greece and Serbia, and the three allies agreed to put aside their rivalries to plan a joint attack on the Ottomans.\n[[Image:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912\u20131913)]] \n[[Image:Bulgarians in 1912.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Areas where [[Bulgarians|ethnic Bulgarians]] were the majority of the population (in light green) in 1912]]\nIn February 1912 a secret treaty was signed between Bulgaria and Serbia, and in May 1912 a similar treaty was signed with Greece. [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] was also brought into the pact. The treaties provided for the partition of Macedonia and [[Thrace]] between the allies, although the lines of partition were left dangerously vague. After the Ottomans refused to implement reforms in the disputed areas, the [[First Balkan War]] broke out in October 1912. (See [[Balkan Wars]] for details.)\n\nThe allies had an astonishing success. The Bulgarian army inflicted several crushing defeats on the Ottoman forces and advanced threateningly against [[Constantinople]], while the Serbs and the Greeks took control of Macedonia. The Ottomans sued for peace in December. Negotiations broke down, and fighting resumed in February 1913. The Ottomans lost Adrianople to a Bulgarian task force. A second armistice followed in March, with the Ottomans losing all their European possessions west of the Midia-Enos line, not far from Istanbul. Bulgaria gained possession of most of Thrace, including Adrianople and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] port of Dedeagach (today [[Alexandroupoli]]). Bulgaria also gained a slice of Macedonia, north and east of [[Thessaloniki]], but only some small areas along her western borders.\n\nBulgaria sustained the heaviest casualties of any of the allies, and on this basis felt entitled to the largest share of the spoils. The Serbs in particular did not see things this way, and refused to vacate any of the territory they had seized in northern Macedonia (that is, the territory roughly corresponding to the modern [[Republic of North Macedonia]]), stating that the Bulgarian army had failed to accomplish its pre-war goals at Adrianople (i.e., failing to capture it without Serbian help) and that the pre-war agreements on the division of Macedonia had to be revised. Some circles in Bulgaria inclined toward going to war with Serbia and Greece on this issue. In June 1913 Serbia and Greece formed a new alliance, against Bulgaria. The Serbian Prime Minister, [[Nikola Pasic]], told Greece it could have Thrace if Greece helped Serbia keep Bulgaria out of Serbian part of Macedonia, and the Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] agreed. Seeing this as a violation of the pre-war agreements, and discreetly encouraged by [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria\u2013Hungary]], Tsar Ferdinand declared war on Serbia and Greece and the Bulgarian army attacked on June 29. The Serbian and the Greek forces were initially on the retreat on the western border, but they soon took the upper hand and forced Bulgaria into retreat. The fighting was very harsh, with many casualties, especially during the key [[Battle of Bregalnica]]. Soon Romania entered the war and attacked Bulgaria from the north. The Ottoman Empire also attacked from the south-east. The war was now definitely lost for Bulgaria, which had to abandon most of her claims of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, while the revived Ottomans retook Adrianople. [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] took possession of [[southern Dobruja]].\n\n== World War I ==\n{{main|Bulgaria during World War I}}{{see also|Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Macedonian Front}}\n[[File:WWI BG MAP.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The largest territorial extent of the Kingdom of Bulgaria during [[World War I]] (including occupied territories)]]\n[[File:Vladimir Vazov at Furka 20 February 1917.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Bulgarian officers on the Macedonian Front]]\nIn the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them.  Bulgaria, Romania and Greece were content to sit on the fence and observe the fortunes of war before deciding whether to declare their sympathies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Glenny |first=Misha |date=2012 |title=The Balkans |location=USA |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-670-85338-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/balkansnationali00mish }}</ref> \nThe government of [[Vasil Radoslavov]] aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria\u2013Hungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] and France) were all in possession of lands perceived in Bulgaria as Bulgarian.  Bulgaria, recuperating from the Balkan Wars, sat out the first year of [[World War I]], but when Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the Treaty of San Stefano, Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. The UK, [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] then declared war on Bulgaria.\n\nBulgaria, in alliance with Germany, Austria\u2013Hungary and the Ottomans, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, taking much of Macedonia (taking [[Skopje]] in October), advancing into Greek Macedonia, and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916. However, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered great economic hardship and also disliked fighting their fellow Orthodox Christians in alliance with the Muslim Ottomans. The Agrarian Party leader, [[Aleksandur Stamboliyski]], was imprisoned for his opposition to the war.  The [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution]] of February 1917 had a great effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities. In June Radoslavov's government resigned. Mutinies broke out in the army, Stamboliyski was released and a republic was proclaimed.\n\nIn September 1918, the French, Serbs, British, Italians and Greeks broke through on the Macedonian front and Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace. Stamboliyski favoured democratic reforms, not a revolution. In order to head off the revolutionaries, he persuaded Ferdinand to abdicate in favour of his son [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]]. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline to Greece and part of its Macedonian territory to the new state of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], and had to give Dobruja back to the [[Kingdom of Romania]] (see also [[Dobruja]], [[Western Outlands]], [[Western Thrace]]). [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1920|Elections in March 1920]] gave the Agrarians a large majority, and Stamboliyski formed Bulgaria's first genuinely democratic government.\n\n==The interwar years==\n\n[[File:BASA-3K-7-342-28-Boris III of Bulgaria.jpeg|left|thumb|250px|[[Boris III of Bulgaria]], who reigned from 1918 to 1943]]\n\n====Political history====\n\n[[File:Map of Bulgaria after Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Sein\u0435-en.svg|right|thumb|250px|Territorial changes after the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]]]]\n\nAlthough it had not lost large amounts of territory, the nation had again struggled hard for nothing. The lost territories, especially the Dobroujea and Macedonia, were considered integral parts of Bulgaria and the pressure to retake them became an ultimately fatal obsession that drove the country into the arms of Nazi Germany. However, unlike the other defeated Eastern European state, Hungary, Bulgaria continued with essentially the same government as before.\n\nStamboliyski faced huge social problems in what was still a poor country, inhabited mostly by peasant smallholders. Bulgaria was saddled with huge war reparations to Yugoslavia and Romania, and had to deal with the problem of refugees as pro-Bulgarian Macedonians had to leave the Yugoslav Macedonia. Nevertheless, Stamboliyski was able to carry through many social reforms, although opposition from the Tsar, the landlords and the officers of the much-reduced but still influential army was powerful. Another bitter enemy was the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (VMRO), which favoured a war to regain Macedonia for Bulgaria. Faced with this array of enemies, Stamboliyski allied himself with the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] and opened relations with the [[Soviet Union]].\n[[File:StamboliskiEnLaConferenciaDeG\u00e9nova1922-2.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|[[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]]]]\nThe Bulgarian government had the same handicap as most constitutional monarchies, which was not drawing a clear line between what powers were granted to the king and what were granted to Parliament. The 1879 constitution was intended to put power in the hands of the latter, but still allowed a clever enough monarch to gain control of the machinery of government. Such was the case with the wily Tsar Ferdinand, who however had been forced to abdicate after the back-to-back losses of the Balkan Wars and World War I. His son Boris then succeeded him to the throne, but the young king could not replace the power his father had built through decades of intrigue. As such, Parliament came to dominate after Boris appointed Alexander Stamboliyski as prime minister. Stamboliyski's Agrarian Party soon dominated Parliament with over half the seats. The rest of the seats were taken by the Bulgarian Communist Party, which was the country's second largest political party and the only other one of any significance (there were a dozen or so minor parties, but they had no representation in Parliament or any real significance). The Agrarian Party chiefly represented peasants, and especially those who were disgruntled with the government in Sofia since Ferdinand's reign saw extensive corruption and theft of money from the peasantry. Also while most of the lower classes in Bulgaria supported annexation of Macedonia, they were disgruntled about the heavy bloodshed incurred in two unsuccessful wars to retake it. Indeed, Stamboliyski actually spent the war years in jail due to his vociferous criticism of it. As for the BCP, it was mainly staffed by intelligentsia and urban professionals, but its chief constituents were the poorest peasants and other minorities. The AP by comparison represented better-off peasants. Under this climate, Stamboliyski hastily enacted a land reform in 1920, which was designed to break up some state properties, church lands, and the holdings of wealthier peasants. Predictably, it gave him widespread support and forced the BCP into an alliance with the AP mainly to gain a voice in Parliament.\n\nHowever, Stamboliyski was a convinced anti-communist and sought to create an international movement to combat Marxism. This was his so-called \"Green International\", a counter to the communist \"Red International\". He traveled to Eastern European capitals promoting his view of a peasant alliance. But trouble began when he tried to spread it in Yugoslavia, a country that had very similar conditions to Bulgaria (i.e. very little industry and a large communist presence). Stamboliyski was well-liked in Belgrade because of supporting a peaceful solution to the Macedonia problem. He also advocated uniting all the Slavic-speaking nations in Eastern Europe into one large Yugoslav confederation. But he got into trouble because of the militant IMRO faction at home. Many Macedonian leaders had lived in Sofia since the failed 1903 revolt against the Ottoman Empire, and now they were joined by others who fled the Yugoslavian government (which maintained as its official position that Macedonians were ethnic Serbs). Since Bulgaria had been forced to limit the size of its armed forces after World War I, IMRO chieftains gained control of much of the border area with Yugoslavia.\n\n[[File:Aleksandar Tsankov.png|left|thumb|150px|[[Aleksandar Tsankov]]]]\n\nIn March 1923, Stamboliyski signed an agreement with Yugoslavia recognizing the new border and agreeing to suppress IMRO. This triggered a nationalist reaction, and on [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1923|9 June there was a coup]] organized by the armed forces under General [[Ivan Valkov]]'s Military Union with support from the Tsar and other right wing elements of the Tsardom after the AP controlled 87% of Parliament in the elections that year. The Bulgarian government could only muster a handful of troops to resist, and even worse was a peasant mob with no guns rallied by Stamboliyski. Despite this, the streets of Sofia erupted in chaos and the hapless prime minister was lynched in addition to attacks on unarmed peasants. The whole affair seriously tarbrushed Bulgaria's international image. A right wing government under [[Aleksandar Tsankov]] took power, backed by the Tsar, the army and the VMRO, who waged a [[White Terror (Bulgaria)|White terror]] against the Agrarians and the Communists. The Communist leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]] fled to the Soviet Union. There was savage repression in 1925 following the second of two failed attempts on the Tsar's life in the [[St Nedelya Church assault|bomb attack on Sofia Cathedral]] (the first attempt took place in the mountain pass of Arabakonak). But in 1926 the Tsar persuaded Tsankov to resign and a more moderate government under [[Andrey Lyapchev]] took office. An amnesty was proclaimed, although the Communists remained banned. The Agrarians reorganised and won [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1931|elections in 1931]] under the leadership of [[Nikola Mushanov]].\n\n[[File:Georgi Kyoseivanov1.png|right|thumb|150px|[[Georgi Kyoseivanov]]]]\n\nJust when political stability had been restored, the full effects of the [[Great Depression]] hit Bulgaria, and social tensions rose again. In May 1934 there was [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1934|another coup]] by the military organization [[Zveno]], and an authoritarian regime headed by Colonel [[Kimon Georgiev]] was established. They dissolved all parties and trade unions and suppressed the IMRO. Their government introduced a corporatist economy, similar to that of Benito Mussolini's Italy. After participating in the Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1934, Zveno supporters declared their intention to immediately form an alliance with France and to seek the unification of Bulgaria into an Integral Yugoslavia.<ref>Khristo Angelov Khristov. ''Bulgaria, 1300 years''. Sofia, Bulgaria: Sofia Press, 1980. p. 192.</ref>\n\nIn April 1935 Boris III staged a counter-coup with the help of monarchist Zveno member General [[Pencho Zlatev]] and took power himself. The political process was controlled by the Tsar, but a form of parliamentary rule was re-introduced, without the restoration of the political parties, prime ministers were appointed by the monarch.<ref>\"[http://www.sofiaecho.com/balkans-and-world-war-1/p_31/ Balkans and World War I]\" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712083123/http://www.sofiaecho.com/balkans-and-world-war-1/p_31/ |date=12 July 2007 }} SofiaEcho.com</ref> With the rise of the \"King's government\" in 1935, Bulgaria entered an era of prosperity and astounding growth, which deservedly qualifies it as the Golden Age of the Third Bulgarian Kingdom.<ref>''King of Mercy'', by Pashanko Dimitroff, Great Britain, 1986</ref> It lasted nearly five years, governed by prime minister [[Georgi Kyoseivanov]]. Kyoseivanov's Premiership oversaw the trials of the instigators of the 1934 military coup and also concluded pacts with Yugoslavia and Greece as Nazi Germany undertook a policy of economic isolation of the Balkans. His government also oversaw a policy of rearmament after a [[Salonika Agreement|treaty]] concluded with Ioannis Metaxas overturned the military clauses of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine and the Treaty of Lausanne. Although the signing of the Salonika Agreement of 1938 restored good relations with Yugoslavia and Greece, the territorial issue continued to simmer.\n\n====Economy====\nInterwar Bulgaria was highly backwards from an economic standpoint. [[Heavy industry]] was almost nonexistent due to a lack of major natural resources, and whatever manufacturing did exist consisted almost exclusively of [[textile]]s and [[handicraft]]s. Even these required extensive tariff protection to survive. Some natural resources did exist, but bad internal communications made it impossible to exploit them and nearly all important manufactured implements were imported. Farm machinery and chemical fertilizers were nearly unheard of. Agricultural products were almost the only thing Bulgaria could export and after 1929 it became very hard to do this.\n\n[[File:BASA-2072K-1-320-7-Viticulture in Bulgaria.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Bulgarian peasant girl in the 1930s]]\n\nBulgarian agriculture was almost entirely one of small farmers and peasants. Plots were small and almost exclusively under 50 acres, but they were working intensively and even the tiniest 5-acre farms often produced crops for market sale. As elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Bulgarian peasants traditionally grew [[grain]]s for their landowners which after the war could not be effectively marketed due to competition from the United States and Western Europe. However, they were able to switch with little difficulty to garden crops and [[tobacco]] in contrast to other countries where the peasantry suffered harder due to continued reliance on [[corn]] and [[wheat]].\n\nWhile more successful than the rest of Eastern Europe, Bulgarian agriculture still suffered from the handicaps of backwards technology and especially rural overpopulation and scattered plots (due to the traditional practice of a peasant dividing his land equally among all surviving sons). And all agricultural exports were harmed by the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. On the other hand, an underdeveloped economy meant that Bulgaria had little trouble with debt and inflation. Just under half of industry was owned by foreign companies in contrast to the nearly 80% of Romanian industry.\n\n====Demographics====\nSince the population was 85% ethnic Bulgarians, there was relatively little social strife aside from the conflict between the haves and have-nots. Most inhabitants of Sofia maintained close ties to the countryside, but this did not prevent a rift between the peasants and urban class (i.e. Sofia versus everyone else), although some was the result of deliberate manipulation by politicians seeking to take advantage of traditional peasant distrust of the \"effeminate city slicker\". Mostly however, it was due to a quarrel between the rulers and the ruled. Around 14% of the population were Muslims, mostly Turks (i.e. the remnant of the landowning class), but also a handful of so-called \"[[Pomak]]s\" (ethnic Bulgarians who practiced Islam). The Muslim population was alienated from the dominant Orthodox Christians both due to religious and historical reasons. They neither pressed for minority rights nor tried to set up their own schools, and instead asked nothing more than to be left alone to mind their own business. The Bulgarian government obliged except for a great willingness to assist them in emigrating back to Turkey.\n\n[[File:Sof.University~1935.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Sofia University]] in 1935]]\n\nBy comparison to economics, Bulgaria's educational system was highly successful and less than half the population were illiterate. Eight years of schooling were required and over 80% of children attended. For the few special students who went past elementary school, the high schools were based on the German gymnasium. Competitive examinations were used to judge college applicants, and Bulgaria had a number of technical and specialized schools in addition to the University of Sofia. Many Bulgarian students also went abroad, primarily to Germany and Austria (educational ties with Russia ended in 1917). Overall, education reached more of the lower classes than anywhere else in Eastern Europe, but on the downside all too many students obtained degrees in the liberal arts and other abstract subjects and could not find work anywhere except in the government bureaucracy. Many of them gravitated towards the Bulgarian Communist Party.\n\n==World War II==\n{{main|Military history of Bulgaria during World War II}}\nThe government of the Kingdom of Bulgaria under Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov declared a position of neutrality upon the outbreak of World War II. Bulgaria was determined to observe it until the end of the war; but it hoped for bloodless territorial gains in order to recover the territories lost in the Second Balkan War and World War I, as well as gain other lands with a significant Bulgarian population occupied by neighboring countries. However, it was clear that the central geopolitical position of Bulgaria in the Balkans would inevitably lead to strong external pressure by both World War II factions. On 15 February 1940, following the resignation of Georgi Kyoseivanov, [[Bogdan Filov]] was appointed Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. On 7 September 1940, Bulgaria succeeded in negotiating the recovery of [[Southern Dobruja]] in the Axis-sponsored [[Treaty of Craiova]].\n\n[[File:KingdomOfBulgaria1941-1944.png|thumbnail|upright=1.5|Bulgaria during [[World War II]]]]\n[[File:BASA-3K-7-436-9-Photo of South Dobruja, 1940.JPG|left|thumb|Bulgarian troops entering [[Southern Dobruja]]]]\nOn 1 March 1941, Bulgaria formally signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], becoming an ally of [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Empire of Japan]], and the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. German troops entered the country in preparation for the German invasions of the [[Kingdom of Greece]] and the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. When Yugoslavia and Greece were defeated, Bulgaria was allowed to occupy all of Greek Thrace and most of Macedonia. Bulgaria declared war on [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]], but resisted German pressure to declare war on the [[Soviet Union]], fearful of pro-Russian sentiment in the country.\n\nIn August 1943 Tsar Boris died suddenly after returning from Germany (possibly assassinated, although this has never been proved) and was succeeded by his six-year-old son [[Simeon II of Bulgaria|Simeon II]]. Power was held by a council of regents headed by the young Tsar's uncle, Prince Kirill. The new Prime Minister, [[Dobri Bozhilov]], was in most respects a German puppet.\n\nResistance to the Germans and the Bulgarian regime was widespread by 1943, co-ordinated mainly by the Communists. Together with the Agrarians, now led by [[Nikola Petkov]], the Social Democrats and even with many army officers they founded the [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]]. Partisans operated in the mountainous west and south. By 1944 it was obvious that Germany was losing the war and the regime began to look for a way out. Bozhilov resigned in May, and his successor [[Ivan Ivanov Bagryanov]] tried to arrange negotiations with the western Allies.\n\nMeanwhile, the capital Sofia was [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|bombed by Allied aircraft]] in late 1943 and early 1944, with raids on other major cities following later. But it was the Soviet army which was rapidly advancing towards Bulgaria. In August Bulgaria unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the war and asked the German troops to leave: Bulgarian troops were hastily withdrawn from Greece and Yugoslavia. In September the Soviets crossed the northern border. The government, desperate to avoid a Soviet occupation, declared war on Germany, but the Soviets could not be put off, and on September 8 they declared war on Bulgaria \u2013 which thus found itself for a few days at war with both Germany and the Soviet Union. On September 16, the Soviet army entered Sofia.\n\n==Communist coup==\nThe Fatherland Front took office in Sofia [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944|following a coup d'\u00e9tat]], setting up a broad coalition under the former ruler Kimon Georgiev and including the Social Democrats and the Agrarians. Under the terms of the peace settlement, Bulgaria was allowed to keep [[Southern Dobruja]], but formally renounced all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory. 150,000 Bulgarians were expelled from Greek [[Thrace]]. The Communists deliberately took a minor role in the new government at first, but the Soviet representatives were the real power in the country. A Communist-controlled People's Militia was set up, which harassed and intimidated non-Communist parties.\n\nOn 1 February 1945, the new realities of power in Bulgaria were shown when [[Regent]] [[Prince Kiril of Bulgaria|Prince Kiril]], former Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], and hundreds of other officials of the old regime were arrested on charges of war crimes. By June, Kirill and the other Regents, twenty-two former ministers, and many others had been executed. In September 1946, the monarchy was abolished by [[Bulgarian republic referendum, 1946|plebiscite]], and young Tsar Simeon was sent into exile. The Communists now openly took power, with [[Vasil Kolarov]] becoming President and Dimitrov becoming Prime Minister. [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1946|Free elections promised for 1946]] were blatantly rigged and were boycotted by the opposition. The Agrarians refused to co-operate with the new regime, and in June 1947 their leader [[Nikola Petkov]] was arrested. Despite strong international protests he was executed in September. This marked the final establishment of a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Communist regime in Bulgaria]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria]]\n*[[Boris III of Bulgaria]]\n*[[Simeon II of Bulgaria]]\n*[[Balkan Wars]]\n*[[History of Bulgaria]]\n*[[History of Bulgaria (1878\u20131946)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*Khristo Angelov Khristov.
