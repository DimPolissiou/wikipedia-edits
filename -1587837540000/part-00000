The goals were:\n*Portability through a flexible and extensible [[API]] for the applications. This avoids bloat in the applications by only getting what they use.{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n*Portability in cross-platform and in backends{{Clarify|date=January 2009}}\n*Security in the sense of requiring as few privileges as possible\n\nThe GGI framework is implemented by a set of [[Porting|portable]] [[user-space]] [[Library (computing)|libraries]], with an array of different backends or targets (e.g. [[Linux framebuffer]], [[X11]], [[quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]], [[DirectX]]), of which the two most fundamental are LibGII (for input-handling) and LibGGI (for graphical output). All other packages add features to these core libraries, and so depend on one or both of them.\n\nSome targets talk to other targets. These are called pseudo targets. Pseudo targets can be combined and work like a pipeline.\n\nOne example:\ndisplay-palemu, for example, emulates palette mode on truecolor modes. This allows users to run applications in palette mode even on machines where no palette mode would be available otherwise. display-tile splits large virtual display into many smaller pieces. You can spread them on multiple monitors or even forward them over a network.\n\n==History==\nAndreas Beck and Steffen Seeger founded '''The GGI Project''' in 1994 after some experimental precursors that were called \"scrdrv\".\n\nDevelopment of scrdrv was motivated by the problems caused by coexisting but not very well cooperating graphics environments (mainly [[X Window System|X]] and [[SVGAlib]]) under the Linux operating system at this time which frequently lead to lockups requiring a reboot. The first scrdrv design was heavily influenced by the graphics subsystem of the DJ DOS extender and some concepts from the [[Scanner Access Now Easy|SANE]] project. The basic problem that scrdrv solved was that it provided a kernel mode driver that knew enough of the video hardware to set up modes, thus allowing to get into a sane state even from a messed-up or crashed graphics application.\n\nThe first official version appeared in 1995. About 1996, GGI 1.0 was released under the LGPL license. GGI only consisted of the core lib named ''libggi''. It included input handling, a set of 2d graphic primitives and some userspace drivers for graphic boards along with a Linux kernel patch with the userspace interface for the drivers. The patch was known as KGI, the Kernel Graphics Interface.\n\nIn 1997, GGI went into a complete re-design. Many new ideas and a decision from Linux made GGI to what it became in GGI 2.0 released in August 2001 under the MIT release.\n\nIn 1998, there was a big flame war on the linux kernel mailing list about getting KGI into the kernel. [[Linus Torvalds]] explained his concerns<ref>[http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=89089527200744&w=2 marc.info]</ref> about GGI stating, \"I think that [[X Window System|X]] is good enough\" and expressing concern regarding the overall direction of GGI.\n\nDuring this time, another design idea called ''EvStack'' also added to the flamewar. EvStack was a pretty much complete redesign of the input and output subsystem that allowed for events (thus the \"Ev\") to flow through a \"Stack\" of modules that can be configured to manipulate them. EvStack is a very powerful concept, allowing e.g. to have two keyboards attached to the same machine, one operating a text console on one graphics adapter and one operating a graphics console on the other (as was demonstrated on the Linux-Kongre\u00df \u00b497<ref>[http://www.linux-kongress.org/1997/seegerbeck.html linux-kongress.org]</ref>) and even allows for having different keyboard layouts on different virtual consoles or attaching keyboards via network. However this came at the price of a huge patch to the input subsystem which did not seem acceptable. The modern Linux input event system allows programs (e.g. Xorg) to receive keyboard events other than through the console keyboard, allowing [[multiseat configuration|multiseat]] operation.\n\nA set of talks about GGI, KGI and EvStack were given at LinuxExpo 98.\n\nFor GGI 2.0, KGI was split off and became its own project named ''The KGI Project''. GGI 2.0 consisted of a set of libraries. During the 2.0 beta phase in late 1998 the license of the libraries was changed from LGPL to a MIT-style license. Much work was also done on the buildsystem to support more operating systems. It worked on FreeBSD, code for OpenBSD, NetBSD and even MS-Windows were there as well as some support for more hardware platforms.\n\nInput handling was moved into a library called libgii. Generic GGI code was in libgg, a sublib within libgii. The core graphic library, libggi, has a lightweight set of graphic primitives that was common enough to write any kind of graphic application, while higherlevel API went into other libraries on top of libggi. These were called GGI extensions. libggi support a set of targets, most of them were Linux specific: fbdev, X, aa, vcsa, [[terminfo]] and some pseudo targets such as tile, multi, palemu and trueemu. The GGI extensions featured higherlevel API. libggiwmh provides functionality for windowed only targets, at that time this was only X. libggimisc provided some basic stuff like vga splitline.\n\nGGI 2.0.2 was released in December 2002. The most user visible change was from the scratch re-designed X backend.  Another noticeable change was the huge documentation improvement.  Last, but not least, the release cycles changed. From this release on, there was a development and a stable tree.  The stable tree is open for bugfixes only, the development tree got the name, following the BSD scheme, -current.\n\nNovember 2004, the last bugfix from the GGI 2.0.x stable tree was released in favour for a new GGI 2.1.x stable tree.\n\nGGI 2.1.x runs on many Operating Systems: [[GNU Hurd]], [[Linux]], [[*BSD]], [[System V]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[MS Windows]]. Support for more hardware platforms has been added. [[NetBSD]] even created a binary package for NetBSD/Vax! A new GGI library on top of libgii called libgiigic has been added. It allows to combine user actions with events at run time.\n\nGGI 2.2 was released in December 2005. The target auto detection has been reworked and was no longer linux centric. GGI replaced its own integer datatypes with ANSI C99 types for more portability. A target for Quartz has been added. Mac OS X users no longer depend on X11 but still can use the X11 backend. The most user visible change, however, was the support for static linked in targets.\n\nLatest release is GGI 2.2.2, a bugfix release in the GGI 2.2.x stable series.  It was released in January 2007.\n\n==Status as of 2006==\nThe GGI Project was moving onward to the GGI 3.0 release.{{when|date=February 2017}} libgii had been re-designed. The input handling had been replaced with a reactor event model, which is more flexible than using select() on a [[file descriptor]]. This also simplified the input-drivers in general, particularly for those who don't use file descriptors such as input-quartz.\nlibgg had been moved out into a separate library.\n\nlibggi had merged some targets into one sublib, multi with tile and mono text with palemu. libggi also had gotten a new [[VNC]] target,\nwhich allowed to run any application as a VNC server.\n\nIn GGI 3.0, the extension mechanism had been re-designed from scratch to simplify interactions between the extensions and the core libs. This required a little API change.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]]\n* [[DirectFB]]\n* [[Graphical Kernel System]]\n* [[Linux framebuffer]]\n* [[SVGALib]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*[http://www.ggi.ps.pl/docs/faq.html The GGI Project Frequently Asked Questions List]\n*[https://lwn.net/1998/0226/#kernel Linux Weekly News - February 26, 1998, section: Kernel]\n*[http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=89089527200744&w=2 GGI Project Unhappy On Linux]\n*Christopher Browne's Web Pages: [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017132732/http://cbbrowne.com/info/ggi.html The X Window System, 15.

The GGI extensions featured higherlevel API. libggiwmh provides functionality for windowed only targets, at that time this was only X. libggimisc provided some basic stuff like vga splitline.\n\nGGI 2.0.2 was released in December 2002. The most user visible change was from the scratch re-designed X backend.  Another noticeable change was the huge documentation improvement.  Last, but not least, the release cycles changed. From this release on, there was a development and a stable tree.  The stable tree is open for bugfixes only, the development tree got the name, following the BSD scheme, -current.\n\nNovember 2004, the last bugfix from the GGI 2.0.x stable tree was released in favour for a new GGI 2.1.x stable tree.\n\nGGI 2.1.x runs on many Operating Systems: [[GNU Hurd]], [[Linux]], [[*BSD]], [[System V]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[MS Windows]]. Support for more hardware platforms has been added. [[NetBSD]] even created a binary package for NetBSD/Vax! A new GGI library on top of libgii called libgiigic has been added. It allows to combine user actions with events at run time.\n\nGGI 2.2 was released in December 2005. The target auto detection has been reworked and was no longer linux centric. GGI replaced its own integer datatypes with ANSI C99 types for more portability. A target for Quartz has been added. Mac OS X users no longer depend on X11 but still can use the X11 backend. The most user visible change, however, was the support for static linked in targets.\n\nLatest release is GGI 2.2.2, a bugfix release in the GGI 2.2.x stable series.  It was released in January 2007.\n\n==Status as of 2006==\nThe GGI Project was moving onward to the GGI 3.0 release.{{when|date=February 2017}} libgii had been re-designed. The input handling had been replaced with a reactor event model, which is more flexible than using select() on a [[file descriptor]]. This also simplified the input-drivers in general, particularly for those who don't use file descriptors such as input-quartz.\nlibgg had been moved out into a separate library.\n\nlibggi had merged some targets into one sublib, multi with tile and mono text with palemu. libggi also had gotten a new [[VNC]] target,\nwhich allowed to run any application as a VNC server.\n\nIn GGI 3.0, the extension mechanism had been re-designed from scratch to simplify interactions between the extensions and the core libs. This required a little API change.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]]\n* [[DirectFB]]\n* [[Graphical Kernel System]]\n* [[Linux framebuffer]]\n* [[SVGALib]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n*[http://www.ggi.ps.pl/docs/faq.html The GGI Project Frequently Asked Questions List]\n*[https://lwn.net/1998/0226/#kernel Linux Weekly News - February 26, 1998, section: Kernel]\n*[http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=89089527200744&w=2 GGI Project Unhappy On Linux]\n*Christopher Browne's Web Pages: [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017132732/http://cbbrowne.com/info/ggi.html The X Window System, 15.

The book was first published in 1555 and has rarely been out of print since his death.\n\nNostradamus's family was originally [[Judaism|Jewish]], but had converted to [[Catholic Christianity]] before he was born. He studied at the [[University of Avignon]], but was forced to leave after just over a year when the university closed due to an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. He worked as an [[apothecary]] for several years before entering the [[University of Montpellier]], hoping to earn a [[doctorate]], but was almost immediately [[Expulsion (education)|expelled]] after his work as an apothecary (a manual trade forbidden by university statutes) was discovered. He first married in 1531, but his wife and two children died in 1534 during another plague outbreak. He fought alongside doctors against the plague before remarrying to Anne Ponsarde, with whom he had six children. He wrote an [[almanac]] for 1550 and, as a result of its success, continued writing them for future years as he began working as an [[Astrology|astrologer]] for various wealthy patrons. [[Catherine de' Medici]] became one of his foremost supporters. His ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'', published in 1555, relied heavily on historical and literary [[precedent]], and initially received mixed reception. He suffered from severe [[gout]] toward the end of his life, which eventually developed into [[edema]]. He died on 2 July 1566. Many popular authors have retold [[apocrypha]]l legends about his lifej.\n\nIn the years since the publication of his ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'', Nostradamus has attracted many supporters, who, along with much of the [[Mass media|popular press]], credit him with having accurately predicted many major world events.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010}}{{sfn|Benazra|1990}} Most academic sources reject the notion that Nostradamus had any genuine supernatural prophetic abilities and maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate).{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=150-2}} These academics argue that Nostradamus's predictions are characteristically vague, meaning they could be applied to virtually anything, and are useless for determining whether their author had any real prophetic powers. They also point out that English translations of his quatrains are almost always of extremely poor quality, based on later manuscripts, produced by authors with little knowledge of [[Middle French|sixteenth-century French]], and often deliberately mistranslated to make the prophecies fit whatever events the translator believed they were supposed to have predicted. What does this mean?\n\n==Life==\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Nostradamus birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Nostradamus's claimed birthplace before its recent renovation, [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]]]]\n[[File:Nostradamus-plaque.gif|thumb|Municipal plaque on the claimed birthplace of Nostradamus in St-R\u00e9my, France, describing him as an 'astrologer' and giving his birth-date as 14 December 1503 (Julian Calendar)]]\n\nNostradamus was born on either 14 or 21 December 1503 in [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]], [[Provence]], France,{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} where his claimed birthplace still exists, and baptized Michel.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} He was one of at least nine children of notary Jaume (or Jacques) de Nostredame and Reyni\u00e8re, granddaughter of Pierre de Saint-R\u00e9my who worked as a [[physician]] in Saint-R\u00e9my.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} Jaume's family had originally been [[Jewish people|Jewish]], but his father, Cresquas, a grain and money dealer based in [[Avignon]], had converted to Catholicism around 1459\u201360, taking the Christian name \"Pierre\" and the surname \"Nostredame\" (Our Lady), the saint on whose day his conversion was solemnised.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} The earliest ancestor who can be identified on the paternal side is Astruge of [[Carcassonne]], who died about 1420. Michel's known siblings included Delphine, Jean (c. 1507\u201377), Pierre, Hector, Louis, Bertrand, Jean II (born 1522) and Antoine (born 1523).{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=143\u2013146}}{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=32\u201351}}{{sfn|Lemesurier|1999|p=24\u201325}}\nLittle else is known about his childhood, although there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. R\u00e9my<ref name = \"ref4\">De Chavigny, J.

After little more than a year (when he would have studied the regular [[trivium (education)|trivium]] of [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] rather than the later [[quadrivium]] of [[geometry]], [[arithmetic]], music, and [[astronomy]]/[[astrology]]), he was forced to leave Avignon when the university closed its doors during an outbreak of the plague. After leaving Avignon, Nostradamus, by his own account, traveled the countryside for eight years from 1521 researching herbal remedies. In 1529, after some years as an [[apothecary]], he entered the [[University of Montpellier]] to study for a doctorate in medicine. He was expelled shortly afterwards by the student ''procurator'', [[Guillaume Rondelet]], when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a \"manual trade\" expressly banned by the university statutes, and had been slandering doctors.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=48\u201349}} The expulsion document, ''BIU Montpellier, Register S 2 folio 87'', still exists in the faculty library.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=2}} However, some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him \"Doctor\". After his expulsion, Nostradamus continued working, presumably still as an [[apothecary]], and became famous for creating a \"rose pill\" that purportedly protected against the plague.<ref name = \"ref6\">Nostradamus, Michel, ''Traite des fardemens et des confitures'', 1555, 1556, 1557</ref>\n\n===Marriage and healing work===\n[[File:Nostradamuss house at Salon-de-Provence.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Nostradamus's house at [[Salon-de-Provence]], as reconstructed after the [[1909 Provence earthquake]]]]\n\nIn 1531 Nostradamus was invited by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Jules-C\u00e9sar Scaliger]], a leading [[Polymath|Renaissance scholar]], to come to [[Agen]].{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=60\u201391}} There he married a woman of uncertain name (possibly Henriette d'Encausse), who bore him two children.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=61}} In 1534 his wife and children died, presumably from the plague. After their deaths, he continued to travel, passing through France and possibly [[Italy]].{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=62\u201371}}\n\nOn his return in 1545, he assisted the prominent physician [[Louis Serre (physician)|Louis Serre]] in his fight against a major plague outbreak in [[Marseille]], and then tackled further outbreaks of disease on his own in [[Salon-de-Provence]] and in the regional capital, [[Aix-en-Provence]]. Finally, in 1547, he settled in Salon-de-Provence in the house which exists today, where he married a rich widow named Anne Ponsarde, with whom he had six children\u2014three daughters and three sons.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=110\u2013133}}  Between 1556 and 1567 he and his wife acquired a one-thirteenth share in a huge canal project, organised by [[Adam de Craponne]], to create the [[Canal de Craponne]] to irrigate the largely waterless [[Salon-de-Provence]] and the nearby D\u00e9sert de la [[Crau]] from the river [[Durance]].{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=130, 132, 369}}\n\n===Occultism===\nAfter another visit to Italy, Nostradamus began to move away from medicine and toward the \"occult\", although evidence suggests that he remained a Catholic and was opposed to the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]].{{sfn|''Nostradamus for Dummies'' 2005, pp. 66\u201368}} But it seems he could have dabbled in [[horoscopes]], [[necromancy]], [[scrying]], and good luck [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]] such as the hawthorn rod.{{sfn|''Lives of the Necromancers'' 1835, pp. 251\u2013252}}{{sfn|''Nostradamus: The Good News'' 2007, pp. 17\u201318}} Following popular trends, he wrote an [[almanac]] for 1550, for the first time in print Latinising his name to Nostradamus. He was so encouraged by the almanac's success that he decided to write one or more annually. Taken together, they are known to have contained at least 6,338 prophecies,{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=23\u201325}}{{sfn|Chevignard|1999}} as well as at least eleven annual calendars, all of them starting on 1 January and not, as is sometimes supposed, in March. It was mainly in response to the almanacs that the nobility and other prominent persons from far away soon started asking for horoscopes and \"psychic\" advice from him, though he generally expected his clients to supply the birth charts on which these would be based, rather than calculating them himself as a professional astrologer would have done. When obliged to attempt this himself on the basis of the published tables of the day, he frequently made errors and failed to adjust the figures for his clients' place or time of birth.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=59\u201364}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=326\u2013399}}{{efn|Refer to the analysis of these charts by Brind'Amour, 1993, and compare Gruber's comprehensive critique of Nostradamus's horoscope for Crown Prince Rudolph Maximilian.}}{{sfn|Gruber|2003}}\n\nHe then began his project of writing a book of one thousand mainly French quatrains, which constitute the largely undated prophecies for which he is most famous today. Feeling vulnerable to opposition on religious grounds,{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=125}} however, he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using \"[[Virgil]]ianised\" syntax, word games and a mixture of other languages such as [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], Italian, [[Latin]], and [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]].{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=99\u2013100}} For technical reasons connected with their publication in three installments (the publisher of the third and last installment seems to have been unwilling to start it in the middle of a \"Century,\" or book of 100 verses), the last fifty-eight quatrains of the seventh \"Century\" have not survived in any extant edition.\n\n[[File:Nostradamus CI 1.jpg|thumb|Century I, Quatrain 1 in the 1555 Lyon Bonhomme edition]]\n\nThe quatrains, published in a book titled ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'' (The Prophecies), received a mixed reaction when they were published. Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil, a fake, or insane, while many of the elite evidently thought otherwise. [[Catherine de' Medici]], wife of King [[Henry II of France]], was one of Nostradamus's greatest admirers. After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain them and to draw up horoscopes for her children. At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded,{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=83}} but by the time of his death in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King [[Charles IX of France]].\n\nSome accounts of Nostradamus's life state that he was afraid of being persecuted for [[Christian heresy|heresy]] by the [[Inquisition]], but neither [[prophecy]] nor [[astrology]] fell in this bracket, and he would have been in danger only if he had practised [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for anti-Catholic views.<ref name=\"Wilson2014\">{{cite book|author=Ian Wilson|title=Nostradamus: The Man Behind the Prophecies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqvcAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT62|date=1 April 2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-6737-6|pages=62 ff}}</ref> His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=124}}\n\n===Final years and death===\n[[File:Nostradamus epitaph.jpg|thumb|Nostradamus's current tomb in the [[Salon-de-Provence#Coll.C3.A9giale Saint Laurent|Coll\u00e9giale Saint-Laurent]] in [[Salon-de-Provence]] in the south of France, into which his scattered remains were transferred after 1789.]]\n\n[[File:140609-Salon-Nostradamus.jpg|thumb|Nostradamus statue in Salon-de-Provence]]\nBy 1566, Nostradamus's [[gout]], which had plagued him painfully for many years and made movement very difficult, turned into [[edema]]. In late June he summoned his lawyer to draw up an extensive will bequeathing his property plus 3,444 crowns (around US$300,000 today), minus a few debts, to his wife pending her remarriage, in trust for her sons pending their twenty-fifth birthdays and her daughters pending their marriages.

Nixon Medical History Library of The [[University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio]].]]\n\nIn ''The Prophecies'' Nostradamus compiled his collection of major, long-term predictions. The first installment was published in 1555 and contained 353 [[quatrain]]s. The third edition, with three hundred new quatrains, was reportedly printed in 1558, but now survives as only part of the omnibus edition that was published after his death in 1568. This version contains one unrhymed and 941 rhymed [[quatrain]]s, grouped into nine sets of 100 and one of 42, called \"Centuries\".\n\nGiven printing practices at the time (which included type-setting from dictation), no two editions turned out to be identical, and it is relatively rare to find even two copies that are exactly the same. Certainly there is no warrant for assuming\u2014as would-be \"code-breakers\" are prone to do\u2014that either the spellings or the punctuation of any edition are Nostradamus's originals.{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=14, 435}}\n\nThe ''Almanacs'', by far the most popular of his works,{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=22-33}} were published annually from 1550 until his death. He often published two or three in a year, entitled either ''Almanachs'' (detailed predictions), ''Prognostications'' or ''Presages'' (more generalised predictions).\n\nNostradamus was not only a diviner, but a professional healer. It is known that he wrote at least two books on medical science. One was an extremely free translation (or rather a paraphrase) of ''The Protreptic'' of [[Galen]] (''Paraphrase de C. GALIEN, sus l'Exhortation de Menodote aux estudes des bonnes Artz, mesmement Medicine''), and in his so-called ''[[Trait\u00e9 des fardemens]]'' (basically a medical cookbook containing, once again, materials borrowed mainly from others), he included a description of the methods he used to treat the plague, including bloodletting, none of which apparently worked.{{sfn|Nostradamus|1555/6/7|p=11}} The same book also describes the preparation of cosmetics.\n\nA manuscript normally known as the ''[[Orus Apollo]]'' also exists in the [[Lyon]] municipal library, where upwards of 2,000 original documents relating to Nostradamus are stored under the aegis of Michel Chomarat. It is a purported translation of an ancient Greek work on [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] based on later Latin versions, all of them unfortunately ignorant of the true meanings of the ancient Egyptian script, which was not correctly deciphered until [[Champollion]] in the 19th century.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=183}}\n\nSince his death, only the ''Prophecies'' have continued to be popular, but in this case they have been quite extraordinarily so. Over two hundred editions of them have appeared in that time, together with over 2,000 commentaries. Their [[Nostradamus in popular culture|persistence in popular culture]] seems to be partly because their vagueness and lack of dating make it easy to quote them selectively after every major dramatic event and retrospectively claim them as \"hits\".{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144-5}}\n\n==Origins of ''The Prophecies''==\n[[File:Dr. Garenci\u00e8res, the Translator of Nostradamus (Robert Chambers, p.12, 1832) - Copy.jpg|thumb|[[Theophilus de Garenci\u00e8res]], the first English translator of the ''Prophecies''<ref name=Chambers>{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=Robert|title=The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar, Including Anecdote, Biography, & History, Curiosities of Literature and Oddities of Human Life and Character, Volume 2|date=1832|publisher=W. & R.

Hence the many predictions involving ancient figures such as [[Sulla]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Nero]], and others, as well as his descriptions of \"battles in the clouds\" and \"frogs falling from the sky\".{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003b|loc=''passim''}} Astrology itself is mentioned only twice in Nostradamus's ''Preface'' and 41 times in the ''Centuries'' themselves, but more frequently in his dedicatory ''[[Letter to King Henry II]]''. In the last quatrain of his sixth ''century'' he specifically attacks astrologers.\n\nHis historical sources include easily identifiable passages from [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]]' ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Plutarch]] and other classical historians, as well as from medieval chroniclers such as [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] and [[Jean Froissart]]. Many of his astrological references are taken almost word for word from [[Richard Roussat]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Livre de l'estat et mutations des temps}}'' of 1549\u201350.\n\nOne of his major prophetic sources was evidently the ''[[Mirabilis Liber]]'' of 1522, which contained a range of prophecies by [[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius|Pseudo-Methodius]], the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]], [[Joachim of Fiore]], [[Savonarola]] and others (his ''Preface'' contains 24 biblical quotations, all but two in the order used by Savonarola). This book had enjoyed considerable success in the 1520s, when it went through half a dozen editions, but did not sustain its influence, perhaps owing to its mostly Latin text, Gothic script and many difficult abbreviations. Nostradamus was one of the first to re-paraphrase these prophecies in French, which may explain why they are credited to him. Modern views of plagiarism did not apply in the 16th century; authors frequently copied and paraphrased passages without acknowledgement, especially from the classics. The latest research suggests that he may in fact have used [[bibliomancy]] for this\u2014randomly selecting a book of history or prophecy and taking his cue from whatever page it happened to fall open at.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010}}\n\nFurther material was gleaned from the ''De honesta disciplina'' of 1504 by [[Petrus Crinitus]],{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=100, 233\u2013235}} which included extracts from [[Michael Psellos]]'s ''De daemonibus'', and the ''[[De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum]]'' (''Concerning the mysteries of Egypt''), a book on [[Chaldea]]n and [[Assyria]]n magic by [[Iamblichus]], a 4th-century [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonist]]. Latin versions of both had recently been published in [[Lyon]], and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) in his first two verses, the first of which is appended to this article. While it is true that Nostradamus claimed in 1555 to have burned all of the occult works in his library, no one can say exactly what books were destroyed in this fire.\n\nOnly in the 17th century did people start to notice his reliance on earlier, mainly classical sources.{{efn|Anonymous letters to the ''Mercure de France'' in August and November 1724 drew specific public attention to the fact (Anonyme) Lettre critique sur la personne et sur les \u00e9crits de Michel Nostradamus, Mercure de France, ao\u00fbt et novembre 1724.}}\n\nNostradamus's reliance on historical precedent is reflected in the fact that he explicitly rejected the label \"prophet\" (i.e. a person having prophetic powers of his own) on several occasions:{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=109}}\n\n{{quote|Although, my son, I have used the word ''prophet'', I would not attribute to myself a title of such lofty sublimity.|''Preface to C\u00e9sar'', 1555<ref name=\"prefces\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26:preface-to-cesar&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |title=Preface to C\u00e9sar |publisher=Nostradamus-repository.org |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928090730/http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26:preface-to-cesar&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n{{quote|Not that I would attribute to myself either the name or the role of a prophet.|''Preface to C\u00e9sar'', 1555<ref name = \"prefces\"/>}}\n{{quote|[S]ome of [the prophets] predicted great and marvelous things to come: [though] for me, I in no way attribute to myself such a title here.|''Letter to King Henry II'', 1558<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27:letter-to-henri-ii&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |title=Letter to Henri II |publisher=Nostradamus-repository.org |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727130736/http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27:letter-to-henri-ii&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n{{quote|Not that I am foolish enough to claim to be a prophet.|Open letter to Privy Councillor (later Chancellor) Birague, 15 June 1566{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=109}}}}\n\n[[File:npix4.jpg|thumb|right|Detail from title-page of the original 1555 (Albi) edition of Nostradamus's ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'']]\n\nGiven this reliance on literary sources, it is unlikely that Nostradamus used any particular methods for entering a [[altered state of consciousness|trance state]], other than [[contemplation]], [[meditation]] and [[Incubation (ritual)|incubation]].{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=98}} His sole description of this process is contained in ''letter 41'' of his collected Latin correspondence.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=41, 225\u2013229}} The popular legend that he attempted the ancient methods of flame gazing, water gazing or both simultaneously is based on a naive reading of his first two verses, which merely liken his efforts to those of the [[Oracle of Delphi|Delphic]] and [[Didyma|Branchidic]] [[oracle]]s. The first of these is reproduced at the bottom of this article and the second can be seen by visiting the relevant facsimile site (see External Links).

Roberts]]' ''The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus'' of 1947, reprinted at least seven times during the next forty years, which contained both transcriptions and translations, with brief commentaries. This was followed in 1961 (reprinted in 1982) by Edgar Leoni's ''Nostradamus and His Prophecies''. After that came [[Erika Cheetham]]'s ''The Prophecies of Nostradamus'', incorporating a reprint of the posthumous 1568 edition, which was reprinted, revised and republished several times from 1973 onwards, latterly as ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus''. This served as the basis for the documentary ''[[The Man Who Saw Tomorrow]]'' and both did indeed mention possible generalised future attacks on New York (via [[nuclear weapon]]s), though not specifically on the World Trade Center or on any particular date.<ref>See, for example, Cheetham, Erika, ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus'', Futura, 1990, p.373</ref>\n\nA two-part translation of Jean-Charles de Fontbrune's ''Nostradamus: historien et proph\u00e8te'' was published in 1980, and John Hogue has published a number of books on Nostradamus from about 1987, including ''Nostradamus and the Millennium: Predictions of the Future'', ''Nostradamus: The Complete Prophecies'' (1999) and ''Nostradamus: A Life and Myth'' (2003). In 1992 one commentator who claimed to be able to contact Nostradamus under hypnosis even had him \"interpreting\" his own verse X.6 (a prediction specifically about floods in southern France around the city of N\u00eemes and people taking refuge in its ''collosse'', or Colosseum, a Roman amphitheatre now known as the ''Ar\u00e8nes'') as a prediction of an undated ''attack on the Pentagon'', despite the historical seer's clear statement in his dedicatory letter to King Henri II that his prophecies were about Europe, North Africa and part of Asia Minor.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=145|Phophecy Location Map=http://www.secret-vault.co.uk/nostradamus/locations.html}}\n\nWith the exception of Roberts, these books and their many popular imitators were almost unanimous not merely about Nostradamus's powers of prophecy but also in inventing intriguing aspects of his purported biography: that he had been a descendant of the Israelite tribe of [[Issachar]]; he had been educated by his grandfathers, who had both been physicians to the court of [[Rene I of Naples|Good King Ren\u00e9]] of [[Provence]]; he had attended [[Montpellier]] University in 1525 to gain his first degree; after returning there in 1529, he had successfully taken his medical doctorate; he had gone on to lecture in the Medical Faculty there, until his views became too unpopular; he had supported the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the universe; he had travelled to the Habsburg Netherlands, where he had composed prophecies at the abbey of Orval; in the course of his travels, he had performed a variety of prodigies, including identifying future Pope, [[Sixtus V]], who was then only a seminary monk. He is credited with having successfully cured the [[Bubonic plague|Plague]] at [[Aix-en-Provence]] and elsewhere; he had engaged in [[scrying]], using either a magic mirror or a bowl of water; he had been joined by his secretary Chavigny at Easter 1554; having published the first installment of his ''Proph\u00e9ties'', he had been summoned by Queen [[Catherine de' Medici]] to Paris in 1556 to discuss with her his prophecy at quatrain I.35 that her husband [[King Henri II]] would be killed in a duel; he had examined the royal children at [[Blois]]; he had bequeathed to his son a \"lost book\" of his own prophetic paintings;{{efn|Actually the 13th\u201314th century ''[[Vaticinia de Summis Pontificibus]]'' in a misascribed version sometimes referred to as the ''[[Vaticinia Nostradami]]''}} he had been buried standing up; and he had been found, when dug up at the French Revolution, to be wearing a medallion bearing the exact date of his disinterment.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=26\u201345}} This was first recorded by [[Samuel Pepys]] as early as 1667, long before the [[French Revolution]]. Pepys records in his celebrated [[Diary of Samuel Pepys|diary]] a legend that, before his death, Nostradamus made the townsfolk swear that his grave would never be disturbed; but that 60 years later his body was exhumed, whereupon a brass plaque was found on his chest correctly stating the date and time when his grave would be opened and cursing the exhumers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1667/02/03/|title=Sunday 3 February 1666/67|website=The Diary of Samuel Pepys|accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, [[Li Hongzhi]] claimed that the 1999 prophecy at X.72 was a prediction of the [[Persecution of Falun Gong|Chinese Falun Gong persecution]] which began in July 1999, leading to an increased interest in Nostradamus among [[Falun Gong]] members.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Manderson |first1=Lenore |last2=Smith |first2=Wendy |last3=Tomlinson |first3=Matt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YH_hg_zZQtEC&lpg=PA44&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Flows of Faith: Religious Reach and Community in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |page=44 |date=16 February 2012|isbn=9789400729322 }}</ref>\n\n===Scholarly rebuttal===\nFrom the 1980s onward, however, an academic reaction set in, especially in France. The publication in 1983 of Nostradamus's private correspondence{{sfn|Dup\u00e8be|1983}} and, during succeeding years, of the original editions of 1555 and 1557 discovered by Chomarat and Benazra, together with the unearthing of much original archival material{{sfn|Leroy|1993}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993}} revealed that much that was claimed about Nostradamus did not fit the documented facts.

Most of them had evidently been based on unsourced rumours relayed as fact by much later commentators, such as Jaubert (1656), Guynaud (1693) and Bareste (1840), on modern misunderstandings of the 16th-century French texts, or on pure invention. Even the often-advanced suggestion that quatrain I.35 had successfully prophesied King Henry II's death did not actually appear in print for the first time until 1614, 55 years after the event.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=28\u201330}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=267}}\n\nSkeptics such as [[James Randi]] suggest that his reputation as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as \"retroactive clairvoyance\" ([[postdiction]]). No Nostradamus quatrain is known to have been interpreted as predicting a specific event before it occurred, other than in vague, general terms that could equally apply to any number of other events.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=23}} This even applies to quatrains that contain specific dates, such as III.77, which predicts \"in 1727, in October, the king of Persia [shall be] captured by those of Egypt\"\u2014a prophecy that has, as ever, been interpreted retrospectively in the light of later events, in this case as though it presaged the known peace treaty between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Persia]] of that year;<ref>See, for example, Cheetham, Erika, ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus'', Futura, 1990, pp. 208\u2013209</ref> Egypt was also an important [[Egypt Eyalet|Ottoman territory]] at this time.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HxKs-NHRgUoC&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=nostradamus+1727+ottoman+empire#v=onepage&q=nostradamus%201727%20ottoman%20empire&f=false|title=Nostradamus and Prophecies of the Next Millennium|isbn=9788171820146|last1=Sharma|first1=A.

Even Leoni accepted on page 115 that he had never seen an original edition, and on earlier pages he indicated that much of his biographical material was unsourced.{{sfn|Leoni|1961|p=115}}\n\nNone of this research and criticism was originally known to most of the English-language commentators, by dint of the dates when they were writing and, to some extent, the language in which it was written.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=144\u2013148}} Hogue was in a position to take advantage of it, but it was only in 2003 that he accepted that some of his earlier biographical material had in fact been apocryphal. Meanwhile, some of the more recent sources listed (Lemesurier, Gruber, Wilson) have been particularly scathing about later attempts by some lesser-known authors and Internet enthusiasts to extract alleged hidden meanings from the texts, whether with the aid of anagrams, numerical codes, graphs or otherwise.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144\u2013148}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Nostradamus in popular culture}}\n\nThe prophecies retold and expanded by Nostradamus  figured largely in [[popular culture]] in the 20th and 21st centuries. As well as being the subject of hundreds of books (both fiction and nonfiction), Nostradamus's life has been depicted in several films and videos, and his life and writings continue to be a subject of media interest.\n\nThere have also been several well-known Internet [[hoax]]es, where quatrains in the style of Nostradamus have been circulated by e-mail as the real thing.

The book was first published in 1555 and has rarely been out of print since his death.\n\nNostradamus's family was originally [[Judaism|Jewish]], but had converted to [[Catholic Christianity]] before he was born. He studied at the [[University of Avignon]], but was forced to leave after just over a year when the university closed due to an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]]. He worked as an [[apothecary]] for several years before entering the [[University of Montpellier]], hoping to earn a [[doctorate]], but was almost immediately [[Expulsion (education)|expelled]] after his work as an apothecary (a manual trade forbidden by university statutes) was discovered. He first married in 1531, but his wife and two children died in 1534 during another plague outbreak. He fought alongside doctors against the plague before remarrying to Anne Ponsarde, with whom he had six children. He wrote an [[almanac]] for 1550 and, as a result of its success, continued writing them for future years as he began working as an [[Astrology|astrologer]] for various wealthy patrons. [[Catherine de' Medici]] became one of his foremost supporters. His ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'', published in 1555, relied heavily on historical and literary [[precedent]], and initially received mixed reception. He suffered from severe [[gout]] toward the end of his life, which eventually developed into [[edema]]. He died on 2 July 1566. Many popular authors have retold [[apocrypha]]l legends about his life.\n\nIn the years since the publication of his ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'', Nostradamus has attracted many supporters, who, along with much of the [[Mass media|popular press]], credit him with having accurately predicted many major world events.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010}}{{sfn|Benazra|1990}} Most academic sources reject the notion that Nostradamus had any genuine supernatural prophetic abilities and maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate).{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=150-2}} These academics argue that Nostradamus's predictions are characteristically vague, meaning they could be applied to virtually anything, and are useless for determining whether their author had any real prophetic powers. They also point out that English translations of his quatrains are almost always of extremely poor quality, based on later manuscripts, produced by authors with little knowledge of [[Middle French|sixteenth-century French]], and often deliberately mistranslated to make the prophecies fit whatever events the translator believed they were supposed to have predicted.\n\n==Life==\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Nostradamus birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Nostradamus's claimed birthplace before its recent renovation, [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]]]]\n[[File:Nostradamus-plaque.gif|thumb|Municipal plaque on the claimed birthplace of Nostradamus in St-R\u00e9my, France, describing him as an 'astrologer' and giving his birth-date as 14 December 1503 (Julian Calendar)]]\n\nNostradamus was born on either 14 or 21 December 1503 in [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence]], [[Provence]], France,{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} where his claimed birthplace still exists, and baptized Michel.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} He was one of at least nine children of notary Jaume (or Jacques) de Nostredame and Reyni\u00e8re, granddaughter of Pierre de Saint-R\u00e9my who worked as a [[physician]] in Saint-R\u00e9my.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} Jaume's family had originally been [[Jewish people|Jewish]], but his father, Cresquas, a grain and money dealer based in [[Avignon]], had converted to Catholicism around 1459\u201360, taking the Christian name \"Pierre\" and the surname \"Nostredame\" (Our Lady), the saint on whose day his conversion was solemnised.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=24}} The earliest ancestor who can be identified on the paternal side is Astruge of [[Carcassonne]], who died about 1420. Michel's known siblings included Delphine, Jean (c. 1507\u201377), Pierre, Hector, Louis, Bertrand, Jean II (born 1522) and Antoine (born 1523).{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=143\u2013146}}{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=32\u201351}}{{sfn|Lemesurier|1999|p=24\u201325}}\nLittle else is known about his childhood, although there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. R\u00e9my<ref name = \"ref4\">De Chavigny, J.

After little more than a year (when he would have studied the regular [[trivium (education)|trivium]] of [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] rather than the later [[quadrivium]] of [[geometry]], [[arithmetic]], music, and [[astronomy]]/[[astrology]]), he was forced to leave Avignon when the university closed its doors during an outbreak of the plague. After leaving Avignon, Nostradamus, by his own account, traveled the countryside for eight years from 1521 researching herbal remedies. In 1529, after some years as an [[apothecary]], he entered the [[University of Montpellier]] to study for a doctorate in medicine. He was expelled shortly afterwards by the student ''procurator'', [[Guillaume Rondelet]], when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a \"manual trade\" expressly banned by the university statutes, and had been slandering doctors.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=48\u201349}} The expulsion document, ''BIU Montpellier, Register S 2 folio 87'', still exists in the faculty library.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=2}} However, some of his publishers and correspondents would later call him \"Doctor\". After his expulsion, Nostradamus continued working, presumably still as an [[apothecary]], and became famous for creating a \"rose pill\" that purportedly protected against the plague.<ref name = \"ref6\">Nostradamus, Michel, ''Traite des fardemens et des confitures'', 1555, 1556, 1557</ref>\n\n===Marriage and healing work===\n[[File:Nostradamuss house at Salon-de-Provence.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Nostradamus's house at [[Salon-de-Provence]], as reconstructed after the [[1909 Provence earthquake]]]]\n\nIn 1531 Nostradamus was invited by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Jules-C\u00e9sar Scaliger]], a leading [[Polymath|Renaissance scholar]], to come to [[Agen]].{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=60\u201391}} There he married a woman of uncertain name (possibly Henriette d'Encausse), who bore him two children.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=61}} In 1534 his wife and children died, presumably from the plague. After their deaths, he continued to travel, passing through France and possibly [[Italy]].{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=62\u201371}}\n\nOn his return in 1545, he assisted the prominent physician [[Louis Serre (physician)|Louis Serre]] in his fight against a major plague outbreak in [[Marseille]], and then tackled further outbreaks of disease on his own in [[Salon-de-Provence]] and in the regional capital, [[Aix-en-Provence]]. Finally, in 1547, he settled in Salon-de-Provence in the house which exists today, where he married a rich widow named Anne Ponsarde, with whom he had six children\u2014three daughters and three sons.{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=110\u2013133}}  Between 1556 and 1567 he and his wife acquired a one-thirteenth share in a huge canal project, organised by [[Adam de Craponne]], to create the [[Canal de Craponne]] to irrigate the largely waterless [[Salon-de-Provence]] and the nearby D\u00e9sert de la [[Crau]] from the river [[Durance]].{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=130, 132, 369}}\n\n===Occultism===\nAfter another visit to Italy, Nostradamus began to move away from medicine and toward the \"occult\", although evidence suggests that he remained a Catholic and was opposed to the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]].{{sfn|''Nostradamus for Dummies'' 2005, pp. 66\u201368}} But it seems he could have dabbled in [[horoscopes]], [[necromancy]], [[scrying]], and good luck [[Spell (paranormal)|charms]] such as the hawthorn rod.{{sfn|''Lives of the Necromancers'' 1835, pp. 251\u2013252}}{{sfn|''Nostradamus: The Good News'' 2007, pp. 17\u201318}} Following popular trends, he wrote an [[almanac]] for 1550, for the first time in print Latinising his name to Nostradamus. He was so encouraged by the almanac's success that he decided to write one or more annually. Taken together, they are known to have contained at least 6,338 prophecies,{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=23\u201325}}{{sfn|Chevignard|1999}} as well as at least eleven annual calendars, all of them starting on 1 January and not, as is sometimes supposed, in March. It was mainly in response to the almanacs that the nobility and other prominent persons from far away soon started asking for horoscopes and \"psychic\" advice from him, though he generally expected his clients to supply the birth charts on which these would be based, rather than calculating them himself as a professional astrologer would have done. When obliged to attempt this himself on the basis of the published tables of the day, he frequently made errors and failed to adjust the figures for his clients' place or time of birth.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=59\u201364}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=326\u2013399}}{{efn|Refer to the analysis of these charts by Brind'Amour, 1993, and compare Gruber's comprehensive critique of Nostradamus's horoscope for Crown Prince Rudolph Maximilian.}}{{sfn|Gruber|2003}}\n\nHe then began his project of writing a book of one thousand mainly French quatrains, which constitute the largely undated prophecies for which he is most famous today. Feeling vulnerable to opposition on religious grounds,{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=125}} however, he devised a method of obscuring his meaning by using \"[[Virgil]]ianised\" syntax, word games and a mixture of other languages such as [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], Italian, [[Latin]], and [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]].{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=99\u2013100}} For technical reasons connected with their publication in three installments (the publisher of the third and last installment seems to have been unwilling to start it in the middle of a \"Century,\" or book of 100 verses), the last fifty-eight quatrains of the seventh \"Century\" have not survived in any extant edition.\n\n[[File:Nostradamus CI 1.jpg|thumb|Century I, Quatrain 1 in the 1555 Lyon Bonhomme edition]]\n\nThe quatrains, published in a book titled ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'' (The Prophecies), received a mixed reaction when they were published. Some people thought Nostradamus was a servant of evil, a fake, or insane, while many of the elite evidently thought otherwise. [[Catherine de' Medici]], wife of King [[Henry II of France]], was one of Nostradamus's greatest admirers. After reading his almanacs for 1555, which hinted at unnamed threats to the royal family, she summoned him to Paris to explain them and to draw up horoscopes for her children. At the time, he feared that he would be beheaded,{{sfn|Leroy|1993|p=83}} but by the time of his death in 1566, Queen Catherine had made him Counselor and Physician-in-Ordinary to her son, the young King [[Charles IX of France]].\n\nSome accounts of Nostradamus's life state that he was afraid of being persecuted for [[Christian heresy|heresy]] by the [[Inquisition]], but neither [[prophecy]] nor [[astrology]] fell in this bracket, and he would have been in danger only if he had practised [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for anti-Catholic views.<ref name=\"Wilson2014\">{{cite book|author=Ian Wilson|title=Nostradamus: The Man Behind the Prophecies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqvcAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT62|date=1 April 2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-6737-6|pages=62 ff}}</ref> His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=124}}\n\n===Final years and death===\n[[File:Nostradamus epitaph.jpg|thumb|Nostradamus's current tomb in the [[Salon-de-Provence#Coll.C3.A9giale Saint Laurent|Coll\u00e9giale Saint-Laurent]] in [[Salon-de-Provence]] in the south of France, into which his scattered remains were transferred after 1789.]]\n\n[[File:140609-Salon-Nostradamus.jpg|thumb|Nostradamus statue in Salon-de-Provence]]\nBy 1566, Nostradamus's [[gout]], which had plagued him painfully for many years and made movement very difficult, turned into [[edema]]. In late June he summoned his lawyer to draw up an extensive will bequeathing his property plus 3,444 crowns (around US$300,000 today), minus a few debts, to his wife pending her remarriage, in trust for her sons pending their twenty-fifth birthdays and her daughters pending their marriages.

This version contains one unrhymed and 941 rhymed [[quatrain]]s, grouped into nine sets of 100 and one of 42, called \"Centuries\".\n\nGiven printing practices at the time (which included type-setting from dictation), no two editions turned out to be identical, and it is relatively rare to find even two copies that are exactly the same. Certainly there is no warrant for assuming\u2014as would-be \"code-breakers\" are prone to do\u2014that either the spellings or the punctuation of any edition are Nostradamus's originals.{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=14, 435}}\n\nThe ''Almanacs'', by far the most popular of his works,{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=22-33}} were published annually from 1550 until his death. He often published two or three in a year, entitled either ''Almanachs'' (detailed predictions), ''Prognostications'' or ''Presages'' (more generalised predictions).\n\nNostradamus was not only a diviner, but a professional healer. It is known that he wrote at least two books on medical science. One was an extremely free translation (or rather a paraphrase) of ''The Protreptic'' of [[Galen]] (''Paraphrase de C. GALIEN, sus l'Exhortation de Menodote aux estudes des bonnes Artz, mesmement Medicine''), and in his so-called ''[[Trait\u00e9 des fardemens]]'' (basically a medical cookbook containing, once again, materials borrowed mainly from others), he included a description of the methods he used to treat the plague, including bloodletting, none of which apparently worked.{{sfn|Nostradamus|1555/6/7|p=11}} The same book also describes the preparation of cosmetics.\n\nA manuscript normally known as the ''[[Orus Apollo]]'' also exists in the [[Lyon]] municipal library, where upwards of 2,000 original documents relating to Nostradamus are stored under the aegis of Michel Chomarat. It is a purported translation of an ancient Greek work on [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] based on later Latin versions, all of them unfortunately ignorant of the true meanings of the ancient Egyptian script, which was not correctly deciphered until [[Champollion]] in the 19th century.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=183}}\n\nSince his death, only the ''Prophecies'' have continued to be popular, but in this case they have been quite extraordinarily so. Over two hundred editions of them have appeared in that time, together with over 2,000 commentaries. Their [[Nostradamus in popular culture|persistence in popular culture]] seems to be partly because their vagueness and lack of dating make it easy to quote them selectively after every major dramatic event and retrospectively claim them as \"hits\".{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144-5}}\n\n==Origins of ''The Prophecies''==\n[[File:Dr. Garenci\u00e8res, the Translator of Nostradamus (Robert Chambers, p.12, 1832) - Copy.jpg|thumb|[[Theophilus de Garenci\u00e8res]], the first English translator of the ''Prophecies''<ref name=Chambers>{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=Robert|title=The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar, Including Anecdote, Biography, & History, Curiosities of Literature and Oddities of Human Life and Character, Volume 2|date=1832|publisher=W. & R.

Hence the many predictions involving ancient figures such as [[Sulla]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Nero]], and others, as well as his descriptions of \"battles in the clouds\" and \"frogs falling from the sky\".{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003b|loc=''passim''}} Astrology itself is mentioned only twice in Nostradamus's ''Preface'' and 41 times in the ''Centuries'' themselves, but more frequently in his dedicatory ''[[Letter to King Henry II]]''. In the last quatrain of his sixth ''century'' he specifically attacks astrologers.\n\nHis historical sources include easily identifiable passages from [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]]' ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Plutarch]] and other classical historians, as well as from medieval chroniclers such as [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]] and [[Jean Froissart]]. Many of his astrological references are taken almost word for word from [[Richard Roussat]]'s ''{{lang|fr|Livre de l'estat et mutations des temps}}'' of 1549\u201350.\n\nOne of his major prophetic sources was evidently the ''[[Mirabilis Liber]]'' of 1522, which contained a range of prophecies by [[Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius|Pseudo-Methodius]], the [[Tiburtine Sibyl]], [[Joachim of Fiore]], [[Savonarola]] and others (his ''Preface'' contains 24 biblical quotations, all but two in the order used by Savonarola). This book had enjoyed considerable success in the 1520s, when it went through half a dozen editions, but did not sustain its influence, perhaps owing to its mostly Latin text, Gothic script and many difficult abbreviations. Nostradamus was one of the first to re-paraphrase these prophecies in French, which may explain why they are credited to him. Modern views of plagiarism did not apply in the 16th century; authors frequently copied and paraphrased passages without acknowledgement, especially from the classics. The latest research suggests that he may in fact have used [[bibliomancy]] for this\u2014randomly selecting a book of history or prophecy and taking his cue from whatever page it happened to fall open at.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010}}\n\nFurther material was gleaned from the ''De honesta disciplina'' of 1504 by [[Petrus Crinitus]],{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=100, 233\u2013235}} which included extracts from [[Michael Psellos]]'s ''De daemonibus'', and the ''[[De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum]]'' (''Concerning the mysteries of Egypt''), a book on [[Chaldea]]n and [[Assyria]]n magic by [[Iamblichus]], a 4th-century [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonist]]. Latin versions of both had recently been published in [[Lyon]], and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) in his first two verses, the first of which is appended to this article. While it is true that Nostradamus claimed in 1555 to have burned all of the occult works in his library, no one can say exactly what books were destroyed in this fire.\n\nOnly in the 17th century did people start to notice his reliance on earlier, mainly classical sources.{{efn|Anonymous letters to the ''Mercure de France'' in August and November 1724 drew specific public attention to the fact (Anonyme) Lettre critique sur la personne et sur les \u00e9crits de Michel Nostradamus, Mercure de France, ao\u00fbt et novembre 1724.}}\n\nNostradamus's reliance on historical precedent is reflected in the fact that he explicitly rejected the label \"prophet\" (i.e. a person having prophetic powers of his own) on several occasions:{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=109}}\n\n{{quote|Although, my son, I have used the word ''prophet'', I would not attribute to myself a title of such lofty sublimity.|''Preface to C\u00e9sar'', 1555<ref name=\"prefces\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26:preface-to-cesar&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |title=Preface to C\u00e9sar |publisher=Nostradamus-repository.org |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928090730/http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=26:preface-to-cesar&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n{{quote|Not that I would attribute to myself either the name or the role of a prophet.|''Preface to C\u00e9sar'', 1555<ref name = \"prefces\"/>}}\n{{quote|[S]ome of [the prophets] predicted great and marvelous things to come: [though] for me, I in no way attribute to myself such a title here.|''Letter to King Henry II'', 1558<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27:letter-to-henri-ii&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |title=Letter to Henri II |publisher=Nostradamus-repository.org |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727130736/http://www.nostradamus-repository.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27:letter-to-henri-ii&catid=6:other&Itemid=5 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n{{quote|Not that I am foolish enough to claim to be a prophet.|Open letter to Privy Councillor (later Chancellor) Birague, 15 June 1566{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=109}}}}\n\n[[File:npix4.jpg|thumb|right|Detail from title-page of the original 1555 (Albi) edition of Nostradamus's ''Les Proph\u00e9ties'']]\n\nGiven this reliance on literary sources, it is unlikely that Nostradamus used any particular methods for entering a [[altered state of consciousness|trance state]], other than [[contemplation]], [[meditation]] and [[Incubation (ritual)|incubation]].{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=98}} His sole description of this process is contained in ''letter 41'' of his collected Latin correspondence.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=41, 225\u2013229}} The popular legend that he attempted the ancient methods of flame gazing, water gazing or both simultaneously is based on a naive reading of his first two verses, which merely liken his efforts to those of the [[Oracle of Delphi|Delphic]] and [[Didyma|Branchidic]] [[oracle]]s. The first of these is reproduced at the bottom of this article and the second can be seen by visiting the relevant facsimile site (see External Links).

This was followed in 1961 (reprinted in 1982) by Edgar Leoni's ''Nostradamus and His Prophecies''. After that came [[Erika Cheetham]]'s ''The Prophecies of Nostradamus'', incorporating a reprint of the posthumous 1568 edition, which was reprinted, revised and republished several times from 1973 onwards, latterly as ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus''. This served as the basis for the documentary ''[[The Man Who Saw Tomorrow]]'' and both did indeed mention possible generalised future attacks on New York (via [[nuclear weapon]]s), though not specifically on the World Trade Center or on any particular date.<ref>See, for example, Cheetham, Erika, ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus'', Futura, 1990, p.373</ref>\n\nA two-part translation of Jean-Charles de Fontbrune's ''Nostradamus: historien et proph\u00e8te'' was published in 1980, and John Hogue has published a number of books on Nostradamus from about 1987, including ''Nostradamus and the Millennium: Predictions of the Future'', ''Nostradamus: The Complete Prophecies'' (1999) and ''Nostradamus: A Life and Myth'' (2003). In 1992 one commentator who claimed to be able to contact Nostradamus under hypnosis even had him \"interpreting\" his own verse X.6 (a prediction specifically about floods in southern France around the city of N\u00eemes and people taking refuge in its ''collosse'', or Colosseum, a Roman amphitheatre now known as the ''Ar\u00e8nes'') as a prediction of an undated ''attack on the Pentagon'', despite the historical seer's clear statement in his dedicatory letter to King Henri II that his prophecies were about Europe, North Africa and part of Asia Minor.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=145|Phophecy Location Map=http://www.secret-vault.co.uk/nostradamus/locations.html}}\n\nWith the exception of Roberts, these books and their many popular imitators were almost unanimous not merely about Nostradamus's powers of prophecy but also in inventing intriguing aspects of his purported biography: that he had been a descendant of the Israelite tribe of [[Issachar]]; he had been educated by his grandfathers, who had both been physicians to the court of [[Rene I of Naples|Good King Ren\u00e9]] of [[Provence]]; he had attended [[Montpellier]] University in 1525 to gain his first degree; after returning there in 1529, he had successfully taken his medical doctorate; he had gone on to lecture in the Medical Faculty there, until his views became too unpopular; he had supported the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] view of the universe; he had travelled to the Habsburg Netherlands, where he had composed prophecies at the abbey of Orval; in the course of his travels, he had performed a variety of prodigies, including identifying future Pope, [[Sixtus V]], who was then only a seminary monk. He is credited with having successfully cured the [[Bubonic plague|Plague]] at [[Aix-en-Provence]] and elsewhere; he had engaged in [[scrying]], using either a magic mirror or a bowl of water; he had been joined by his secretary Chavigny at Easter 1554; having published the first installment of his ''Proph\u00e9ties'', he had been summoned by Queen [[Catherine de' Medici]] to Paris in 1556 to discuss with her his prophecy at quatrain I.35 that her husband [[King Henri II]] would be killed in a duel; he had examined the royal children at [[Blois]]; he had bequeathed to his son a \"lost book\" of his own prophetic paintings;{{efn|Actually the 13th\u201314th century ''[[Vaticinia de Summis Pontificibus]]'' in a misascribed version sometimes referred to as the ''[[Vaticinia Nostradami]]''}} he had been buried standing up; and he had been found, when dug up at the French Revolution, to be wearing a medallion bearing the exact date of his disinterment.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=26\u201345}} This was first recorded by [[Samuel Pepys]] as early as 1667, long before the [[French Revolution]].

Most of them had evidently been based on unsourced rumours relayed as fact by much later commentators, such as Jaubert (1656), Guynaud (1693) and Bareste (1840), on modern misunderstandings of the 16th-century French texts, or on pure invention. Even the often-advanced suggestion that quatrain I.35 had successfully prophesied King Henry II's death did not actually appear in print for the first time until 1614, 55 years after the event.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=28\u201330}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=267}}\n\nSkeptics such as [[James Randi]] suggest that his reputation as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as \"retroactive clairvoyance\" ([[postdiction]]).

Meanwhile, some of the more recent sources listed (Lemesurier, Gruber, Wilson) have been particularly scathing about later attempts by some lesser-known authors and Internet enthusiasts to extract alleged hidden meanings from the texts, whether with the aid of anagrams, numerical codes, graphs or otherwise.{{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144\u2013148}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Main|Nostradamus in popular culture}}\n\nThe prophecies retold and expanded by Nostradamus  figured largely in [[popular culture]] in the 20th and 21st centuries. As well as being the subject of hundreds of books (both fiction and nonfiction), Nostradamus's life has been depicted in several films and videos, and his life and writings continue to be a subject of media interest.\n\nThere have also been several well-known Internet [[hoax]]es, where quatrains in the style of Nostradamus have been circulated by e-mail as the real thing.

Historically it has been used to establish [[Language family|language genealogies]].\n\n==Second language acquisition==\nContrastive analysis was used extensively in the field of [[second language acquisition]] (SLA) in the 1960s and early 1970s, as a method of explaining why some features of a [[Second language|target language]] were more difficult to acquire than others. According to the [[behaviourism|behaviourist]] theories prevailing at the time, language learning was a question of [[habituation|habit formation]], and this could be reinforced or impeded by existing habits. Therefore, the difficulty in mastering certain structures in a [[second language]] (L2) depended on the difference between the learners' mother language (L1) and the language they were trying to learn.\n\n===History===\nThe theoretical foundations for what became known as the contrastive analysis hypothesis were formulated in [[Robert Lado]]'s ''Linguistics Across Cultures'' (1957). In this book, Lado claimed that \"those elements which are similar to [the learner's] native language will be simple for him, and those elements that are different will be difficult\". While it was not a novel suggestion, Lado was the first to provide a comprehensive theoretical treatment and to suggest a systematic set of technical procedures for the contrastive study of languages. That involved describing the languages (using [[structuralism|structuralist]] linguistics), comparing them and predicting learning difficulties.\n\nDuring the 1960s, there was a widespread enthusiasm with this technique, manifested in the contrastive descriptions of several European languages<ref name=\"TU Chemnitz\">{{cite news|url=https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/phil/english/sections/linguist/independent/kursmaterialien/contrli/ConLi1004.pdf|title=contrastive descriptions of several European languages}}</ref>, many of which were sponsored by the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]] in [[Washington, DC]]. It was expected that once the areas of potential difficulty had been mapped out through contrastive analysis, it would be possible to design language courses more efficiently. Contrastive analysis, along with behaviourism and [[structuralism]] exerted a profound effect on SLA curriculum design and language teacher education, and provided the theoretical pillars of the [[audio-lingual method]].\n\n===Criticism and its response===\nIn its strongest formulation, the contrastive analysis hypothesis claimed that all the errors made in learning the L2 could be attributed to 'interference' by the L1. However, this claim could not be sustained by empirical evidence that was accumulated in the mid- and late 1970s. It was soon pointed out that many errors predicted by Contrastive Analysis were inexplicably not observed in learners' language. Even more confusingly, some uniform errors were made by learners irrespective of their L1. It thus became clear that contrastive analysis could not predict all learning difficulties, but was certainly useful in the retrospective explanation of errors.\n\nIn response to the above criticisms, a moderate version of the Contrastive Analysis Hypothesis (CAH) has developed which paradoxically contradicts Lado's original claim. The new CAH hypothesizes that the more different the L2 is with one's L1, the easier it is for one to learn the target language.
