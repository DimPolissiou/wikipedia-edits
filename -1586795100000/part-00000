He was born to a poor farming family. He studied for only a few months at the village [[maqtab]], however this brief dabble in institutional education centered only on the [[Quran]] and other [[Islamic|Islam]] studies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} He gathered most of his knowledge on varied subjects, including science and philosophy, through his own readings and research.\n\nMatubbar lost his father at an early age. When he was 12 years old, his inherited property of {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of land was auctioned off because, as a minor, he was unable to pay land tax. The landless boy faced an even more critical crisis when a local usurer called him out of his ancestral homestead. Destitute, Matubbar grew up somehow on the charity of others and by working as a farm laborer. Due to his poverty, he could not attend school and had to rely on the free [[maqtab]] religious education provided by a local mosque. However he did not accept the rigid methods of learning there, and left it. A kindhearted man helped him finish the Bengali Primers. Persevering as he was, he kept on reading more and more. To satisfy his thirst for knowledge he studied all the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] books in [[Barisal Public Library]] like a serious student. Philosophy as a subject interested him most, but there were not enough books in the collection there. A teacher of philosophy at the [[B M College]], Kazi Ghulam Quadir, was impressed by his depth of knowledge and understanding, so he helped him borrow books from the college library. This was how his mind was shaped.\n\n==Philosophy==\nMatubbar developed a very [[progressivism|progressive]] approach and wrote against ignorance, superstition, and religious fundamentalism. He came to be considered an iconoclast for writing against established religious ideologies. For example, he questioned Islamic law of inheritance, as he failed to reconcile the suggested mode of sharing of inherited property.\n\nAroj Ali wrote several books, in spite of his lack of formal schooling. His writings reflect his controversial philosophy about life and the world. He also befriended a number of communist politicians and academics of Barisal town, including Professor Kazi Golam Kadir and Professor Muhammad Shamsul Haque. His books were always in danger of being banned by the government, since they contained certain claims that disagreed with the religious beliefs of the majority. Matubbar was arrested and taken into police custody for his book, ''Sotyer Shondhaney'' (The Quest for Truth).<ref name=\"The Quest for Truth\">{{cite web|url=http://avijit.humanists.net/aroj_ali/quest_for_truth_1.html |title=The Quest for Truth |work=avijit.humanists.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723144846/http://avijit.humanists.net/aroj_ali/quest_for_truth_1.html |archivedate=23 July 2010 }}{{self-published source|date=October 2016}}</ref> He was, in fact, subjected to harassment and threats throughout his life, due to his writings, as many of them challenged religious statements and claims.<ref name=\"The Quest for Truth\" />\n\n==Career==\nDue to financial constraints, Matubbar could not pursue any academic course or attain a formal institutional degree. He lived mostly on subsistence farming. He learned surveying techniques and began his life as a private land surveyor in his locality. This enabled him to accumulate some capital and he could own some land to start farming.\n\n==Death==\nHe died on 15 March 1985 (1st [[Chaitra]] of the [[Bengali year]] 1392 ) in [[Barisal]], Bangladesh.

After his death in 1985, Aroj Ali Matubbar came to be regarded as one of the most prolific thinkers that rural Bangladesh ever produced, and an iconoclast who was not afraid of speaking out against entrenched beliefs and superstitions.<ref name=\"The Quest for Truth\"/>\n\n==Writings and publications==\nMatubbar had to take a lot of trouble in order to publish his books. He himself drew the cover of his first book, which was written in 1952 and published twenty one years later in 1973, under the title ''Satyer Sandhane''. This book gained him a reputation in the locality as a \"learned man\". In the preface he wrote:\n\n\u201cI was thinking of many things, my mind was full of questions, but haphazardly. I then started jotting down questions, not for writing a book, but only to remember these questions later. Those questions were driving my mind towards an endless ocean and I was gradually drifting away from the fold of religion.\u201d\n\nHe made six propositions in this book, which reflected the nature of his philosophical questions. These are:\n\nProposition 1 : dealt with the soul, containing 8 questions<br>\nProposition 2 : dealt with God, containing as many as 11 questions<br>\nProposition 3 : dealt with the after-world, containing as many as 7 questions<br>\nProposition 4 : dealt with religious matters, containing as many as 22 questions<br>\nProposition 5 : dealt with Nature, containing as many as 10 questions<br>\nProposition 6 : dealt with remaining matters, containing as many as 9 questions\n\nThe eight questions he posed in the first proposition exemplify his approach. These are (a) Who am I (self)?, (b) Is Life incorporeal or corporal ? (c) Is mind and his/soul one, and the same? (d) What is the relationship of life with the body and the mind? (e) Can we recognize or identify life? (f) Am I free? (g) Will the soul without body continue to have \"knowledge\" even after it leaves the body at death? and finally (h) How does life can come into and go out of the body?\n\n==Books==\nHe was an unusual type of writer. Because of his rural background, it was not possible on his part to remove the darkness covering his society, but with the dim torch he held, he tried to see the truth, wherever he could, without fear or doubt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mukto-mona.com/Special_Event_/5_yrs_anniv/sirajul_islam_chy/aroj1.htm |title=5 years of Mukto-Mona |website=Mukto Mona |language=bn}}</ref> In Bangladesh, his writings were censored.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kabir |first=Md Anwarul |date=26 November 2004 |title=Letters to Editor: Freedom of speech |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/11/26/d41126110379.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star}}</ref> Following are his writings:\n* ''Shotter Shondhaney'' (The Quest for Truth) (1973)\n* ''Sristir Rahasya'' (The Mystery of Creation) (1977)\n* ''Anuman'' (Estimation) (1983)\n* ''Muktaman'' (Free Mind) (1988)\n\nSeveral of his unpublished manuscripts were later published posthumously under the title of ''Aroj Ali Matubbar Rachanabali''.

In any case, however, they only occurred in the first (and sometimes only) syllable of any word.\n\nEvery vowel occurred in long and short versions which were different [[phoneme]]s in the first syllable. Starostin et al. (2003) treat length together with pitch as a prosodic feature.\n\n====Prosody====\nAs reconstructed by Starostin et al. (2003), Proto-Altaic was a [[pitch accent]] or [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] language; at least the first and probably every syllable could have a high or a low pitch.\n\n===Sound correspondences===\nIf a Proto(-Macro)-Altaic language really existed, it should be possible to reconstruct regular sound correspondences between that [[protolanguage]] and its descendants; such correspondences would make it possible to distinguish [[cognate]]s from [[loanword]]s (in many cases). Such attempts have repeatedly been made. The latest version is reproduced here, taken from Bla\u017eek's (2006) summary of the newest Altaic etymological dictionary (Starostin et al. 2003) and transcribed into the [[help:IPA|IPA]].\n\nWhen a Proto-Altaic phoneme developed differently depending on its position in a word (beginning, interior, or end), the special case (or all cases) is marked with a hyphen; for example, Proto-Altaic {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} disappears (marked \"0\") or becomes {{IPA|/j/}} at the beginning of a Turkic word and becomes {{IPA|/p/}} elsewhere in a Turkic word.\n\n====Consonants====\nOnly single consonants are considered here. In the middle of words, clusters of two consonants were allowed in Proto-Altaic as reconstructed by Starostin et al. (2003); the correspondence table of these clusters spans almost seven pages in their book (83\u201389), and most clusters are only found in one or a few of the reconstructed roots.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

(It also retains a number of other archaisms.) However, it has also added {{IPA|/h/}} in front of words for which no initial consonant (except in some cases {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, as expected) can be reconstructed for Proto-Altaic; therefore, and because it would make them dependent on whether Khalaj happens to have preserved any given root, Starostin et al. (2003: 26\u201328) have not used Khalaj to decide whether to reconstruct an initial {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} in any given word and have not reconstructed a {{IPA|/h/}} for Proto-Turkic even though it was probably there.<br>\n<sup>2</sup> The [[Monguor language]] has {{IPA|/f/}} here instead (Kaiser & Shevoroshkin 1988); it is therefore possible that Proto-Mongolian also had {{IPA|/f/}} which then became {{IPA|/h/}} (and then usually disappeared) in all descendants except Monguor. Tabga\u010d and [[Khitan language|Kitan]], two extinct Mongolic languages not considered by Starostin et al. (2003), even preserve {{IPA|/p/}} in these places (Bla\u017eek 2006).<br>\n<sup>3</sup> This happened when the next consonant in the word was {{IPA|/l\u02b2/}}, {{IPA|/r\u02b2/}}, or {{IPA|/r/}}.<br>\n<sup>4</sup> Before {{IPA|/i/}}.<br>\n<sup>5</sup> When the next consonant in the word was {{IPA|/h/}}.<br>\n<sup>6</sup> This happened \"in syllables with original high pitch\" (Starostin et al. 2003:135).<br>\n<sup>7</sup> Before {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}, {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} or {{IPA|/y/}}.<br>\n<sup>8</sup> When the next consonant in the word was {{IPA|/r/}}.<br>\n<sup>9</sup> When the preceding consonant was {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/r\u02b2/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, or {{IPA|/l\u02b2/}}, or when the next consonant was {{IPA|/\u0261/}}.<br>\n<sup>10</sup> Before {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, or any vowel followed by {{IPA|/j/}}.<br>\n<sup>11</sup> Before {{IPA|/j/}}, or {{IPA|/i/}} and then another vowel.<br>\n<sup>12</sup> When preceded by a vowel preceded by {{IPA|/i/}}.<br>\n<sup>13</sup> Before {{IPA|/a/}}.<br>\n<sup>14</sup> Starostin et al. (2003) follow a minority opinion (Vovin 1993) in interpreting the sound of the Middle Korean letter \u1140 as {{IPA|[n\u02b2]}} or {{IPA|[\u0272]}} rather than {{IPA|[z]}}. (Dybo & Starostin 2008:footnote 50)<br>\n<sup>15</sup> Before {{IPA|/u/}}.<br>\n<sup>16</sup> Before {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA| /o/}}, or {{IPA|/e/}}.\n\n====Vowels====\n[[Vowel harmony]] is pervasive in the languages attributed to Altaic: most Turkic and Mongolic as well as some Tungusic languages have it, Korean is arguably in the process of losing its traces, and it is controversially hypothesized for Old Japanese. (Vowel harmony is also typical of the neighboring [[Uralic languages]] and was often counted among the arguments for the [[Ural\u2013Altaic languages|Ural\u2013Altaic hypotheses]].) Nevertheless, Starostin et al. (2003) reconstruct Proto-Altaic as lacking vowel harmony. Instead, according to them, vowel harmony originated in each daughter branch as assimilation of the vowel in the first syllable to the vowel in the second syllable (which was usually modified or lost later). \"The situation therefore is very close, e.g. to [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [see [[Germanic umlaut]]] or to the [[Nakh languages]] in the Eastern Caucasus, where the quality of non-initial vowels can now only be recovered on the basis of umlaut processes in the first syllable.\" (Starostin et al. 2003:91) The table below is taken from Starostin et al.

For instance, regarding Korean, Starostin et al. state that Middle Korean genitive is  /n\u02b2/, while it actually was /s/ in its honorific form, and /\u00f3j/ or /uj/ as neutral forms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Korean Linguistics|last=Jaehoon|first=Yeon|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=449}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, some \"cognates\" are visibly forced, like the comparison between Turkish instrumental {{IPA|-/n/, -/\u026fn/, -/in/}} and Japanese locative /ni/. A locative postposition expresses an absolutely different meaning to that of an instrumental, so it is evident that both of them are not related whatsoever. The same applies for Japanese /ga/ and Proto Tungusic /ga/. The first of those particles expresses genitive case, while the second is the partitive case, which bear no resemblance of meaning at all either.{{dubious|date=December 2019}} A different kind of issue is that of the Old Turkish genitive /X\u014b/ (where \"X\" stands for any phoneme) and Old Japanese genitive /no/. Although they share the same consonant, the fact that the former is a vowel plus a consonant, and the second is a fixed set of the consonant /n/ plus vowel /o/ makes the fact that those two are cognates extremely unlikely.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/turks/Erdal_OTG.pdf|title=A Grammar of Old Turkic|last=Erdal|first=Marcel|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=29 April 2016}}</ref>{{dubious|date=December 2019}}<!-- not in the source cited -->\n\n===Selected cognates===\n\n====Personal pronouns====\nThe table below is taken (with slight modifications) from Bla\u017eek (2006) and transcribed into IPA.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

Aside from the huge amount of non-attested, free reconstructions, some mistakes on the research carried out by Altaicists must be pointed out. The first of them is that Old Japanese for the first person pronoun (\"I\", in English) was neither /ba/ or /a/. It was /ware/ (\u548c\u79ae), and sometimes it was abbreviated to /wa/ (\u543e). Also, it is not a Sino-Japanese word, but a native Japanese term. In addition, the second person pronoun was not /si/, but either /imasi/ (\u6c5d), or /namu/ (\u5948\u725f), which sometimes was shortened to /na/. Its plural was /namu tachi/ (\u5948\u725f\u591a\u77e5).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Descriptive Grammar of Early Old Japanese Prose|last=Bentley|first=John R.|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=62\u201365}}</ref>\n\n====Other basic vocabulary====\nThe following table is a brief selection of further proposed [[cognate]]s in basic vocabulary across the Altaic family (from Starostin et al.

This is a rather exceptional case; especially words for higher numbers are often borrowed wholesale. (Perhaps the most famous cases are [[Japanese numerals|Japanese]] and [[Korean numerals|Korean]], which have two complete sets of numerals each \u2013 one native, one [[Chinese numerals|Chinese]].) Indeed, the Altaic numerals are less stable than the Indo-European ones, but nevertheless Starostin et al. (2003) reconstruct them as follows. They are not accepted by the mainstream linguists and are controversial.

In any case, however, they only occurred in the first (and sometimes only) syllable of any word.\n\nEvery vowel occurred in long and short versions which were different [[phoneme]]s in the first syllable. Starostin et al. (2003) treat length together with pitch as a prosodic feature.\n\n====Prosody====\nAs reconstructed by Starostin et al. (2003), Proto-Altaic was a [[pitch accent]] or [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] language; at least the first and probably every syllable could have a high or a low pitch.\n\n===Sound correspondences===\nIf a Proto(-Macro)-Altaic language really existed, it should be possible to reconstruct regular sound correspondences between that [[protolanguage]] and its descendants; such correspondences would make it possible to distinguish [[cognate]]s from [[loanword]]s (in many cases). Such attempts have repeatedly been made. The latest version is reproduced here, taken from Bla\u017eek's (2006) summary of the newest Altaic etymological dictionary (Starostin et al. 2003) and transcribed into the [[help:IPA|IPA]].\n\nWhen a Proto-Altaic phoneme developed differently depending on its position in a word (beginning, interior, or end), the special case (or all cases) is marked with a hyphen; for example, Proto-Altaic {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} disappears (marked \"0\") or becomes {{IPA|/j/}} at the beginning of a Turkic word and becomes {{IPA|/p/}} elsewhere in a Turkic word.\n\n====Consonants====\nOnly single consonants are considered here. In the middle of words, clusters of two consonants were allowed in Proto-Altaic as reconstructed by Starostin et al. (2003); the correspondence table of these clusters spans almost seven pages in their book (83\u201389), and most clusters are only found in one or a few of the reconstructed roots.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

(It also retains a number of other archaisms.) However, it has also added {{IPA|/h/}} in front of words for which no initial consonant (except in some cases {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, as expected) can be reconstructed for Proto-Altaic; therefore, and because it would make them dependent on whether Khalaj happens to have preserved any given root, Starostin et al. (2003: 26\u201328) have not used Khalaj to decide whether to reconstruct an initial {{IPA|/p\u02b0/}} in any given word and have not reconstructed a {{IPA|/h/}} for Proto-Turkic even though it was probably there.<br>\n<sup>2</sup> The [[Monguor language]] has {{IPA|/f/}} here instead (Kaiser & Shevoroshkin 1988); it is therefore possible that Proto-Mongolian also had {{IPA|/f/}} which then became {{IPA|/h/}} (and then usually disappeared) in all descendants except Monguor. Tabga\u010d and [[Khitan language|Kitan]], two extinct Mongolic languages not considered by Starostin et al.

(Vowel harmony is also typical of the neighboring [[Uralic languages]] and was often counted among the arguments for the [[Ural\u2013Altaic languages|Ural\u2013Altaic hypotheses]].) Nevertheless, Starostin et al. (2003) reconstruct Proto-Altaic as lacking vowel harmony. Instead, according to them, vowel harmony originated in each daughter branch as assimilation of the vowel in the first syllable to the vowel in the second syllable (which was usually modified or lost later). \"The situation therefore is very close, e.g. to [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [see [[Germanic umlaut]]] or to the [[Nakh languages]] in the Eastern Caucasus, where the quality of non-initial vowels can now only be recovered on the basis of umlaut processes in the first syllable.\" (Starostin et al. 2003:91) The table below is taken from Starostin et al.

Suffixes reconstructed for Proto-Turkic, Proto-Mongolic, Proto-Korean, or Proto-Japonic, but not attested in Old Turkic, Classical Mongolian, Middle Korean, or Old Japanese are marked with asterisks.\n\nThis correspondences, however, have been harshly criticized for several reasons: There are significant gaps resulting in the absence of etymologies for certain initial segments: an impossible situation in the case of a genetic relationship; lack of common paradigmatic morphology; in many cases, there are ghosts, invented or polished meanings; and word-list linguistics rules supreme, as there are few if any references to texts or philology.<ref name=georg2004>Stefan Georg (2004): \"[Review of ''Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages'' (2003)]\".

For instance, regarding Korean, Starostin et al. state that Middle Korean genitive is  /n\u02b2/, while it actually was /s/ in its honorific form, and /\u00f3j/ or /uj/ as neutral forms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Korean Linguistics|last=Jaehoon|first=Yeon|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=449}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, some \"cognates\" are visibly forced, like the comparison between Turkish instrumental {{IPA|-/n/, -/\u026fn/, -/in/}} and Japanese locative /ni/. A locative postposition expresses an absolutely different meaning to that of an instrumental, so it is evident that both of them are not related whatsoever. The same applies for Japanese /ga/ and Proto Tungusic /ga/. The first of those particles expresses genitive case, while the second is the partitive case, which bear no resemblance of meaning at all either.{{dubious|date=December 2019}} A different kind of issue is that of the Old Turkish genitive /X\u014b/ (where \"X\" stands for any phoneme) and Old Japanese genitive /no/. Although they share the same consonant, the fact that the former is a vowel plus a consonant, and the second is a fixed set of the consonant /n/ plus vowel /o/ makes the fact that those two are cognates extremely unlikely.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://altaica.ru/LIBRARY/turks/Erdal_OTG.pdf|title=A Grammar of Old Turkic|last=Erdal|first=Marcel|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=29 April 2016}}</ref>{{dubious|date=December 2019}}<!-- not in the source cited -->\n\n===Selected cognates===\n\n====Personal pronouns====\nThe table below is taken (with slight modifications) from Bla\u017eek (2006) and transcribed into IPA.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!\n!

Aside from the huge amount of non-attested, free reconstructions, some mistakes on the research carried out by Altaicists must be pointed out. The first of them is that Old Japanese for the first person pronoun (\"I\", in English) was neither /ba/ or /a/. It was /ware/ (\u548c\u79ae), and sometimes it was abbreviated to /wa/ (\u543e). Also, it is not a Sino-Japanese word, but a native Japanese term. In addition, the second person pronoun was not /si/, but either /imasi/ (\u6c5d), or /namu/ (\u5948\u725f), which sometimes was shortened to /na/. Its plural was /namu tachi/ (\u5948\u725f\u591a\u77e5).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Descriptive Grammar of Early Old Japanese Prose|last=Bentley|first=John R.|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=62\u201365}}</ref>\n\n====Other basic vocabulary====\nThe following table is a brief selection of further proposed [[cognate]]s in basic vocabulary across the Altaic family (from Starostin et al.

This is a rather exceptional case; especially words for higher numbers are often borrowed wholesale. (Perhaps the most famous cases are [[Japanese numerals|Japanese]] and [[Korean numerals|Korean]], which have two complete sets of numerals each \u2013 one native, one [[Chinese numerals|Chinese]].) Indeed, the Altaic numerals are less stable than the Indo-European ones, but nevertheless Starostin et al. (2003) reconstruct them as follows. They are not accepted by the mainstream linguists and are controversial.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], written by the writing team of [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Edward Miller]] and [[Zack Stentz]] along with [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]], and stars [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the title character]] alongside [[Natalie Portman]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Colm Feore]], [[Ray Stevenson]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. After reigniting a dormant war, Thor is banished from [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] to Earth, stripped of his powers and his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]]. As his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] plots to take the Asgardian throne, Thor must prove himself worthy.\n\n[[Sam Raimi]] first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on ''Thor'' in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in \"[[development hell]]\" for several years. During this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until Marvel signed [[Mark Protosevich]] to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount. [[Matthew Vaughn]] was assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in [[California]] and [[New Mexico]] from January to May 2010. The film was converted to [[3-D film|3D]] in post-production.\n\n''Thor'' premiered in Sydney on April 17, 2011, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film was a financial success, earning $449.3 million worldwide, and was positively reviewed for its performances, although the Earth-based elements of the film received some criticism. Two sequels have been released, ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' in 2017. A fourth film, ''Thor: Love and Thunder'', is in development.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 965 AD, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], king of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wages war against the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)#Giants of Jotunheim 2|Frost Giants]] of [[Jotunheim]] and their leader [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], to prevent them from conquering the [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|nine realms]], starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants in [[T\u00f8nsberg]], [[Norway]], and seize the source of their power, the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].\n\nIn the present,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008) and ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the latter of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Odin's son [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], childhood friend [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg]], [[Fandral]], and [[Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]], now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\n\nThor lands in [[New Mexico]], where astrophysicist [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]], her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Phil Coulson]] soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Foster's data about the [[wormhole]] that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed, but he finds himself unable to lift it and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.\n\nLoki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After he confronts Odin, a weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifr\u00f6st]]\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor proves himself worthy by his sacrifice to wield Mj\u00f6lnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Foster goodbye and vowing to return, he leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.\n\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval.

Look into all the research about the comic books that we could, but also bring it back to 'Who is this guy as a person, and what's his relationship with people in the individual scenes?{{Single double}}<ref name=\"huver\"/> About approaching Thor's fighting style, he remarked, \"First, we looked at the comic books and the posturing, the way [Thor] moves and fights, and a lot of his power seems to be drawn up through the ground.

And Ken, who's amazing, who is so incredible, was like, 'You can really help create this character'. I got to read all of these biographies of female scientists like [[Rosalind Franklin]] who actually discovered the [[Nucleic acid double helix|DNA double helix]] but didn't get the credit for it. The struggles they had and the way that they thought&nbsp;\u2013 I was like, 'What a great opportunity, in a very big movie that is going to be seen by a lot of people, to have a woman as a scientist'. She's a very serious scientist. Because in the comic she's a nurse and now they made her an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]]. Really, I know it sounds silly, but it is those little things that makes girls think it's possible.

Hiddleston stated that the character was \"a comic book version of [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', but nastier.\" Hiddleston had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because Branagh wanted \"Loki to have a lean and hungry look, like [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. Physically, he can't be posing as Thor\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMay2009\" /> Hiddleston looked at [[Peter O'Toole]] as inspiration for Loki as well, explaining, \"Interestingly enough, [Kenneth Branagh] said to look at Peter O'Toole in two specific films, ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''. What's interesting about ... his performance [as King Henry] is you see how damaged he is. There's a rawness [to his performance]; it's almost as if he's living with a layer of skin peeled away. He's grandiose and teary and, in a moment, by turns hilarious and then terrifying. What we wanted was that emotional volatility. It's a different acting style, it's not quite the same thing, but it's fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as O'Toole head for those great high hills\".<ref name=\"Storm\" /> Ted Allpress portrays a young Loki.\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />A scientist doing research in New Mexico who encounters Thor.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> Skarsg\u00e5rd stated that he was not initially familiar with the comic book version of Thor.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> As to why he took the part, Skarsg\u00e5rd remarked, I \"chose ''Thor'' because of [director] Kenneth Branagh. The script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us. So I had a very happy time on it. What I always try to do is immediately do something I just haven't done so I get variation in my life. I've made about 90 films and if I did the same thing over and over again I would be bored by now.

These were discussions that took no more than a few minutes between takes, but they allowed Ken, Tony and [me] to understand each other instantly without Ken taking an hour away to explain to the actors exactly what was going on.

Stevenson wore a [[fat suit]] for the role, stating, \"I've tried the suit on, and what they've done is kind of sex him up: he's sort of slimmer but rounder.\". Stevenson said, \"He's got every bit of that [[Falstaff]]ian verve and vigor, and a bit of a beer gut to suggest that enormous appetite, but he's not the sort of [[Weeble]]-shaped figure he is in the comics.

It's Kenneth Branagh. I was like, 'Definitely'\".<ref name=\"Bierly\" /> About the role Elba remarked, \"I did green screen for the first time!

About the film he said, \"It's a superhero movie, but with a bit of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] thrown in\".<ref name=\"Carroll\" /> Hopkins stated, \"I'm very interested in that relationship between fathers and sons\", and that, \"My father's relationship with me was cold. He was a hot-blood character but to me, cold. When I was young, he expressed his disappointment because I was bad in school and all of that. He didn't mean any harm, but I felt I could never meet up to his expectations.\" Hopkins expressed that he found a personal resonance in the Odin role, saying, \"He's a stern man. He's a man with purpose. I play the god who banishes his son from the kingdom of Asgard because he screwed up. He's a hot-headed, temperamental young man... probably a chip off of the old block but I decide he's not really ready to rule the future kingdom, so I banish him. I'm harsh and my wife complains and I say, 'That is why I'm king.' He's ruthless, take-it-or-leave-it. Women are much more forgiving; men are not so forgiving.

Dallas mentioned that [[Errol Flynn]] was an inspiration for the character stating, \"He was a big inspiration for the character and for me.

They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants\".<ref name=\"tait\" /> In April 2011, the [[IMAX Corporation]], Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in [[IMAX 3D]], continuing the partnership which began on ''Iron Man 2''.<ref name=\"imax\" /> Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said \"We came to feel that in our case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience\". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the \"special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D\".<ref name=\"3d\" /> The [[post-credits scene]] that sees [[Nick Fury]] approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by ''The Avengers''{{'}}s director, [[Joss Whedon]].<ref name=\"Hewitt\" />\n\n[[BUF Compagnie]] served as the lead [[visual effects]] vendor working on the film,<ref name=\"bufcompagnie\" /> with [[Digital Domain]] also providing work on the film.<ref name=\"digitaldomain\" /> Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by [[J. M. W. Turner]] to Digital Domain when creating [[J\u00f6tunheimr|Jotunheim]].<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of [[Fuel VFX]], said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifr\u00f6st would look like, \"You can't [[Google]] what these things look like\u2014they are totally imagined and within the heads of the stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifr\u00f6st and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo.<ref name=\"Frei\" /> In the film, Odin enters what is known as the \"Odinsleep\" in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, \"For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space\".<ref name=\"Frei\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Thor (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nThe film's score was written by composer [[Patrick Doyle]], a frequent collaborator of Branagh. Doyle described ''Thor'' as \"the most commercially high profile film I have done since ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Frankenstein]]''\",<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find a tone that fit the duality of Asgard and Earth. Thus Doyle and Branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction,<ref name=\"MotG\" /> with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having a balance between the music and \"grand images [that] were not in any way hyperbolized\", and the composer in turn implementing \"a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work\". As Doyle declared that his own [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] background made him familiar with Norse mythology, an old Celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for Thor's leitmotif.<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> A soundtrack album was released by [[Buena Vista Records]] in April 2011.<ref name=\"filmmusicreporter\" />\n\nThe film also features a song by the [[Foo Fighters]], \"[[Walk (Foo Fighters song)|Walk]]\", in both a scene where a powerless Thor shares some [[Boilermaker (beer cocktail)|boilermakers]] with Selvig in a roadhouse, and the film's closing credits. Marvel president Kevin Feige stated that \"Walk\" was a last minute addition, that the crew felt had \"these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes\" upon hearing it. Branagh in particular thought that \"these lyrics about learning to walk again\" were appropriate \"of [a] movie about redemption, learning to be a hero.\"<ref name=\"Boucher4\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Thor Comic-Con Panel.jpg|thumb|right|Hemsworth, Portman, Dennings and Hiddleston at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn July 2010 Marvel Studios held a ''Thor'' panel at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] during which Kenneth Branagh, Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg discussed the film and showed some clips from it.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> A few days later, this footage was leaked on the internet.<ref name=\"Fleming6\" /> The first television advertisement was broadcast during [[Super Bowl XLV]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in the United States.

Branagh stated the footage contains \"things like the Asgardian parents, Odin and Frigga, played by the beautiful Rene Russo, there's some beautiful scenes in there that I think people will enjoy. And certainly Thor and Loki interacting in different ways that just fill in a little bit of a back story, that was part of our rehearsal and research.\"<ref name=\"Marshall4\" /> In its first week of release, ''Thor'' took the number one spot on Blu-ray/DVD sales chart and topped ''[[Home Media Magazine]]'''s rental chart for the week.<ref name=\"Arnold\" />\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home Media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"PhaseOneSetAnnounced\" /> It was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"PhaseOneSetDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Boxset release\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Thor'' earned $181&nbsp;million in [[North America]] and $268.3&nbsp;million in other territories for a worldwide total of $449.3&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\"/> It was the 15th highest-grossing film of 2011.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo4\" />\n\n''Thor'' earned $25.5 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada, including $3.3 million from Thursday previews,<ref name=\"BOWknd1\" /> for a total weekend gross of $65.7 million. $6.2 million of the gross came from IMAX 3D, while 60% of the gross was from 3D screenings.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo5\" /><ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo6\" /> It became the tenth highest-grossing film of 2011 in the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo7\"/> and the highest-grossing comic-book film from May\u2013August 2011.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo8\"/>\n\n''Thor''{{'}}s opening in Australia generated $5.8 million and placing second behind [[Universal Pictures]]' ''[[Fast Five]]''.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], written by the writing team of [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Edward Miller]] and [[Zack Stentz]] along with [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]], and stars [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the title character]] alongside [[Natalie Portman]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Colm Feore]], [[Ray Stevenson]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. After reigniting a dormant war, Thor is banished from [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] to Earth, stripped of his powers and his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]]. As his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] plots to take the Asgardian throne, Thor must prove himself worthy.\n\n[[Sam Raimi]] first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on ''Thor'' in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in \"[[development hell]]\" for several years. During this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until Marvel signed [[Mark Protosevich]] to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount. [[Matthew Vaughn]] was assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in [[California]] and [[New Mexico]] from January to May 2010. The film was converted to [[3-D film|3D]] in post-production.\n\n''Thor'' premiered in Sydney on April 17, 2011, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film was a financial success, earning $449.3 million worldwide on a $150 million budget. It was positively reviewed for its performances, although the Earth-based elements of the film received some criticism. Two sequels have been released, ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' in 2017. A fourth film, ''Thor: Love and Thunder'', is in development.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 965 AD, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], king of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wages war against the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)#Giants of Jotunheim 2|Frost Giants]] of [[Jotunheim]] and their leader [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], to prevent them from conquering the [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|nine realms]], starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants in [[T\u00f8nsberg]], [[Norway]], and seize the source of their power, the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].\n\nIn the present,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008) and ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the latter of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Odin's son [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], childhood friend [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg]], [[Fandral]], and [[Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]], now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\n\nThor lands in [[New Mexico]], where astrophysicist [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]], her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Phil Coulson]] soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Foster's data about the [[wormhole]] that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed, but he finds himself unable to lift it and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.\n\nLoki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After he confronts Odin, a weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifr\u00f6st]]\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor proves himself worthy by his sacrifice to wield Mj\u00f6lnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Foster goodbye and vowing to return, he leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.\n\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; meanwhile, on Earth, Foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Selvig is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where [[Nick Fury]] opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object,{{refn|name=CosmicCube|group=N|Identified off-screen as the [[Cosmic Cube]].<ref name=\"CosmicCube\" />}} which Fury says may hold untold power. An invisible Loki prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:ChrisHemsworthApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Hemsworth promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]: <br />The [[crown prince]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] [[deity]] of the [[Thor|same name]].

Look into all the research about the comic books that we could, but also bring it back to 'Who is this guy as a person, and what's his relationship with people in the individual scenes?{{Single double}}<ref name=\"huver\"/> About approaching Thor's fighting style, he remarked, \"First, we looked at the comic books and the posturing, the way [Thor] moves and fights, and a lot of his power seems to be drawn up through the ground. We talked about boxers, you know, [[Mike Tyson]], very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time, and then as we shot stuff things became easier.\"<ref name=\"Warmoth\" /> [[Dakota Goyo]] portrays a young Thor.\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]: <br />A scientist and Thor's love interest. Marvel Studios stated in an announcement that the character was updated from the comics' initial portrayal for the feature adaptation.<ref name=\"portman\" /> When asked why she took the role, Portman replied, \"I just thought it sounded like a weird idea because Kenneth Branagh's directing it, so I was just like, 'Kenneth Branagh doing ''Thor'' is super-weird, I've gotta do it.{{Single double}}<ref name=\"portmanthorweird\" /> Portman stated that she really wanted to do a big effects film that emphasized character, and getting to do it with Branagh was a new way of approaching it, relative to ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> Regarding her preparation for the role Portman remarked, \"I signed on to do it before there was a script. And Ken, who's amazing, who is so incredible, was like, 'You can really help create this character'. I got to read all of these biographies of female scientists like [[Rosalind Franklin]] who actually discovered the [[Nucleic acid double helix|DNA double helix]] but didn't get the credit for it. The struggles they had and the way that they thought&nbsp;\u2013 I was like, 'What a great opportunity, in a very big movie that is going to be seen by a lot of people, to have a woman as a scientist'. She's a very serious scientist. Because in the comic she's a nurse and now they made her an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]].

Hiddleston was chosen after previously working with Branagh on ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' and ''[[Wallander (British TV series)|Wallander]]''.<ref name=\"hiddleston\" /> Initially, Hiddleston auditioned to play Thor but Branagh decided his talent would be better harnessed playing Loki. Hiddleston stated that the character was \"a comic book version of [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', but nastier.\" Hiddleston had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because Branagh wanted \"Loki to have a lean and hungry look, like [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. Physically, he can't be posing as Thor\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMay2009\" /> Hiddleston looked at [[Peter O'Toole]] as inspiration for Loki as well, explaining, \"Interestingly enough, [Kenneth Branagh] said to look at Peter O'Toole in two specific films, ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''. What's interesting about ... his performance [as King Henry] is you see how damaged he is. There's a rawness [to his performance]; it's almost as if he's living with a layer of skin peeled away. He's grandiose and teary and, in a moment, by turns hilarious and then terrifying. What we wanted was that emotional volatility. It's a different acting style, it's not quite the same thing, but it's fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as O'Toole head for those great high hills\".<ref name=\"Storm\" /> Ted Allpress portrays a young Loki.\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />A scientist doing research in New Mexico who encounters Thor.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> Skarsg\u00e5rd stated that he was not initially familiar with the comic book version of Thor.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> As to why he took the part, Skarsg\u00e5rd remarked, I \"chose ''Thor'' because of [director] Kenneth Branagh. The script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us. So I had a very happy time on it. What I always try to do is immediately do something I just haven't done so I get variation in my life. I've made about 90 films and if I did the same thing over and over again I would be bored by now.

And if you've seen any of the Frost Giants, you know that I am, of course, the [[Napoleon]] of Frost Giants. We've got some massive, fabulous guys who dwarf me and come in at around eight-and-a-half feet, nine feet. But, no. Can't you tell by the commanding presence? I am the boss\".<ref name=\"feoreaudio\"/> He said the Shakespearean training he shared with Hopkins and director Branagh helped keep production moving briskly, saying that \"during the breaks, Tony, myself and Ken would be talking in Shakespearean shorthand about what the characters were doing, what we thought they may be like, and how we could focus our attention more intelligently. These were discussions that took no more than a few minutes between takes, but they allowed Ken, Tony and [me] to understand each other instantly without Ken taking an hour away to explain to the actors exactly what was going on.

Stevenson wore a [[fat suit]] for the role, stating, \"I've tried the suit on, and what they've done is kind of sex him up: he's sort of slimmer but rounder.\". Stevenson said, \"He's got every bit of that [[Falstaff]]ian verve and vigor, and a bit of a beer gut to suggest that enormous appetite, but he's not the sort of [[Weeble]]-shaped figure he is in the comics. He's Falstaff with muscles.

It's Kenneth Branagh. I was like, 'Definitely'\".<ref name=\"Bierly\" /> About the role Elba remarked, \"I did green screen for the first time!

About the film he said, \"It's a superhero movie, but with a bit of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] thrown in\".<ref name=\"Carroll\" /> Hopkins stated, \"I'm very interested in that relationship between fathers and sons\", and that, \"My father's relationship with me was cold. He was a hot-blood character but to me, cold. When I was young, he expressed his disappointment because I was bad in school and all of that. He didn't mean any harm, but I felt I could never meet up to his expectations.\" Hopkins expressed that he found a personal resonance in the Odin role, saying, \"He's a stern man. He's a man with purpose. I play the god who banishes his son from the kingdom of Asgard because he screwed up. He's a hot-headed, temperamental young man... probably a chip off of the old block but I decide he's not really ready to rule the future kingdom, so I banish him. I'm harsh and my wife complains and I say, 'That is why I'm king.' He's ruthless, take-it-or-leave-it. Women are much more forgiving; men are not so forgiving.

Dallas mentioned that [[Errol Flynn]] was an inspiration for the character stating, \"He was a big inspiration for the character and for me.

Jackson]], who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury at the end of the film ''Iron Man'', signed on to reprise the role in ''Thor'' as part of an unprecedented nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"samjackson\" /> In the same month, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor.<ref name=\"Brady\" />\n\nHowever, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in ''Thor''. When asked why not Jackson explained, \"I have no idea. I'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. I thought I was; they said I was in the trades, and I was like, 'Ooh! I got a job!' I called my agent he said, 'Naw, you're not in it.' I was like, 'Well shit, they need to pay me if they're gonna put my name in it.{{Single double}}<ref name=\"Yamato\" /> Later in the month, Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for ''Thor'' to serve as \"connective tissue\" for ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"Davis2\" />\n\nIn May 2009, [[Chris Hemsworth]] was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, [[Liam Hemsworth|Liam]] also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]].<ref name=\"hemsworth\" /> The next day, Marvel announced that [[Tom Hiddleston]], who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki.<ref name=\"hiddleston\" /> In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on.<ref name=\"feigehemsworth\" /> Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included.<ref name=\"feigehemsworth\" /> In July 2009, Marvel announced that [[Natalie Portman]] would portray Jane Foster.<ref name=\"portman\" /> [[Jaimie Alexander]] and [[Colm Feore]] were reported to have joined the cast in September, with Alexander portraying [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain.<ref name=\"alexander\" /> In an interview with Swedish news site ''Ystads Allehanda'', [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> By late October [[Anthony Hopkins]] had been cast as [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] in the film.<ref name=\"hopkins\" /> The following month, Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three; Fandral was to be played by [[Stuart Townsend]], Hogun was to be played by [[Tadanobu Asano]] and Volstagg was to be played by [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]].<ref name=\"three\" /> [[Idris Elba]] was announced to have joined the cast, portraying Heimdall.<ref name=\"elba\" /> Natalie Portman revealed that [[Kat Dennings]] would be involved in the project, portraying Darcy, a coworker of Portman's Jane Foster.<ref name=\"darcy\" /><ref name=\"kat\" />\n\nIn December 2009, [[Rene Russo]] was cast as [[Frigga (Marvel Comics)|Frigga]], Thor's stepmother and Odin's wife.<ref name=\"frigga\" /> Later that month, actors Joseph Gatt, [[Troy Brenna]], and Joshua Cox had been cast in the film, though none of their roles were revealed.<ref name=\"newactors\" /> In January 2010, Adriana Barraza had joined the film's cast, in a supporting capacity.<ref name=\"barraza\" /> Only days before filming began, Stuart Townsend was replaced by [[Joshua Dallas]] as Fandral, citing \"creative differences\".<ref name=\"townsendexit\" /> When ''[[Spider-Man 4]]''{{'}}s production stalled, Paramount and Marvel Entertainment pushed up the release of ''Thor'' by two weeks to May 6, 2011.<ref name=\"date\" />\n\nThe [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] introduced Marvel Entertainment, Kenneth Branagh, \"the screenwriter, and a few people on the design and production side of things\" to three physicists ([[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]], [[Kevin Hand]], and Jim Hartle), as well as physics student Kevin Hickerson, to provide a realistic science background for the Thor universe. The consultation resulted in a change in Jane Foster's profession, from nurse to particle physicist, and the terminology ([[Einstein-Rosen bridge]]) to describe the [[Bifrost Bridge]].<ref name=\"SEE\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:KennethBranaghApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Director [[Kenneth Branagh]] promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\nIn October 2008, Marvel Studios signed a long-term lease agreement with Raleigh Studios to photograph their next four films\u2014''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor'', ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''\u2014at Raleigh's [[Manhattan Beach, California]] facility.<ref name=\"RaleighStudios\" /> ''Production Weekly'' reported that filming on Marvel's ''Thor'' was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles mid-January, then move to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] from March until late-April.<ref name=\"Baxter\" /> [[Principal photography]] began on January 11, 2010.<ref name=\"thorfilmingbegins\" /> A few days after filming began, Clark Gregg signed on to reprise his role from ''Iron Man'' and ''Iron Man 2'' as Agent Coulson.<ref name=\"coulson\" /> In February, Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with [[Del Mar, California]] to use a 300-yard stretch of beach to film a scene for ''Thor'' involving six horses running down the terrain. Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film.<ref name=\"delmar\" /> On March 15, 2010, production of ''Thor'' moved to [[Galisteo, New Mexico]] where [[Cerro Pelon Ranch]],<ref name=\"CerroPelonRanch\" /> an old-fashioned Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.<ref name=\"Bord\" /><ref name=\"Paramount\" />\n\nBranagh, a fan of the comic book since childhood, commented on the challenge of bridging Asgard and the modern world: \"Inspired by the comic book world both pictorially and compositionally at once, we've tried to find a way to make a virtue and a celebration of the distinction between the worlds that exist in the film but absolutely make them live in the same world. It's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds. If it succeeds, it will mark this film as different.... The combination of the primitive and the sophisticated, the ancient and the modern, I think that potentially is the exciting fusion, the exciting tension in the film\".<ref name=\"Boucher3\" />\n\nBy April, the prospect for filming parts of ''Thor'' in Del Mar, California had fallen through. Paramount Pictures sent a letter informing the city that it has instead chosen an undisclosed [[Northern California]] location to film a beachfront scene for the film. The letter cited cost concerns with moving production too far away from its headquarters.<ref name=\"Horn\" /> Filming wrapped on May 6, 2010.<ref name=\"huver\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Thor \u2013 Bifrost sequence.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = HubblePAO.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer            = The film's [[Bifr\u00f6st]] travel sequences (top) were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography (bottom).\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nIn October 2010, casting calls revealed the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots.<ref name=\"rehoots\" /> In March 2011, scenes involving Adriana Barraza were removed from the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future. In response Barraza stated, \"It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut\".<ref name=\"Esmas\" /> Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. In that same month, Douglas Tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants.<ref name=\"tait\" /> On his hiring, Tait said \"I am 6'5\" and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7\" and taller, and weighed over {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=out}}. When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants\".<ref name=\"tait\" /> In April 2011, the [[IMAX Corporation]], Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in [[IMAX 3D]], continuing the partnership which began on ''Iron Man 2''.<ref name=\"imax\" /> Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said \"We came to feel that in our case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience\". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the \"special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D\".<ref name=\"3d\" /> The [[post-credits scene]] that sees [[Nick Fury]] approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by ''The Avengers''{{'}}s director, [[Joss Whedon]].<ref name=\"Hewitt\" />\n\n[[BUF Compagnie]] served as the lead [[visual effects]] vendor working on the film,<ref name=\"bufcompagnie\" /> with [[Digital Domain]] also providing work on the film.<ref name=\"digitaldomain\" /> Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by [[J. M. W. Turner]] to Digital Domain when creating [[J\u00f6tunheimr|Jotunheim]].<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of [[Fuel VFX]], said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifr\u00f6st would look like, \"You can't [[Google]] what these things look like\u2014they are totally imagined and within the heads of the stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifr\u00f6st and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo.<ref name=\"Frei\" /> In the film, Odin enters what is known as the \"Odinsleep\" in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, \"For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space\".<ref name=\"Frei\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Thor (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nThe film's score was written by composer [[Patrick Doyle]], a frequent collaborator of Branagh. Doyle described ''Thor'' as \"the most commercially high profile film I have done since ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Frankenstein]]''\",<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find a tone that fit the duality of Asgard and Earth. Thus Doyle and Branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction,<ref name=\"MotG\" /> with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having a balance between the music and \"grand images [that] were not in any way hyperbolized\", and the composer in turn implementing \"a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work\". As Doyle declared that his own [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] background made him familiar with Norse mythology, an old Celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for Thor's leitmotif.<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> A soundtrack album was released by [[Buena Vista Records]] in April 2011.<ref name=\"filmmusicreporter\" />\n\nThe film also features a song by the [[Foo Fighters]], \"[[Walk (Foo Fighters song)|Walk]]\", in both a scene where a powerless Thor shares some [[Boilermaker (beer cocktail)|boilermakers]] with Selvig in a roadhouse, and the film's closing credits. Marvel president Kevin Feige stated that \"Walk\" was a last minute addition, that the crew felt had \"these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes\" upon hearing it. Branagh in particular thought that \"these lyrics about learning to walk again\" were appropriate \"of [a] movie about redemption, learning to be a hero.\"<ref name=\"Boucher4\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Thor Comic-Con Panel.jpg|thumb|right|Hemsworth, Portman, Dennings and Hiddleston at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn July 2010 Marvel Studios held a ''Thor'' panel at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] during which Kenneth Branagh, Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg discussed the film and showed some clips from it.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> A few days later, this footage was leaked on the internet.<ref name=\"Fleming6\" /> The first television advertisement was broadcast during [[Super Bowl XLV]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in the United States.

The 2-disc and 3-disc packs includes a digital copy, the first in a series of [[Marvel One-Shots]], ''The Consultant'', and 7 behind-the-scenes featurettes.<ref name=\"DVD Release\" />\n\nBranagh said that the DVD includes at least 20 minutes of [[deleted scene]]s. Branagh stated the footage contains \"things like the Asgardian parents, Odin and Frigga, played by the beautiful Rene Russo, there's some beautiful scenes in there that I think people will enjoy. And certainly Thor and Loki interacting in different ways that just fill in a little bit of a back story, that was part of our rehearsal and research.\"<ref name=\"Marshall4\" /> In its first week of release, ''Thor'' took the number one spot on Blu-ray/DVD sales chart and topped ''[[Home Media Magazine]]'''s rental chart for the week.<ref name=\"Arnold\" />\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home Media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"PhaseOneSetAnnounced\" /> It was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"PhaseOneSetDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Boxset release\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Thor'' earned $181&nbsp;million in [[North America]] and $268.3&nbsp;million in other territories for a worldwide total of $449.3&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\"/> It was the 15th highest-grossing film of 2011.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo4\" />\n\n''Thor'' earned $25.5 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada, including $3.3 million from Thursday previews,<ref name=\"BOWknd1\" /> for a total weekend gross of $65.7 million. $6.2 million of the gross came from IMAX 3D, while 60% of the gross was from 3D screenings.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo5\" /><ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo6\" /> It became the tenth highest-grossing film of 2011 in the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo7\"/> and the highest-grossing comic-book film from May\u2013August 2011.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo8\"/>\n\n''Thor''{{'}}s opening in Australia generated $5.8 million and placing second behind [[Universal Pictures]]' ''[[Fast Five]]''.

From early in its life the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use, and in 1902 an Admiralty Circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially. Such use was given Parliamentary approval in 1908 when it was stated that 'the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag'.\"</ref>\n\nThe current design of the Union Jack dates from the [[Act of Union 1801]] which united the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (previously in [[personal union]]) to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].

Recent reforms are shifting professional education from an undergraduate [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] to a postgraduate [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] type of education. In addition, many Korean universities continue to offer legal education in academic and scholastic frameworks, offering graduate degrees, including Ph.D.s in Law. \nFurther, several universities focus on legal systems outside of Korea, such as on Common Law.\n\n==Admission and Law School Ranking==\nSince the implementation of the 2007 Act calling for reform in legal education, law schools in Korea became graduate schools (similar to the US system) and require a [[bachelor's degree]], a satisfactory undergraduate [[grade point average]], foreign language proficiency, and a satisfactory score on the [[Legal Education Eligibility Test]] (LEET) in order to be considered for admission (the LEET is modeled after Law School Admission Test ([[LSAT]]) in the US).  Additional factors are evaluated through essays, interviews, school administered essay exams, and other application materials.\n\nThe 2012\u20132019 Top 10 Law School Ranking from Hankyung Business Magazine was:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://magazine.hankyung.com/business/apps/news?popup=0&nid=01&c1=1011&nkey=2017101601142000101&mode=sub_view|title=\uc9c0\ubc29 \ub85c\uc2a4\ucfe8 \uc57d\uc9c4...10\uc704\uad8c 3\uac1c \ub300\ud559 \uc785\uc131|date=2017-10-17|website=magazine.hankyung.com|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n# [[Seoul National University Law School]]\n# [[Korea University Law School]]\n# [[Yonsei Law School]]\n# [[Sungkyunkwan University Law School]]\n# [[Hanyang University]] Law School\n# [[Sogang University Law School ]]\n# [[Ewha Law School]]\n# [[Pusan National University School of Law]]\n# [[Chonnam National University Law School]]\n# [[Kyungpook National University Law School]]\n\n==Law School System in Transition==\n\nIn [[South Korea]], a '''[[law school]]''' was an undergraduate institution where students major in law and are awarded a ''L\u00e9gum Baccalaureus'', or [[LL.B.]] (Bachelor of Laws).  Following graduation, candidates must take and pass the [[bar exam]].  Under the present judiciary exam (as of 2008), the number of new lawyers admitted each year was limited to 1,000.  Successful candidates must then complete the mandatory 2 years of training courses at the '''Judicial Research & Training Institute (JRTI)''' in order to join the bar in Korea. The JRTI is managed by the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, as a result of a bill passed in July 2007, the education system for legal studies will soon undergo significant changes.  The 2007 Act calls for the adoption of a separate law school system similar to that of the [[United States]], with the new graduate-level law schools expected to open by 2009.  Only a limited number of [[universities]] will be permitted to establish such graduate-level [[law school]]s, as determined by the relevant government agency after its review of each university's submitted materials.  In February 2008, the Education Ministry released a final selection of 25 universities approved for the new graduate-level law schools (15 in the [[Seoul]] metropolitan area and 10 in the provinces).  The selection process itself has not been without controversy; upon release of the final list, some of the excluded universities threatened to sue for an injunction or stage protest rallies, and one university president threatened to resign.\n\nUnder the new system, those who have bachelor's degrees can apply for law schools which have three-year programs and the graduates can then take the bar exam; those who achieve a certain score (or above) will be licensed.  In addition, based on an October 2007 revised plan submitted by Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development, the law school admission is limited to 2,000 candidates.\n\nThe bar passage rate in South Korea is around 50%, yet declining rapidly due to restraints on the number of lawyers admitted to the bar association. Only approximately 1500 people can be admitted to the Bar annually. More and more students who already graduated law school are retaking the Bar exam, which may cause issues with law school system in Korea.\n\n==Republic of Korea Law Schools==\n\nUniversities with their government approved annual enrollment of students:<ref>[http://www.fnnews.com/view?ra=Sent1201m_View&corp=fnnews&arcid=00000921224211&cDateYear=2008&cDateMonth=02&cDateDay=04 Financial News Feb.4,2008 25 law school confirmed (in Korean)]</ref>\n\nIn February 2008, the Ministry of Education released a final selection of 25 universities approved for the new graduate-level (J.D.-style) law schools.

Those schools not only teach common law, but also teach most or all of their classes in English.

Recent reforms are shifting professional education from an undergraduate [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] to a postgraduate [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] type of education. In addition, many Korean universities continue to offer legal education in academic and scholastic frameworks, offering graduate degrees, including Ph.D.s in Law. \nFurther, several universities focus on legal systems outside of Korea, such as on Common Law.\n\n==Admission and Law School Ranking==\nSince the implementation of the 2007 Act calling for reform in legal education, law schools in Korea became graduate schools (similar to the US system) and require a [[bachelor's degree]], a satisfactory undergraduate [[grade point average]], foreign language proficiency, and a satisfactory score on the [[Legal Education Eligibility Test]] (LEET) in order to be considered for admission (the LEET is modeled after Law School Admission Test ([[LSAT]]) in the US).  Additional factors are evaluated through essays, interviews, school administered essay exams, and other application materials.\n\nLaw School Ranking in South Korea\n\n2012~2019 the top 10 Law School Ranking from Hankyung Business Magazine<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://magazine.hankyung.com/business/apps/news?popup=0&nid=01&c1=1011&nkey=2017101601142000101&mode=sub_view|title=\uc9c0\ubc29 \ub85c\uc2a4\ucfe8 \uc57d\uc9c4...10\uc704\uad8c 3\uac1c \ub300\ud559 \uc785\uc131|date=2017-10-17|website=magazine.hankyung.com|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n# Seoul National University\n# Korea\n# Yonsei\n# Sungkyunkwan\n# Hanyang\n# Sogang\n# Ewha\n# Pusan National\n# Chonnam National\n# Kyungpook National\n# etc 15 lawschool\n\n<br />\n\n==Law School System in Transition==\n\nIn [[South Korea]], a '''[[law school]]''' was an undergraduate institution where students major in law and are awarded a ''L\u00e9gum Baccalaureus'', or [[LL.B.]] (Bachelor of Laws).  Following graduation, candidates must take and pass the [[bar exam]].  Under the present judiciary exam (as of 2008), the number of new lawyers admitted each year was limited to 1,000.  Successful candidates must then complete the mandatory 2 years of training courses at the '''Judicial Research & Training Institute (JRTI)''' in order to join the bar in Korea. The JRTI is managed by the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, as a result of a bill passed in July 2007, the education system for legal studies will soon undergo significant changes.  The 2007 Act calls for the adoption of a separate law school system similar to that of the [[United States]], with the new graduate-level law schools expected to open by 2009.  Only a limited number of [[universities]] will be permitted to establish such graduate-level [[law school]]s, as determined by the relevant government agency after its review of each university's submitted materials.  In February 2008, the Education Ministry released a final selection of 25 universities approved for the new graduate-level law schools (15 in the [[Seoul]] metropolitan area and 10 in the provinces).  The selection process itself has not been without controversy; upon release of the final list, some of the excluded universities threatened to sue for an injunction or stage protest rallies, and one university president threatened to resign.\n\nUnder the new system, those who have bachelor's degrees can apply for law schools which have three-year programs and the graduates can then take the bar exam; those who achieve a certain score (or above) will be licensed.  In addition, based on an October 2007 revised plan submitted by Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development, the law school admission is limited to 2,000 candidates.\n\nThe bar passage rate in South Korea is around 50%, yet declining rapidly due to restraints on the number of lawyers admitted to the bar association. Only approximately 1500 people can be admitted to the Bar annually. More and more students who already graduated law school are retaking the Bar exam, which may cause issues with law school system in Korea.\n\n==Republic of Korea Law Schools==\n\nUniversities with their government approved annual enrollment of students:<ref>[http://www.fnnews.com/view?ra=Sent1201m_View&corp=fnnews&arcid=00000921224211&cDateYear=2008&cDateMonth=02&cDateDay=04 Financial News Feb.4,2008 25 law school confirmed (in Korean)]</ref>\n\nIn February 2008, the Ministry of Education released a final selection of 25 universities approved for the new graduate-level (J.D.-style) law schools.

The LS was introduced in June 1999 as a 2000 model-year vehicle with either a V6 engine (which was offered with a [[manual transmission]]) or a [[V8 engine]], both featuring [[rear-wheel drive]] and near 50/50 [[weight distribution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/lincoln/ls/ |title=Lincoln LS |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref>\n\nThe LS shared the [[Ford DEW platform|Ford DEW98 platform]], along with the [[Jaguar S-Type]] and the [[Ford Thunderbird (eleventh generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]. The Lincoln LS was originally to be marketed in two versions: the '''LS6''' and the '''LS8''' (the names had reflected the vehicle's engine sizes), however, [[Toyota]]'s [[Lexus]] division became concerned about the potential name confusion with its [[Lexus LS]] and Lincoln ended up using only the name \"LS\".<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FullTests/articleId=44148 Edmunds.com Inside Line - ''Stars, Stripes and a Healthy Dose of Das Vaterland'' - 01 Jan 1999]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825131349/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FullTests/articleId%3D44148 |date=August 25, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nTrim levels ranged from the base [[V6]] model to the Special Edition V8 LSE trims in 2004, which featured revised front and rear fascia, taillights and foglights, and front grille.\n\nLS models were manufactured at [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s [[Wixom Assembly Plant]] until production ended on April 3, 2006 and the plant was idled as part of  Ford's [[The Way Forward]]. Approximately 262,900 LS models were manufactured, including 2,331 manual transmission V6 models, and 1,500 LSE editions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/04/03/lincoln-ls-run-will-end/ |title=Lincoln LS run will end |work=LeftLaneNews |date=April 3, 2006}}</ref>\n{{TOC left}}\n{{-}}\n\n==2000\u20132002==\n[[File:2001 Lincoln LS -- NHTSA.jpg|thumb|left|2001 Lincoln LS]]\nIn 1999, the LS debuted as Lincoln's first rear-wheel drive sport luxury sedan for the 2000 model year, under influence from the newly established [[Premier Automotive Group]]. In designing the LS to be competitive in its segment (which was also shared with its domestic rival, the [[Cadillac Catera]], which debuted in 1996), Helmuth Schrader, the LS' German-born chief designer, said of the car, \"In a segment defined and dominated by BMW and Mercedes, the car had to have a functional, no-nonsense look. This redefines the Lincoln brand, but we still had to make sure it was recognizable as a member of the same family as the [[Lincoln Town Car#Third generation (1998\u20132011)|Town Car]], [[Lincoln Continental#Ninth generation (1995\u20132002)|Continental]], [[Lincoln Mark VIII|Mark VIII]], and the [[Lincoln Navigator|Navigator]].\"<ref>Phelan, Mark. \"Lincoln LS: Ford's car du jour.\" [[Automotive Industries (magazine)|Automotive Industries Magazine]]. September, 1998.</ref> Heeding this insight, the LS featured an understated, well-proportioned exterior design with squared rectangular fog lights. The body was tightly sculpted with short front and rear overhangs to emphasize an athletic appearance while well-rounded wheel housings were intentionally made small to suggest that the car's wheels were larger than their actual size. The [[Greenhouse (automotive term)|greenhouse]] of the LS offered spacious headroom and was accentuated by a smoothly arched roofline. Completing the exterior were chrome accents on the front and rear fascias and a waterfall grille.\n\nRelative to the exterior, the interior of the LS bore a stronger resemblance to the S-Type, with a similar dashboard layout, gauges, and controls. The interior of the LS was simple, straightforward, and comfortable. Large gauges were designed to convey sportiness, while other controls, such as audio and climate controls, were positioned in the car's center stack for convenience to both the driver and the front passenger. The steering wheel could be wood- and leather-wrapped while wood accents continued around the interior on the door panels and dashboard area. Leather seating surfaces were standard and the front power bucket seats were bolstered for a firm feel like the LS' European competitors. Other standard interior features included power windows, power door locks with keyless entry, power heated mirrors, automatic headlights, air conditioning with automatic climate control, cruise control, and an AM/FM cassette radio. Some of the available options included a six-disc in-dash CD changer (only accessible through the glove box initially; changed on later models), a power moonroof, and a universal garage door opener.\n\n[[File:02LSDash.jpg|thumb|right|Instrument panel and dash area of a 2002 Lincoln LS: Other model years are similar.]]\nAs mentioned above, the Lincoln LS shared a platform and equipment with the Jaguar S-Type. The [[Ford DEW platform|DEW98]] platform on which the cars were based was a rigid chassis that featured [[Independent suspension|independent]] [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] (short-long arm; SLA) front and rear suspensions for excellent handling and ride quality. Enhancing ride quality further, as well as increasing interior space, was the LS' large {{convert|114.5|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase. Four-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|antilock]] disc brakes were standard while Ford's ''AdvanceTrac'' [[traction control system]] was available as an option for improved driving control. A number of suspension components, as well as the hood, decklid, and front fenders, used [[aluminum]] to save weight. The LS came with standard 16-inch alloy wheels while 17-inch wheels were available through an optional sport package. The sport package for only an extra $1000.00, gave a stiffer suspension, 17-inch rims and a \"slap shift\" selecter. The battery of the LS was positioned in the spare tire well inside the car's trunk because too little room for it was left in the engine bay. However, moving the heavy battery and its interconnecting cables to the rear of the vehicle contributed to its near-50/50 weight distribution.\n\nThe base LS was powered by an all-aluminum 3.0 L [[DOHC]] V6 that was a variant of the [[Jaguar AJ-V6 engine]]. Optional in the LS was an all-aluminum 3.9 L DOHC V8, a shorter-stroke variant of the Jaguar 4.0 L [[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine|AJ-26]] V8. The V8 was not offered as a manual because the Getrag could not handle the torque produced. Both engines required premium-grade gasoline for optimum performance. Ford's [[Ford Bordeaux Automatic Transmissions#5R44E/5R55E/N/S/W|5R55S]] five-speed automatic transmission with an optional manual shift ability called ''SelectShift'' was standard with either engine, while a [[Getrag#Products|Getrag 221]] five-speed [[manual transmission]] was available for V6-equipped LS models through an optional sport package. Automatic transmission-equipped cars featured a 3.58:1 rear-axle ratio, while manual transmission-equipped versions came with a 3.07:1 rear-axle ratio. The available manual transmission made the LS the first Lincoln since the 1951 [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan|Cosmopolitan]] to have this option. In spite of this, Lincoln stopped production of the manual-transmission model LS after 2002 due to low sales figures; only 2,331 were produced. Road tests by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' and ''[[Car and Driver]]'' found that a V8-equipped LS could accelerate from zero to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in the low seven-second range, while V6 models were up to two seconds slower in the same test.\n\nThe LS was named ''Motor Trend's'' [[Car of the Year]] for 2000, and was nominated for the [[North American Car of the Year]] award, as well.  Early 2000 LS models included a full-sized spare tire. This was changed (starting in February 2000) to a space-saving spare tire, to reduce weight to keep the car in the mid-size class per government specifications. However, the spare tire well in all LS models still has space for a full-sized spare.\n\nThe powertrain control module in 2000-2002 automatic transmission models with the ''SelectShift'' option originally would not allow the car to start off in first gear when shifting manually (the car started in second gear). It would quickly shift to first gear, however, if the throttle were<!-- subjunctive --> depressed more than 60%. Second-gear starts were programmed to meet fuel economy regulations as required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. This was changed in 2003 when the regulations were amended and first-gear starts were permitted.\n\nIn 2002, the LSE (Limited Special Edition) package was introduced in V6 and V8 versions, with a revised fascia including round fog lamp openings and a special metallic grille treatment, and with enlarged lower body rocker panels, special wheels, and twin dual-exhaust tailpipes. Also for 2002, V6-equipped LS models gained {{convert|10|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|10|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Years\n!Model\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Fuel Economy, City/Hwy\n!Transmission\n|-\n|2000&ndash;2001||LS V6||{{convert|2967|cc|L cuin|0|abbr=on}} [[Jaguar AJ-V6 engine|''Jaguar AJ'' V6]] |||{{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 6500&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|205|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4750&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} / {{convert|25|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}||Getrag 221 manual & 5R55N automatic\n|-\n|2002||LS V6||{{convert|2967|cc|L cuin|0|abbr=on}} [[Jaguar AJ-V6 engine|''Jaguar AJ'' V6]] |||{{convert|220|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 6400&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|215|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4800&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} / {{convert|25|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}||Getrag 221 manual & 5R55N automatic\n|-\n|2000&ndash;2002||LS V8||{{convert|3934|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#3.9|''Jaguar AJ-V8'']]||{{convert|252|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 6100&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|267|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4300&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|17|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} / {{convert|23|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}||5R55N automatic\n|}\n\n==2003\u20132006==\n[[File:2004 Lincoln LS -- NHTSA.jpg|thumb|left|2004 Lincoln LS]]\n[[File:Lincoln LS 2006 2.jpg|thumb|left|2006 Lincoln LS]]\nThe Lincoln LS received its first, and only, major refresh for 2003, coinciding with Lincoln's then-new \"Travel Well\" ad campaign. The exterior received a slight facelift, with [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] headlamps (optional), and a revised trunklid with new taillights. For the powertrains, both available engines received a boost in power and torque, as well as slightly improved fuel efficiency. The 3.0&nbsp;L DOHC [[V6]] with which the LS was introduced now featured [[Variable Cam Timing|continuously variable intake cam timing]], improved [[Variable length intake manifold|variable-length intake runners]], and electronic [[Drive by wire|\"drive-by-wire\"]] throttle control (which replaced the traditional mechanical cable-linked throttle control system used previously).

The LS was introduced in June 1999 as a 2000 model-year vehicle with either a V6 engine (which was offered with a [[manual transmission]]) or a [[V8 engine]], both featuring [[rear-wheel drive]] and near 50/50 [[weight distribution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/lincoln/ls/ |title=Lincoln LS |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=2010-08-11 |accessdate=2011-08-01}}</ref>\n\nThe LS shared the [[Ford DEW platform|Ford DEW98 platform]], along with the [[Jaguar S-Type]] and the [[Ford Thunderbird (eleventh generation)|Ford Thunderbird]]. The Lincoln LS was originally to be marketed in two versions: the '''LS6''' and the '''LS8''' (the names had reflected the vehicle's engine sizes), however, [[Toyota]]'s [[Lexus]] division became concerned about the potential name confusion with its [[Lexus LS]] and Lincoln ended up using only the name \"LS\".<ref>[http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FullTests/articleId=44148 Edmunds.com Inside Line - ''Stars, Stripes and a Healthy Dose of Das Vaterland'' - 01 Jan 1999]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080825131349/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FullTests/articleId%3D44148 |date=August 25, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nTrim levels ranged from the base [[V6]] model to the Special Edition V8 LSE trims in 2004, which featured revised front and rear fascia, taillights and foglights, and front grille.\n\nLS models were manufactured at [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s [[Wixom Assembly Plant]] until production ended on April 3, 2006 and the plant was idled as part of  Ford's [[The Way Forward]]. Approximately 262,900 LS models were manufactured, including 2,331 manual transmission V6 models, and 1,500 LSE editions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/2006/04/03/lincoln-ls-run-will-end/ |title=Lincoln LS run will end |work=LeftLaneNews |date=April 3, 2006}}</ref>\n{{TOC left}}\n{{-}}\n\n==2000\u20132002==\n[[File:2001 Lincoln LS -- NHTSA.jpg|thumb|left|2001 Lincoln LS]]\nIn 1999, the LS debuted as Lincoln's first rear-wheel drive sport luxury sedan for the 2000 model year, under influence from the newly established [[Premier Automotive Group]]. In designing the LS to be competitive in its segment (which was also shared with its domestic rival, the [[Cadillac Catera]], which debuted in 1996), Helmuth Schrader, the LS' German-born chief designer, said of the car, \"In a segment defined and dominated by BMW and Mercedes, the car had to have a functional, no-nonsense look. This redefines the Lincoln brand, but we still had to make sure it was recognizable as a member of the same family as the [[Lincoln Town Car#Third generation (1998\u20132011)|Town Car]], [[Lincoln Continental#Ninth generation (1995\u20132002)|Continental]], [[Lincoln Mark VIII|Mark VIII]], and the [[Lincoln Navigator|Navigator]].\"<ref>Phelan, Mark. \"Lincoln LS: Ford's car du jour.\" [[Automotive Industries (magazine)|Automotive Industries Magazine]]. September, 1998.</ref> Heeding this insight, the LS featured an understated, well-proportioned exterior design with squared rectangular fog lights. The body was tightly sculpted with short front and rear overhangs to emphasize an athletic appearance while well-rounded wheel housings were intentionally made small to suggest that the car's wheels were larger than their actual size. The [[Greenhouse (automotive term)|greenhouse]] of the LS offered spacious headroom and was accentuated by a smoothly arched roofline. Completing the exterior were chrome accents on the front and rear fascias and a waterfall grille.\n\nRelative to the exterior, the interior of the LS bore a stronger resemblance to the S-Type, with a similar dashboard layout, gauges, and controls. The interior of the LS was simple, straightforward, and comfortable. Large gauges were designed to convey sportiness, while other controls, such as audio and climate controls, were positioned in the car's center stack for convenience to both the driver and the front passenger. The steering wheel could be wood- and leather-wrapped while wood accents continued around the interior on the door panels and dashboard area. Leather seating surfaces were standard and the front power bucket seats were bolstered for a firm feel like the LS' European competitors. Other standard interior features included power windows, power door locks with keyless entry, power heated mirrors, automatic headlights, air conditioning with automatic climate control, cruise control, and an AM/FM cassette radio. Some of the available options included a six-disc in-dash CD changer (only accessible through the glove box initially; changed on later models), a power moonroof, and a universal garage door opener.\n\n[[File:02LSDash.jpg|thumb|right|Instrument panel and dash area of a 2002 Lincoln LS: Other model years are similar.]]\nAs mentioned above, the Lincoln LS shared a platform and equipment with the Jaguar S-Type. The [[Ford DEW platform|DEW98]] platform on which the cars were based was a rigid chassis that featured [[Independent suspension|independent]] [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] (short-long arm; SLA) front and rear suspensions for excellent handling and ride quality. Enhancing ride quality further, as well as increasing interior space, was the LS' large {{convert|114.5|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase. Four-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|antilock]] disc brakes were standard while Ford's ''AdvanceTrac'' [[traction control system]] was available as an option for improved driving control. A number of suspension components, as well as the hood, decklid, and front fenders, used [[aluminum]] to save weight. The LS came with standard 16-inch alloy wheels while 17-inch wheels were available through an optional sport package. The sport package for only an extra $1000.00, gave a stiffer suspension, 17-inch rims and a \"slap shift\" selecter. The battery of the LS was positioned in the spare tire well inside the car's trunk because too little room for it was left in the engine bay. However, moving the heavy battery and its interconnecting cables to the rear of the vehicle contributed to its near-50/50 weight distribution.\n\nThe base LS was powered by an all-aluminum 3.0 L [[DOHC]] V6 that was a variant of the [[Jaguar AJ-V6 engine]]. Optional in the LS was an all-aluminum 3.9 L DOHC V8, a shorter-stroke variant of the Jaguar 4.0 L [[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine|AJ-26]] V8. The V8 was not offered as a manual because the Getrag could not handle the torque produced. Both engines required premium-grade gasoline for optimum performance. Ford's [[Ford Bordeaux Automatic Transmissions#5R44E/5R55E/N/S/W|5R55S]] five-speed automatic transmission with an optional manual shift ability called ''SelectShift'' was standard with either engine, while a [[Getrag#Products|Getrag 221]] five-speed [[manual transmission]] was available for V6-equipped LS models through an optional sport package. Automatic transmission-equipped cars featured a 3.58:1 rear-axle ratio, while manual transmission-equipped versions came with a 3.07:1 rear-axle ratio. The available manual transmission made the LS the first Lincoln since the 1951 [[Lincoln Cosmopolitan|Cosmopolitan]] to have this option. In spite of this, Lincoln stopped production of the manual-transmission model LS after 2002 due to low sales figures; only 2,331 were produced. Road tests by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' and ''[[Car and Driver]]'' found that a V8-equipped LS could accelerate from zero to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in the low seven-second range, while V6 models were up to two seconds slower in the same test.\n\nThe LS was named ''Motor Trend's'' [[Car of the Year]] for 2000, and was nominated for the [[North American Car of the Year]] award, as well.  Early 2000 LS models included a full-sized spare tire. This was changed (starting in February 2000) to a space-saving spare tire, to reduce weight to keep the car in the mid-size class per government specifications. However, the spare tire well in all LS models still has space for a full-sized spare.\n\nThe powertrain control module in 2000-2002 automatic transmission models with the ''SelectShift'' option originally would not allow the car to start off in first gear when shifting manually (the car started in second gear). It would quickly shift to first gear, however, if the throttle were<!-- subjunctive --> depressed more than 60%. Second-gear starts were programmed to meet fuel economy regulations as required by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]. This was changed in 2003 when the regulations were amended and first-gear starts were permitted.\n\nIn 2002, the LSE (Limited Special Edition) package was introduced in V6 and V8 versions, with a revised fascia including round fog lamp openings and a special metallic grille treatment, and with enlarged lower body rocker panels, special wheels, and twin dual-exhaust tailpipes. Also for 2002, V6-equipped LS models gained {{convert|10|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|10|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Years\n!Model\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Fuel Economy, City/Hwy\n!Transmission\n|-\n|2000&ndash;2001||LS V6||{{convert|2967|cc|L cuin|0|abbr=on}} [[Jaguar AJ-V6 engine|''Jaguar AJ'' V6]] |||{{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 6500&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|205|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4750&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} / {{convert|25|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}||Getrag 221 manual & 5R55N automatic\n|-\n|2002||LS V6||{{convert|2967|cc|L cuin|0|abbr=on}} [[Jaguar AJ-V6 engine|''Jaguar AJ'' V6]] |||{{convert|220|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 6400&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|215|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4800&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|18|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} / {{convert|25|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}||Getrag 221 manual & 5R55N automatic\n|-\n|2000&ndash;2002||LS V8||{{convert|3934|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Jaguar AJ-V8 engine#3.9|''Jaguar AJ-V8'']]||{{convert|252|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 6100&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|267|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 4300&nbsp;rpm||{{convert|17|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} / {{convert|23|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}||5R55N automatic\n|}\n\n==2003\u20132006==\n[[File:2004 Lincoln LS -- NHTSA.jpg|thumb|left|2004 Lincoln LS]]\n[[File:Lincoln LS 2006 2.jpg|thumb|left|2006 Lincoln LS]]\nThe Lincoln LS received its first, and only, major refresh for 2003, coinciding with Lincoln's then-new \"Travel Well\" ad campaign.

Following his education, he stayed in London and entered the Civil Service. He became very friendly with [[Arthur Griffith]] and Michael Collins at this time. In 1905, he was present at the establishment of the Sinn F\u00e9in organisation in London, and in November 1909, according to some sources, he initiated Michael Collins into Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB).  He was a prominent member of the Geraldines [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] Club in London, and he was for many years its President. In 1909 he became Secretary of the London County Board of the GAA.\n\nIn 1910 he was transferred to the [[Irish Land Commission]] in Dublin.\n\n==1916 and after==\nBelton took part in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. His obituary in the ''[[Longford Leader]]'' noted that he \"...was associated with Michael Collins and other London comrades when they came to Ireland in 1916 for the Rising. After the Rising he was suspended from the Land Commission on suspicion of having been connected with the event, but was later reinstated\". A detailed narrative of his activities during the 1916 Rising is contained in a handwritten letter he sent in 1937 to M\u00e1ire English, supporting her claim to a Military Service Pension. It suggests that he was either physically in the GPO at some stage during the Rising, or in some way attached to the insurgents based there.<ref>http://www.militaryarchives.ie/collections/online-collections/military-service-pensions-collection (File Reference MSP34REF24424).</ref>\n\nAfter reports in 1918 that 'large bodies of Sinn F\u00e9iners' had assembled and were drilling on his lands, the police raided his house on 30 July. While some of those present managed to escape, two revolvers and more than fifty rounds of ammunition were discovered in the house. Various papers were found which showed Belton's involvement with the Irish National Aid Association, the Irish Volunteer Dependants' Fund, Sinn F\u00e9in, and the Patriots' Graves Committee. There was a pass admitting the bearer to the graveside of [[Thomas Ashe]] on the day of his funeral. On 31 August 1918, Belton was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment with hard labour for possessing arms and ammunition. He served his sentence in Mountjoy and Belfast jails.\n\nIn the [[1923 Irish general election|1923 general election]], he stood unsuccessfully for the [[National Democratic Party (Ireland)|National Democratic Party]] in [[Laois\u2013Offaly (D\u00e1il constituency)|Leix\u2013Offaly]].<ref>\"General election - full list of nominations\", ''[[Irish Times]]'', 20 August 1923</ref>\n\n==Events of 1927==\nBelton was elected as a [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) for [[Dublin County (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin County]] in the [[June 1927 Irish general election|June 1927 general election]].<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Patrick-Belton.D.1927-06-23/|title=Patrick Belton|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref> In the eight-seat constituency, he was the third person to be elected, after [[Kevin O'Higgins]] (of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]]), who would be assassinated one month later, and [[Bryan Cooper (politician)|Bryan Cooper]]. Fianna F\u00e1il, which had been founded in 1926 by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], contested [[Irish Free State|Free State]] elections but its policy was to refuse to take seats in the D\u00e1il; this was because the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]], agreed in the Treaty, required all TDs to swear, ''inter alia'': \u201cI will be faithful to [[Majesty|H.M.]] [[King George V]], his heirs and successors...\u201d\n\nOn 26 July 1927, he made headlines by breaking with Fianna F\u00e1il policy, taking the Oath of Allegiance and entering the D\u00e1il ([[Dan Breen]], perhaps surprisingly, had done this on 25 January). The next day's paper quoted him as saying that he was taking his seat in the hope of saving the nation \"from the degradation and destruction\" which he believed the passage of proposed new legislation would involve. These measures included, in addition to the Electoral Amendment Bill (requiring inter alia that all D\u00e1il candidates take the Oath of Allegiance), a Public Safety Bill incorporating tough new measures, and which was partly a reaction to the assassination on 10 July of Kevin O'Higgins by IRA members. The National Executive of Fianna F\u00e1il expelled him from the party and called on him to resign his seat. \u00c9amon de Valera said: \u201cAs for Mr Belton, everybody who was not absolutely blind could see that Mr Belton, since his election, has been manoeuvring for an opportunity to go in and take the oath. He will be alone, however.\u201d<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/1532399/Slightly_Constitutional_Politics_Fianna_F%C3%A1ils_Tortuous_Entry_to_the_Irish_Parliament_1926-7 Statement issued by Fianna F\u00e1il publicity department, 25 July 1937, published in 'The Nation', 30 July 1927, P5 - cited in 'Slightly Constitutional' Politics: Fianna F\u00e1il's Tortuous Entry to the Irish Parliament,. 1926\u20137.

He subsequently lost his seat in the general election of September 1927, in which he had to stand as an Independent. From this time onward, there was a mutual and obvious enmity between Belton and de Valera.\n\nHe joined Cumann na nGaedheal in 1933, and was returned as a TD for [[Dublin North (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North]] at the [[1933 Irish general election|1933 general election]].<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=600|title=Patrick Belton|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Irish Christian Front==\nOn 22 August 1936, the ''[[Irish Independent]]'' called for the formation of a committee to help the (pro-[[Francisco Franco|Franco]]) citizens of Spain in their [[Spanish Civil War|war]] effort. These calls for support resulted in the formation of the [[Irish Christian Front]] (ICF). The ICF held its initial meeting at the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]] in Dublin on 31 August 1936.

However, Belton, a supporter of nationalist Spain, claimed that the important battle was to be fought at home and not abroad.

In 1917 he had acquired a sizeable holding at Belfield Park in Drumcondra, and in 1938 he moved to a farm at Bellevue Park, [[Killiney]] on Dublin's southside. In 1937, he was active building several hundred houses at Belton Park, part of Puckstown Lane, which he renamed Collins Avenue. He also became active in the licensed trade, opening a public house on Collins Avenue. Around that time, however, his health seems to have taken a turn for the worse. Reporting to the October 1937 Special Convention of the ICF, the organisation\u2019s honorary secretary stated that in April Belton \u201csuffered from a severe breakdown in health caused by overwork, principally his efforts on behalf of the Irish Christian Front, and more especially by hardships undergone by him through his journey to Spain. His illness necessitated a considerable slowing down of activities.\u201d Despite this deterioration in health, he was elected as a Fine Gael TD for Dublin County at the [[1938 Irish general election|1938 general election]]. In 1939, he attempted to buy [[Glencairn House]] from [[Boss Croker]]'s estate, but the sale fell through. He lost his D\u00e1il seat at the [[1943 Irish general election|1943 general election]].\n\nHe died on 30 January 1945, at his home in Killiney, [[County Dublin]]. His death prompted the ''Longford Leader'' to write as follows: \"The regretted death of Mr Patrick Belton has occasioned widespread sympathy throughout the country but particularly in his native county of Longford with his family and relatives.  The name of Belton in Dublin has been associated with one of the most remarkable personal undertakings of enterprise and courage in this country in the present century. A veteran of the war of independence, a civil servant in his early days, court-martialled, imprisoned and suffering dismissal because of his national sympathies and activities, the late Mr Belton proceeded on a course of independent enterprise which astonished the greatest financiers of the day. In addition to his great practical undertakings in housing, tillage, dairying and many other pursuits, which provided extensive employment, Mr Belton was a D\u00e1il deputy for a number of years and a Member of Dublin Corporation, County Council and practically every other public body in Dublin\"\n\nThree of his four sons &ndash; [[Richard Belton|Richard]], [[Jack Belton|Jack]] and [[Paddy Belton|Paddy]] - served as members of the [[Oireachtas]], as did his granddaughter, [[Avril Doyle]].\n\n==Quotes==\n''\"I did not agree with the wisdom of Irishmen going out to Spain.\"'' \u2013 Irish Press (26 November 1936)\n\n''\"I have never been a party politician in the sense that I would obey the orders of any political junta who would tell me to do a thing, whether I considered it right or wrong.\"'' &ndash; Irish Press (30 January 1937)\n\n''\"The Minister for Finance [Se\u00e1n T. \u00d3 Ceallaigh] was there or thereabouts at the birth of Sinn F\u00e9in.

Following his education, he stayed in London and entered the Civil Service. He became very friendly with [[Arthur Griffith]] and Michael Collins at this time. In 1905, he was present at the establishment of the Sinn F\u00e9in organisation in London, and in November 1909, according to some sources, he initiated Michael Collins into Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB).  He was a prominent member of the Geraldines [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] Club in London, and he was for many years its President. In 1909 he became Secretary of the London County Board of the GAA.\n\nIn 1910 he was transferred to the [[Irish Land Commission]] in Dublin.\n\n==1916 and after==\nBelton took part in the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. His obituary in the ''[[Longford Leader]]'' noted that he \"...was associated with Michael Collins and other London comrades when they came to Ireland in 1916 for the Rising. After the Rising he was suspended from the Land Commission on suspicion of having been connected with the event, but was later reinstated\". A detailed narrative of his activities during the 1916 Rising is contained in a handwritten letter he sent in 1937 to M\u00e1ire English, supporting her claim to a Military Service Pension. It suggests that he was either physically in the GPO at some stage during the Rising, or in some way attached to the insurgents based there.<ref>http://www.militaryarchives.ie/collections/online-collections/military-service-pensions-collection (File Reference MSP34REF24424).</ref>\n\nAfter reports in 1918 that 'large bodies of Sinn F\u00e9iners' had assembled and were drilling on his lands, the police raided his house on 30 July. While some of those present managed to escape, two revolvers and more than fifty rounds of ammunition were discovered in the house. Various papers were found which showed Belton's involvement with the Irish National Aid Association, the Irish Volunteer Dependants' Fund, Sinn F\u00e9in, and the Patriots' Graves Committee. There was a pass admitting the bearer to the graveside of [[Thomas Ashe]] on the day of his funeral. On 31 August 1918, Belton was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment with hard labour for possessing arms and ammunition. He served his sentence in Mountjoy and Belfast jails.\n\nIn the [[1923 Irish general election|1923 general election]], he stood unsuccessfully for the [[National Democratic Party (Ireland)|National Democratic Party]] in [[Laois\u2013Offaly (D\u00e1il constituency)|Leix\u2013Offaly]].<ref>\"General election - full list of nominations\", ''[[Irish Times]]'', 20 August 1923</ref>\n\n==Events of 1927==\nBelton was elected as a [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TD) for [[Dublin County (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin County]] in the [[June 1927 Irish general election|June 1927 general election]].<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Patrick-Belton.D.1927-06-23/|title=Patrick Belton|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref> In the eight-seat constituency, he was the third person to be elected, after [[Kevin O'Higgins]] (of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]]), who would be assassinated one month later, and [[Bryan Cooper (politician)|Bryan Cooper]]. Fianna F\u00e1il, which had been founded in 1926 by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], contested [[Irish Free State|Free State]] elections but its policy was to refuse to take seats in the D\u00e1il; this was because the [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance]], agreed in the Treaty, required all TDs to swear, ''inter alia'': \u201cI will be faithful to [[Majesty|H.M.]] [[King George V]], his heirs and successors...\u201d\n\nOn 26 July 1927, he made headlines by breaking with Fianna F\u00e1il policy, taking the Oath of Allegiance and entering the D\u00e1il ([[Dan Breen]], perhaps surprisingly, had done this on 25 January). The next day's paper quoted him as saying that he was taking his seat in the hope of saving the nation \"from the degradation and destruction\" which he believed the passage of proposed new legislation would involve. These measures included, in addition to the Electoral Amendment Bill (requiring inter alia that all D\u00e1il candidates take the Oath of Allegiance), a Public Safety Bill incorporating tough new measures, and which was partly a reaction to the assassination on 10 July of Kevin O'Higgins by IRA members. The National Executive of Fianna F\u00e1il expelled him from the party and called on him to resign his seat. \u00c9amon de Valera said: \u201cAs for Mr Belton, everybody who was not absolutely blind could see that Mr Belton, since his election, has been manoeuvring for an opportunity to go in and take the oath.

In 1917 he had acquired a sizeable holding at Belfield Park in Drumcondra, and in 1938 he moved to a farm at Bellevue Park, [[Killiney]] on Dublin's southside. In 1937, he was active building several hundred houses at Belton Park, part of Puckstown Lane, which he renamed Collins Avenue. He also became active in the licensed trade, opening a public house on Collins Avenue. Around that time, however, his health seems to have taken a turn for the worse. Reporting to the October 1937 Special Convention of the ICF, the organisation\u2019s honorary secretary stated that in April Belton \u201csuffered from a severe breakdown in health caused by overwork, principally his efforts on behalf of the Irish Christian Front, and more especially by hardships undergone by him through his journey to Spain. His illness necessitated a considerable slowing down of activities.\u201d Despite this deterioration in health, he was elected as a Fine Gael TD for Dublin County at the [[1938 Irish general election|1938 general election]]. In 1939, he attempted to buy [[Glencairn House]] from [[Boss Croker]]'s estate, but the sale fell through. He lost his D\u00e1il seat at the [[1943 Irish general election|1943 general election]].\n\nHe died on 30 January 1945, at his home in Killiney, [[County Dublin]]. His death prompted the ''Longford Leader'' to write as follows: \"The regretted death of Mr Patrick Belton has occasioned widespread sympathy throughout the country but particularly in his native county of Longford with his family and relatives.  The name of Belton in Dublin has been associated with one of the most remarkable personal undertakings of enterprise and courage in this country in the present century. A veteran of the war of independence, a civil servant in his early days, court-martialled, imprisoned and suffering dismissal because of his national sympathies and activities, the late Mr Belton proceeded on a course of independent enterprise which astonished the greatest financiers of the day. In addition to his great practical undertakings in housing, tillage, dairying and many other pursuits, which provided extensive employment, Mr Belton was a D\u00e1il deputy for a number of years and a Member of Dublin Corporation, County Council and practically every other public body in Dublin\"\n\nThree of his four sons &ndash; [[Richard Belton|Richard]], [[Jack Belton|Jack]] and [[Paddy Belton|Paddy]] - served as members of the [[Oireachtas]], as did his granddaughter, [[Avril Doyle]].\n\n==Quotes==\n''\"I did not agree with the wisdom of Irishmen going out to Spain.\"'' \u2013 Irish Press (26 November 1936)\n\n''\"I have never been a party politician in the sense that I would obey the orders of any political junta who would tell me to do a thing, whether I considered it right or wrong.\"'' &ndash; Irish Press (30 January 1937)\n\n''\"The Minister for Finance [Se\u00e1n T. \u00d3 Ceallaigh] was there or thereabouts at the birth of Sinn F\u00e9in.

The Italian invasion of [[British Somaliland]] was to be based on mobility and speed but was hampered by the terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked, until the remaining fortified hilltops were vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route at the same time and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was not needed. The rainy weather continued to slow the Italian advance and when the airstrip near Berbera was found still to be garrisoned, an Italian {{lang|fr|coup de main}} was impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n{{see also|Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian East Africa}}\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the foundation of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', AOI), formed from the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]], [[Italian Somaliland]], and [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], conquered in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936).{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain. The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham.

In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding.

The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship.

When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms.

On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine and feared a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall the British, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter a British intervention. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar, by defeating the garrison and occupying British Somaliland.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the Assa Hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\nThe direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary.

The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}}\n\nWithdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on.

The CTSAO concentrated its operations against the port and in a dawn attack two SM 81 bombers attacked ships in the harbour and were damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Two SM 79s bombed at noon and one was also damaged by anti-aircraft fire. The third Italian raid, by three SM 79s met two [[Martin Maryland]]s from the Free French flight in 8 Squadron, which were patrolling Berbera and one Maryland pilot claimed a SM 79 shot down; it was not confirmed but crashed in flames soon after.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=53}}{{efn|The SM 79 crashed in flames; not carrying wireless, the crew misunderstood hand signals from the other crews who could see smoke coming out of the aircraft. The SM 79 crew waved back but then the aircraft exploded and hit the ground near [[Sheikh, Somaliland|Sheikh]], south of Berbera.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=53}}}} The CTSAO at Dire Dawa was reinforced by two SM 79s of 44\u00b0 {{lang|de|Gruppo}} and three CR 32s from 411\u00b0 {{lang|de|Squadriglia}} at Addis Ababa and three SM 81s from Shashamanna.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=53}}\n\nThe retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the attackers but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked. The evacuation at Berbera went more smoothly than expected and Godwin-Austen was able to withdraw the rearguard at Nasiyeh and once night fell, bring back the rearguard from Barkasan.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}} Five Blenheims bombed the captured landing ground at Hargeisa and five Ca 133s with two CR 32 fighter escorts bombed the British residency at Sheikh. A 39 Squadron Blenheim on a reconnaissance sortie, was hit by ground fire and came down in the sea, the crew being rescued by the cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}}. As the Italian invasion neared completion, three SM 81s of the 4\u00b0 {{lang|de|Gruppo}} went back to Shashamanna , two of the SM 79s of 44\u00b0 {{lang|de|Gruppo}} went back to Addis Ababa and three more SM 79s of 10\u00b0 {{lang|de|Squadriglia}} 28\u00b0 {{lang|de|Gruppo}} arrived from Gura in Eritrea after the 10\u00b0 {{lang|de|Squadriglia}} had exchanged it SM 81s from reinforcements of SM 79s being flown from Libya. In Aden 39 Sauadron gave up two Blenheims to 11 Squadron so that each had five operational bombers.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nThe [[Royal Navy]] had built an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials; on 16 August, the British started to embark troops.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=19}} Attacks by the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} on the British vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Berbera had begun on 8 August to little effect; {{HMAS|Hobart|1939|6}} was slightly damaged in two attacks and the auxiliary vessel ''Chakdina'' suffered splinter damage.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=39\u201340}} On 17 August, the Italian western column at Bulhar, about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera, was engaged by the light cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and halted by gunfire.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}} After dark, the rearguard was withdrawn to Berbera with minimal losses and loading was complete by the early hours of 18 August.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=205\u2013206}} At 05:35 on 18 August three 11 Squadron Blenheims bombed Italian vehicles near Laferug and were intercepted by two CR 32s of 410\u00b0 {{lang|de|Squadriglia}}, which shot down a Blenheim in flames. the crew parachuted but two of the men died in hospital of burns. Soon after the Blenheims took off, five Wellesleys from 223 Squadron flew from Perim Island and bombed Addis Ababa airfield in bad weather. A CR 42 managed to damage four of the Wellesleys whose crews claimed two hangars destroyed, two damaged, four SM 79s destroyed, two damaged and Aosta's runabout destroyed. Italian records show a SM 79, a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75|S 75]] and three Ca 133s destroyed, one SM 79 and a SM 81 damaged. Two attacks on Berbera were made by SM 79s during the morning and three SM 79s escorted by two CR 42s attacked soon after noon, the fighters driving a Blenheim F away. Italian troops overcame the second British defensive position before Berbera.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\nBefore sailing for Aden early on 19 August, ''Hobart'', with the force headquarters aboard, stayed behind to collect stragglers and complete the destruction of buildings, vehicles, fuel and stores. The tug ''Queen'' was the only British ship lost in the operation.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=205\u2013206}} The Navy embarked {{nowrap|7,140 people,}} {{nowrap|5,690 of}} them being front-line troops, {{nowrap|1,266 civilians}} and {{nowrap|184 sick;}} Most of the Somalis of the SCC were sent home to wait for the British to return, earlier plans for them to fight a guerrilla war being scrapped. SCC members who were embarked, became an armoured car unit under the same title.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=87, 263}} There was little Italian interference with the evacuation, perhaps because on 15 August, the Duke of Aosta had ordered Nasi to allow the British to evacuate without too much fighting, in the hope of a peace agreement being mediated through the [[Holy See|Vatican]].{{sfn|Rovighi|1988|p=138}} The last CTSAO raid was flown against Berbera by three SM 79s; soon afterwards, British aircraft from Aden attacked Italian troops as they occupied the town that evening. Much of Berbera was on fire and the wreckage of four British aircraft were found on the airfield.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}} Mussolini annexed the colony to the AOI, as part of the [[Italian Empire]].{{sfn|Mockler|1984|pp=245\u2013249}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\n[[File:Impero italiano.svg|thumb|{{centre|''Impero italiano'' (red); the maximum extent of the Italian Empire shown in pink}}]]\nThe Italians had shown the ability to co-ordinate columns separated by many miles of desert; the forces under British command had kept their discipline during the retreat and preserved most of their men. British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa and Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory the size of [[England]], British Somaliland, the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and [[Kassala]] in Sudan, [[Moyale]] and [[Buna, Kenya|Buna]] in Kenya. News of the evacuation came as a shock to British public opinion but Wavell backed Godwin-Austen, saying that he had judged the situation correctly.{{sfn|Mockler|1984|pp=245\u2013249}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=179}} The British had to immobilise and abandon 350 vehicles and most of their stores because of the need to ferry everything to the ships offshore.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=87}}\n\nFrom 5 to 19 August the RAF at Aden flew 184 sorties and dropped {{cvt|60|LT|t|abbr=on}} of bombs. From 16 to 19 August, the RAF flew 12 reconnaissance sorties, 19 bomber-reconnaissance sorties, 72 bomber sorties against Italian troops and transport and 36 fighter sorties over Berbera of the total. The British learned that inadequately defended airstrips could quickly be made untenable, leaving bombers flying from Aden unprotected against air attack. Despite the land campaign, a convoy sailed the Red Sea early in August and another convoy began the voyage on 19 August escorted by 14 Squadron Wellesleys as the Blenheim IVFs were busy over Berbera. After the British evacuation, both sides dispersed aircraft sent to reinforce the local units, the CTSAO being disbanded on 26 August.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\nWinston Churchill criticised Wavell for the loss of British Somaliland; because of the few casualties, Churchill thought that the colony had not been vigorously defended and proposed a [[court of enquiry]]. Wavell refused to co-operate and said that Godwin-Austen and Wilson had conducted a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. Wavell sent a telegram to Churchill which included the passage\n\n{{quote|...a big butcher\u2019s bill was not necessarily evidence of good tactics.|Wavell{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}}}}\n\nChurchill was said by General [[John Dill]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), to have been moved to \"greater anger than he had ever seen him in before\"; the incident was the beginning of the end for Wavell.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart wrote that given the exiguous nature of the British force in the colony, the defenders had done well to resist for as long as they had. The defence of British Somaliland took place during the [[Battle of Britain]] and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to defeated generals. Adolf Hitler called the evacuation of the colony a \"hard blow\" but\n\n{{quote|...all the British had lost was the privilege of maintaining an expensive garrison in their least valuable colony.|Cowie ''War for Britain'' (1941){{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=93}}}}\n\nThe capture of the colony was the greatest success of the Italians in the East African campaign but they had not been able to exploit the opportunities that they had created. Delays caused by the terrain, weather and the cancellation of a {{lang|fr|coup de main}} by Italian 300 infantry on the port enabled the British to get away, despite the improvised nature of the embarkation.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n===Casualties===\n\nIn 1954, [[I. S. O. Playfair|Ian Playfair]], the British official historian, wrote that the British suffered 260 casualties and estimated Italian losses of 2,052 men. Seven British aircraft were shot down and ten were badly damaged in the fourteen days' fighting.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=178\u2013179}} In 1988, Alberto Rovighi, the Italian official historian, wrote that the Italians suffered 465 men killed, 1,530 wounded and 34 missing, a total of 2,029 men, of whom 161 were Italian and 1,868 were in local Eritrean and Somali Ascari units of the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo di Truppe Coloniali}}. Somali irregulars supporting the British suffered about another 2,000 casualties during the invasion and occupation; about 1,000 Somali irregulars became casualties fighting on the Italian side.{{sfnm|1a1=Maravigna|1y=1949|1p=453|2a1=Rovighi|2y=1988|2p=188}} In 1993, Harold Raugh wrote that 38 of the British casualties had been killed and 222 wounded.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=82}} In a 1996 publication, Christopher Shores gave the same figures for Italian casualties as Maravigna and wrote that the RAF lost seven aircraft and ten were damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}} In 2007, Andrea Molinari recorded 1,995 Italian casualties and four aircraft destroyed.{{sfn|Molinari|2007|p=117}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n{{main|Operation Appearance}}\n\nOn 16 March 1941, the British executed Operation Appearance from [[Aden]]; the two [[Sikh]] battalions of the [[Indian Army]], that had been part of the defence force in August 1940 and a Somali commando detachment, were landed on either side of Berbera from transports escorted by HMS ''Glasgow'', ''Caledon'', ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston''.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=417}}{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=54}} The invasion by the Sikhs was the first successful [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landing on an occupied beach of the war; few men of the Italian 70th Colonial Brigade offered resistance. Repairs began on the port and supplies for the [[1st (African) Division|11th African Division]] were passing through within a week, reducing the road transport distance by {{convert|500|mi|km|abbr=on}}.

The Italian invasion of [[British Somaliland]] was to be based on mobility and speed but was hampered by the terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked, until the remaining fortified hilltops were vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route at the same time and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was not needed. The rainy weather continued to slow the Italian advance and when the airstrip near Berbera was found still to be garrisoned, an Italian {{lang|fr|coup de main}} was impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n{{see also|Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian East Africa}}\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the foundation of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', AOI), formed from the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]], [[Italian Somaliland]], and [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], conquered in the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936).{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain. The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine and feared a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall the British, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter a British intervention. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar, by defeating the garrison and occupying British Somaliland.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the Assa Hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\nThe direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary. De Simone, with the central column would establish a base at Hargeisa and Adalek then carry the main weight of the attack through the Mirgo Pass towards Berbera. The western column (Lieutenant-General [[Sisto Bertoldi]]) was to advance towards [[Zeila]] to seal the border with French Somaliland and then move eastwards along the coast road towards Berbera.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 03.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Example of a Savoia-Marchetti SM 81}}]]\nOn 31 July 18\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglie}} arrived at the Scelene airstrip near [[Dire Dawa]] with six [[Caproni Ca.133|Ca 133]] bomber/transport aircraft. On 1 August {{lang|it|Comando Tattico dell Settore Aeronautica Ouest}} (CTSAO, Western Sector Tactical Command) was created for the invasion of British Somaliland. At first the CTSAO ({{lang|it|Generale}} Collalti) had 27 bombers, 23 fighters and seven reconnaissance aircraft.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=45}} During the afternoon, flights of three [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81|SM 81]] bombers each, attacked shipping off [[Zeila]] as two waves of six Blenheim Mk Is from 8 and 39 squadrons, escorted by two 203 Squadron Blenheim IVFs, bombed the Italian airfield at Chinele, which had been discovered that morning. The Blenheims dived to {{cvt|10000|ft|m|abbr=on}} through anti-aircraft fire as [[Fiat CR.42|CR 42]] fighters of 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglie}} scrambled from Dire Dawa ({{cvt|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} away) and attacked the Blenheim IVFs.

As the Blenheims flew home over Zeila, the crews spotted a flight of the SM 81 bombers attacking the port. Three Blenheims broke formation and shot down one of the Italian bombers. On the morning of 2 August, 39 Squadron raided Chinele again and were intercepted by CR 42s of 413\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}}; the CR 42 of the CO {{lang|it|Capitano}} Corrado Santoro, was hit in the engine and force landed. {{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=41\u201343}}\n\n[[File:GeneraleGuglielmo Nasi.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|left|{{centre|General Guglielmo Nasi}}]]\nOn 3 August 1940, British air reconnaissance discovered that about 400 Italians had crossed the frontier at Biyad.

Early on 4 August the central column advanced towards Hargeisa, observed by the SCC which skirmished with the column to impose delays.{{sfnm|1a1=Stewart|1y=2016|1pp=75\u201377|2a1=Playfair|2y=1959|2p=174}}{{efn|[[No. 39 Squadron RAF|39]] ([[Bristol Blenheim]]), [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|112]] ([[Gloster Gladiator]]), [[No. 94 Squadron RAF|94]] (Gladiator), [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|223]] ([[Vickers Wellesley]]), [[No. 47 Squadron RAF|47]] (Wellesley, [[Vickers Vildebeest|Vickers Vincent]], [[Gloster Gauntlet]]), [[No. 14 Squadron RAF|14]] (Wellesley), [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|203]], [[No. 84 Squadron RAF|84]], [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45]], [[No. 11 Squadron RAF|11]] and [[No. 8 Squadron RAF|8 Squadrons]] (Blenheim).

Aosta urged haste but Nasi refused to rush because the road was deteriorating under the heavy traffic and rain. The Italian advance resumed on 8 August and for two days closed up to the British defences as the Italians made preparations to attack. The defenders reported the presence of Italian medium tanks and the captain of {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} donated the ship's [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss]] saluting gun, a three-man crew and thirty rounds of ammunition.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=173\u2013175}}{{efn|PO H.

Around noon a Blenheim attacked three more SM 79s as they bombed Berbera, damaged one and killed a member of the crew. Three SM 81s had attacked the Godojere Pass in the morning and three Ca 133s bombed the Kerim Pass.

The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major-General [[Reade Godwin-Austen]] was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary. Godwin-Austen reached Berbera on 11 July and took over command that evening; the reinforcements were too late and were diverted to Sudan.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=175}}\n\n===Tug Argan position===\n\n[[File:Tug Argan Gap.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Photograph of the Tug Argan Gap (1954)}}]]\nFrom 7 to 8 August, the defenders had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch; by 10 August, De Simone had closed up on the British positions behind the Tug Argan and prepared the Italian attack. The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Kerim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about {{convert|2000|to|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Mill Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\nThe positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery, the advantage was of dubious advantage. The defenders were too few in number to cover the gap and the hills were far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackenzie|1y=1951|1p=22|2a1=Playfair|2y=1959|1pp=175\u2013176}} During the morning of 9 August, three Italian fighters strafed the airfield at Berbera but found only a damaged Blenheim. The aircraft were fired on by personnel at the base and {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} in the harbour joined in with its [[Vickers .50 machine gun|pom-pom guns]]. The Gladiator damaged the day before was dismantled and taken to Aden. On 10 August the Italian northern column reached Zeila despite naval bombardments and bombing from aircraft flying from Aden; the column was eventually stopped by its vehicle tyres being damaged by the rough ground.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=48}}{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=48}}\n\n===Battle of Tug Argan===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Tug Argan}}\n\nThe Australians from ''Hobart'' with their Hotchkiss gun arrived at dawn on 10 August but the gun had to be dismantled to load, which reduced its rate of fire to once every five minutes, while its 32 HE rounds and 32 solid shot lasted.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}} The battle for Tug Argan began and another two CR 32 and a CR 42 were sent from Dire Dawa to Hargeisa along with a Ca 133 of 53\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}}; five SM 79s from Addis Ababa were transferred to Dire Dawa. Early in the morning 8 Squadron sent three Blenheims to dive bomb Italian troops at Tug Argan, one being damaged by a CR 42. In the afternoon another three Blenheims bombed the village of Dubato; two of the Blenheims collided on the return journey and crashed in flames. On 11 August a morning attack was made by Six Ca 133s and three SM 81s on the Godojere Pass, a SM 81 being shot down by ground fire. Three CR 42s strafed Laferug and a SM 79 bombed the airstrip afterwards. A Blenheim was claimed shot down by Italian troops but no loss appeared in British records.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=48}}\n\nOn 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} At dawn a couple of Blenheims from 11 and 39 squadrons from Aden bombed Italian artillery around Darbouruk against anti-aircraft fire then the 11 Squadron Blenheim was bounced by a CR 42 and damaged while the crew were trying to drop a message for British troops. The 39 Squadron machine was also attacked and made an emergency landing at Berbera. About two hours later three 39 Squadron Blenheims arrived to repeat the attack and the formation leader was attacked by a 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}} CR 32. The pilot of the third Blenheim saw the attack, jettisoned bombs and attacked the Italian fighter, which made a head-on attack, wounding the Blenheim pilot and killed the observer. The pilot managed to reach Berbera and crash-land; the Italian pilot was also wounded. During the attack, a Blenheim IVF of 203 Squadron patrolled Berbera and tried to intercept three SM 79s but broke off the pursuit when a hit in the cockpit, wounded the pilot and navigator. Italian aircraft provided ground support all day, six Ca 133s bombing Mandera and Laferug.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=49\u201351}}\n\nOn 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery [[howitzer]]s were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap. On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} On 13 August the aircraft of CTSAO concentrated on the area to the east of Adadleh; the Jerato Pass was bombed by Ca 233s and the crashed Blenheims at Berbera were strafed twice by CR 32s, one on the second attack being hit by small-arms fire and landing inside British-held territory. Another three SM 81s were transferred from [[Shashamane]] (south of Addis Ababa) to Dire Dawa. Italian outflanking moves at Tug Argan led the British to begin a withdrawal to Berbera. Eleven [[Vickers Wellesley|Wellesleys]] of 223 Squadron were sent to reinforce the RAF at Aden.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nOn 14 August, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed.

SM 79s attacked shipping off [[Bulhar]], three SM 81s and three Ca 133s bombed a fort near the Godojere Pass and retreating troops on the road to Berbera nearby. Three CR 32s attacked road transport at Laferug, Mandera and tracks to Berbera.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=51\u201352}} At Tug Argan counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}}\n\nWithdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left, either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin-Austen to withdraw from the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=176\u2013177}} Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about {{convert|33|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, {{convert|17|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the port.

Six Blenheim I bombers flew from Iraq to reinforce the RAF at Aden and on passing [[Kamaran|Kamaran Island]] an SM 81 flew underneath the formation. The Blenheims dived on the bomber and three achieved firing positions, shooting it down. On landing the crews handed over their aircraft and returned to Iraq in Bombay transports the next day.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=51\u201352}} After a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}} The British withdrawal to Berbera was complete and the evacuation had begun.

Two SM 79s bombed at noon and one was also damaged by anti-aircraft fire. The third Italian raid, by three SM 79s met two [[Martin Maryland]]s from the Free French flight in 8 Squadron, which were patrolling Berbera and one Maryland pilot claimed a SM 79 shot down; it was not confirmed but crashed in flames soon after.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=53}}{{efn|The SM 79 crashed in flames; not carrying wireless, the crew misunderstood hand signals from the other crews who could see smoke coming out of the aircraft.

The defence of British Somaliland took place during the [[Battle of Britain]] and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to defeated generals.
