Among other things, this prevents some bots from visiting websites, forcing some search engines to exclude domains hosted with GoDaddy. \n\nWith this policy, they are choosing to allow their DNS servers to be under-provisioned (meaning that their servers are unable to gracefully handle their normal load). To prevent slow DNS, which would generate complaints quickly, they decided to block 100% of packets from hand-picked DNS servers based on volume and visibility. This reduces load somewhat, while making it difficult for customers to pinpoint GoDaddy as the problem. This policy also affects search engine ranking for various GoDaddy customers who have multiple domains with different registrars. \n\nGoDaddy has refused to comment on the policy or the perception that their servers cannot handle the load or they are giving preference to their platinum level customers at first. It has also interfered with projects that collect Internet statistics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perry|first=R.

Called \"Journey Home\", the commercial featured a [[Retriever]] puppy named Buddy who was bounced out of the back of a truck. After making a journey home his owners are relieved because they just sold him on a website they built with GoDaddy. GoDaddy claims the ad was supposed to be funny and an attempt to make fun of all the puppies shown in Super Bowl ads. Most notably, [[Budweiser]]'s famous Super Bowl ad also featured a Retriever puppy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/28/godaddy-2015-super-bowl-ad_n_6557548.html |title=\u2013 GoDaddy Pulls 2015 Super Bowl Ad After Slew Of Negative Feedback From Animal Advocates |work= Huffington Post |date= 2015-01-28|accessdate=2015-01-27}}</ref> The ad found very few fans from the online community.

Among other things, this prevents some bots from visiting websites, forcing some search engines to exclude domains hosted with GoDaddy. \n\nWith this policy, they are choosing to allow their DNS servers to be under-provisioned (meaning that their servers are unable to gracefully handle their normal load). To prevent slow DNS, which would generate complaints quickly, they decided to block 100% of packets from hand-picked DNS servers based on volume and visibility. This reduces load somewhat, while making it difficult for customers to pinpoint GoDaddy as the problem. This policy also affects search engine ranking for various GoDaddy customers who have multiple domains with different registrars. \n\nGoDaddy has refused to comment on the policy or the perception that their servers cannot handle the load or they are giving preference to their platinum level customers at first. It has also interfered with projects that collect Internet statistics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perry|first=R.

Called \"Journey Home\", the commercial featured a [[Retriever]] puppy named Buddy who was bounced out of the back of a truck. After making a journey home his owners are relieved because they just sold him on a website they built with GoDaddy. GoDaddy claims the ad was supposed to be funny and an attempt to make fun of all the puppies shown in Super Bowl ads. Most notably, [[Budweiser]]'s famous Super Bowl ad also featured a Retriever puppy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/28/godaddy-2015-super-bowl-ad_n_6557548.html |title=\u2013 GoDaddy Pulls 2015 Super Bowl Ad After Slew Of Negative Feedback From Animal Advocates |work= Huffington Post |date= 2015-01-28|accessdate=2015-01-27}}</ref> The ad found very few fans from the online community.

Some called it a public relations campaign, since it closely followed Google's revolt in China.<ref>[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/after-google-godaddy-pulls-out-of-china/112139-11.html?from=webx After Google, GoDaddy pulls out of China].</ref> GoDaddy\u2019s top lawyer [[Christine Jones (businesswoman)|Christine Jones]] told Congress, \u201cWe were having to contact Chinese users to ask for their personal information and begrudgingly give it to Chinese authorities.
