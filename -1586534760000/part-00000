There were also reports of [[tear gas]] being deployed to disperse the intruders as at least three protesters appeared to have difficulties breathing. The mob subsequently set fire to three trailers used by security guards along the embassy compound's wall. Reportedly, a man on a loudspeaker urged the mob not to enter the compound, saying: \"The message was delivered.\" Some commanders from Iranian-backed Iraqi militia factions began joining the protesters, including chief of the [[Badr Organization]] and PMF commander [[Hadi al-Amiri]] and leader of the Iranian-backed \"[[Special Groups (Iraq)|Special Groups]]\" paramilitary collective [[Qais Khazali]]. Iraq's interior minister Yassine al-Yasseri was also briefly at the scene, calling the situation \"...embarrassing to the government.\" \n\nBy early evening, the mob, which at one point numbered in several hundreds, had largely retreated and protesters had set up tents outside the embassy in an attempted [[sit-in]].

I, p. 4: At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about the collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe Mueller Report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts.

The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Candidates table ===\n\n<!-- This table is sorted by pledged electors first (that is, ignoring faithless electors), then by popular vote among candidates with 0 pledged electors. -->\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Donald Trump]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 62,984,828 |pv_pct= 46.09% |ev-projected=306|ev=304 (306)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Mike Pence]]|vp_party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|vp_state=[[Indiana]]|vp_ev=304}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Hillary Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 65,853,514 |pv_pct= 48.18% |ev-projected=232|ev=227 (232)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Tim Kaine]]|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]|vp_ev=227}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gary Johnson]]| party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| state=[[New Mexico]]| pv= 4,489,341 | pv_pct= 3.28% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Bill Weld]]| vp_party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Jill Stein]]| party=[[Green Party of the United States|Green]]| state=[[Massachusetts]]| pv= 1,457,218 | pv_pct= 1.07% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Ajamu Baraka]]| vp_party=[[Green Party (United States)|Green]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evan McMullin]]| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Utah]]| pv= 731,991 | pv_pct= 0.54% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Mindy Finn]]| vp_party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Darrell Castle]]|| party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| state=[[Tennessee]]| pv= 203,090 | pv_pct= 0.15% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Scott Bradley (politician)|Scott Bradley]]| vp_party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| vp_state=[[Utah]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Bernie Sanders]]{{efn|name=faithless}}| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Vermont]]| pv= 111,850 {{efn|name=write-in}}| pv_pct= 0.08% {{efn|name=write-in}}| ev-projected=0| ev=1 (0)| vp_count=1| vp_name=[[Elizabeth Warren]]{{efn|name=faithless}}|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]| vp_ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gloria La Riva]]|party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]|state=[[California]]| pv= 74,401 | pv_pct= 0.05% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Eugene Puryear]]|vp_party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[John Kasich]]{{efn|name=faithless}}{{efn|name=paul-kasich|Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively.

However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEarly exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected.

The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \"DCLeaks\" and \"Guccifer 2.0.\" The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>\n\nTo establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators \"applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]\", and not the concept of \"collusion\", because collusion \"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In evaluating whether evidence about the collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \"collusion.\" In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \"collud[e]\" was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \"coordinated\" with Russia, using the definition of \"coordination\" as having \"an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference\". Investigators further elaborated that merely having \"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

Like collusion, \"coordination\" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>\n\nThe Mueller Report writes that the investigation \"identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign\", found that Russia \"perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency\" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"expected it would benefit electorally\" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, \"the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\".<ref name=\"GlobeGraphic\">{{Cite web |last1=Ostriker |first1=Rebecca |last2=Puzzanghera |first2=Jim |last3=Finucane |first3=Martin |last4=Datar |first4=Saurabh |last5=Uraizee |first5=Irfan |last6=Garvin |first6=Patrick |title=What the Mueller report says about Trump and more |url=https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/graphics/2019/03/mueller-report/ |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"TIMErelease\">{{cite magazine |last1=Law |first1=Tara |title=Here Are the Biggest Takeaways From the Mueller Report |url=http://time.com/5567077/mueller-report-release/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHowever, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony, as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications.

The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Candidates table ===\n\n<!-- This table is sorted by pledged electors first (that is, ignoring faithless electors), then by popular vote among candidates with 0 pledged electors. -->\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box|pv_footnote=|ev_footnote=}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Donald Trump]]|party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 62,984,828 |pv_pct= 46.09% |ev-projected=306|ev=304 (306)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Mike Pence]]|vp_party=[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]|vp_state=[[Indiana]]|vp_ev=304}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan|name=[[Hillary Clinton]]|party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|state=[[New York (state)|New York]]|pv= 65,853,514 |pv_pct= 48.18% |ev-projected=232|ev=227 (232)|vp_count=1|vp_name=[[Tim Kaine]]|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]|vp_state=[[Virginia]]|vp_ev=227}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gary Johnson]]| party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| state=[[New Mexico]]| pv= 4,489,341 | pv_pct= 3.28% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Bill Weld]]| vp_party=[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Jill Stein]]| party=[[Green Party of the United States|Green]]| state=[[Massachusetts]]| pv= 1,457,218 | pv_pct= 1.07% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Ajamu Baraka]]| vp_party=[[Green Party (United States)|Green]]| vp_state=[[Illinois]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Evan McMullin]]| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Utah]]| pv= 731,991 | pv_pct= 0.54% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Mindy Finn]]| vp_party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name=[[Darrell Castle]]|| party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| state=[[Tennessee]]| pv= 203,090 | pv_pct= 0.15% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Scott Bradley (politician)|Scott Bradley]]| vp_party=[[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution]]| vp_state=[[Utah]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[Bernie Sanders]]{{efn|name=faithless}}| party=[[Independent politician|Independent]]| state=[[Vermont]]| pv= 111,850 {{efn|name=write-in}}| pv_pct= 0.08% {{efn|name=write-in}}| ev-projected=0| ev=1 (0)| vp_count=1| vp_name=[[Elizabeth Warren]]{{efn|name=faithless}}|vp_party=[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]| vp_state=[[Massachusetts]]| vp_ev=1}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row|name=[[Gloria La Riva]]|party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]|state=[[California]]| pv= 74,401 | pv_pct= 0.05% | ev-projected=0| ev=0| vp_name=[[Eugene Puryear]]|vp_party=[[Party for Socialism and Liberation|Socialism and Liberation]]| vp_state=[[District of Columbia]]}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box rowspan| name=[[John Kasich]]{{efn|name=faithless}}{{efn|name=paul-kasich|Two faithless electors from Texas cast their presidential votes for Ron Paul and John Kasich, respectively.

However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |newspaper=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nEarly exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected.

The width, however, is usually greater than or equal to the length. The articular surfaces of the cervical centra are \"slightly concave and kidney-shaped, with rounded, slightly rugose edges.\" Small holes called foramina subcentralia are found on the ventral surface of the centra. Some of the dorsals have rugose articular edges, like the cervicals; this feature is typically absent from the caudals.<ref name=Storrs170/>\n\nRibs are found from the neck to the tail. Cervical ribs are hatchet-shaped and have two articular heads.<ref name=Storrs170/> Dorsal ribs are thick and have only one head.

A pair of oval holes called pectoral fenestrae are found midway along the scapular/coracoid contacts.<ref name=Storrs171/> The forelimbs are elongate and relatively narrow compared to those of most plesiosaurs. The [[humerus]] (upper arm bone) has distinctive curvature, which appears to be a retained [[symplesiomorphy|primitive feature]] among [[sauropterygia]]ns.

It was so-named (\"near lizard\") by [[William Daniel Conybeare|William Conybeare]] and [[Henry De la Beche]], to indicate that it was more like a normal reptile than ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'', which had been found in the same rock strata just a few years earlier. ''Plesiosaurus'' is the archetypical genus of Plesiosauria and the first to be described, hence lending its name to the order. Conybeare and De la Beche coined the name for scattered finds from the Bristol region, [[Dorset]], and [[Lyme Regis]] in 1821. The [[type species]] of ''Plesiosaurus'', ''P. dolichodeirus'', was named and described by Conybeare in 1824 on the basis of Anning's original finds.\n\n==Classifications==\n''Plesiosaurus'' has historically been a [[wastebasket taxon]]. This is due in part to few anatomical or taxonomic studies of the relevant fossils. Uncritical taxonomic work resulted in hundreds of species representing most of the world and most of the Mesozoic being assigned to ''Plesiosaurus.'' None of the younger [[Jurassic]] or [[Cretaceous]] species belong to ''Plesiosaurus''. Review of the Early Jurassic species indicates that the only English species properly assigned to ''Plesiosaurus'' is ''P. dolichodeirus''.<ref name=Storrs146/> Several other European Early Jurassic species have been assigned to new genera. ''P. brachypterygius'', ''P. guilielmiiperatoris'' and ''P. tournemirensis'', for example,  were assigned to the new genera ''[[Hydrorion]]'', ''[[Seeleyosaurus]]'' and ''[[Occitanosaurus]]''.\n\nThe following [[cladogram]] follows an analysis by Benson et al., 2012, and shows the placement of ''Plesiosaurus'' within Plesiosauria.<ref name=Bensonetal12>{{Cite journal | last1 = Benson | first1 = R.

Its U-shaped jaw and sharp teeth would have been like a fish trap. It propelled itself by the paddles, the tail being too short to be of much use. Its neck could have been used as a rudder when navigating during a chase. ''Plesiosaurus'' gave live birth to live young in the water like [[sea snake]]s. The young might have lived in [[estuary|estuaries]] before moving out into the open ocean.\nIt has been postulated that the long neck of ''Plesiosaurus'' would have been a hindrance when trying to speed up, any bend in the neck creating turbulences. <ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170705132908.htm</ref> If that is the case then ''Plesiosaurus'' would have had to keep its neck straigth to achieve good acceleration, something that would make hunting difficult. For this reason it may be possible that these animals would actually lie in wait for preys to come close instead of trying to pursue them.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Paleontology}}\n* [[Timeline of plesiosaur research]]\n* [[List of plesiosaur genera]]\n* [[Loch Ness Monster]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Sources===\n* Andrews, C.

It was so-named (\"near lizard\") by [[William Daniel Conybeare|William Conybeare]] and [[Henry De la Beche]], to indicate that it was more like a normal reptile than ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'', which had been found in the same rock strata just a few years earlier. ''Plesiosaurus'' is the archetypical genus of Plesiosauria and the first to be described, hence lending its name to the order. Conybeare and De la Beche coined the name for scattered finds from the Bristol region, [[Dorset]], and [[Lyme Regis]] in 1821. The [[type species]] of ''Plesiosaurus'', ''P. dolichodeirus'', was named and described by Conybeare in 1824 on the basis of Anning's original finds.\n\n==Classifications==\n''Plesiosaurus'' has historically been a [[wastebasket taxon]]. This is due in part to few anatomical or taxonomic studies of the relevant fossils. Uncritical taxonomic work resulted in hundreds of species representing most of the world and most of the Mesozoic being assigned to ''Plesiosaurus.'' None of the younger [[Jurassic]] or [[Cretaceous]] species belong to ''Plesiosaurus''. Review of the Early Jurassic species indicates that the only English species properly assigned to ''Plesiosaurus'' is ''P. dolichodeirus''.<ref name=Storrs146/> Several other European Early Jurassic species have been assigned to new genera. ''P. brachypterygius'', ''P. guilielmiiperatoris'' and ''P. tournemirensis'', for example,  were assigned to the new genera ''[[Hydrorion]]'', ''[[Seeleyosaurus]]'' and ''[[Occitanosaurus]]''.\n\nThe following [[cladogram]] follows an analysis by Benson et al., 2012, and shows the placement of ''Plesiosaurus'' within Plesiosauria.<ref name=Bensonetal12>{{Cite journal | last1 = Benson | first1 = R.

Its U-shaped jaw and sharp teeth would have been like a fish trap. It propelled itself by the paddles, the tail being too short to be of much use. Its neck could have been used as a rudder when navigating during a chase. ''Plesiosaurus'' gave live birth to live young in the water like [[sea snake]]s. The young might have lived in [[estuary|estuaries]] before moving out into the open ocean.\nIt has been postulated that the long neck of ''Plesiosaurus'' would have been a hindrance when trying to speed up, any bend in the neck creating turbulences. <ref>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170705132908.htm</ref> If that is the case then ''Plesiosaurus'' would have had to keep its neck straigth to achieve good acceleration, something that would make hunting difficult. For this reason it may be possible that these animals would actually lie in wait for preys to come close instead of trying to pursue them.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Paleontology}}\n* [[Timeline of plesiosaur research]]\n* [[List of plesiosaur genera]]\n* [[Loch Ness Monster]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Sources===\n* Andrews, C.

It rotates around a center star Pin, its day-night cycle simulated by a ring of shadow blocks rotating between Pendor and Pin, creating 292 day/night cycles per earth year. The system also includes a planet called Pandora, its moon Pindam and a space station called Parma.\n\nIn one of the earliest Journal Entries, Kennet Shardik travels back in time to give an earlier version of himself his [[Artificial Intelligence]], named Fawn Destiniere.
