These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events.

The [[St. Louis Cardinals]] defeated the heavily favored [[New York Mets]] in seven games to advance to the [[2006 World Series]] against the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\nThe Cardinals and the Mets took the series to the limit, reaching the 9th inning of Game 7 tied at 1\u20131. The Cardinals took the lead with [[Yadier Molina]]'s two-run [[home run]] off Mets reliever [[Aaron Heilman]] in the 9th to put his team ahead, 3\u20131. [[Adam Wainwright]] would then hold the Mets scoreless in the bottom of the 9th to give St. Louis their second pennant in three years and 17th in club history, placing them one behind the [[San Francisco Giants|New York/San Francisco Giants]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers]] for most in NL modern history (since 1903). The Cardinals were making their third consecutive appearance in the NLCS; manager [[Tony La Russa]], who led St. Louis to the 2004 pennant and previously won AL titles with the [[Oakland Athletics]] from 1988\u201390, became the first manager in history to win multiple pennants in both leagues.\n\nThe Mets, handicapped after season-ending injuries to [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez]], qualified for postseason play for the first time since [[2000 New York Mets season|2000]]. They defeated the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] three games to none in the [[2006 National League Division Series|NL Division Series]], while the Cardinals defeated the [[San Diego Padres]] three games to one. The Mets had home-field advantage due to their better record in the regular season (the Mets were 97\u201365, the Cardinals 83\u201378). The Mets and Cardinals previously met in the [[2000 National League Championship Series|2000 NLCS]], which the Mets won in five games.\n\nThe Cardinals would go on to defeat the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the [[2006 World Series|World Series]] in five games.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===New York Mets vs. St. Louis Cardinals===\n{{MLB Playoff Summary\n| summary =\n| winner = St. Louis\n| score = 4-3\n| score1 = St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 0, '''New York Mets''' \u2013 2\n| date1 = October 12\u2020\n| loc1 = [[Shea Stadium]]\n| time1 = 2:52\n| att1 = 56,311\n| ref1 = <ref name=\"Game1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10120NYN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 1 - St. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score2 = '''St. Louis Cardinals''' \u2013 9, New York Mets \u2013 6\n| date2 = October 13\u2020\n| loc2 = Shea Stadium\n| time2 = 3:58\n| att2 = 56,349\n| ref2 = <ref name=\"Game2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10130NYN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 2 - St. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score3 = New York Mets \u2013 0, '''St. Louis Cardinals''' \u2013 5\n| date3 = October 14\n| loc3 = [[Busch Stadium]]\n| time3 = 2:53\n| att3 = 47,053\n| ref3 = <ref name=\"Game3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10140SLN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 3 - New York Mets vs. St. Louis Cardinals|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score4 = '''New York Mets''' \u2013 12, St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 5\n| date4 = October 15\n| loc4 = Busch Stadium\n| time4 = 3:31\n| att4 = 46,600\n| ref4 = <ref name=\"Game4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10150SLN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 4 - New York Mets vs. St. Louis Cardinals|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score5 = New York Mets \u2013 2, '''St. Louis Cardinals''' \u2013 4\n| date5 = October 17\u2021\n| loc5 = Busch Stadium\n| time5 = 3:26\n| att5 = 46,496\n| ref5 = <ref name=\"Game5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10170SLN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 5 - New York Mets vs. St. Louis Cardinals|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score6 = St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 2, '''New York Mets''' \u2013 4\n| date6 = October 18\n| loc6 = Shea Stadium\n| time6 = 2:56\n| att6 = 56,334\n| ref6 = <ref name=\"Game6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10180NYN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 6 - St. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score7 = '''St. Louis Cardinals''' \u2013 3, New York Mets \u2013 1\n| date7 = October 19\n| loc7 = Shea Stadium\n| time7 = 3:23\n| att7 = 56,357\n| ref7 = <ref name=\"Game7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10190NYN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 7 - St. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n}}\n<small>\u2020: Game 1 was postponed due to rain on October 11.

[[Tom Glavine]] earned the win with seven innings of shutout baseball. The game's only runs came on a two-run homer by [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] off losing pitcher [[Jeff Weaver]] in the sixth following a two-out single by [[Paul Lo Duca]]. Glavine was aided by stellar defense, as the Mets turned two double plays. In the third inning, with runners on first and second, third baseman [[David Wright]] caught a [[line drive]] off the bat of [[David Eckstein]] and threw to second to double up [[Yadier Molina]]. In the following inning, [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] flied out to shallow center to Beltr\u00e1n, who threw to first on the run to double up [[Albert Pujols]], who went 0-for-3 with a walk. Left fielder [[Endy Ch\u00e1vez]] also made an excellent diving play on a flare hit by [[Ronnie Belliard]]. He replaced [[Cliff Floyd]], who left in the second inning when he reaggravated his injured [[Achilles tendon]].\n\nFollowing the game, [[Albert Pujols]] was controversially critical of Glavine's performance, saying that the Cards would have dominated him if they were on their \"A\" game. His exact words were:\n \t\t\n<blockquote>\"He wasn't good. He wasn't good at all ... I think we hit the ball hard, we didn't get some breaks. I say he wasn't good at all. We just didn't get some opportunities and that's it.... [He did the] same thing that he always does. Throw a changeup, fastball and that was it.\"<ref>https://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/14/sports/sp-nlnotes14</ref> </blockquote>\n \t\t \t\nPujols' comments drew criticism from fans, talk-show hosts, broadcasters, and even his own manager. Tony La Russa, while maintaining that Pujols made the remarks in the heat of the moment, said \"It's not a good statement. Glavine deserves credit.\" <ref>https://sports.yahoo.com/news/pujols-comments-draw-attention-004800985--mlb.html</ref> Tom Glavine, when asked, merely said that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. His teammate Billy Wagner, on the other hand, said:\n \t\t\t\n<blockquote>\"I know if Albert would have said that about me, I wouldn't have been as veteraned, as seasoned about it ... I probably would have said something back. That's me. Tom is classy all the way ... Tom's done so much. Tom doesn't have to stoop to tell people how good he is ... His numbers speak for themselves. With 290 wins for somebody that has been in the league as long as he has is pretty self-explanatory ...Tommy's stature is much bigger than Pujols'. He's [got] a Hall of Fame induction coming. Albert doesn't. Albert's a great player, but you just don't know about tomorrow. In this clubhouse, Tommy is the epitome of class and great leadership. He leads by what he does in the field. He doesn't lead by what he says in the media.\" <ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2006/news/story?id=2630313</ref>\n \t\n</blockquote>\n\n===Game 2===\nFriday, October 13, 2006 at [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Queens, New York]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''St. Louis'''|RoadAbr=STL\n|R1=0|R2=2|R3=2|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=2|R8=0|R9=3|RR=9|RH=10|RE=1\n|Home=New York|HomeAbr=NYM\n|H1=3|H2=1|H3=0|H4=0|H5=1|H6=1|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=6|HH=9|HE=2\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Josh Kinney]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Billy Wagner]] (0\u20131)|SV=[[Adam Wainwright]] (1)\n|RoadHR=[[Jim Edmonds]] (1), [[So Taguchi]] (1)|HomeHR=[[Carlos Delgado]] 2 (2)\n|}}\n\nIn Game 2, the Cardinals erased three deficits en route to a 9\u20136 victory. In the first inning, [[Carlos Delgado]] hit a three-run home run off the Cardinals' ace [[Chris Carpenter]]. [[Yadier Molina]] then drove in two runs with a bases-loaded double in the second inning off of [[John Maine]]. In the bottom of the second, [[Endy Chavez]] hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on [[Jos\u00e9 Reyes (shortstop)|Jos\u00e9 Reyes]]'s, but [[Jim Edmonds]]'s home run after a walk tied the game in the third. Delgado's home run in the fifth put the Mets back on top 5\u20134. Next inning, Cardinals reliever [[Josh Hancock]] walked Reyes, who scored on [[Paul Lo Duca]]'s double, but [[Scott Spiezio]], who started the game at third base in place of an injured [[Scott Rolen]], had two hits and three [[RBI]]s, including a two-run triple on an 0\u20132 pitch in the seventh inning to tie the game at six off of [[Guillermo Mota]]. Lefty closer [[Billy Wagner]] came into the game in the top of the ninth inning. Left fielder [[Chris Duncan]], a lefty hitter, was due to lead off, so, Duncan was pulled in favor of [[So Taguchi]], a right-hitting outfielder who was a better defensive option than Duncan. Taguchi homered on the ninth pitch of the at-bat to put the Cardinals ahead, 7\u20136. [[Albert Pujols]] doubled and moved to third on a groundout before Spiezio's RBI double and [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]]'s single extended the Cardinals' lead to 9\u20136. [[Tyler Johnson (baseball, born 1981)|Tyler Johnson]] and [[Adam Wainwright]] retired the Mets in order in the bottom of the ninth as the Cardinals' win tied the series 1\u20131.\n\n===Game 3===\nSaturday, October 14, 2006 at [[Busch Stadium|Busch Stadium (III)]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=New York|RoadAbr=NYM\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=0|RH=3|RE=0\n|Home='''St. Louis'''|HomeAbr=STL\n|H1=2|H2=3|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=X|HR=5|HH=8|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Jeff Suppan]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Steve Trachsel]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=[[Jeff Suppan]] (1)\n|}}\n\nBack in St. Louis for the next three games, St. Louis starter [[Jeff Suppan]] pitched eight innings as the Cardinals defeated the Mets, 5\u20130. [[Scott Spiezio]] hit a two-run triple (his second two-run triple in as many games) in the bottom of the first inning to put the Cardinals ahead, 2\u20130. The Cardinals loaded the bases on two walks afterward, but Mets starter [[Steve Trachsel]] struck out [[Yadier Molina]] looking to end the inning. Next inning, Suppan's leadoff home run made it 3\u20130, who then loaded the bases on two walks and a line drive off the bat of [[Preston Wilson]] that hit Trachsel, who left with a bruised thigh. Mets reliever [[Darren Oliver]] threw a wild pitch to [[Jim Edmonds]] that let [[David Eckstein]] score before Edmonds's RBI groundout plated the last run of the game. Oliver then pitched six shutout innings. After the game, the Mets had not scored in twelve consecutive innings, making it fourteen before scoring in the third inning of Game 4.\n\n===Game 4===\nSunday, October 15, 2006 at [[Busch Stadium|Busch Stadium (III)]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''New York'''|RoadAbr=NYM\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=2|R4=0|R5=3|R6=6|R7=1|R8=0|R9=0|RR=12|RH=14|RE=1\n|Home=St. Louis|HomeAbr=STL\n|H1=0|H2=1|H3=1|H4=0|H5=1|H6=2|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=5|HH=11|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[\u00d3liver P\u00e9rez]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Brad Thompson]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] 2 (3), [[David Wright]] (1), [[Carlos Delgado]] (3)|HomeHR=[[David Eckstein]] (1), [[Jim Edmonds]] (2), [[Yadier Molina]] (1)\n|}}\n\nGame 4 was a pivotal game for the Mets, who were faced with a two-games-to-one deficit. They sent [[\u00d3liver P\u00e9rez]], a young lefty picked up at the trade deadline from the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], to face the Cardinals' own young starter, [[Anthony Reyes]]. In a game that would see an NLCS-record-tying seven home runs, the Cardinals grabbed an early lead in the bottom of the second on a [[Yadier Molina]] single. It seemed to be a repeat of the night before, but in the top of the third the Mets hit two home runs, one being [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]]'s second of the series and sixth against the Cardinals in NLCS play, and another representing [[David Wright]]'s first hit of the series and first homer of the playoffs. The lead was short-lived, as [[Scott Spiezio]] walked with one out, then scored on [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]]'s two-out triple to tie the game. The game would stay tied until the top of the fifth inning, when [[Paul Lo Duca]] reached on an error by Cardinals second baseman [[Ronnie Belliard]], Beltr\u00e1n managed a walk, and [[Carlos Delgado]] scored an opposite-field three-run homer, his third of the series, to make it 5\u20132 Mets and knock starter [[Brad Thompson]] out of the game. [[David Eckstein]] pulled the Cards back in the bottom of the fifth with a leadoff homer, but, in the top of the sixth, the Mets extended the lead. [[Jos\u00e9 Reyes (shortstop)|Jos\u00e9 Reyes]] and Paul Lo Duca hit back-to-back singles off of [[Josh Hancock]], and Beltr\u00e1n walked to load the bases. Delgado then hit a ground-rule double to drive in two runs, and then Wright walked. [[Tyler Johnson (baseball, born 1981)|Tyler Johnson]] relieved Hancock and [[Shawn Green]] singled to drive in one run and [[Jos\u00e9 Valent\u00edn]], who, at that point, was only 3-for-20 in the playoffs, hit a bases-clearing double down the left field line to make it 11\u20133. The Cardinals got home runs from Edmonds and Molina to make it an 11\u20135 game, but Mets manager [[Willie Randolph]] then pulled starter P\u00e9rez and bought in [[submarine (baseball)|submarine]] pitcher [[Chad Bradford]] to try and limit the damage. Beltr\u00e1n would tie the NLCS record of seven home runs with another in the seventh off of [[Braden Looper]] en route to a final score of 12\u20135. Beltr\u00e1n also tied [[Babe Ruth]] for the all-time postseason record of seven home runs against the Cardinals, having hit four against them in the [[2004 National League Championship Series]] while playing for the [[Houston Astros]].\n\n===Game 5===\nTuesday, October 17, 2006 at [[Busch Stadium|Busch Stadium (III)]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=New York|RoadAbr=NYM\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=2|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=2|RH=8|RE=0\n|Home='''St. Louis'''|HomeAbr=STL\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=2|H5=1|H6=1|H7=0|H8=0|H9=X|HR=4|HH=10|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Jeff Weaver]] (1\u20131)|LP=[[Tom Glavine]] (1\u20131)|SV=[[Adam Wainwright]] (2)\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=[[Albert Pujols]] (1), [[Chris Duncan]] (1)\n|}}\n\nAfter Game 5 was pushed back a day by rain, giving their starter now four days' normal rest instead of three days' short rest, the Mets sought a 3\u20132 lead in the NLCS. However, pitcher [[Tom Glavine]] could not stifle the Cardinals' offense. After the Mets jumped out to a 2\u20130 lead on [[Jose Valentin]]'s double off of [[Jeff Weaver]], the next half-inning [[Albert Pujols]] struck for his first home run and RBI of the series to cut the Mets' lead in half. Glavine then walked [[Scott Rolen]] and allowed a single to [[Jim Edmonds]] before [[Ronnie Belliard]] tied the game with a single to left. [[David Eckstein]] singled to lead off the fifth and scored on [[Preston Wilson]] double to put the Cardinals up 3\u20132. St. Louis padded their lead in the sixth through a pinch-hit home run by rookie [[Chris Duncan]] off of [[Pedro Feliciano]] that made the final score 4\u20132, Cardinals.

He allowed no runs in {{frac|5|1|3}} innings, earning the win for the Mets. [[Jos\u00e9 Reyes (shortstop)|Jos\u00e9 Reyes]] hit a leadoff home run in the bottom of the first, giving the Mets a lead that would never be relinquished. Reyes became the first Met to lead off with a home run in the first inning of a postseason game since former outfielder [[Lenny Dykstra]] in Game 3 of the [[1986 World Series]] against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The Cardinals stranded several runners against Maine. In the top of the first inning, with runners on second and third and one out, Maine struck out [[Jim Edmonds]]. After Maine hit [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] with a pitch to load the bases, [[Scott Rolen]] flew out. In the top of the third, with a runner on second and nobody out, Maine struck out [[Scott Spiezio]] and intentionally walked [[Albert Pujols]]. Edmonds then flew out and Maine struck out Encarnaci\u00f3n to finish the job. [[Shawn Green]] hit an RBI single in the fourth off of starter [[Chris Carpenter]] and [[Paul Lo Duca]] added two more with an RBI hit in the seventh off of [[Braden Looper]]. [[Billy Wagner]] came on in the ninth and allowed a leadoff single to [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] and subsequent double to [[Scott Rolen]]. After retiring the next two batters, Wagner gave up a two-RBI double to [[So Taguchi]] before retiring [[David Eckstein]] to end the game.\n\n===Game 7===\n[[File:Endy Chavez plaque.JPG|thumb|Endy Ch\u00e1vez plaque]]\nThursday, October 19, 2006 at [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Queens, New York]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''St. Louis'''|RoadAbr=STL\n|R1=0|R2=1|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=2|RR=3|RH=6|RE=1\n|Home=New York|HomeAbr=NYM\n|H1=1|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=1|HH=4|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Randy Flores]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Aaron Heilman]] (0\u20131)|SV=[[Adam Wainwright]] (3)\n|RoadHR=[[Yadier Molina]] (2)|HomeHR=\n|}}\nIn the decisive Game 7, the Mets sent Game 4 winner [[\u00d3liver P\u00e9rez]] to the mound against [[Jeff Suppan]]. The Mets jumped out to an early 1\u20130 lead when [[David Wright]] drove in [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] in the first with a bloop single into right field. The Cardinals tied the game in the second when [[Ronnie Belliard]] hit into a squeeze play that scored [[Jim Edmonds]] from third. In the fifth, with runners on first and second and two gone, [[Albert Pujols]] came up to the plate. Even with [[Chad Bradford]] warming up in the bullpen, [[Willie Randolph]] decided to stay with P\u00e9rez. He got Pujols to pop out. P\u00e9rez ran into some more trouble in the sixth with a runner on and one out, when [[Scott Rolen]] hit a long fly ball to left field to create one of the greatest defensive plays in postseason history.\n\nThe ball cleared the fence, but [[Endy Ch\u00e1vez]] amazingly brought it back by snow-coning the ball, jumping from the edge of the warning track to retrieve what looked to be an easy home run. He then threw the ball to first base quickly to double off Jim Edmonds, who had rounded second on his way to third, to end the inning. He received two curtain calls from the Shea crowd. With the bases loaded and one out in the bottom of the sixth, [[Jos\u00e9 Valent\u00edn]] and Ch\u00e1vez failed to get the go-ahead run in.\n\nWith the score 1\u20131 in the top of the ninth, [[Yadier Molina]], with a man on-base, hit a deep fly off [[Aaron Heilman]] in the same general direction as the one Rolen hit in the sixth. This ball was hit too high for Ch\u00e1vez to catch, and it gave the Cardinals a 3\u20131 lead, with only three outs in the bottom of the ninth separating them from a pennant.\n\nHowever, the Mets would not go quietly. Rookie closer [[Adam Wainwright]] yielded singles to Valent\u00edn and Ch\u00e1vez to lead off the ninth. After getting a strikeout and a flyout, Wainwright walked [[Paul Lo Duca]] to bring up Carlos Beltr\u00e1n with the bases loaded. Down 0\u20132 to the rookie Wainwright, Beltr\u00e1n looked at a called strike three, a curveball on the outside corner at the knees, to end the game.\n\nThis was the last playoff game played in Shea Stadium and the last postseason appearance for the Mets until [[2015 NLDS|2015]], six years after [[Citi Field]] opened. It is also the second time that a visiting team won a postseason series at Shea (the other being the Yankees' victory over the Mets in the [[2000 World Series]]).\n\n==Composite box==\n2006 NLCS '''(4\u20133): [[St. Louis Cardinals]]''' over [[New York Mets]]\n{{Linescore\n|Road='''[[St. Louis Cardinals]]'''\n|R1=2|R2=7|R3=3|R4=2|R5=2|R6=3|R7=2|R8=0|R9=7|RR=28|RH=56|RE=4\n|Home='''[[New York Mets]]'''\n|H1=5|H2=1|H3=2|H4=3|H5=4|H6=9|H7=3|H8=0|H9=0|HR=27|HH=54|HE=4\n|TotalAttendance=365,500 |AveAttendance=52,214\n}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Cardinals would win the World Series by defeating the heavily favored Detroit Tigers. With 83 wins, the Cardinals set a record for the worst regular season win-loss total for any championship team. They would win another World Series in [[2011 World Series|2011]] and make another World Series appearance in [[2013 World Series|2013]] (where they lost to the [[Boston Red Sox]]). Manager Tony La Russa retired after the 2011 season, going out a champion.\n\nAs for the Mets, many commentators and fans had predicted that 2006 would be the beginning of a dynasty. They had dominated the National League that season, winning 97 games when no one else won more than 88, and they had a deep and young core, with Beltran, Wright, and Reyes being under 30 (the latter two being under 25). Supporting those three were Hall of Fame caliber players such as Carlos Delgado, Tom Glavine, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, and Billy Wagner.\n\nNonetheless, 2006 stands as the only major achievement for this group. They suffered an historic collapse at the end of the 2007 season, losing 12 of their final 17 games to blow a 7-game division lead and miss the postseason by one game. After a smaller late-season collapse the next season, they again missed the postseason by one game. They ultimately would not return to the postseason until [[2015 New York Mets Season|2015]]. Manager Willie Randolph was fired in the middle of the 2008 season, Delgado played his last game in 2009, General Manager [[Omar Minaya]] was fired after 2010 (In 2017, he was brought back as a Special Assistant to then-General Manager [[Sandy Alderson]]), Beltran was dealt away at the 2011 trade deadline, and Reyes left via free agency that offseason. Reyes would eventually return to the Mets in [[2016 New York Mets season|2016]]; he, along with David Wright, would leave the Mets after the 2018 season - Reyes's contract was not renewed, and Wright retired as a result of [[spinal stenosis]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{external media|video1={{youtube|YRuQ0JvxS4Y|2006 NLCS Game 7 (Cardinals vs. Mets)}}}}\n*2006 NLCS [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/VSLN32006.htm box scores and play-by-play] at Retrosheet\n*2006 NLCS [https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2006_NLCS.shtml statistics] at Baseball Reference\n*[http://proxy.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2006/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&id=2632739 \"Cardinals win unlikely pennant\"], ESPN.com\n*[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1115809/index.htm \"Seventh Heaven\"], ''Sports Illustrated''\n\n{{2006 MLB Playoffs navbox}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{NLCS}}\n{{St. Louis Cardinals}}\n{{New York Mets}}\n{{Major League Baseball on Fox}}\n{{Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:National League Championship Series]]\n[[Category:2006 Major League Baseball season|National League Championship Series]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Cardinals postseason]]\n[[Category:New York Mets postseason]]\n[[Category:2006 in sports in Missouri|National League Championship Series]]\n[[Category:2006 in sports in New York City|National League Championship Series]]\n[[Category:2000s in St. Louis]]\n[[Category:October 2006 sports events in the United States|National League Championship Series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Infobox LCS\n  | image = 2006 NLCS Logo.png\n  | year = 2006\n  | champion = [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (4)\n  | champion_manager = [[Tony La Russa]]\n  | champion_games = 83\u201378, .516, GA: 1\u00bd\n  | runnerup = [[New York Mets]] (3)\n  | runnerup_manager = [[Willie Randolph]]\n  | runnerup_games = 97\u201365, .599, GA: 12\n  | date = October 11\u201319\n  | MVP = [[Jeff Suppan]] (St. Louis)\n  | television = [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]\n  | announcers = [[Joe Buck]], [[Tim McCarver]] and [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder)|Luis Gonzalez]]\n  | radio_network = [[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio|ESPN]]\n  | radio_announcers = [[Dan Shulman]] and [[Dave Campbell (infielder)|Dave Campbell]]\n  | umpires = [[Tim Welke]], [[Jim Joyce]], [[Jerry Layne]], [[Fieldin Culbreth]], [[Jeff Kellogg]], [[Gary Darling]]\n  | LDS1 = '''[[New York Mets]]''' over [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (3\u20130)\n  | LDS2 = '''[[St. Louis Cardinals]]''' over [[San Diego Padres]] (3\u20131)\n}}\nThe '''2006 [[National League Championship Series]]''' ('''NLCS'''), the second round of the 2006 [[National League]] playoffs, began on October 12 and ended on October 19; it was scheduled to begin on October 11, but was postponed a day because of inclement weather. The [[St. Louis Cardinals]] defeated the heavily favored [[New York Mets]] in seven games to advance to the [[2006 World Series]] against the [[Detroit Tigers]].\n\nThe Cardinals and the Mets took the series to the limit, reaching the 9th inning of Game 7 tied at 1\u20131. The Cardinals took the lead with [[Yadier Molina]]'s two-run [[home run]] off Mets reliever [[Aaron Heilman]] in the 9th to put his team ahead, 3\u20131. [[Adam Wainwright]] would then hold the Mets scoreless in the bottom of the 9th to give St. Louis their second pennant in three years and 17th in club history, placing them one behind the [[San Francisco Giants|New York/San Francisco Giants]] and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers]] for most in NL modern history (since 1903). The Cardinals were making their third consecutive appearance in the NLCS; manager [[Tony La Russa]], who led St. Louis to the 2004 pennant and previously won AL titles with the [[Oakland Athletics]] from 1988\u201390, became the first manager in history to win multiple pennants in both leagues.\n\nThe Mets, handicapped after season-ending injuries to [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez]], qualified for postseason play for the first time since [[2000 New York Mets season|2000]]. They defeated the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] three games to none in the [[2006 National League Division Series|NL Division Series]], while the Cardinals defeated the [[San Diego Padres]] three games to one. The Mets had home-field advantage due to their better record in the regular season (the Mets were 97\u201365, the Cardinals 83\u201378). The Mets and Cardinals previously met in the [[2000 National League Championship Series|2000 NLCS]], which the Mets won in five games.\n\nThe Cardinals would go on to defeat the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the [[2006 World Series|World Series]] in five games.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===New York Mets vs. St. Louis Cardinals===\n{{MLB Playoff Summary\n| summary =\n| winner = St. Louis\n| score = 4-3\n| score1 = St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 0, '''New York Mets''' \u2013 2\n| date1 = October 12\u2020\n| loc1 = [[Shea Stadium]]\n| time1 = 2:52\n| att1 = 56,311\n| ref1 = <ref name=\"Game1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10120NYN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 1 - St. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score2 = '''St. Louis Cardinals''' \u2013 9, New York Mets \u2013 6\n| date2 = October 13\u2020\n| loc2 = Shea Stadium\n| time2 = 3:58\n| att2 = 56,349\n| ref2 = <ref name=\"Game2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10130NYN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 2 - St. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score3 = New York Mets \u2013 0, '''St. Louis Cardinals''' \u2013 5\n| date3 = October 14\n| loc3 = [[Busch Stadium]]\n| time3 = 2:53\n| att3 = 47,053\n| ref3 = <ref name=\"Game3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10140SLN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 3 - New York Mets vs. St. Louis Cardinals|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score4 = '''New York Mets''' \u2013 12, St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 5\n| date4 = October 15\n| loc4 = Busch Stadium\n| time4 = 3:31\n| att4 = 46,600\n| ref4 = <ref name=\"Game4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10150SLN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 4 - New York Mets vs. St. Louis Cardinals|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score5 = New York Mets \u2013 2, '''St. Louis Cardinals''' \u2013 4\n| date5 = October 17\u2021\n| loc5 = Busch Stadium\n| time5 = 3:26\n| att5 = 46,496\n| ref5 = <ref name=\"Game5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10170SLN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 5 - New York Mets vs. St. Louis Cardinals|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score6 = St. Louis Cardinals \u2013 2, '''New York Mets''' \u2013 4\n| date6 = October 18\n| loc6 = Shea Stadium\n| time6 = 2:56\n| att6 = 56,334\n| ref6 = <ref name=\"Game6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10180NYN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 6 - St. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n| score7 = '''St. Louis Cardinals''' \u2013 3, New York Mets \u2013 1\n| date7 = October 19\n| loc7 = Shea Stadium\n| time7 = 3:23\n| att7 = 56,357\n| ref7 = <ref name=\"Game7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/B10190NYN2006.htm|title=2006 NLCS Game 7 - St. Louis Cardinals vs. New York Mets|accessdate=September 13, 2009|publisher=Retrosheet}}</ref>\n}}\n<small>\u2020: Game 1 was postponed due to rain on October 11.

[[Tom Glavine]] earned the win with seven innings of shutout baseball. The game's only runs came on a two-run homer by [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] off losing pitcher [[Jeff Weaver]] in the sixth following a two-out single by [[Paul Lo Duca]]. Glavine was aided by stellar defense, as the Mets turned two double plays. In the third inning, with runners on first and second, third baseman [[David Wright]] caught a [[line drive]] off the bat of [[David Eckstein]] and threw to second to double up [[Yadier Molina]]. In the following inning, [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] flied out to shallow center to Beltr\u00e1n, who threw to first on the run to double up [[Albert Pujols]], who went 0-for-3 with a walk. Left fielder [[Endy Ch\u00e1vez]] also made an excellent diving play on a flare hit by [[Ronnie Belliard]]. He replaced [[Cliff Floyd]], who left in the second inning when he reaggravated his injured [[Achilles tendon]].\n\nFollowing the game, [[Albert Pujols]] was controversially critical of Glavine's performance, saying that the Cards would have dominated him if they were on their \"A\" game. His exact words were:\n \t\t\n<blockquote>\"He wasn't good. He wasn't good at all ... I think we hit the ball hard, we didn't get some breaks. I say he wasn't good at all.

Tony La Russa, while maintaining that Pujols made the remarks in the heat of the moment, said \"It's not a good statement. Glavine deserves credit.\" <ref>https://sports.yahoo.com/news/pujols-comments-draw-attention-004800985--mlb.html</ref> Tom Glavine, when asked, merely said that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. His teammate Billy Wagner, on the other hand, said:\n \t\t\t\n<blockquote>\"I know if Albert would have said that about me, I wouldn't have been as veteraned, as seasoned about it ... I probably would have said something back. That's me. Tom is classy all the way ... Tom's done so much. Tom doesn't have to stoop to tell people how good he is ... His numbers speak for themselves. With 290 wins for somebody that has been in the league as long as he has is pretty self-explanatory ...Tommy's stature is much bigger than Pujols'. He's [got] a Hall of Fame induction coming. Albert doesn't. Albert's a great player, but you just don't know about tomorrow. In this clubhouse, Tommy is the epitome of class and great leadership. He leads by what he does in the field.

Lefty closer [[Billy Wagner]] came into the game in the top of the ninth inning. Left fielder [[Chris Duncan]], a lefty hitter, was due to lead off, so, Duncan was pulled in favor of [[So Taguchi]], a right-hitting outfielder who was a better defensive option than Duncan. Taguchi homered on the ninth pitch of the at-bat to put the Cardinals ahead, 7\u20136.

Oliver then pitched six shutout innings. After the game, the Mets had not scored in twelve consecutive innings, making it fourteen before scoring in the third inning of Game 4.\n\n===Game 4===\nSunday, October 15, 2006 at [[Busch Stadium|Busch Stadium (III)]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''New York'''|RoadAbr=NYM\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=2|R4=0|R5=3|R6=6|R7=1|R8=0|R9=0|RR=12|RH=14|RE=1\n|Home=St. Louis|HomeAbr=STL\n|H1=0|H2=1|H3=1|H4=0|H5=1|H6=2|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=5|HH=11|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[\u00d3liver P\u00e9rez]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Brad Thompson]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=[[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] 2 (3), [[David Wright]] (1), [[Carlos Delgado]] (3)|HomeHR=[[David Eckstein]] (1), [[Jim Edmonds]] (2), [[Yadier Molina]] (1)\n|}}\n\nGame 4 was a pivotal game for the Mets, who were faced with a two-games-to-one deficit. They sent [[\u00d3liver P\u00e9rez]], a young lefty picked up at the trade deadline from the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], to face the Cardinals' own young starter, [[Anthony Reyes]]. In a game that would see an NLCS-record-tying seven home runs, the Cardinals grabbed an early lead in the bottom of the second on a [[Yadier Molina]] single. It seemed to be a repeat of the night before, but in the top of the third the Mets hit two home runs, one being [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]]'s second of the series and sixth against the Cardinals in NLCS play, and another representing [[David Wright]]'s first hit of the series and first homer of the playoffs. The lead was short-lived, as [[Scott Spiezio]] walked with one out, then scored on [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]]'s two-out triple to tie the game. The game would stay tied until the top of the fifth inning, when [[Paul Lo Duca]] reached on an error by Cardinals second baseman [[Ronnie Belliard]], Beltr\u00e1n managed a walk, and [[Carlos Delgado]] scored an opposite-field three-run homer, his third of the series, to make it 5\u20132 Mets and knock starter [[Brad Thompson]] out of the game. [[David Eckstein]] pulled the Cards back in the bottom of the fifth with a leadoff homer, but, in the top of the sixth, the Mets extended the lead. [[Jos\u00e9 Reyes (shortstop)|Jos\u00e9 Reyes]] and Paul Lo Duca hit back-to-back singles off of [[Josh Hancock]], and Beltr\u00e1n walked to load the bases. Delgado then hit a ground-rule double to drive in two runs, and then Wright walked. [[Tyler Johnson (baseball)|Tyler Johnson]] relieved Hancock and [[Shawn Green]] singled to drive in one run and [[Jos\u00e9 Valent\u00edn]], who, at that point, was only 3-for-20 in the playoffs, hit a bases-clearing double down the left field line to make it 11\u20133. The Cardinals got home runs from Edmonds and Molina to make it an 11\u20135 game, but Mets manager [[Willie Randolph]] then pulled starter P\u00e9rez and bought in [[submarine (baseball)|submarine]] pitcher [[Chad Bradford]] to try and limit the damage. Beltr\u00e1n would tie the NLCS record of seven home runs with another in the seventh off of [[Braden Looper]] en route to a final score of 12\u20135. Beltr\u00e1n also tied [[Babe Ruth]] for the all-time postseason record of seven home runs against the Cardinals, having hit four against them in the [[2004 National League Championship Series]] while playing for the [[Houston Astros]].\n\n===Game 5===\nTuesday, October 17, 2006 at [[Busch Stadium|Busch Stadium (III)]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=New York|RoadAbr=NYM\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=2|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=0|RR=2|RH=8|RE=0\n|Home='''St. Louis'''|HomeAbr=STL\n|H1=0|H2=0|H3=0|H4=2|H5=1|H6=1|H7=0|H8=0|H9=X|HR=4|HH=10|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Jeff Weaver]] (1\u20131)|LP=[[Tom Glavine]] (1\u20131)|SV=[[Adam Wainwright]] (2)\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=[[Albert Pujols]] (1), [[Chris Duncan]] (1)\n|}}\n\nAfter Game 5 was pushed back a day by rain, giving their starter now four days' normal rest instead of three days' short rest, the Mets sought a 3\u20132 lead in the NLCS. However, pitcher [[Tom Glavine]] could not stifle the Cardinals' offense. After the Mets jumped out to a 2\u20130 lead on [[Jose Valentin]]'s double off of [[Jeff Weaver]], the next half-inning [[Albert Pujols]] struck for his first home run and RBI of the series to cut the Mets' lead in half. Glavine then walked [[Scott Rolen]] and allowed a single to [[Jim Edmonds]] before [[Ronnie Belliard]] tied the game with a single to left. [[David Eckstein]] singled to lead off the fifth and scored on [[Preston Wilson]] double to put the Cardinals up 3\u20132. St. Louis padded their lead in the sixth through a pinch-hit home run by rookie [[Chris Duncan]] off of [[Pedro Feliciano]] that made the final score 4\u20132, Cardinals. The win moved the Cardinals within one of their second National League pennant in three years.\n\n===Game 6===\nWednesday, October 18, 2006 at [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Queens, New York]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road=St. Louis|RoadAbr=STL\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=2|RR=2|RH=7|RE=1\n|Home='''New York'''|HomeAbr=NYM\n|H1=1|H2=0|H3=0|H4=1|H5=0|H6=0|H7=2|H8=0|H9=X|HR=4|HH=10|HE=0\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[John Maine]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Chris Carpenter]] (0\u20131)|SV=\n|RoadHR=|HomeHR=[[Jos\u00e9 Reyes (shortstop)|Jos\u00e9 Reyes]] (1)\n|}}\n\nFacing elimination, the Mets sent [[John Maine]] to start Game&nbsp;6. He allowed no runs in {{frac|5|1|3}} innings, earning the win for the Mets. [[Jos\u00e9 Reyes (shortstop)|Jos\u00e9 Reyes]] hit a leadoff home run in the bottom of the first, giving the Mets a lead that would never be relinquished. Reyes became the first Met to lead off with a home run in the first inning of a postseason game since former outfielder [[Lenny Dykstra]] in Game 3 of the [[1986 World Series]] against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The Cardinals stranded several runners against Maine. In the top of the first inning, with runners on second and third and one out, Maine struck out [[Jim Edmonds]]. After Maine hit [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] with a pitch to load the bases, [[Scott Rolen]] flew out. In the top of the third, with a runner on second and nobody out, Maine struck out [[Scott Spiezio]] and intentionally walked [[Albert Pujols]]. Edmonds then flew out and Maine struck out Encarnaci\u00f3n to finish the job. [[Shawn Green]] hit an RBI single in the fourth off of starter [[Chris Carpenter]] and [[Paul Lo Duca]] added two more with an RBI hit in the seventh off of [[Braden Looper]]. [[Billy Wagner]] came on in the ninth and allowed a leadoff single to [[Juan Encarnaci\u00f3n]] and subsequent double to [[Scott Rolen]]. After retiring the next two batters, Wagner gave up a two-RBI double to [[So Taguchi]] before retiring [[David Eckstein]] to end the game.\n\n===Game 7===\n[[File:Endy Chavez plaque.JPG|thumb|Endy Ch\u00e1vez plaque]]\nThursday, October 19, 2006 at [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Queens, New York]]\n{{Linescore|\n|Road='''St. Louis'''|RoadAbr=STL\n|R1=0|R2=1|R3=0|R4=0|R5=0|R6=0|R7=0|R8=0|R9=2|RR=3|RH=6|RE=1\n|Home=New York|HomeAbr=NYM\n|H1=1|H2=0|H3=0|H4=0|H5=0|H6=0|H7=0|H8=0|H9=0|HR=1|HH=4|HE=1\n|RSP=|HSP=\n|WP=[[Randy Flores]] (1\u20130)|LP=[[Aaron Heilman]] (0\u20131)|SV=[[Adam Wainwright]] (3)\n|RoadHR=[[Yadier Molina]] (2)|HomeHR=\n|}}\nIn the decisive Game 7, the Mets sent Game 4 winner [[\u00d3liver P\u00e9rez]] to the mound against [[Jeff Suppan]]. The Mets jumped out to an early 1\u20130 lead when [[David Wright]] drove in [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] in the first with a bloop single into right field. The Cardinals tied the game in the second when [[Ronnie Belliard]] hit into a squeeze play that scored [[Jim Edmonds]] from third. In the fifth, with runners on first and second and two gone, [[Albert Pujols]] came up to the plate. Even with [[Chad Bradford]] warming up in the bullpen, [[Willie Randolph]] decided to stay with P\u00e9rez. He got Pujols to pop out. P\u00e9rez ran into some more trouble in the sixth with a runner on and one out, when [[Scott Rolen]] hit a long fly ball to left field to create one of the greatest defensive plays in postseason history.\n\nThe ball cleared the fence, but [[Endy Ch\u00e1vez]] amazingly brought it back by snow-coning the ball, jumping from the edge of the warning track to retrieve what looked to be an easy home run. He then threw the ball to first base quickly to double off Jim Edmonds, who had rounded second on his way to third, to end the inning. He received two curtain calls from the Shea crowd. With the bases loaded and one out in the bottom of the sixth, [[Jos\u00e9 Valent\u00edn]] and Ch\u00e1vez failed to get the go-ahead run in.\n\nWith the score 1\u20131 in the top of the ninth, [[Yadier Molina]], with a man on-base, hit a deep fly off [[Aaron Heilman]] in the same general direction as the one Rolen hit in the sixth. This ball was hit too high for Ch\u00e1vez to catch, and it gave the Cardinals a 3\u20131 lead, with only three outs in the bottom of the ninth separating them from a pennant.\n\nHowever, the Mets would not go quietly. Rookie closer [[Adam Wainwright]] yielded singles to Valent\u00edn and Ch\u00e1vez to lead off the ninth. After getting a strikeout and a flyout, Wainwright walked [[Paul Lo Duca]] to bring up Carlos Beltr\u00e1n with the bases loaded. Down 0\u20132 to the rookie Wainwright, Beltr\u00e1n looked at a called strike three, a curveball on the outside corner at the knees, to end the game.\n\nThis was the last playoff game played in Shea Stadium and the last postseason appearance for the Mets until [[2015 NLDS|2015]], six years after [[Citi Field]] opened. It is also the second time that a visiting team won a postseason series at Shea (the other being the Yankees' victory over the Mets in the [[2000 World Series]]).\n\n==Composite box==\n2006 NLCS '''(4\u20133): [[St. Louis Cardinals]]''' over [[New York Mets]]\n{{Linescore\n|Road='''[[St. Louis Cardinals]]'''\n|R1=2|R2=7|R3=3|R4=2|R5=2|R6=3|R7=2|R8=0|R9=7|RR=28|RH=56|RE=4\n|Home='''[[New York Mets]]'''\n|H1=5|H2=1|H3=2|H4=3|H5=4|H6=9|H7=3|H8=0|H9=0|HR=27|HH=54|HE=4\n|TotalAttendance=365,500 |AveAttendance=52,214\n}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Cardinals would win the World Series by defeating the heavily favored Detroit Tigers. With 83 wins, the Cardinals set a record for the worst regular season win-loss total for any championship team. They would win another World Series in [[2011 World Series|2011]] and make another World Series appearance in [[2013 World Series|2013]] (where they lost to the [[Boston Red Sox]]). Manager Tony La Russa retired after the 2011 season, going out a champion.\n\nAs for the Mets, many commentators and fans had predicted that 2006 would be the beginning of a dynasty. They had dominated the National League that season, winning 97 games when no one else won more than 88, and they had a deep and young core, with Beltran, Wright, and Reyes being under 30 (the latter two being under 25). Supporting those three were Hall of Fame caliber players such as Carlos Delgado, Tom Glavine, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, and Billy Wagner.\n\nNonetheless, 2006 stands as the only major achievement for this group. They suffered an historic collapse at the end of the 2007 season, losing 12 of their final 17 games to blow a 7-game division lead and miss the postseason by one game. After a smaller late-season collapse the next season, they again missed the postseason by one game. They ultimately would not return to the postseason until [[2015 New York Mets Season|2015]]. Manager Willie Randolph was fired in the middle of the 2008 season, Delgado played his last game in 2009, General Manager [[Omar Minaya]] was fired after 2010 (In 2017, he was brought back as a Special Assistant to then-General Manager [[Sandy Alderson]]), Beltran was dealt away at the 2011 trade deadline, and Reyes left via free agency that offseason. Reyes would eventually return to the Mets in [[2016 New York Mets season|2016]]; he, along with David Wright, would leave the Mets after the 2018 season - Reyes's contract was not renewed, and Wright retired as a result of [[spinal stenosis]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{external media|video1={{youtube|YRuQ0JvxS4Y|2006 NLCS Game 7 (Cardinals vs. Mets)}}}}\n*2006 NLCS [http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2006/VSLN32006.htm box scores and play-by-play] at Retrosheet\n*2006 NLCS [https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2006_NLCS.shtml statistics] at Baseball Reference\n*[http://proxy.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2006/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&id=2632739 \"Cardinals win unlikely pennant\"], ESPN.com\n*[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1115809/index.htm \"Seventh Heaven\"], ''Sports Illustrated''\n\n{{2006 MLB Playoffs navbox}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{NLCS}}\n{{St. Louis Cardinals}}\n{{New York Mets}}\n{{Major League Baseball on Fox}}\n{{Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:National League Championship Series]]\n[[Category:2006 Major League Baseball season|National League Championship Series]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Cardinals postseason]]\n[[Category:New York Mets postseason]]\n[[Category:2006 in sports in Missouri|National League Championship Series]]\n[[Category:2006 in sports in New York City|National League Championship Series]]\n[[Category:2000s in St. Louis]]\n[[Category:October 2006 sports events in the United States|National League Championship Series]]\n", "name_user": "KingSkyLord", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_National_League_Championship_Series"}

This uncommon round ''cella'' with polygonal ambulatory plan seems to be more typical of Western Gaul than elsewhere, as it is also found in examples at [[Saint-Gervais, Vend\u00e9e|Saint-Gervais]] (Vend\u00e9e) and  [[Chassenon]] (Charente).<ref name=CDA/>\n\n== Related sites ==\nA prospection of the Cantal ''d\u00e9partement'' made by Alphonse Vinati\u00e9 (1924 - 2005), a local archaeologist, made it possible to identify three other ancient sanctuaries in [[Landeyrat]] and [[Allanche]]<ref name=SEL>\n{{\ncite journal\n| last = Calbris\n| first = Maxime\n| title = Changes in Places of Worship in the Ancient Urban Zone at Mathoni\u00e8re, in Allanche (Cantal): An Analysis of Pedestrian, Arial, and Geophysical Surveys\n| journal = Si\u00e8cles (en ligne)\n| volume = 48\n| issue = 2020\n| publisher = OpenEdition Journals\n| date = 24 February 2020\n| url = http://journals.openedition.org/siecles/6279\n| accessdate = 25 April 2020\n}}\n</ref>, as well as possible sites in [[Celles, Cantal|Celles]], [[Charmensac]], and [[Mauriac, Cantal|Mauriac]] Vernols.<ref name=RACF/>\n\n== References == \n{{reflist}}\n== Further Reading ==\n* \u00ab Destruction \u00e0 Aurillac du seul sanctuaire gallo-romain de Haute-Auvergne \u00bb, Genevi\u00e8ve Charbonneau, [[1979]], in ''Revue Arch\u00e9ologia'', n\u00b0 131, p. 36-53,\n* \u00ab D\u00e9couverte d\u2019un temple gallo-romain \u00e0 Aurillac.
