Although they are usually transmitted by the [[orofaecal]] route, some are transmitted with the [[Host (biology)|host]]'s [[gamete]]s during [[copulation (zoology)|copulation]] (''[[Monocystis]]).\n\nIn all species, four or more [[sporozoite]]s (the precise number depends on the species) equipped with an apical complex escape from the [[oocyst]]s, a process called excystation, find their way to the appropriate body cavity, and penetrate host cells in their immediate environment. The sporozoites emerge within the host cell, begin to feed, and develop into larger [[trophozoite]]s. In some species, the sporozoites and trophozoites are capable of asexual replication \u2014 a process called [[schizogony]] or [[Protozoal merogony|merogony]]. Most species, however, appear to lack schizogony in their lifecycles.\n\nIn all species, two mature trophozoites eventually pair up in a process known as [[Meiosis|syzygy]] and develop into [[gamont]]s. During syzygy, gamont orientation differs between species (side-to-side, head-to-tail). A [[gametocyst]] wall forms around each pair of gamonts which then begin to divide into hundreds of [[gamete]]s. [[Zygote]]s are produced by the fusion of two gametes and these in turn become surrounded by an oocyst wall. Within the oocyst, [[meiosis]] occurs, yielding the sporozoites. Hundreds of oocysts accumulate within each gametocyst and these are released via host's [[faeces]] or via host death and decay.\n\n[[File:Lankesteria lm.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Lankesteria cystodytae]]'' is an intestinal parasite of [[ascidian]]s.

In the life cycle is an extracellular feeding stage known as the trophozoite.\n\n===Main divisions===\n\n'''Archigregarines''' are found only in marine habitats. They possess intestinal trophozoites similar in morphology to the infective sporozoites. Phylogenetic analysis suggests this group is paraphyletic and will need division. Generally, four zoites are in each spore in this group.\n\n'''Eugregarines''' are found in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. These species possess large trophozoites that are significantly different in morphology and behavior from the sporozoites. This taxon contains most of the known gregarine species. The intestinal [[Eugregarinorida|eugregarines]] are separated into septate \u2014 suborder [[Septatorina]] \u2014 and [[aseptate]] \u2014 suborder [[Aseptatorina]] \u2014 depending on whether the trophozoite is superficially divided by a transverse septum.

Although they are usually transmitted by the [[orofaecal]] route, some are transmitted with the [[Host (biology)|host]]'s [[gamete]]s during [[copulation (zoology)|copulation]] (''[[Monocystis]]).\n\nIn all species, four or more [[sporozoite]]s (the precise number depends on the species) equipped with an apical complex escape from the [[oocyst]]s, a process called excystation, find their way to the appropriate body cavity, and penetrate host cells in their immediate environment. The sporozoites emerge within the host cell, begin to feed, and develop into larger [[trophozoite]]s. In some species, the sporozoites and trophozoites are capable of asexual replication \u2014 a process called [[schizogony]] or [[Protozoal merogony|merogony]]. Most species, however, appear to lack schizogony in their lifecycles.\n\nIn all species, two mature trophozoites eventually pair up in a process known as [[Meiosis|syzygy]] and develop into [[gamont]]s. During syzygy, gamont orientation differs between species (side-to-side, head-to-tail). A [[gametocyst]] wall forms around each pair of gamonts which then begin to divide into hundreds of [[gamete]]s. [[Zygote]]s are produced by the fusion of two gametes and these in turn become surrounded by an oocyst wall. Within the oocyst, [[meiosis]] occurs, yielding the sporozoites. Hundreds of oocysts accumulate within each gametocyst and these are released via host's [[faeces]] or via host death and decay.\n\n[[File:Lankesteria lm.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Lankesteria cystodytae]]'' is an intestinal parasite of [[ascidian]]s.

Elleman 2001 p. 90\" /> However, one consequence was that France supplanted China's control of [[Tonkin]] (northern [[Vietnam]]). The war strengthened the dominance of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] over the Chinese government, but brought down the government of Prime Minister [[Jules Ferry]] in Paris. Both sides were satisfied with the [[Treaty of Tientsin (1885)|Treaty of Tientsin]].<ref>Twitchett, ''Cambridge History of China'', xi. 251; Chere, 188\u201390.</ref> According to Lloyd Eastman, \"neither nation reaped diplomatic gains.\"<ref> Eastman, p 201.</ref>\n\n== Prelude ==\nFrench interest in northern [[Vietnam]] dated from the late 18th century, when the political Catholic priest [[Pigneau de Behaine]] recruited French volunteers to fight for [[Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh]] and help begin the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]], in an attempt to gain privileges for France and for the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. France began its colonial campaign in 1858, annexing several southern provinces in 1862 to form the colony of [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]].\n\nFrench explorers followed the course of the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] through northern Vietnam to its source in [[Yunnan]], arousing hopes for a profitable trade route with China that could bypass the treaty ports of the Chinese coastal provinces.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 105\u20137</ref> The main obstacle to this idea, the [[Black Flag Army]] \u2013 a well-organized bandit force led by the formidable [[Liu Yongfu]] \u2013 was levying exorbitant \"taxes\" on Red River trade between [[S\u01a1n T\u00e2y]] and [[L\u00e0o Cai]] on the Yunnan border.\n\nIn 1873, a small French force commanded by Lieutenant de Vaisseau [[Francis Garnier]], exceeding his instructions, intervened militarily in northern Vietnam. Following a series of French victories against the Vietnamese, the Vietnamese government called on Liu Yongfu's Black Flags, who defeated Garnier's force beneath the walls of [[Hanoi]]. Garnier was killed in this battle, and the French government later disavowed his expedition.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 116\u201331</ref>\n\n=== Henri Rivi\u00e8re's expedition in Tonkin ===\n{{Main|Capture of Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh (1883)|Battle of Paper Bridge}}\n[[File:HenriRiviere1870s.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Commandant [[Henri Rivi\u00e8re (naval officer)|Henri Rivi\u00e8re]] (1827\u201383)]]\n\nIn 1881, French Commandant [[Henri Rivi\u00e8re (naval officer)|Henri Rivi\u00e8re]] was sent with a small military force to Hanoi to investigate Vietnamese complaints about the activities of French merchants.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 140\u201357</ref> In defiance of the instructions of his superiors, Rivi\u00e8re stormed the citadel of Hanoi on 25 April 1882.<ref>Marolles, 75\u201392</ref> Although Rivi\u00e8re subsequently returned the citadel to Vietnamese control, his recourse to force provoked alarm both in Vietnam and in China.<ref>Eastman, 51\u20137</ref>\n\nThe Vietnamese government, unable to confront Rivi\u00e8re with its own ramshackle army, once again enlisted the help of Liu Yongfu, whose well-trained and seasoned Black Flag soldiers would prove a thorn in the side of the French. The Vietnamese also bid for Chinese support. Vietnam had long been a vassal state of China, and China agreed to arm and support the Black Flags, and to covertly oppose French operations in Tonkin.\n\nThe Qing court also sent a strong signal to the French that China would not allow Tonkin to fall under French control. In the summer of 1882, troops of the Chinese [[Yunnan Army]] and [[Guangxi Army]] crossed the border into Tonkin, occupying L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, B\u1eafc Ninh, Hung Hoa and other towns.<ref>Marolles, 133\u201344; Lung Chang, 90\u20131</ref> The French minister to China, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bour\u00e9e, was so alarmed by the prospect of war with China that in November and December he negotiated a deal with the Chinese statesman [[Li Hongzhang]] to divide Tonkin into French and Chinese spheres of influence. Neither of the parties to these negotiations consulted the Vietnamese.<ref>Eastman, 57\u201365</ref>\n\n[[File:Riviere pushing the cannon forward at Sontay.jpg|thumb|260px|Rivi\u00e8re attempts to rescue a bogged French cannon during the [[Battle of Paper Bridge]]. (19 May 1883)]]\n\nRivi\u00e8re, disgusted at the deal cut by Bour\u00e9e, decided early in 1883 to force the issue. He had recently been sent a battalion of marine infantry from France, giving him just enough men to venture beyond Hanoi. On 27 March 1883, to secure his line of communications from Hanoi to the coast, Rivi\u00e8re captured the citadel of [[Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]] with a force of 520 French soldiers under his personal command.<ref>Marolles, 178\u201392</ref> During his absence at Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh, the Black Flags and Vietnamese made an attack on Hanoi, but Chef de Bataillon Berthe de Villers repulsed them in the [[Battle of Gia Cuc]] on 28 March.<ref>Huard, 26\u201330</ref> Rivi\u00e8re jubilantly reacted: 'This will force them to take forward their Tonkin Question!'{{citequote|date = January 2018}}\n\nRivi\u00e8re had perfect timing. He had expected to be cashiered for his [[Capture of Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh (1883)|Capture of Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]]; instead he found himself the hero of the hour. There had recently been a change of government in France, and the new administration of [[Jules Ferry]] strongly favoured colonial expansion. It therefore decided to back Rivi\u00e8re. Ferry and Foreign Minister Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour denounced Bour\u00e9e's agreement with Li Hongzhang and recalled the hapless French minister.<ref>Eastman, 62\u20139</ref> They also made it clear to the Chinese that they were determined to place Tonkin under French protection. In April 1883, realising that the Vietnamese lacked the means of resisting the French effectively, the Chinese civil Mandarin Tang Jingsong ([[Tang Jingsong]], \u5510\u666f\u5d27) persuaded Liu Yongfu to take the field against Rivi\u00e8re with the Black Flag Army. This resulted in a year of Liu Yongfu's forces fighting an unconventional war.<ref>{{cite book|volume=Volume 11, Part 2 of The Cambridge History of China Series|title=Late Ch'ing, 1800\u20131911|editor1-link=John K.

On 19 May Rivi\u00e8re confronted the Black Flags in the [[Battle of Paper Bridge]], and the French suffered a disastrous defeat. Rivi\u00e8re's small force (around 450 men) attacked a strong Black Flag defensive position near the village of C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y, a few miles to the west of Hanoi, known to the French as Paper Bridge (Pont de Papier). After initial successes the French were eventually enveloped on both wings; only with difficulty could they regroup and fall back to Hanoi. Rivi\u00e8re, Berthe de Villers and several other senior officers were killed in this action.<ref>Marolles, 193\u2013222; Duboc, 123\u201339; Huard, 6\u201316; Thomazi, ''Histoire militaire'', 55\u20138</ref>\n\n== French intervention in Tonkin ==\n{{Main|Tonkin Campaign}}\n[[File:Admiral Courbet drawing.jpg|thumb|Admiral Anatole-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Prosper Courbet (1827\u201385)]]\nRivi\u00e8re's death produced an angry reaction in France. Reinforcements were rushed to Tonkin, a threatened attack by the Black Flags on Hanoi was averted, and the military situation was stabilised.\n\n=== Protectorate over Tonkin ===\n{{Main|Battle of Ph\u1ee7 Ho\u00e0i|Battle of Thu\u1eadn An|Battle of Palan}}\nOn 20 August 1883 Admiral [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Courbet]], who had recently been appointed to the command of the newly formed Tonkin Coasts Naval Division, stormed the forts which guarded the approaches to the Vietnamese capital Hu\u1ebf in the [[Battle of Thu\u1eadn An]], and forced the Vietnamese government to sign the [[Treaty of Hu\u1ebf (1883)|Treaty of Hu\u1ebf]], placing [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|Tonkin under French protection]].<ref>Huard, 103\u201322; Loir, 13\u201322; Thomazi, ''Histoire militaire'', 62\u20134; ''Conqu\u00eate'', 165\u20136</ref>\n\nAt the same time the new commander of the Tonkin expeditionary corps, General Bou\u00ebt, attacked the Black Flag positions on the Day River. Although the French mauled the Black Flag Army in the [[Battle of Ph\u1ee7 Ho\u00e0i]] (15 August) and the [[Battle of Palan]] (1 September), they were unable to capture all of Liu Yongfu's positions, and in the eyes of the world the battles were tantamount to French defeats. Bou\u00ebt was widely held to have failed in his mission, and resigned in September 1883. In the event, severe flooding eventually forced Liu Yongfu to abandon the line of the Day River and fall back to the fortified city of [[S\u01a1n T\u00e2y]], several miles to the west.\n\n=== Confrontation between France and China ===\n[[File:Anti-foreign feeling in Guangzhou, 1883.jpg|thumb|left|300px|European residents walk warily in the streets of Guangzhou, autumn 1883.]]\nThe French prepared for a major offensive at the end of the year to annihilate the Black Flags, and tried to persuade China to withdraw its support for Liu Yongfu, while attempting to win the support of the other European powers for the projected offensive. However, negotiations in Shanghai in July 1883 between the French minister Arthur Tricou and [[Li Hongzhang]] were terminated by the Qing government on receipt of a naively optimistic assessment by Marquis [[Zeng Jize]], the Chinese minister to Paris, that the French government had no stomach for a full-scale war with China.<ref>Eastman, 76\u201384</ref> Jules Ferry and the French foreign minister [[Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour]] met a number of times in the summer and autumn of 1883 with Marquis Zeng in Paris, but these parallel diplomatic discussions also proved abortive.<ref>Eastman, 85\u20137</ref> The Chinese stood firm, and refused to withdraw substantial garrisons of Chinese regular troops from S\u01a1n T\u00e2y, B\u1eafc Ninh and L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, despite the likelihood that they would be shortly engaged in battle against the French. As war with China seemed increasingly likely, the French persuaded the German government to delay the release of ''[[Chinese turret ship Dingyuan|Dingyuan]]'' and ''[[Chinese turret ship Zhenyuan|Zhenyuan]]'', two modern battleships then being constructed in German shipyards for China's [[Beiyang Fleet]].<ref>Lung Chang, 180\u20133 and 184\u201394</ref> Meanwhile, the French consolidated their hold on the Delta by establishing posts at [[Qu\u1ea3ng Y\u00ean]], [[H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean]] and [[Ninh B\u00ecnh]].<ref>De Lonlay, ''Au Tonkin'', 111\u201316; Duboc, 207; Huard, 164\u201370</ref>\n\nThe growing tension between France and China gave rise to anti-foreign demonstrations inside China during the autumn of 1883. The most serious incidents took place in Guangdong province, where Europeans were most prominent. Attacks were made on the property of European merchants in Guangzhou and on Shamian island. Several European powers, including France, sent gunboats to Guangzhou to protect their nationals.\n\n==== S\u01a1n T\u00e2y and Bac Ninh ====\n{{Main|S\u01a1n T\u00e2y Campaign|B\u1eafc Ninh Campaign}}\n[[File:prise de Son Tay.jpg|thumb|260px|The capture of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y, 16 December 1883]]\nThe French accepted that an attack on Liu Yongfu would probably result in an undeclared war with China, but calculated that a quick victory in Tonkin would force the Chinese to accept a ''fait accompli''. Command of the Tonkin Campaign was entrusted to Admiral Courbet, who attacked [[S\u01a1n T\u00e2y]] in December 1883. The [[S\u01a1n T\u00e2y Campaign]] was the fiercest campaign the French had yet fought in Tonkin. Although the Chinese and Vietnamese contingents at Son Tay played little part in the defence, Liu Yongfu's Black Flags fought ferociously to hold the city. On 14 December the French assaulted the outer defences of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y at [[Phu Sa]], but were thrown back with heavy casualties. Hoping to exploit Courbet's defeat, Liu Yongfu attacked the French lines the same night, but the Black Flag attack also failed disastrously. After resting his troops on 15 December, Courbet again assaulted the defences of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y on the afternoon of 16 December. This time the attack was thoroughly prepared by artillery, and delivered only after the defenders had been worn down. At 5 p.m. a Foreign Legion battalion and a battalion of marine fusiliers captured the western gate of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y and fought their way into the town. Liu Yongfu's garrison withdrew to the citadel, and evacuated S\u01a1n T\u00e2y under cover of darkness several hours later. Courbet had achieved his objective, but at considerable cost. French casualties at Son Tay were 83 dead and 320 wounded. The fighting at S\u01a1n T\u00e2y also took a terrible toll of the Black Flags, and in the opinion of some observers broke them once and for all as a serious fighting force. Liu Yongfu felt that he had been deliberately left to bear the brunt of the fighting by his Chinese and Vietnamese allies, and determined never again to expose his troops so openly.<ref>Huard, 180\u20137 and 202\u201331; Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 171\u20137; ''Histoire militaire'', 68\u201372</ref>\n\n[[File:Taking-of-bac-ninh.jpg|thumb|left|330px|The capture of B\u1eafc Ninh, 12 March 1884]]\nIn March 1884 the French renewed their offensive under the command of General [[Charles-Th\u00e9odore Millot]], who took over responsibility for the land campaign from Admiral Courbet after the fall of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y. Reinforcements from France and the African colonies had now raised the strength of the [[Tonkin Expeditionary Corps]] to over 10,000 men, and Millot organised this force into two brigades. The 1st Brigade was commanded by General [[Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle]], who had earlier made his reputation as governor of Senegal, and the 2nd Brigade was commanded by the charismatic young Foreign Legion general [[Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier]], who had recently quelled a serious Arab rebellion in Algeria. The French target was [[B\u1eafc Ninh]], garrisoned by a strong force of regular Chinese troops of the Guangxi Army.<ref>Technically the Army of the Two Guangs (Guangdong and Guangxi), but invariably called the Guangxi Army in French and other European sources.</ref> The [[B\u1eafc Ninh Campaign]] was a walkover for the French. Morale in the Chinese army was low, and Liu Yongfu was careful to keep his experienced Black Flags out of danger. Millot bypassed Chinese defences to the southwest of B\u1eafc Ninh, and assaulted the city on 12 March from the southeast, with complete success. The Guangxi Army put up a feeble resistance, and the French took the city with ease, capturing large quantities of ammunition and a number of brand new [[Krupp]] cannon.<ref>Huard, 252\u201376; Thomazi, ''Histoire militaire'', 75\u201380</ref>\n\n==== The Tientsin Accord and the Treaty of Hu\u1ebf ====\n{{Main|Capture of H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a}}\n[[File:Qing army Sino-French war.jpg|thumb|300px|Chinese regular soldiers photographed during the Sino-French war]]\nThe defeat at B\u1eafc Ninh, coming close on the heels of the fall of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y, strengthened the hand of the moderate element in the Chinese government and temporarily discredited the extremist 'Purist' party led by [[Zhang Zhidong]], which was agitating for a full-scale war against France. Further French successes in the spring of 1884, including the [[Capture of H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a]] and [[Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean]], convinced the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] that China should come to terms, and an accord was reached between France and China in May. The negotiations took place in Tianjin (Tientsin). Li Hongzhang, the leader of the Chinese moderates, represented China; and Captain [[Fran\u00e7ois Ernest Fournier|Fran\u00e7ois-Ernest Fournier]], commander of the French cruiser ''Volta'', represented France. The [[Tientsin Accord]], concluded on 11 May 1884, provided for Chinese recognition of the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin and withdrawal of Chinese troops from Tonkin, in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 189\u201392</ref>\n\nOn 6 June the French followed up their accord with China by concluding a fresh [[Treaty of Hu\u1ebf (1884)|Treaty of Hu\u1ebf]] with the Vietnamese, which established a French protectorate over both Annam and Tonkin and allowed the French to station troops at strategic points in Vietnamese territory and to install residents in the main towns. The signature of the treaty was accompanied by an important symbolic gesture. The seal presented by the emperor of China several decades earlier to the Vietnamese king [[Gia Long]] was melted down in the presence of the French and Vietnamese plenipotentiaries, betokening the renunciation by Vietnam of its traditional links with China.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 192\u20133</ref>\n\nFournier was not a professional diplomat, and the Tientsin Accord contained several loose ends. Crucially, it failed to explicitly state a deadline for the Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin. The French asserted that the troop withdrawal was to take place immediately, while the Chinese argued that the withdrawal was contingent upon the conclusion of the comprehensive treaty. In fact, the Chinese stance was an ex post facto rationalisation, designed to justify their unwillingness or inability to put the terms of the accord into effect. The accord was extremely unpopular in China, and provoked an immediate backlash. The war party called for Li Hongzhang's impeachment, and his political opponents intrigued to have orders sent to the Chinese troops in Tonkin to hold their positions.\n\n==== The B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush ====\n{{Main|B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush}}\n[[File:Bac Le Ambush.jpeg|thumb|330px|The B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush, 23 June 1884]]\nLi Hongzhang hinted to the French that there might be difficulties in enforcing the accord, but nothing specific was said. The French assumed that the Chinese troops would leave Tonkin as agreed, and made preparations for occupying the border towns of [[L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]], [[Cao B\u1eb1ng]] and [[That Ke]]. In early June 1884 a French column under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Alphonse Dugenne advanced to occupy Langson. On 23 June, near the small town of [[B\u1eafc L\u1ec7]], the French encountered a strong detachment of the Guangxi Army ensconced in a defensive position behind the Song Thuong River. In view of the diplomatic significance of this discovery, Dugenne should have reported the presence of the Chinese force to Hanoi and waited for further instructions. Instead, he gave the Chinese an ultimatum, and on their refusal to withdraw resumed his advance. The Chinese opened fire on the advancing French, precipitating a two-day battle in which Dugenne's column was encircled and seriously mauled. Dugenne eventually fought his way out of the Chinese encirclement and extricated his small force.<ref>Lecomte, ''Guet-apens'', 102\u201375</ref>\n\nWhen news of the '[[B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush]]' reached Paris, there was fury at what was perceived as blatant Chinese treachery. Ferry's government demanded an apology, an indemnity, and the immediate implementation of the terms of the Tianjin Accord. The Chinese government agreed to negotiate, but refused to apologise or pay any indemnity. The mood in France was against compromise, and although negotiations continued throughout July, Admiral Courbet was ordered to take his squadron to [[Fuzhou]] (Foochow). He was instructed to prepare to attack the [[Fujian Fleet|Chinese Fujian Fleet]] in the harbour and to destroy the [[Foochow Navy Yard]]. Meanwhile, as a preliminary demonstration of what would follow if the Chinese were recalcitrant, Rear Admiral [[S\u00e9bastien Lesp\u00e8s]] destroyed three Chinese shore batteries in the port of [[Keelung]] in northern Formosa ([[Taiwan]]) by naval bombardment on 5 August. The French put a landing force ashore to occupy Keelung and the nearby coal mines at Pei-tao (Pa-tou), as a 'pledge' (''gage'') to be bargained against a Chinese withdrawal from Tonkin, but the arrival of a large Chinese army under the command of the imperial commissioner [[Liu Mingchuan]] forced it to re-embark on 6 August.<ref>Duboc, 261\u20133; Garnot, 45\u20137; Loir, 184\u20138</ref>\n\n== The Sino-French War, August 1884 to April 1885 ==\n\n=== Operations of Admiral Courbet's squadron ===\n\n==== Fuzhou and the Min River ====\n{{Main|Battle of Fuzhou}}\n[[File:BattleFoochow.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Battle of Fuzhou]], 23 August 1884 (19th-century painting)]]\nNegotiations between France and China broke down in mid-August, and on 22 August Courbet was ordered to attack the Chinese fleet at Fuzhou. In the [[Battle of Fuzhou]] (also known as the Battle of the Pagoda Anchorage) on 23 August 1884, the French took their revenge for the Bac Le Ambush. In a two-hour engagement watched with professional interest by neutral British and American vessels (the battle was one of the first occasions on which the spar torpedo was successfully deployed), Courbet's [[Far East Squadron]] annihilated China's outclassed Fujian fleet and severely damaged the [[Foochow Arsenal|Foochow Navy Yard]] (which, ironically, had been built under the direction of the French administrator [[Prosper Giquel]]). Nine Chinese ships were sunk in less than an hour, including the corvette ''[[Chinese corvette Yangwu|Yangwu]]'', the flagship of the Fujian fleet. Chinese losses may have amounted to 3,000 dead, while French losses were minimal. Courbet then successfully withdrew down the Min River to the open sea, destroying several Chinese shore batteries from behind as he took the French squadron through the Min'an and Jinpai passes.<ref>Lung Chang, 280\u20133; Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 204\u201315</ref>\n\n==== Riots in Hong Kong ====\nThe French attack at Fuzhou effectively ended diplomatic contacts between France and China. Although neither country declared war, the dispute would now be settled on the battlefield. The news of the destruction of the Fujian fleet was greeted by an outbreak of patriotic fervour in China, marred by attacks on foreigners and foreign property. There was considerable sympathy for China in Europe, and the Chinese were able to hire a number of British, German and American army and navy officers as advisers.\n\nPatriotic indignation spread to the British colony of [[Hong Kong]]. In September 1884 dock workers in Hong Kong refused to repair the French ironclad [[French ironclad La Galissonni\u00e8re|''La Galissonni\u00e8re'']], which had suffered shell damage in the August naval engagements. The strike collapsed at the end of September, but the dock workers were prevented from resuming their business by other groups of Chinese workers, including longshoremen, sedan chair carriers and rickshawmen. An attempt by the British authorities to protect the dock workers against harassment resulted in serious rioting on 3 October, during which at least one rioter was shot dead and several Sikh constables were injured. The British suspected, with good reason, that the disturbances had been fomented by the Chinese authorities in Guangdong province.<ref>Chere, ''Diplomacy of the Sino-French War'', 108\u201315; ''JHKBRAS'', 20 (1980), 54\u201365</ref>\n\n==== French occupation of Keelung ====\n{{Main|Keelung Campaign|Battle of Tamsui}}\n[[File:Landing of French forces at Keelung.jpg|thumb|A Chinese depiction of the French landing at Keelung]]\nMeanwhile, the French decided to put pressure on China by landing an expeditionary corps in northern Formosa to seize [[Keelung]] and [[Tamsui, Taipei|Tamsui]], redeeming the failure of 6 August and finally winning the \u2018pledge\u2019 they sought. On 1 October Lieutenant-Colonel Bertaux-Levillain landed at Keelung with a force of 1,800 marine infantry, forcing the Chinese to withdraw to strong defensive positions which had been prepared in the surrounding hills. The French force was too small to advance beyond Keelung, and the Pei-tao coal mines remained in Chinese hands. Meanwhile, after an ineffective naval bombardment on 2 October, Admiral Lesp\u00e8s attacked the Chinese defences at Tamsui with 600 sailors from his squadron's landing companies on 8 October, and was decisively repulsed by forces under the command of the Fujianese general [[Sun Kaihua]] (\u5b6b\u958b\u83ef). As a result of this reverse, French control over Formosa was limited merely to the town of Keelung. This achievement fell far short of what had been hoped for.\n\n==== Blockade of Formosa ====\nTowards the end of 1884 the French were able to enforce a limited blockade of the northern Formosan ports of Keelung and Tamsui and the prefectural capital Taiwan (now [[Tainan]]) and the southern port Takow ([[Kaohsiung]]). In early January 1885 the Formosa expeditionary corps, now under the command of Colonel [[Jacques Duchesne]], was substantially reinforced with two battalions of infantry, bringing its total strength to around 4,000 men. Meanwhile, drafts from the [[Xiang Army|Hunan Army]] and [[Huai Army|Anhui Army]] had brought the strength of Liu Mingchuan's defending army to around 25,000 men. Although severely outnumbered, the French captured a number of minor Chinese positions to the southeast of Keelung at the end of January 1885, but were forced to halt offensive operations in February due to incessant rain.\n\nThe blockade succeeded in part because the northern [[Beiyang Fleet]], commanded by [[Li Hongzhang]], denied help to the southern [[Nanyang Fleet]]. No Beiyang ships were sent to battle the French.<ref name=\"Elleman 89\">{{cite book|volume=|title=Modern Chinese warfare, 1795\u20131989|author=Bruce A.

On 1 October, Admiral Courbet landed at Jilong with 2,250 men, and the city fell to the French. Chinese forces continued to encircle Jilong throughout the rest of the War. Although a French blockade thwarted all subsequent Chinese efforts to send a fleet to relieve Taiwan, the French troops never succeeded in taking the riverside town of Danshui (Tamsui) in Taiwan's northwestern coastal plain, immediately north of modern-day Taipei. As a result, French control over Taiwan was limited merely to the northern coast. China's central fleet, based in Jiangsu Province, proved unable to break through Admiral Courbet's blockade of Taiwan. Although the south quickly requested assistance from the northern fleet, Li Hongzhang refused to place his own ships in danger. This decision almost guaranteed that China's coastal waters would be dominated by the French.|year=2001|accessdate=2012-01-18|location=|page=89|isbn=0-415-21474-2|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref> This led the Navy to fail.<ref>{{cite book|volume=|title=Modern Chinese warfare, 1795\u20131989|author=Bruce A.

Although many of China's modern ships were state of the art, the personnel manning them were relatively unskilled: according to Rawlinson, only eight of the fourteen ship captains that saw action in the war had received any modern training at all. In addition, there was little, if any, coordination between the fleets in north and south China. The lack of a centralized admiralty commanding the entire navy meant that at any one time France opposed only a fraction of China's total fleet.

One of the major training grounds during the early 1870s was at the [[Fuzhou Arsenal]], which had hired foreign experts to conduct training classes. By the late 1870s, many of the foreigners had left Fuzhou and a new naval academy was opened at Tianjin, in northern China. This academy lured many of the best-trained Chinese sailors away from southern China. |year=2001|accessdate=2012-01-18|location=|page=87|isbn=0-415-21474-2|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref>\n\n==== Shipu Bay, Zhenhai Bay and the rice blockade ====\n{{Main|Battle of Shipu|Battle of Zhenhai}}\n[[File:FrenchTorpedoBoat.jpg|thumb|French torpedo launch attacking the Chinese frigate ''Yuyuan'', 14 February 1885]]\nAlthough the Formosa expeditionary corps remained confined in Keelung, the French scored important successes elsewhere in the spring of 1885. Courbet's squadron had been reinforced substantially since the start of the war, and he now had considerably more ships at his disposal than in October 1884. In early February 1885 part of his squadron left Keelung to head off a threatened attempt by part of the Chinese [[Nanyang Fleet]] (Southern Seas fleet) to break the French blockade of Formosa. On 11 February Courbet's task force met the cruisers ''Kaiji'', ''Nanchen'' and ''Nanrui'', three of the most modern ships in the Chinese fleet, near Shipu Bay, accompanied by the frigate ''Yuyuan'' and the composite sloop ''Chengqing''. The Chinese scattered at the French approach, and while the three cruisers successfully made their escape, the French succeeded in trapping ''Yuyuan'' and ''Chengqing'' in Shipu Bay. On the night of 14 February, in the [[Battle of Shipu]], the French attacked the Chinese vessels with two torpedo launches. During a brief engagement inside the bay, ''Yuyuan'' was seriously damaged by torpedoes and ''Chengqing'' was hit by ''Yuyuan'''s fire. Both ships were subsequently scuttled by the Chinese. The French torpedo launches escaped almost without loss.<ref>Duboc, 274\u201393; Loir, 245\u201364; Lung Chang, 327\u20138; Thomazi, 220\u201325; Wright, 63\u20134</ref>\n\nCourbet followed up this success on 1 March by locating ''Kaiji'', ''Nanchen'' and ''Nanrui'', which had taken refuge with four other Chinese warships in Zhenhai Bay, near the port of [[Ningbo]]. Courbet considered forcing the Chinese defences, but after testing its defenses finally decided to guard the entrance to the bay to keep the enemy vessels bottled up there for the duration of hostilities. A brief and inconclusive skirmish between the French cruiser ''Nielly'' and the Chinese shore batteries on 1 March enabled the Chinese general Ouyang Lijian (\u6b50\u967d\u5229\u898b), charged with the defence of Ningbo, to claim the so-called '[[Battle of Zhenhai]]' as a defensive victory.<ref>Loir, 277\u20139; Lung Chang, 328</ref>\n\nIn February 1885, under diplomatic pressure from China, Britain invoked the provisions of the 1870 Foreign Enlistment Act and closed Hong Kong and other ports in the Far East to French warships. The French government retaliated by ordering Admiral Courbet to implement a 'rice blockade' of the Yangzi River, hoping to bring the Qing court to terms by provoking serious rice shortages in northern China. The rice blockade severely disrupted the transport of rice by sea from Shanghai and forced the Chinese to carry it overland, but the war ended before the blockade seriously affected China's economy.\n\n=== Operations in Tonkin ===\n\n==== French victories in the delta ====\n{{Main|Kep Campaign|Battle of Yu Oc}}\n[[File:Combat de Lang-Kep.jpg|thumb|300px|The battle of K\u00e9p, 8 October 1884]]\n[[File:Louis Briere de lIsle.jpg|thumb|220px|General [[Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle]] (1827\u201396)]]\nMeanwhile, the French army in Tonkin was also putting severe pressure on the Chinese forces and their Black Flag allies. General Millot, whose health was failing, resigned as general-in-chief of the Tonkin expeditionary corps in early September 1884 and was replaced by General Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle, the senior of his two brigade commanders. Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's first task was to beat off a major Chinese invasion of the Red River Delta. In late September 1884 large detachments of the Guangxi Army advanced from Langson and probed into the [[L\u1ee5c Nam River|L\u1ee5c Nam]] valley, announcing their presence by ambushing the French gunboats ''Hache'' and ''Massue'' on 2 October. Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle responded immediately, transporting nearly 3,000 French soldiers to the L\u1ee5c Nam valley aboard a flotilla of gunboats and attacking the Chinese detachments before they could concentrate. In the [[Kep Campaign]], (2 to 15 October 1884), three French columns under the overall command of General de N\u00e9grier fell upon the separated detachments of the Guangxi Army and successively defeated them in engagements at [[Lam C\u1ed1t|Lam]] (6 October), [[K\u00e9p]] (8 October) and [[Ch\u0169]] (10 October). The second of these battles was marked by bitter close-quarter fighting between French and Chinese troops, and de N\u00e9grier's soldiers suffered heavy casualties storming the fortified village of K\u00e9p. The exasperated victors shot or bayoneted scores of wounded Chinese soldiers after the battle, and reports of French atrocities at Kep shocked public opinion in Europe. In fact, prisoners were rarely taken by either side during the Sino-French War, and the French were equally shocked by the Chinese habit of paying a bounty for severed French heads.\n\nIn the wake of these French victories the Chinese fell back to B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 and Dong Song, and de N\u00e9grier established important forward positions at K\u00e9p and Chu, which threatened the Guangxi Army's base at Lang Son. Ch\u0169 was only a few miles southwest of the Guangxi Army's advanced posts at Dong Song, and on 16 December a strong Chinese raiding detachment ambushed two companies of the Foreign Legion just to the east of Ch\u0169, at [[Ha Ho]]. The legionnaires fought their way out of the Chinese encirclement, but suffered a number of casualties and had to abandon their dead on the battlefield. De N\u00e9grier immediately brought up reinforcements and pursued the Chinese, but the raiders made good their retreat to Dong Song.<ref>Bonifacy, 7\u20138; Harmant, 91\u2013112; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 149\u201355</ref>\n\nShortly after the October engagements against the Guangxi Army, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle took steps to resupply the western outposts of [[H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a]], Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean and [[Tuy\u00ean Quang]], which were coming under increasing threat from Liu Yongfu's Black Flags and Tang Jingsong's [[Yunnan Army]]. On 19 November, in the [[Battle of Yu Oc]], a column making for Tuy\u00ean Quang under the command of Colonel [[Jacques Duchesne]] was ambushed in the [[Yu Oc]] gorge by the Black Flags but was able to fight its way through to the beleaguered post. The French also sealed off the eastern Delta from raids by Chinese guerillas based in Guangdong by occupying Tien Yen, Dong Trieu and other strategic points, and by blockading the Cantonese port of Beihai (Pak-Hoi). They also conducted sweeps along the lower course of the Red River to dislodge Annamese guerilla bands from bases close to Hanoi. These operations enabled Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle to concentrate the bulk of the Tonkin expeditionary corps around Ch\u0169 and K\u00e9p at the end of 1884, to advance on L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n as soon as the word was given.\n\n==== The L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Campaign ====\n{{Main|Battle of N\u00fai Bop|L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Campaign}}\n[[File:Lang Son Campaign.jpg|thumb|260px|The L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Campaign, February 1885]]\nFrench strategy in Tonkin was the subject of a bitter debate in the Chamber of Deputies in late December 1884. The army minister General Jean-Baptiste-Marie Campenon argued that the French should consolidate their hold on the Delta. His opponents urged an all-out offensive to throw the Chinese out of northern Tonkin. The debate culminated in Campenon's resignation and his replacement as army minister by the hawkish General [[Jules Louis Lewal]], who immediately ordered Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle to capture L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n. The campaign would be launched from the French forward base at Chu, and on 3 and 4 January 1885 General de N\u00e9grier attacked and defeated a substantial detachment of the Guangxi Army that had concentrated around the nearby village of [[N\u00fai Bop]] to try to disrupt the French preparations. De N\u00e8grier's victory at [[Battle of N\u00fai Bop|N\u00fai Bop]], won at odds of just under one to ten, was regarded by his fellow-officers as the most spectacular professional triumph of his career.<ref>Armengaud, 2\u20134; Bonifacy, 8\u20139; Harmant, 113\u201337; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 155\u201376</ref>\n\n[[File:Capture of Lang Son.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The capture of L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, 13 February 1885]]\nIt took the French a month to complete their preparations for the [[L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Campaign]]. Finally, on 3 February 1885, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle began his advance from Chu with a column of just under 7,200 troops, accompanied by 4,500 coolies. In ten days the column advanced to the outskirts of Lang Son. The troops were burdened with the weight of their provisions and equipment, and had to march through extremely difficult country. They also had to fight fierce actions to overrun stoutly defended Chinese positions, at [[T\u00e2y H\u00f2a]] (4 February), [[H\u1ea1 H\u00f2a]] (5 February) and [[Dong Song, Vietnam|Dong Song]] (6 February). After a brief pause for breath at Dong Song, the expeditionary corps pressed on towards L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, fighting further actions at [[Deo Quao]] (9 February), and [[Pho Vy]] (11 February). On 12 February, in a costly but successful battle, the Turcos and marine infantry of Colonel Laurent Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade stormed the main Chinese defences at [[Bac Vie]], several kilometres to the south of Lang Son.<ref>Armengaud, 21\u20134; Harmant, 157\u20138; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 288\u201398 and 304\u20135</ref> On 13 February, the French column entered Lang Son which the Chinese abandoned after fighting a token rearguard action at the nearby village of [[Ky Lua]].<ref>Armengaud, 24\u20138; Bonifacy, 17\u201318; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 298\u2013305</ref>\n\n==== Siege and relief of Tuy\u00ean Quang ====\n{{Main|Siege of Tuy\u00ean Quang|Battle of H\u00f2a M\u1ed9c}}\n[[File:Chinese Prisoners.jpg|thumb|200px|Chinese soldiers captured by the French at Tuy\u00ean Quang]]\nThe capture of Lang Son allowed substantial French forces to be diverted further west to relieve the small and isolated French garrison in [[Tuy\u00ean Quang]], which had been placed under siege in November 1884 by Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army and Tang Jingsong's Yunnan Army. The [[Siege of Tuy\u00ean Quang]] was the most evocative confrontation of the Sino-French War. The Chinese and Black Flags sapped methodically up to the French positions, and in January and February 1885 breached the outer defences with mines and delivered seven separate assaults on the breach. The Tuy\u00ean Quang garrison, 400 legionnaires and 200 Tonkinese auxiliaries under the command of ''chef de bataillon'' Marc-Edmond Domin\u00e9, beat off all attempts to storm their positions, but lost over a third of their strength (50 dead and 224 wounded) sustaining a heroic defence against overwhelming odds. By mid-February it was clear that Tuy\u00ean Quang would fall unless it was relieved immediately.<ref>Harmant, 159\u201364; Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 237\u201341 and 246\u20138; ''Histoire militaire'', 102\u20133 and 107\u20138</ref>\n\nLeaving de N\u00e9grier at Lang Son with the 2nd Brigade, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle personally led Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade back to Hanoi, and then upriver to the relief of Tuy\u00ean Quang. The brigade, reinforced at Phu Doan on 24 February by a small column from Hung Hoa under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel de Maussion, found the route to Tuy\u00ean Quang blocked by a strong Chinese defensive position at [[H\u00f2a M\u1ed9c]]. On 2 March 1885 Giovanninelli attacked the left flank of the Chinese defensive line. The [[Battle of H\u00f2a M\u1ed9c]] was the most fiercely fought action of the war. Two French assaults were decisively repulsed, and although the French eventually stormed the Chinese positions, they suffered very high casualties (76 dead and 408 wounded). Nevertheless, their costly victory cleared the way to Tuy\u00ean Quang. The Yunnan Army and the Black Flags raised the siege and drew off to the west, and the relieving force entered the beleaguered post on 3 March. Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle praised the courage of the hard-pressed garrison in a widely quoted order of the day. \u2018Today, you enjoy the admiration of the men who have relieved you at such heavy cost.

After resupplying the 2nd Brigade with food and ammunition, de N\u00e9grier defeated the Guangxi Army at the [[Battle of \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng (1885)|Battle of \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng]] on 23 February 1885 and cleared it from Tonkinese territory. For good measure, the French crossed briefly into Guangxi province and blew up the 'Gate of China', an elaborate Chinese customs building on the Tonkin-Guangxi border. They were not strong enough to exploit this victory, however, and the 2nd Brigade returned to Langson at the end of February.<ref>Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 337\u201349</ref>\n\n[[File:Zhen Nan Guan-Qing-deployment.jpg|thumb|left|330px|Chinese fortifications at Bang Bo]]\nBy early March, in the wake of the French victories at Hoa Moc and Dong Dang, the military situation in Tonkin had reached a temporary stalemate. Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade faced Tang Qingsong's Yunnan Army around H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a and Tuy\u00ean Quang, while de N\u00e9grier's 2nd Brigade at L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n faced Pan Dingxin's Guangxi Army. Neither Chinese army had any realistic prospect of launching an offensive for several weeks, while the two French brigades that had jointly captured L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n in February were not strong enough to inflict a decisive defeat on either Chinese army separately. Meanwhile, the French government was pressuring Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle to send the 2nd Brigade across the border into Guangxi province, in the hope that a threat to Chinese territory would force China to sue for peace. Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle and de N\u00e9grier examined the possibility of a campaign to capture the major Chinese military depot at Longzhou (Lung-chou, \u9f8d\u5dde), 60 kilometres beyond the border, but on 17 March Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle advised the army ministry in Paris that such an operation was beyond his strength. Substantial French reinforcements reached Tonkin in the middle of March, giving Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle a brief opportunity to break the stalemate. He moved the bulk of the reinforcements to H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a to reinforce the 1st Brigade, intending to attack the Yunnan Army and drive it back beyond Yen Bay. While he and Giovanninelli drew up plans for a western offensive, he ordered de N\u00e9grier to hold his positions at Lang Son.\n\nOn 23 and 24 March the&nbsp;2nd Brigade, only 1,500 men strong, fought a fierce action with over 25,000 troops of the Guangxi Army entrenched near [[Friendship Gate|Zhennanguan]] on the Chinese border. The [[Battle of Bang Bo]] (named by the French from the Vietnamese pronunciation of Hengpo, a village in the centre of the Chinese position where the fighting was fiercest), is normally known as the Battle of Zhennan Pass in China. The French took a number of outworks on 23 March, but failed to take the main Chinese positions on 24 March and were fiercely counterattacked in their turn. Although the French made a fighting withdrawal and prevented the Chinese from piercing their line, casualties in the 2nd Brigade were relatively heavy (70 dead and 188 wounded) and there were ominous scenes of disorder as the defeated French regrouped after the battle. As the brigade's morale was precarious and ammunition was running short, de N\u00e9grier decided to fall back to Lang Son.<ref>Armengaud, 40\u201358; Bonifacy, 23\u20136; Harmant, 211\u201335; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 428\u201353 and 455</ref>\n\n[[File:Paul-Gustave Herbinger.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger (1839\u201386)]]\nThe coolies abandoned the French and the French also had supply issues.

Elleman|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Md801mHEeOkC|quote=The Qing coury whole-heartedly supported the war, and from August to November 1884 the Chinese military prepared to enter the conflict. During the early months of 1885, the Chinese Army once again took the offensive as Beijing repeatedly ordered it to march on Tonkin. However, the shortage of supplies, poor weather, and illness devastated the Chinese troops; one 2,000 man unit reportedly lost 1,500 men to disease. This situation led one Qing military official to warn that fully one-half of all reinforcements to Annam might succumb to the elemnts. The focus of the fightin soon revolved around L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, Pan Dingxin, the Governor of Guangxi, succeeded in establishing his headquarters there by early 1885. In February 1885 a French campaign forced Pan to retreat, and the French troops soon reoccupied the town. the French forces continued the offensive, an on 23 March they temporarily occupied and then hastily torched Zhennanguan, a town on the China-Annam border, before pulling back once again to L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n. Spurred on by the French attack, General Feng Zicai led his troops southward against General Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier's forces. The situation quickly became serious for the French, as their coolies deserted, interrupting the French supply lines, and ammunition began to run short. Even though the training of the Qing troops was inferior to the French and the Chinese officer corps was poor, their absolute number were greater. This precarious situation worsened for the French when General Negrier was wounded on 28 March.

Rested, recovered and fighting behind breastworks, the French successfully held their positions and inflicted crippling casualties on the Guangxi Army. French casualties at Ky Lua were 7 men killed and 38 wounded. The Chinese left 1,200 corpses on the battlefield, and a further 6,000 Chinese soldiers may have been wounded. The battle of Ky Lua gave a grim foretaste of the horrors of warfare on the Western Front thirty years later.<ref>Armengaud, 61\u20137; Bonifacy, 27\u20139; Harmant, 237\u201352; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 463\u201374; Thomazi, ''Histoire militaire'', 111\u201312</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the battle de N\u00e9grier was seriously wounded in the chest while scouting the Chinese positions. He was forced to hand over command to his senior regimental commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger. Herbinger was a noted military theoretician who had won a respectable battlefield reputation during the Franco-Prussian War, but was quite out of his depth as a field commander in Tonkin. Several French officers had already commented scathingly on his performance during the L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n campaign and at Bang Bo, where he had badly bungled an attack on the Chinese positions.\n\nUpon assuming command of the brigade, Herbinger panicked. Despite the evidence that the Chinese had been decisively defeated and were streaming back in disarray towards the Chinese frontier, he convinced himself that they were preparing to encircle L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n and cut his supply line. Disregarding the appalled protests of some of his officers, he ordered the 2nd Brigade to abandon L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n on the evening of 28 March and retreat to [[Ch\u0169]]. The [[retreat from L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]] was conducted without loss and with little interference from the Chinese, but Herbinger set an unnecessarily punishing pace and abandoned considerable quantities of food, ammunition and equipment. When the 2nd Brigade eventually rallied at Ch\u0169, its soldiers were exhausted and demoralised. Meanwhile, the Chinese general [[:zh:\u6f58\u9f0e\u65b0|Pan Dingxin]] (\u6f58\u9f0e\u65b0), informed by sympathisers in L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n that the French were in full retreat, promptly turned his battered army around and reoccupied L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n on 30 March. The Chinese were in no condition to pursue the French to Ch\u0169, and contented themselves with a limited advance to Dong Song.<ref>Armengaud, 74\u20136; Bonifacy, 36\u20138 and 39\u201340; Harmant, 274\u2013300; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 501\u201312</ref> The retreat was seen as a Chinese victory.<ref name=\"Elleman\">{{cite book|volume=|title=Modern Chinese warfare, 1795\u20131989|author=Bruce A.

He immediately ordered the evacuation of Lang S\u00f3n. Although Herbinger may have been retiring to the more strongly fortified positions further south, the retreat seemed to many to be the result of panic. Widely interpreted as a Chinese victory, the Qing forces were able to capture the strategic northern city of Lang S\u00f3n and the surrounding territory by early April 1885. China's forces now dominated the battefield, but fighting ended on 4 April 1885 as a result of peace negotiations. China sued for peace because Britain and Germany had not offered assistance as Beijing had hoped, and Russia and Japan threatened china's northern borders. Meanwhile, China's economy was injured by the French \"naval interdiction of the seaborne rich trade.\"197 Negotiations between Li Hongzhang and the French minister in China were concluded in June 1885.

On 23 March, in the [[Battle of Phu Lam Tao]], a force of Chinese regulars and Black Flags surprised and routed a French zouave battalion that had been ordered to scout positions around H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a in preparation for Giovanninelli's projected offensive against the Yunnan Army.<ref>Bonifacy, 37\u20138; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 329\u201330 and 515\u201316; Lung Chang, 340</ref>\n\n==== Collapse of Ferry's government ====\n{{Main|Tonkin Affair}}\n[[File:Chinese report on the Sino-French War printed in Shanghai 1883-1885.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Diagram of Report of Victory in Vietnam\" (\u8d8a\u5357\u6377\u62a5\u56fe), contemporary Chinese report on the Sino-French War, printed in [[Shanghai]] 1883\u20131885]]\nNeither reverse was serious, but in the light of Herbinger's alarming reports Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle believed the situation to be much worse than it was, and sent an extremely pessimistic telegram back to Paris on the evening of 28 March. The political effect of this telegram was momentous. Ferry's immediate reaction was to reinforce the army in Tonkin, and indeed Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle quickly revised his estimate of the situation and advised the government that the front could soon be stabilised. However, his second thoughts came too late. When his first telegram was made public in Paris there was an uproar in the Chamber of Deputies. A motion of no confidence was tabled, and Ferry's government fell on 30 March.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 258\u201361</ref> The '[[Tonkin Affair]]', as this humiliating blow to French policy in Tonkin was immediately dubbed, effectively ended Ferry's distinguished career in French politics. He would never again become premier, and his political influence during the rest of his career would be severely limited. His successor, [[Henri Brisson]], promptly concluded peace with China. The Chinese government agreed to implement the Tientsin Accord (implicitly recognising the French protectorate over Tonkin), and the French government dropped its demand for an indemnity for the B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush. A peace protocol ending hostilities was signed on 4 April, and a substantive peace treaty was signed on 9 June at [[Treaty of Tientsin (1885)|Tianjin]] by Li Hongzhang and the French minister [[Jules Paten\u00f4tre des Noyers|Jules Paten\u00f4tre]].<ref>Huard, 800\u201312; Lung Chang, 369\u201371; Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 261\u20132</ref>\n\n==== Japan and Russia's threat to join the war against China and the Northern fleet ====\nJapan had taken advantage of China's distraction with France to intrigue in the Chinese protectorate state of Korea. In December 1884 the Japanese sponsored the '[[Gapsin Coup]]', bringing Japan and China to the brink of war. Thereafter the Qing court considered that the Japanese were a greater threat to China than the French. In January 1885 the [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Empress Dowager]] directed her ministers to seek an honourable peace with France. Secret talks between the French and Chinese were held in Paris in February and March 1885, and the fall of Ferry's ministry removed the last remaining obstacles to a peace.<ref>Eastman, 196\u20139; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 405\u20138 and 531\u20136</ref>\n\nThe Korean issue led to Japan and Russia having deteriorating relations with China, and in northern China Japan potentially threatened to join the war with France against China.<ref name=\"Fairbank1978\">{{cite book|author=John King Fairbank|title=The Cambridge History of China: Late Ch\u02bbing, 1800\u20131911, pt. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&pg=PA251|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22029-3|pages=251\u2013}}</ref> North China was menaced by the prospect of Japan and Russia joining in the war which led to China seeking a peace deal even though Chinese forces defeated the French on land.<ref name=\"Elleman\" />\n\nLi Hongzhang rejected pleas for the northern Beiyang fleet to be sent south to battle the French blockade.<ref name=\"Elleman 89\" />\n\nThe Korean issue and the threat of Japan led to Li Hongzhang refusing to use the northern Beiyang fleet to fight the French who destroyed the Fuzhou fleet.<ref>{{cite book|author=John King Fairbank|title=The Cambridge History of China: Late Ch\u02bbing, 1800\u20131911, pt. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&pg=PA252|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22029-3|pages=252\u2013}}</ref> Li Hongzhang also wanted to personally maintain control of the fleet by keeping it in northern China and not let it slip into the control of another party.<ref name=\"Elleman 87\" />\n\n==== Final engagements ====\n{{Main|Keelung Campaign|Pescadores campaign (1885)}}\nIronically, while the war was being decided on the battlefields of Tonkin and in Paris, the Formosa expeditionary corps won two spectacular victories in March 1885. In a series of actions fought between 4 and 7 March Colonel Duchesne broke the Chinese encirclement of [[Keelung]] with a flank attack delivered against the east of the Chinese line, capturing the key position of La Table and forcing the Chinese to withdraw behind the Keelung River.<ref>Garnot, 147\u201372</ref> Duchesne's victory sparked a brief panic in [[Taipei]], but the French were not strong enough to advance beyond their bridgehead. The [[Keelung Campaign]] now reached a point of equilibrium. The French were holding a virtually impregnable defensive perimeter around Keelung but could not exploit their success, while Liu Mingchuan's army remained in presence just beyond their advanced positions.\n\n[[File:French Soldiers in Pescadores.jpg|thumb|300px|French soldiers and local townsfolk pose for the camera in front of a temple in [[Makung]] in the [[Pescadores Islands]].]]\nHowever, the French had one card left to play. Duchesne's victory enabled Admiral Courbet to detach a marine infantry battalion from the Keelung garrison to capture the [[Pescadores Islands]] in late March.<ref>Garnot, 179\u201395; Loir, 291\u2013317</ref> Strategically, the [[Pescadores campaign (1885)]] was an important victory, which would have prevented the Chinese from further reinforcing their army in Formosa, but it came too late to affect the outcome of the war. Future French operations were cancelled on the news of Lieutenant-Colonel Herbinger's [[retreat from L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]] on 28 March, and Courbet was on the point of evacuating Keelung to reinforce the Tonkin expeditionary corps, leaving only a minimum garrison at [[Magong|Makung]] in the Pescadores, when hostilities were ended in April by the conclusion of preliminaries of peace.<ref>Garnot, 195\u2013206</ref>\n\nThe news of the peace protocol of 4 April did not reach the French and Chinese forces in Tonkin for several days, and the final engagement of the Sino-French War took place on 14 April 1885 at [[K\u00e9p]], where the French beat off a half-hearted Chinese attack on their positions.<ref>Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 524\u20136</ref> Meanwhile, Bri\u00e8re de l\u2019Isle had reinforced the key French posts at H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a and Ch\u0169, and when hostilities ended in the third fortnight of April the French were standing firm against both the Guangxi and Yunnan armies.<ref>Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 513\u201324</ref> Although Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle was planning to attack the Yunnan Army at Phu Lam Tao to avenge the defeat of 23 March, many French officers doubted whether this offensive would have succeeded. At the same time, the Chinese armies had no prospect whatsoever of driving the French from H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a or Ch\u0169. Militarily, the war in Tonkin ended in a stalemate.\n\nThe peace protocol of 4 April required the Chinese to withdraw their armies from Tonkin, and the French continued to occupy Keelung and the Pescadores for several months after the end of hostilities, as a surety for Chinese good faith. Admiral Courbet fell seriously ill during this occupation, and on 11 June died aboard his flagship ''[[French ironclad Bayard|Bayard]]'' in [[Magong|Makung]] harbour.<ref>Garnot, 214\u201323; Loir, 338\u201345</ref> Meanwhile, the Chinese punctiliously observed the terms of the peace settlement, and by the end of June 1885 both the Yunnan and Guangxi armies had evacuated Tonkin.

The war had already destroyed Ferry's career, and his successor [[Henri Brisson]] also resigned in the wake of the acrimonious 'Tonkin Debate' of December 1885, in which Clemenceau and other opponents of colonial expansion nearly succeeded in securing a French withdrawal from Tonkin. In the end, the Chamber voted the 1886 credits to support the Tonkin expeditionary corps by 274 votes to 270.<ref>Huard, 1,113\u201374; Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 277\u201382</ref> If only three votes had gone the other way, the French would have left Tonkin. As Thomazi would later write, 'France gained Indochina very much against its own wishes.' The reverberations of the [[Tonkin Affair]] tarnished the reputation of the proponents of French colonial expansion generally, and delayed the realisation of other French colonial projects, including the conquest of Madagascar. It was not until the early 1890s that domestic political support for colonial expansion revived in France.\n\nAs far as China was concerned, the war hastened the emergence of a strong nationalist movement, and was a significant step in the decline of the Qing empire. The loss of the Fujian fleet on 23 August 1884 was considered particularly humiliating. The Chinese strategy also demonstrated the flaws in the late Qing national defence system of independent regional armies and fleets. The military and naval commanders in the south received no assistance from Li Hongzhang's Northern Seas ([[Beiyang]]) fleet, based in the Gulf of Zhili, and only token assistance from the Southern Seas ([[Nanyang Fleet|Nanyang]]) fleet at Shanghai. The excuse given, that these forces were needed to deter a Japanese penetration of Korea, was not convincing. The truth was, that having built up a respectable steam navy at considerable expense, the Chinese were reluctant to hazard it in battle, even though concentrating their forces would have given them the best chance of challenging France's local naval superiority. The [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] and her advisers responded in October 1885 by establishing a Navy Yamen on the model of the admiralties of the European powers, to provide unified direction of naval policy. The benefits of this reform were largely nullified by corruption, and although China acquired a number of modern ships in the decade after the Sino-French War, the Chinese navies remained handicapped by incompetent leadership. The bulk of China's steamship fleet was destroyed or captured in the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino\u2013Japanese War]] (1894\u201395), and for decades thereafter, China ceased to be a naval power of any importance.\n\nHistorians have judged the Qing dynasty's vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that \"Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the mid century rebellions, bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia, and defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884\u201385). However the defeat of the fleet, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms.\"<ref name=\"Chung-yam PO\"/>\n\n==Movie==\n\nThere is an action packed war movie, The War of Loong (2017) about Feng Zicai and the victory of Chinese troops in the Sino-French conflict (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7345928/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[France\u2013Asia relations]]\n* [[Franco\u2013Siamese War]] of 1893\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Armengaud, J., ''Lang-Son: journal des op\u00e9rations qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et suivi la prise de cette citadel'' (Paris, 1901)\n* Bonifacy, ''A propos d\u2019une collection des peintures chinoises repr\u00e9sentant diverse \u00e9pisodes de la guerre franco-chinoise de 1884\u20131885'' (Hanoi, 1931)\n* Chere, L.

Garnier was killed in this battle, and the French government later disavowed his expedition.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 116\u201331</ref>\n\n=== Henri Rivi\u00e8re's expedition in Tonkin ===\n{{Main|Capture of Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh (1883)|Battle of Paper Bridge}}\n[[File:HenriRiviere1870s.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Commandant [[Henri Rivi\u00e8re (naval officer)|Henri Rivi\u00e8re]] (1827\u201383)]]\n\nIn 1881, French Commandant [[Henri Rivi\u00e8re (naval officer)|Henri Rivi\u00e8re]] was sent with a small military force to Hanoi to investigate Vietnamese complaints about the activities of French merchants.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 140\u201357</ref> In defiance of the instructions of his superiors, Rivi\u00e8re stormed the citadel of Hanoi on 25 April 1882.<ref>Marolles, 75\u201392</ref> Although Rivi\u00e8re subsequently returned the citadel to Vietnamese control, his recourse to force provoked alarm both in Vietnam and in China.<ref>Eastman, 51\u20137</ref>\n\nThe Vietnamese government, unable to confront Rivi\u00e8re with its own ramshackle army, once again enlisted the help of Liu Yongfu, whose well-trained and seasoned Black Flag soldiers would prove a thorn in the side of the French. The Vietnamese also bid for Chinese support. Vietnam had long been a vassal state of China, and China agreed to arm and support the Black Flags, and to covertly oppose French operations in Tonkin.\n\nThe Qing court also sent a strong signal to the French that China would not allow Tonkin to fall under French control. In the summer of 1882, troops of the Chinese [[Yunnan Army]] and [[Guangxi Army]] crossed the border into Tonkin, occupying L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, B\u1eafc Ninh, Hung Hoa and other towns.<ref>Marolles, 133\u201344; Lung Chang, 90\u20131</ref> The French minister to China, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bour\u00e9e, was so alarmed by the prospect of war with China that in November and December he negotiated a deal with the Chinese statesman [[Li Hongzhang]] to divide Tonkin into French and Chinese spheres of influence. Neither of the parties to these negotiations consulted the Vietnamese.<ref>Eastman, 57\u201365</ref>\n\n[[File:Riviere pushing the cannon forward at Sontay.jpg|thumb|260px|Rivi\u00e8re attempts to rescue a bogged French cannon during the [[Battle of Paper Bridge]]. (19 May 1883)]]\n\nRivi\u00e8re, disgusted at the deal cut by Bour\u00e9e, decided early in 1883 to force the issue. He had recently been sent a battalion of marine infantry from France, giving him just enough men to venture beyond Hanoi. On 27 March 1883, to secure his line of communications from Hanoi to the coast, Rivi\u00e8re captured the citadel of [[Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]] with a force of 520 French soldiers under his personal command.<ref>Marolles, 178\u201392</ref> During his absence at Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh, the Black Flags and Vietnamese made an attack on Hanoi, but Chef de Bataillon Berthe de Villers repulsed them in the [[Battle of Gia Cuc]] on 28 March.<ref>Huard, 26\u201330</ref> Rivi\u00e8re jubilantly reacted: 'This will force them to take forward their Tonkin Question!'{{citequote|date = January 2018}}\n\nRivi\u00e8re had perfect timing. He had expected to be cashiered for his [[Capture of Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh (1883)|Capture of Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]]; instead he found himself the hero of the hour. There had recently been a change of government in France, and the new administration of [[Jules Ferry]] strongly favoured colonial expansion. It therefore decided to back Rivi\u00e8re. Ferry and Foreign Minister Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour denounced Bour\u00e9e's agreement with Li Hongzhang and recalled the hapless French minister.<ref>Eastman, 62\u20139</ref> They also made it clear to the Chinese that they were determined to place Tonkin under French protection. In April 1883, realising that the Vietnamese lacked the means of resisting the French effectively, the Chinese civil Mandarin Tang Jingsong ([[Tang Jingsong]], \u5510\u666f\u5d27) persuaded Liu Yongfu to take the field against Rivi\u00e8re with the Black Flag Army. This resulted in a year of Liu Yongfu's forces fighting an unconventional war.<ref>{{cite book|volume=Volume 11, Part 2 of The Cambridge History of China Series|title=Late Ch'ing, 1800\u20131911|editor1-link=John K.

On 19 May Rivi\u00e8re confronted the Black Flags in the [[Battle of Paper Bridge]], and the French suffered a disastrous defeat. Rivi\u00e8re's small force (around 450 men) attacked a strong Black Flag defensive position near the village of C\u1ea7u Gi\u1ea5y, a few miles to the west of Hanoi, known to the French as Paper Bridge (Pont de Papier). After initial successes the French were eventually enveloped on both wings; only with difficulty could they regroup and fall back to Hanoi. Rivi\u00e8re, Berthe de Villers and several other senior officers were killed in this action.<ref>Marolles, 193\u2013222; Duboc, 123\u201339; Huard, 6\u201316; Thomazi, ''Histoire militaire'', 55\u20138</ref>\n\n== French intervention in Tonkin ==\n{{Main|Tonkin Campaign}}\n[[File:Admiral Courbet drawing.jpg|thumb|Admiral Anatole-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Prosper Courbet (1827\u201385)]]\nRivi\u00e8re's death produced an angry reaction in France. Reinforcements were rushed to Tonkin, a threatened attack by the Black Flags on Hanoi was averted, and the military situation was stabilised.\n\n=== Protectorate over Tonkin ===\n{{Main|Battle of Ph\u1ee7 Ho\u00e0i|Battle of Thu\u1eadn An|Battle of Palan}}\nOn 20 August 1883 Admiral [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Courbet]], who had recently been appointed to the command of the newly formed Tonkin Coasts Naval Division, stormed the forts which guarded the approaches to the Vietnamese capital Hu\u1ebf in the [[Battle of Thu\u1eadn An]], and forced the Vietnamese government to sign the [[Treaty of Hu\u1ebf (1883)|Treaty of Hu\u1ebf]], placing [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|Tonkin under French protection]].<ref>Huard, 103\u201322; Loir, 13\u201322; Thomazi, ''Histoire militaire'', 62\u20134; ''Conqu\u00eate'', 165\u20136</ref>\n\nAt the same time the new commander of the Tonkin expeditionary corps, General Bou\u00ebt, attacked the Black Flag positions on the Day River. Although the French mauled the Black Flag Army in the [[Battle of Ph\u1ee7 Ho\u00e0i]] (15 August) and the [[Battle of Palan]] (1 September), they were unable to capture all of Liu Yongfu's positions, and in the eyes of the world the battles were tantamount to French defeats. Bou\u00ebt was widely held to have failed in his mission, and resigned in September 1883. In the event, severe flooding eventually forced Liu Yongfu to abandon the line of the Day River and fall back to the fortified city of [[S\u01a1n T\u00e2y]], several miles to the west.\n\n=== Confrontation between France and China ===\n[[File:Anti-foreign feeling in Guangzhou, 1883.jpg|thumb|left|300px|European residents walk warily in the streets of Guangzhou, autumn 1883.]]\nThe French prepared for a major offensive at the end of the year to annihilate the Black Flags, and tried to persuade China to withdraw its support for Liu Yongfu, while attempting to win the support of the other European powers for the projected offensive. However, negotiations in Shanghai in July 1883 between the French minister Arthur Tricou and [[Li Hongzhang]] were terminated by the Qing government on receipt of a naively optimistic assessment by Marquis [[Zeng Jize]], the Chinese minister to Paris, that the French government had no stomach for a full-scale war with China.<ref>Eastman, 76\u201384</ref> Jules Ferry and the French foreign minister [[Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour]] met a number of times in the summer and autumn of 1883 with Marquis Zeng in Paris, but these parallel diplomatic discussions also proved abortive.<ref>Eastman, 85\u20137</ref> The Chinese stood firm, and refused to withdraw substantial garrisons of Chinese regular troops from S\u01a1n T\u00e2y, B\u1eafc Ninh and L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, despite the likelihood that they would be shortly engaged in battle against the French. As war with China seemed increasingly likely, the French persuaded the German government to delay the release of ''[[Chinese turret ship Dingyuan|Dingyuan]]'' and ''[[Chinese turret ship Zhenyuan|Zhenyuan]]'', two modern battleships then being constructed in German shipyards for China's [[Beiyang Fleet]].<ref>Lung Chang, 180\u20133 and 184\u201394</ref> Meanwhile, the French consolidated their hold on the Delta by establishing posts at [[Qu\u1ea3ng Y\u00ean]], [[H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean]] and [[Ninh B\u00ecnh]].<ref>De Lonlay, ''Au Tonkin'', 111\u201316; Duboc, 207; Huard, 164\u201370</ref>\n\nThe growing tension between France and China gave rise to anti-foreign demonstrations inside China during the autumn of 1883. The most serious incidents took place in Guangdong province, where Europeans were most prominent. Attacks were made on the property of European merchants in Guangzhou and on Shamian island. Several European powers, including France, sent gunboats to Guangzhou to protect their nationals.\n\n==== S\u01a1n T\u00e2y and Bac Ninh ====\n{{Main|S\u01a1n T\u00e2y Campaign|B\u1eafc Ninh Campaign}}\n[[File:prise de Son Tay.jpg|thumb|260px|The capture of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y, 16 December 1883]]\nThe French accepted that an attack on Liu Yongfu would probably result in an undeclared war with China, but calculated that a quick victory in Tonkin would force the Chinese to accept a ''fait accompli''. Command of the Tonkin Campaign was entrusted to Admiral Courbet, who attacked [[S\u01a1n T\u00e2y]] in December 1883. The [[S\u01a1n T\u00e2y Campaign]] was the fiercest campaign the French had yet fought in Tonkin. Although the Chinese and Vietnamese contingents at Son Tay played little part in the defence, Liu Yongfu's Black Flags fought ferociously to hold the city. On 14 December the French assaulted the outer defences of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y at [[Phu Sa]], but were thrown back with heavy casualties. Hoping to exploit Courbet's defeat, Liu Yongfu attacked the French lines the same night, but the Black Flag attack also failed disastrously. After resting his troops on 15 December, Courbet again assaulted the defences of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y on the afternoon of 16 December. This time the attack was thoroughly prepared by artillery, and delivered only after the defenders had been worn down. At 5 p.m. a Foreign Legion battalion and a battalion of marine fusiliers captured the western gate of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y and fought their way into the town. Liu Yongfu's garrison withdrew to the citadel, and evacuated S\u01a1n T\u00e2y under cover of darkness several hours later. Courbet had achieved his objective, but at considerable cost. French casualties at Son Tay were 83 dead and 320 wounded. The fighting at S\u01a1n T\u00e2y also took a terrible toll of the Black Flags, and in the opinion of some observers broke them once and for all as a serious fighting force. Liu Yongfu felt that he had been deliberately left to bear the brunt of the fighting by his Chinese and Vietnamese allies, and determined never again to expose his troops so openly.<ref>Huard, 180\u20137 and 202\u201331; Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 171\u20137; ''Histoire militaire'', 68\u201372</ref>\n\n[[File:Taking-of-bac-ninh.jpg|thumb|left|330px|The capture of B\u1eafc Ninh, 12 March 1884]]\nIn March 1884 the French renewed their offensive under the command of General [[Charles-Th\u00e9odore Millot]], who took over responsibility for the land campaign from Admiral Courbet after the fall of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y. Reinforcements from France and the African colonies had now raised the strength of the [[Tonkin Expeditionary Corps]] to over 10,000 men, and Millot organised this force into two brigades. The 1st Brigade was commanded by General [[Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle]], who had earlier made his reputation as governor of Senegal, and the 2nd Brigade was commanded by the charismatic young Foreign Legion general [[Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier]], who had recently quelled a serious Arab rebellion in Algeria. The French target was [[B\u1eafc Ninh]], garrisoned by a strong force of regular Chinese troops of the Guangxi Army.<ref>Technically the Army of the Two Guangs (Guangdong and Guangxi), but invariably called the Guangxi Army in French and other European sources.</ref> The [[B\u1eafc Ninh Campaign]] was a walkover for the French. Morale in the Chinese army was low, and Liu Yongfu was careful to keep his experienced Black Flags out of danger. Millot bypassed Chinese defences to the southwest of B\u1eafc Ninh, and assaulted the city on 12 March from the southeast, with complete success. The Guangxi Army put up a feeble resistance, and the French took the city with ease, capturing large quantities of ammunition and a number of brand new [[Krupp]] cannon.<ref>Huard, 252\u201376; Thomazi, ''Histoire militaire'', 75\u201380</ref>\n\n==== The Tientsin Accord and the Treaty of Hu\u1ebf ====\n{{Main|Capture of H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a}}\n[[File:Qing army Sino-French war.jpg|thumb|300px|Chinese regular soldiers photographed during the Sino-French war]]\nThe defeat at B\u1eafc Ninh, coming close on the heels of the fall of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y, strengthened the hand of the moderate element in the Chinese government and temporarily discredited the extremist 'Purist' party led by [[Zhang Zhidong]], which was agitating for a full-scale war against France. Further French successes in the spring of 1884, including the [[Capture of H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a]] and [[Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean]], convinced the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] that China should come to terms, and an accord was reached between France and China in May. The negotiations took place in Tianjin (Tientsin). Li Hongzhang, the leader of the Chinese moderates, represented China; and Captain [[Fran\u00e7ois Ernest Fournier|Fran\u00e7ois-Ernest Fournier]], commander of the French cruiser ''Volta'', represented France. The [[Tientsin Accord]], concluded on 11 May 1884, provided for Chinese recognition of the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin and withdrawal of Chinese troops from Tonkin, in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 189\u201392</ref>\n\nOn 6 June the French followed up their accord with China by concluding a fresh [[Treaty of Hu\u1ebf (1884)|Treaty of Hu\u1ebf]] with the Vietnamese, which established a French protectorate over both Annam and Tonkin and allowed the French to station troops at strategic points in Vietnamese territory and to install residents in the main towns. The signature of the treaty was accompanied by an important symbolic gesture. The seal presented by the emperor of China several decades earlier to the Vietnamese king [[Gia Long]] was melted down in the presence of the French and Vietnamese plenipotentiaries, betokening the renunciation by Vietnam of its traditional links with China.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 192\u20133</ref>\n\nFournier was not a professional diplomat, and the Tientsin Accord contained several loose ends. Crucially, it failed to explicitly state a deadline for the Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin. The French asserted that the troop withdrawal was to take place immediately, while the Chinese argued that the withdrawal was contingent upon the conclusion of the comprehensive treaty. In fact, the Chinese stance was an ex post facto rationalisation, designed to justify their unwillingness or inability to put the terms of the accord into effect. The accord was extremely unpopular in China, and provoked an immediate backlash. The war party called for Li Hongzhang's impeachment, and his political opponents intrigued to have orders sent to the Chinese troops in Tonkin to hold their positions.\n\n==== The B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush ====\n{{Main|B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush}}\n[[File:Bac Le Ambush.jpeg|thumb|330px|The B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush, 23 June 1884]]\nLi Hongzhang hinted to the French that there might be difficulties in enforcing the accord, but nothing specific was said. The French assumed that the Chinese troops would leave Tonkin as agreed, and made preparations for occupying the border towns of [[L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]], [[Cao B\u1eb1ng]] and [[That Ke]]. In early June 1884 a French column under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Alphonse Dugenne advanced to occupy Langson. On 23 June, near the small town of [[B\u1eafc L\u1ec7]], the French encountered a strong detachment of the Guangxi Army ensconced in a defensive position behind the Song Thuong River. In view of the diplomatic significance of this discovery, Dugenne should have reported the presence of the Chinese force to Hanoi and waited for further instructions. Instead, he gave the Chinese an ultimatum, and on their refusal to withdraw resumed his advance. The Chinese opened fire on the advancing French, precipitating a two-day battle in which Dugenne's column was encircled and seriously mauled. Dugenne eventually fought his way out of the Chinese encirclement and extricated his small force.<ref>Lecomte, ''Guet-apens'', 102\u201375</ref>\n\nWhen news of the '[[B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush]]' reached Paris, there was fury at what was perceived as blatant Chinese treachery. Ferry's government demanded an apology, an indemnity, and the immediate implementation of the terms of the Tianjin Accord. The Chinese government agreed to negotiate, but refused to apologise or pay any indemnity. The mood in France was against compromise, and although negotiations continued throughout July, Admiral Courbet was ordered to take his squadron to [[Fuzhou]] (Foochow). He was instructed to prepare to attack the [[Fujian Fleet|Chinese Fujian Fleet]] in the harbour and to destroy the [[Foochow Navy Yard]]. Meanwhile, as a preliminary demonstration of what would follow if the Chinese were recalcitrant, Rear Admiral [[S\u00e9bastien Lesp\u00e8s]] destroyed three Chinese shore batteries in the port of [[Keelung]] in northern Formosa ([[Taiwan]]) by naval bombardment on 5 August. The French put a landing force ashore to occupy Keelung and the nearby coal mines at Pei-tao (Pa-tou), as a 'pledge' (''gage'') to be bargained against a Chinese withdrawal from Tonkin, but the arrival of a large Chinese army under the command of the imperial commissioner [[Liu Mingchuan]] forced it to re-embark on 6 August.<ref>Duboc, 261\u20133; Garnot, 45\u20137; Loir, 184\u20138</ref>\n\n== The Sino-French War, August 1884 to April 1885 ==\n\n=== Operations of Admiral Courbet's squadron ===\n\n==== Fuzhou and the Min River ====\n{{Main|Battle of Fuzhou}}\n[[File:BattleFoochow.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Battle of Fuzhou]], 23 August 1884 (19th-century painting)]]\nNegotiations between France and China broke down in mid-August, and on 22 August Courbet was ordered to attack the Chinese fleet at Fuzhou. In the [[Battle of Fuzhou]] (also known as the Battle of the Pagoda Anchorage) on 23 August 1884, the French took their revenge for the Bac Le Ambush. In a two-hour engagement watched with professional interest by neutral British and American vessels (the battle was one of the first occasions on which the spar torpedo was successfully deployed), Courbet's [[Far East Squadron]] annihilated China's outclassed Fujian fleet and severely damaged the [[Foochow Arsenal|Foochow Navy Yard]] (which, ironically, had been built under the direction of the French administrator [[Prosper Giquel]]). Nine Chinese ships were sunk in less than an hour, including the corvette ''[[Chinese corvette Yangwu|Yangwu]]'', the flagship of the Fujian fleet. Chinese losses may have amounted to 3,000 dead, while French losses were minimal. Courbet then successfully withdrew down the Min River to the open sea, destroying several Chinese shore batteries from behind as he took the French squadron through the Min'an and Jinpai passes.<ref>Lung Chang, 280\u20133; Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 204\u201315</ref>\n\n==== Riots in Hong Kong ====\nThe French attack at Fuzhou effectively ended diplomatic contacts between France and China. Although neither country declared war, the dispute would now be settled on the battlefield. The news of the destruction of the Fujian fleet was greeted by an outbreak of patriotic fervour in China, marred by attacks on foreigners and foreign property. There was considerable sympathy for China in Europe, and the Chinese were able to hire a number of British, German and American army and navy officers as advisers.\n\nPatriotic indignation spread to the British colony of [[Hong Kong]]. In September 1884 dock workers in Hong Kong refused to repair the French ironclad [[French ironclad La Galissonni\u00e8re|''La Galissonni\u00e8re'']], which had suffered shell damage in the August naval engagements. The strike collapsed at the end of September, but the dock workers were prevented from resuming their business by other groups of Chinese workers, including longshoremen, sedan chair carriers and rickshawmen. An attempt by the British authorities to protect the dock workers against harassment resulted in serious rioting on 3 October, during which at least one rioter was shot dead and several Sikh constables were injured. The British suspected, with good reason, that the disturbances had been fomented by the Chinese authorities in Guangdong province.<ref>Chere, ''Diplomacy of the Sino-French War'', 108\u201315; ''JHKBRAS'', 20 (1980), 54\u201365</ref>\n\n==== French occupation of Keelung ====\n{{Main|Keelung Campaign|Battle of Tamsui}}\n[[File:Landing of French forces at Keelung.jpg|thumb|A Chinese depiction of the French landing at Keelung]]\nMeanwhile, the French decided to put pressure on China by landing an expeditionary corps in northern Formosa to seize [[Keelung]] and [[Tamsui, Taipei|Tamsui]], redeeming the failure of 6 August and finally winning the \u2018pledge\u2019 they sought. On 1 October Lieutenant-Colonel Bertaux-Levillain landed at Keelung with a force of 1,800 marine infantry, forcing the Chinese to withdraw to strong defensive positions which had been prepared in the surrounding hills. The French force was too small to advance beyond Keelung, and the Pei-tao coal mines remained in Chinese hands. Meanwhile, after an ineffective naval bombardment on 2 October, Admiral Lesp\u00e8s attacked the Chinese defences at Tamsui with 600 sailors from his squadron's landing companies on 8 October, and was decisively repulsed by forces under the command of the Fujianese general [[Sun Kaihua]] (\u5b6b\u958b\u83ef). As a result of this reverse, French control over Formosa was limited merely to the town of Keelung. This achievement fell far short of what had been hoped for.\n\n==== Blockade of Formosa ====\nTowards the end of 1884 the French were able to enforce a limited blockade of the northern Formosan ports of Keelung and Tamsui and the prefectural capital Taiwan (now [[Tainan]]) and the southern port Takow ([[Kaohsiung]]). In early January 1885 the Formosa expeditionary corps, now under the command of Colonel [[Jacques Duchesne]], was substantially reinforced with two battalions of infantry, bringing its total strength to around 4,000 men. Meanwhile, drafts from the [[Xiang Army|Hunan Army]] and [[Huai Army|Anhui Army]] had brought the strength of Liu Mingchuan's defending army to around 25,000 men. Although severely outnumbered, the French captured a number of minor Chinese positions to the southeast of Keelung at the end of January 1885, but were forced to halt offensive operations in February due to incessant rain.\n\nThe blockade succeeded in part because the northern [[Beiyang Fleet]], commanded by [[Li Hongzhang]], denied help to the southern [[Nanyang Fleet]]. No Beiyang ships were sent to battle the French.<ref name=\"Elleman 89\">{{cite book|volume=|title=Modern Chinese warfare, 1795\u20131989|author=Bruce A.

On 1 October, Admiral Courbet landed at Jilong with 2,250 men, and the city fell to the French. Chinese forces continued to encircle Jilong throughout the rest of the War. Although a French blockade thwarted all subsequent Chinese efforts to send a fleet to relieve Taiwan, the French troops never succeeded in taking the riverside town of Danshui (Tamsui) in Taiwan's northwestern coastal plain, immediately north of modern-day Taipei. As a result, French control over Taiwan was limited merely to the northern coast. China's central fleet, based in Jiangsu Province, proved unable to break through Admiral Courbet's blockade of Taiwan. Although the south quickly requested assistance from the northern fleet, Li Hongzhang refused to place his own ships in danger.

Although many of China's modern ships were state of the art, the personnel manning them were relatively unskilled: according to Rawlinson, only eight of the fourteen ship captains that saw action in the war had received any modern training at all. In addition, there was little, if any, coordination between the fleets in north and south China. The lack of a centralized admiralty commanding the entire navy meant that at any one time France opposed only a fraction of China's total fleet. This virtually assured French naval dominance in the upcoming conflict. |year=2001|accessdate=2012-01-18|location=|page=87|isbn=0-415-21474-2|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref> [[Tianjin]]'s northern naval academy also drained southern China of potential sailors, since they enlisted in northern China instead.<ref>{{cite book|volume=|title=Modern Chinese warfare, 1795\u20131989|author=Bruce A.

One of the major training grounds during the early 1870s was at the [[Fuzhou Arsenal]], which had hired foreign experts to conduct training classes. By the late 1870s, many of the foreigners had left Fuzhou and a new naval academy was opened at Tianjin, in northern China. This academy lured many of the best-trained Chinese sailors away from southern China. |year=2001|accessdate=2012-01-18|location=|page=87|isbn=0-415-21474-2|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref>\n\n==== Shipu Bay, Zhenhai Bay and the rice blockade ====\n{{Main|Battle of Shipu|Battle of Zhenhai}}\n[[File:FrenchTorpedoBoat.jpg|thumb|French torpedo launch attacking the Chinese frigate ''Yuyuan'', 14 February 1885]]\nAlthough the Formosa expeditionary corps remained confined in Keelung, the French scored important successes elsewhere in the spring of 1885. Courbet's squadron had been reinforced substantially since the start of the war, and he now had considerably more ships at his disposal than in October 1884. In early February 1885 part of his squadron left Keelung to head off a threatened attempt by part of the Chinese [[Nanyang Fleet]] (Southern Seas fleet) to break the French blockade of Formosa. On 11 February Courbet's task force met the cruisers ''Kaiji'', ''Nanchen'' and ''Nanrui'', three of the most modern ships in the Chinese fleet, near Shipu Bay, accompanied by the frigate ''Yuyuan'' and the composite sloop ''Chengqing''. The Chinese scattered at the French approach, and while the three cruisers successfully made their escape, the French succeeded in trapping ''Yuyuan'' and ''Chengqing'' in Shipu Bay. On the night of 14 February, in the [[Battle of Shipu]], the French attacked the Chinese vessels with two torpedo launches. During a brief engagement inside the bay, ''Yuyuan'' was seriously damaged by torpedoes and ''Chengqing'' was hit by ''Yuyuan'''s fire. Both ships were subsequently scuttled by the Chinese. The French torpedo launches escaped almost without loss.<ref>Duboc, 274\u201393; Loir, 245\u201364; Lung Chang, 327\u20138; Thomazi, 220\u201325; Wright, 63\u20134</ref>\n\nCourbet followed up this success on 1 March by locating ''Kaiji'', ''Nanchen'' and ''Nanrui'', which had taken refuge with four other Chinese warships in Zhenhai Bay, near the port of [[Ningbo]]. Courbet considered forcing the Chinese defences, but after testing its defenses finally decided to guard the entrance to the bay to keep the enemy vessels bottled up there for the duration of hostilities. A brief and inconclusive skirmish between the French cruiser ''Nielly'' and the Chinese shore batteries on 1 March enabled the Chinese general Ouyang Lijian (\u6b50\u967d\u5229\u898b), charged with the defence of Ningbo, to claim the so-called '[[Battle of Zhenhai]]' as a defensive victory.<ref>Loir, 277\u20139; Lung Chang, 328</ref>\n\nIn February 1885, under diplomatic pressure from China, Britain invoked the provisions of the 1870 Foreign Enlistment Act and closed Hong Kong and other ports in the Far East to French warships. The French government retaliated by ordering Admiral Courbet to implement a 'rice blockade' of the Yangzi River, hoping to bring the Qing court to terms by provoking serious rice shortages in northern China. The rice blockade severely disrupted the transport of rice by sea from Shanghai and forced the Chinese to carry it overland, but the war ended before the blockade seriously affected China's economy.\n\n=== Operations in Tonkin ===\n\n==== French victories in the delta ====\n{{Main|Kep Campaign|Battle of Yu Oc}}\n[[File:Combat de Lang-Kep.jpg|thumb|300px|The battle of K\u00e9p, 8 October 1884]]\n[[File:Louis Briere de lIsle.jpg|thumb|220px|General [[Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle]] (1827\u201396)]]\nMeanwhile, the French army in Tonkin was also putting severe pressure on the Chinese forces and their Black Flag allies. General Millot, whose health was failing, resigned as general-in-chief of the Tonkin expeditionary corps in early September 1884 and was replaced by General Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle, the senior of his two brigade commanders. Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle's first task was to beat off a major Chinese invasion of the Red River Delta. In late September 1884 large detachments of the Guangxi Army advanced from Langson and probed into the [[L\u1ee5c Nam]] valley, announcing their presence by ambushing the French gunboats ''Hache'' and ''Massue'' on 2 October. Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle responded immediately, transporting nearly 3,000 French soldiers to the L\u1ee5c Nam valley aboard a flotilla of gunboats and attacking the Chinese detachments before they could concentrate. In the [[Kep Campaign]], (2 to 15 October 1884), three French columns under the overall command of General de N\u00e9grier fell upon the separated detachments of the Guangxi Army and successively defeated them in engagements at [[Lam C\u1ed1t|Lam]] (6 October), [[K\u00e9p]] (8 October) and [[Ch\u0169]] (10 October). The second of these battles was marked by bitter close-quarter fighting between French and Chinese troops, and de N\u00e9grier's soldiers suffered heavy casualties storming the fortified village of K\u00e9p. The exasperated victors shot or bayoneted scores of wounded Chinese soldiers after the battle, and reports of French atrocities at Kep shocked public opinion in Europe. In fact, prisoners were rarely taken by either side during the Sino-French War, and the French were equally shocked by the Chinese habit of paying a bounty for severed French heads.\n\nIn the wake of these French victories the Chinese fell back to B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 and Dong Song, and de N\u00e9grier established important forward positions at K\u00e9p and Chu, which threatened the Guangxi Army's base at Lang Son. Ch\u0169 was only a few miles southwest of the Guangxi Army's advanced posts at Dong Song, and on 16 December a strong Chinese raiding detachment ambushed two companies of the Foreign Legion just to the east of Ch\u0169, at [[Ha Ho]]. The legionnaires fought their way out of the Chinese encirclement, but suffered a number of casualties and had to abandon their dead on the battlefield. De N\u00e9grier immediately brought up reinforcements and pursued the Chinese, but the raiders made good their retreat to Dong Song.<ref>Bonifacy, 7\u20138; Harmant, 91\u2013112; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 149\u201355</ref>\n\nShortly after the October engagements against the Guangxi Army, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle took steps to resupply the western outposts of [[H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a]], Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean and [[Tuy\u00ean Quang]], which were coming under increasing threat from Liu Yongfu's Black Flags and Tang Jingsong's [[Yunnan Army]]. On 19 November, in the [[Battle of Yu Oc]], a column making for Tuy\u00ean Quang under the command of Colonel [[Jacques Duchesne]] was ambushed in the [[Yu Oc]] gorge by the Black Flags but was able to fight its way through to the beleaguered post. The French also sealed off the eastern Delta from raids by Chinese guerillas based in Guangdong by occupying Tien Yen, Dong Trieu and other strategic points, and by blockading the Cantonese port of Beihai (Pak-Hoi). They also conducted sweeps along the lower course of the Red River to dislodge Annamese guerilla bands from bases close to Hanoi. These operations enabled Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle to concentrate the bulk of the Tonkin expeditionary corps around Ch\u0169 and K\u00e9p at the end of 1884, to advance on L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n as soon as the word was given.\n\n==== The L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Campaign ====\n{{Main|Battle of N\u00fai Bop|L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Campaign}}\n[[File:Lang Son Campaign.jpg|thumb|260px|The L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Campaign, February 1885]]\nFrench strategy in Tonkin was the subject of a bitter debate in the Chamber of Deputies in late December 1884. The army minister General Jean-Baptiste-Marie Campenon argued that the French should consolidate their hold on the Delta. His opponents urged an all-out offensive to throw the Chinese out of northern Tonkin. The debate culminated in Campenon's resignation and his replacement as army minister by the hawkish General [[Jules Louis Lewal]], who immediately ordered Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle to capture L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n. The campaign would be launched from the French forward base at Chu, and on 3 and 4 January 1885 General de N\u00e9grier attacked and defeated a substantial detachment of the Guangxi Army that had concentrated around the nearby village of [[N\u00fai Bop]] to try to disrupt the French preparations. De N\u00e8grier's victory at [[Battle of N\u00fai Bop|N\u00fai Bop]], won at odds of just under one to ten, was regarded by his fellow-officers as the most spectacular professional triumph of his career.<ref>Armengaud, 2\u20134; Bonifacy, 8\u20139; Harmant, 113\u201337; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 155\u201376</ref>\n\n[[File:Capture of Lang Son.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The capture of L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, 13 February 1885]]\nIt took the French a month to complete their preparations for the [[L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n Campaign]]. Finally, on 3 February 1885, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle began his advance from Chu with a column of just under 7,200 troops, accompanied by 4,500 coolies. In ten days the column advanced to the outskirts of Lang Son. The troops were burdened with the weight of their provisions and equipment, and had to march through extremely difficult country. They also had to fight fierce actions to overrun stoutly defended Chinese positions, at [[T\u00e2y H\u00f2a]] (4 February), [[H\u1ea1 H\u00f2a]] (5 February) and [[Dong Song, Vietnam|Dong Song]] (6 February). After a brief pause for breath at Dong Song, the expeditionary corps pressed on towards L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, fighting further actions at [[Deo Quao]] (9 February), and [[Pho Vy]] (11 February). On 12 February, in a costly but successful battle, the Turcos and marine infantry of Colonel Laurent Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade stormed the main Chinese defences at [[Bac Vie]], several kilometres to the south of Lang Son.<ref>Armengaud, 21\u20134; Harmant, 157\u20138; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 288\u201398 and 304\u20135</ref> On 13 February, the French column entered Lang Son which the Chinese abandoned after fighting a token rearguard action at the nearby village of [[Ky Lua]].<ref>Armengaud, 24\u20138; Bonifacy, 17\u201318; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 298\u2013305</ref>\n\n==== Siege and relief of Tuy\u00ean Quang ====\n{{Main|Siege of Tuy\u00ean Quang|Battle of H\u00f2a M\u1ed9c}}\n[[File:Chinese Prisoners.jpg|thumb|200px|Chinese soldiers captured by the French at Tuy\u00ean Quang]]\nThe capture of Lang Son allowed substantial French forces to be diverted further west to relieve the small and isolated French garrison in [[Tuy\u00ean Quang]], which had been placed under siege in November 1884 by Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army and Tang Jingsong's Yunnan Army. The [[Siege of Tuy\u00ean Quang]] was the most evocative confrontation of the Sino-French War. The Chinese and Black Flags sapped methodically up to the French positions, and in January and February 1885 breached the outer defences with mines and delivered seven separate assaults on the breach. The Tuy\u00ean Quang garrison, 400 legionnaires and 200 Tonkinese auxiliaries under the command of ''chef de bataillon'' Marc-Edmond Domin\u00e9, beat off all attempts to storm their positions, but lost over a third of their strength (50 dead and 224 wounded) sustaining a heroic defence against overwhelming odds. By mid-February it was clear that Tuy\u00ean Quang would fall unless it was relieved immediately.<ref>Harmant, 159\u201364; Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 237\u201341 and 246\u20138; ''Histoire militaire'', 102\u20133 and 107\u20138</ref>\n\nLeaving de N\u00e9grier at Lang Son with the 2nd Brigade, Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle personally led Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade back to Hanoi, and then upriver to the relief of Tuy\u00ean Quang. The brigade, reinforced at Phu Doan on 24 February by a small column from Hung Hoa under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel de Maussion, found the route to Tuy\u00ean Quang blocked by a strong Chinese defensive position at [[H\u00f2a M\u1ed9c]]. On 2 March 1885 Giovanninelli attacked the left flank of the Chinese defensive line. The [[Battle of H\u00f2a M\u1ed9c]] was the most fiercely fought action of the war. Two French assaults were decisively repulsed, and although the French eventually stormed the Chinese positions, they suffered very high casualties (76 dead and 408 wounded). Nevertheless, their costly victory cleared the way to Tuy\u00ean Quang. The Yunnan Army and the Black Flags raised the siege and drew off to the west, and the relieving force entered the beleaguered post on 3 March. Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle praised the courage of the hard-pressed garrison in a widely quoted order of the day. \u2018Today, you enjoy the admiration of the men who have relieved you at such heavy cost.

After resupplying the 2nd Brigade with food and ammunition, de N\u00e9grier defeated the Guangxi Army at the [[Battle of \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng (1885)|Battle of \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng]] on 23 February 1885 and cleared it from Tonkinese territory. For good measure, the French crossed briefly into Guangxi province and blew up the 'Gate of China', an elaborate Chinese customs building on the Tonkin-Guangxi border. They were not strong enough to exploit this victory, however, and the 2nd Brigade returned to Langson at the end of February.<ref>Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 337\u201349</ref>\n\n[[File:Zhen Nan Guan-Qing-deployment.jpg|thumb|left|330px|Chinese fortifications at Bang Bo]]\nBy early March, in the wake of the French victories at Hoa Moc and Dong Dang, the military situation in Tonkin had reached a temporary stalemate. Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade faced Tang Qingsong's Yunnan Army around H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a and Tuy\u00ean Quang, while de N\u00e9grier's 2nd Brigade at L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n faced Pan Dingxin's Guangxi Army. Neither Chinese army had any realistic prospect of launching an offensive for several weeks, while the two French brigades that had jointly captured L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n in February were not strong enough to inflict a decisive defeat on either Chinese army separately. Meanwhile, the French government was pressuring Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle to send the 2nd Brigade across the border into Guangxi province, in the hope that a threat to Chinese territory would force China to sue for peace. Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle and de N\u00e9grier examined the possibility of a campaign to capture the major Chinese military depot at Longzhou (Lung-chou, \u9f8d\u5dde), 60 kilometres beyond the border, but on 17 March Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle advised the army ministry in Paris that such an operation was beyond his strength. Substantial French reinforcements reached Tonkin in the middle of March, giving Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle a brief opportunity to break the stalemate. He moved the bulk of the reinforcements to H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a to reinforce the 1st Brigade, intending to attack the Yunnan Army and drive it back beyond Yen Bay. While he and Giovanninelli drew up plans for a western offensive, he ordered de N\u00e9grier to hold his positions at Lang Son.\n\nOn 23 and 24 March the&nbsp;2nd Brigade, only 1,500 men strong, fought a fierce action with over 25,000 troops of the Guangxi Army entrenched near [[Friendship Gate|Zhennanguan]] on the Chinese border. The [[Battle of Bang Bo]] (named by the French from the Vietnamese pronunciation of Hengpo, a village in the centre of the Chinese position where the fighting was fiercest), is normally known as the Battle of Zhennan Pass in China. The French took a number of outworks on 23 March, but failed to take the main Chinese positions on 24 March and were fiercely counterattacked in their turn. Although the French made a fighting withdrawal and prevented the Chinese from piercing their line, casualties in the 2nd Brigade were relatively heavy (70 dead and 188 wounded) and there were ominous scenes of disorder as the defeated French regrouped after the battle. As the brigade's morale was precarious and ammunition was running short, de N\u00e9grier decided to fall back to Lang Son.<ref>Armengaud, 40\u201358; Bonifacy, 23\u20136; Harmant, 211\u201335; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 428\u201353 and 455</ref>\n\n[[File:Paul-Gustave Herbinger.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger (1839\u201386)]]\nThe coolies abandoned the French and the French also had supply issues.

Elleman|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Md801mHEeOkC|quote=The Qing coury whole-heartedly supported the war, and from August to November 1884 the Chinese military prepared to enter the conflict. During the early months of 1885, the Chinese Army once again took the offensive as Beijing repeatedly ordered it to march on Tonkin. However, the shortage of supplies, poor weather, and illness devastated the Chinese troops; one 2,000 man unit reportedly lost 1,500 men to disease. This situation led one Qing military official to warn that fully one-half of all reinforcements to Annam might succumb to the elemnts. The focus of the fightin soon revolved around L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n, Pan Dingxin, the Governor of Guangxi, succeeded in establishing his headquarters there by early 1885. In February 1885 a French campaign forced Pan to retreat, and the French troops soon reoccupied the town. the French forces continued the offensive, an on 23 March they temporarily occupied and then hastily torched Zhennanguan, a town on the China-Annam border, before pulling back once again to L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n. Spurred on by the French attack, General Feng Zicai led his troops southward against General Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier's forces. The situation quickly became serious for the French, as their coolies deserted, interrupting the French supply lines, and ammunition began to run short. Even though the training of the Qing troops was inferior to the French and the Chinese officer corps was poor, their absolute number were greater. This precarious situation worsened for the French when General Negrier was wounded on 28 March.

French casualties at Ky Lua were 7 men killed and 38 wounded. The Chinese left 1,200 corpses on the battlefield, and a further 6,000 Chinese soldiers may have been wounded.

He was forced to hand over command to his senior regimental commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger. Herbinger was a noted military theoretician who had won a respectable battlefield reputation during the Franco-Prussian War, but was quite out of his depth as a field commander in Tonkin. Several French officers had already commented scathingly on his performance during the L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n campaign and at Bang Bo, where he had badly bungled an attack on the Chinese positions.\n\nUpon assuming command of the brigade, Herbinger panicked. Despite the evidence that the Chinese had been decisively defeated and were streaming back in disarray towards the Chinese frontier, he convinced himself that they were preparing to encircle L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n and cut his supply line. Disregarding the appalled protests of some of his officers, he ordered the 2nd Brigade to abandon L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n on the evening of 28 March and retreat to [[Ch\u0169]]. The [[retreat from L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]] was conducted without loss and with little interference from the Chinese, but Herbinger set an unnecessarily punishing pace and abandoned considerable quantities of food, ammunition and equipment. When the 2nd Brigade eventually rallied at Ch\u0169, its soldiers were exhausted and demoralised. Meanwhile, the Chinese general [[:zh:\u6f58\u9f0e\u65b0|Pan Dingxin]] (\u6f58\u9f0e\u65b0), informed by sympathisers in L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n that the French were in full retreat, promptly turned his battered army around and reoccupied L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n on 30 March.

China's forces now dominated the battefield, but fighting ended on 4 April 1885 as a result of peace negotiations. China sued for peace because Britain and Germany had not offered assistance as Beijing had hoped, and Russia and Japan threatened china's northern borders.

The political effect of this telegram was momentous. Ferry's immediate reaction was to reinforce the army in Tonkin, and indeed Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle quickly revised his estimate of the situation and advised the government that the front could soon be stabilised. However, his second thoughts came too late. When his first telegram was made public in Paris there was an uproar in the Chamber of Deputies. A motion of no confidence was tabled, and Ferry's government fell on 30 March.<ref>Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 258\u201361</ref> The '[[Tonkin Affair]]', as this humiliating blow to French policy in Tonkin was immediately dubbed, effectively ended Ferry's distinguished career in French politics. He would never again become premier, and his political influence during the rest of his career would be severely limited. His successor, [[Henri Brisson]], promptly concluded peace with China. The Chinese government agreed to implement the Tientsin Accord (implicitly recognising the French protectorate over Tonkin), and the French government dropped its demand for an indemnity for the B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush. A peace protocol ending hostilities was signed on 4 April, and a substantive peace treaty was signed on 9 June at [[Treaty of Tientsin (1885)|Tianjin]] by Li Hongzhang and the French minister [[Jules Paten\u00f4tre des Noyers|Jules Paten\u00f4tre]].<ref>Huard, 800\u201312; Lung Chang, 369\u201371; Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 261\u20132</ref>\n\n==== Japan and Russia's threat to join the war against China and the Northern fleet ====\nJapan had taken advantage of China's distraction with France to intrigue in the Chinese protectorate state of Korea. In December 1884 the Japanese sponsored the '[[Gapsin Coup]]', bringing Japan and China to the brink of war. Thereafter the Qing court considered that the Japanese were a greater threat to China than the French. In January 1885 the [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Empress Dowager]] directed her ministers to seek an honourable peace with France. Secret talks between the French and Chinese were held in Paris in February and March 1885, and the fall of Ferry's ministry removed the last remaining obstacles to a peace.<ref>Eastman, 196\u20139; Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 405\u20138 and 531\u20136</ref>\n\nThe Korean issue led to Japan and Russia having deteriorating relations with China, and in northern China Japan potentially threatened to join the war with France against China.<ref name=\"Fairbank1978\">{{cite book|author=John King Fairbank|title=The Cambridge History of China: Late Ch\u02bbing, 1800\u20131911, pt. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&pg=PA251|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22029-3|pages=251\u2013}}</ref> North China was menaced by the prospect of Japan and Russia joining in the war which led to China seeking a peace deal even though Chinese forces defeated the French on land.<ref name=\"Elleman\" />\n\nLi Hongzhang rejected pleas for the northern Beiyang fleet to be sent south to battle the French blockade.<ref name=\"Elleman 89\" />\n\nThe Korean issue and the threat of Japan led to Li Hongzhang refusing to use the northern Beiyang fleet to fight the French who destroyed the Fuzhou fleet.<ref>{{cite book|author=John King Fairbank|title=The Cambridge History of China: Late Ch\u02bbing, 1800\u20131911, pt. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfWaxPhdnIC&pg=PA252|year=1978|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22029-3|pages=252\u2013}}</ref> Li Hongzhang also wanted to personally maintain control of the fleet by keeping it in northern China and not let it slip into the control of another party.<ref name=\"Elleman 87\" />\n\n==== Final engagements ====\n{{Main|Keelung Campaign|Pescadores campaign (1885)}}\nIronically, while the war was being decided on the battlefields of Tonkin and in Paris, the Formosa expeditionary corps won two spectacular victories in March 1885. In a series of actions fought between 4 and 7 March Colonel Duchesne broke the Chinese encirclement of [[Keelung]] with a flank attack delivered against the east of the Chinese line, capturing the key position of La Table and forcing the Chinese to withdraw behind the Keelung River.<ref>Garnot, 147\u201372</ref> Duchesne's victory sparked a brief panic in [[Taipei]], but the French were not strong enough to advance beyond their bridgehead. The [[Keelung Campaign]] now reached a point of equilibrium. The French were holding a virtually impregnable defensive perimeter around Keelung but could not exploit their success, while Liu Mingchuan's army remained in presence just beyond their advanced positions.\n\n[[File:French Soldiers in Pescadores.jpg|thumb|300px|French soldiers and local townsfolk pose for the camera in front of a temple in [[Makung]] in the [[Pescadores Islands]].]]\nHowever, the French had one card left to play. Duchesne's victory enabled Admiral Courbet to detach a marine infantry battalion from the Keelung garrison to capture the [[Pescadores Islands]] in late March.<ref>Garnot, 179\u201395; Loir, 291\u2013317</ref> Strategically, the [[Pescadores campaign (1885)]] was an important victory, which would have prevented the Chinese from further reinforcing their army in Formosa, but it came too late to affect the outcome of the war. Future French operations were cancelled on the news of Lieutenant-Colonel Herbinger's [[retreat from L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n]] on 28 March, and Courbet was on the point of evacuating Keelung to reinforce the Tonkin expeditionary corps, leaving only a minimum garrison at [[Magong|Makung]] in the Pescadores, when hostilities were ended in April by the conclusion of preliminaries of peace.<ref>Garnot, 195\u2013206</ref>\n\nThe news of the peace protocol of 4 April did not reach the French and Chinese forces in Tonkin for several days, and the final engagement of the Sino-French War took place on 14 April 1885 at [[K\u00e9p]], where the French beat off a half-hearted Chinese attack on their positions.<ref>Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 524\u20136</ref> Meanwhile, Bri\u00e8re de l\u2019Isle had reinforced the key French posts at H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a and Ch\u0169, and when hostilities ended in the third fortnight of April the French were standing firm against both the Guangxi and Yunnan armies.<ref>Lecomte, ''Lang-Son'', 513\u201324</ref> Although Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle was planning to attack the Yunnan Army at Phu Lam Tao to avenge the defeat of 23 March, many French officers doubted whether this offensive would have succeeded. At the same time, the Chinese armies had no prospect whatsoever of driving the French from H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a or Ch\u0169. Militarily, the war in Tonkin ended in a stalemate.\n\nThe peace protocol of 4 April required the Chinese to withdraw their armies from Tonkin, and the French continued to occupy Keelung and the Pescadores for several months after the end of hostilities, as a surety for Chinese good faith. Admiral Courbet fell seriously ill during this occupation, and on 11 June died aboard his flagship ''[[French ironclad Bayard|Bayard]]'' in [[Magong|Makung]] harbour.<ref>Garnot, 214\u201323; Loir, 338\u201345</ref> Meanwhile, the Chinese punctiliously observed the terms of the peace settlement, and by the end of June 1885 both the Yunnan and Guangxi armies had evacuated Tonkin.

The war had already destroyed Ferry's career, and his successor [[Henri Brisson]] also resigned in the wake of the acrimonious 'Tonkin Debate' of December 1885, in which Clemenceau and other opponents of colonial expansion nearly succeeded in securing a French withdrawal from Tonkin. In the end, the Chamber voted the 1886 credits to support the Tonkin expeditionary corps by 274 votes to 270.<ref>Huard, 1,113\u201374; Thomazi, ''Conqu\u00eate'', 277\u201382</ref> If only three votes had gone the other way, the French would have left Tonkin. As Thomazi would later write, 'France gained Indochina very much against its own wishes.' The reverberations of the [[Tonkin Affair]] tarnished the reputation of the proponents of French colonial expansion generally, and delayed the realisation of other French colonial projects, including the conquest of Madagascar. It was not until the early 1890s that domestic political support for colonial expansion revived in France.\n\nAs far as China was concerned, the war hastened the emergence of a strong nationalist movement, and was a significant step in the decline of the Qing empire. The loss of the Fujian fleet on 23 August 1884 was considered particularly humiliating. The Chinese strategy also demonstrated the flaws in the late Qing national defence system of independent regional armies and fleets. The military and naval commanders in the south received no assistance from Li Hongzhang's Northern Seas ([[Beiyang]]) fleet, based in the Gulf of Zhili, and only token assistance from the Southern Seas ([[Nanyang Fleet|Nanyang]]) fleet at Shanghai. The excuse given, that these forces were needed to deter a Japanese penetration of Korea, was not convincing. The truth was, that having built up a respectable steam navy at considerable expense, the Chinese were reluctant to hazard it in battle, even though concentrating their forces would have given them the best chance of challenging France's local naval superiority. The [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] and her advisers responded in October 1885 by establishing a Navy Yamen on the model of the admiralties of the European powers, to provide unified direction of naval policy. The benefits of this reform were largely nullified by corruption, and although China acquired a number of modern ships in the decade after the Sino-French War, the Chinese navies remained handicapped by incompetent leadership. The bulk of China's steamship fleet was destroyed or captured in the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino\u2013Japanese War]] (1894\u201395), and for decades thereafter, China ceased to be a naval power of any importance.\n\nHistorians have judged the Qing dynasty's vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that \"Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the mid century rebellions, bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia, and defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884\u201385).

These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d).
