In constraint programming, users declaratively state the [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] on the feasible solutions for a set of decision variables. Constraints differ from the common [[Language primitive|primitives]] of [[imperative programming]] languages in that they do not specify a step or sequence of steps to execute, but rather the properties of a solution to be found. In additions to constraints, users also need to specify a method to solve these constraints. This typically draws upon standard methods like chronological [[backtracking]] and [[constraint propagation]], but may use customized code like a problem specific branching [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]].\n\nConstraint programming takes its root from and can be expressed in the form of [[constraint logic programming]], which embeds constraints into a [[logic program]]. This variant of logic programming is due to Jaffar and Lassez,<ref>Jaffar, Joxan, and J-L. Lassez. \"[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=41635 Constraint logic programming].\" Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGACT-SIGPLAN symposium on Principles of programming languages. ACM, 1987.</ref> who extended in 1987 a specific class of constraints that were introduced in [[Prolog II]]. The first implementations of constraint logic programming were [[Prolog III]], [[CLP(R)]], and [[CHIP (programming language)|CHIP]].\n\nInstead of logic programming, constraints can be mixed with [[functional programming]], [[term rewriting]], and [[imperative language]]s.\nProgramming languages with built-in support for constraints include [[Oz programming language|Oz]] (functional programming) and [[Kaleidoscope programming language|Kaleidoscope]] (imperative programming). Mostly, constraints are implemented in imperative languages via ''constraint solving toolkits'', which are separate libraries for an existing imperative language.\n\n==Constraint logic programming==\n{{main|Constraint logic programming}}\n\nConstraint programming is an embedding of constraints in a host language. The first host languages used were [[logic programming]] languages, so the field was initially called ''constraint logic programming''. The two paradigms share many important features, like logical variables and [[backtracking]]. Today most [[Prolog]] implementations include one or more libraries for constraint logic programming.\n\nThe difference between the two is largely in their styles and approaches to modeling the world. Some problems are more natural (and thus, simpler) to write as logic programs, while some are more natural to write as constraint programs.\n\nThe constraint programming approach is to search for a state of the world in which a large number of constraints are satisfied at the same time. A problem is typically stated as a state of the world containing a number of unknown variables. The constraint program searches for values for all the variables.\n\nTemporal concurrent constraint programming (TCC) and non-deterministic temporal concurrent constraint programming (MJV) are variants of constraint programming that can deal with time.\n\n==Constraint satisfaction problem==\n{{main|Constraint satisfaction problem}}\n\nA constraint is a relation between multiple variables which limits the values these variables can take simultaneously.\n{{math theorem\n|Definition\n|A constraint satisfaction problem on finite domains (or CSP) is defined by a triplet <math>(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{C})</math> where:\n* <math>\\mathcal{X} = \\{x_1, \\dots, x_n \\}</math> is the set of variables of the problem;\n* <math>\\mathcal{D} = \\{\\mathcal{D}_1, \\dots, \\mathcal{D}_n \\}</math> is the set of domains of the variables, i.e., for all <math>k \\in [1; n]</math> we have <math>x_k \\in \\mathcal{D}_k</math>;\n* <math>\\mathcal{C} = \\{C_1, \\dots, C_m \\}</math> is a set of constraints.

At different times one or more variables receive perturbations (changes to their old value), and the system propagates the change trying to assign new values to other variables that are consistent with the perturbation.\n[[Constraint propagation]] in [[Constraint Satisfaction Problems|constraint satisfaction problems]] is a typical example of a refinement model, and [[spreadsheet]]s are a typical example of a perturbation model.\n\nThe refinement model is more general, as it does not restrict variables to have a single value, it can lead to several solutions to the same problem. However, the perturbation model is more intuitive for programmers using mixed imperative constraint object-oriented languages.<ref>Lopez, G., Freeman-Benson, B., & Borning, A. (1994, January).

Springer Berlin Heidelberg.</ref>\n\n==Domains==\nThe constraints used in constraint programming are typically over some specific domains. Some popular domains for constraint programming are:\n\n* [[Boolean datatype|boolean]] domains, where only true/false constraints apply ([[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT problem]])\n* [[integer]] domains, [[Rational numbers|rational]] domains\n* [[Interval_(mathematics)|interval]] domains, in particular for scheduling problems\n* [[Linear algebra|linear]] domains, where only [[linear]] functions are described and analyzed (although approaches to [[non-linear]] problems do exist)\n* [[wiktionary:finite|finite]] domains, where constraints are defined over [[finite set]]s\n* mixed domains, involving two or more of the above\n\nFinite domains is one of the most successful domains of constraint programming. In some areas (like [[operations research]]) constraint programming is often identified with constraint programming over finite domains.\n\n== Constraint propagation ==\n{{Main|Constraint propagation}}\n'''Local consistency''' conditions are properties of [[Constraint satisfaction problem|constraint satisfaction problems]] related to the [[consistency]] of subsets of variables or constraints. They can be used to reduce the search space and make the problem easier to solve. Various kinds of local consistency conditions are leveraged, including '''node consistency''', '''arc consistency''', and '''path consistency'''.\n\nEvery local consistency condition can be enforced by a transformation that changes the problem without changing its solutions. Such a transformation is called '''[[constraint propagation]]'''.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bessiere|first=Christian|chapter=Constraint Propagation|date=2006|pages=29\u201383|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780444527264|doi=10.1016/s1574-6526(06)80007-6|title=Handbook of Constraint Programming|volume=2|series=Foundations of Artificial Intelligence}}</ref> Constraint propagation works by reducing domains of variables, strengthening constraints, or creating new ones. This leads to a reduction of the search space, making the problem easier to solve by some algorithms. Constraint propagation can also be used as an unsatisfiability checker, incomplete in general but complete in some particular cases.\n\n== Constraint solving ==\nThere are three main algorithmic techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems: backtracking search, local search, and dynamic programming<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n=== Backtracking search ===\n{{Main|Backtracking}}\n'''Backtracking search''' is a general [[algorithm]] for finding all (or some) solutions to some [[Computational problem|computational problems]], notably [[Constraint satisfaction problem|constraint satisfaction problems]], that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate (\"backtracks\") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.\n\n=== Local Search ===\n{{Main|Local search (constraint satisfaction)}}\n'''Local search''' is an incomplete method for finding a solution to a [[Constraint satisfaction problem|problem]]. It is based on iteratively improving an assignment of the variables until all constraints are satisfied. In particular, local search algorithms typically modify the value of a variable in an assignment at each step. The new assignment is close to the previous one in the space of assignment, hence the name ''local search''.\n\n=== Dynamic programming ===\n{{Main|Dynamic programming}}\n'''Dynamic programming''' is both a [[mathematical optimization]] method and a computer programming method. It refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a [[Recursion|recursive]] manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have [[optimal substructure]].\n\n== Example ==\nThe syntax for expressing constraints over finite domains depends on the host language. The following is a [[Prolog]] program that solves the classical [[alphametic]] puzzle [[Verbal arithmetic|SEND+MORE=MONEY]] in constraint logic programming:\n<source lang=\"prolog\">\n% This code works in both YAP and SWI-Prolog using the environment-supplied\n% CLPFD constraint solver library.  It may require minor modifications to work\n% in other Prolog environments or using other constraint solvers.\n:- use_module(library(clpfd)).\nsendmore(Digits) :-\n   Digits = [S,E,N,D,M,O,R,N,Y],   % Create variables\n   Digits ins 0..9,                % Associate domains to variables\n   S #\\= 0,                        % Constraint: S must be different from 0\n   M #\\= 0,\n   all_different(Digits),          % all the elements must take different values\n                1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D     % Other constraints\n              + 1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E\n   #= 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y,\n   label(Digits).                  % Start the search\n</source>\n\nThe interpreter creates a variable for each letter in the puzzle. The operator <code>ins</code> is used to specify the domains of these variables, so that they range over the set of values {0,1,2,3, ..., 9}. The constraints <code>S#\\=0</code> and <code>M#\\=0</code> means that these two variables cannot take the value zero. When the interpreter evaluates these constraints, it reduces the domains of these two variables by removing the value 0 from them. Then, the constraint <code>all_different(Digits)</code> is considered; it does not reduce any domain, so it is simply stored. The last constraint specifies that the digits assigned to the letters must be such that \"SEND+MORE=MONEY\" holds when each letter is replaced by its corresponding digit. From this constraint, the solver infers that M=1. All stored constraints involving variable M are awakened: in this case, [[constraint propagation]] on the <code>all_different</code> constraint removes value 1 from the domain of all the remaining variables. Constraint propagation may solve the problem by reducing all domains to a single value, it may prove that the problem has no solution by reducing a domain to the empty set, but may also terminate without proving satisfiability or unsatisfiability. The '''label''' literals are used to actually perform search for a solution.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Combinatorial optimization]]\n* [[Constraint logic programming]]\n* [[Concurrent constraint logic programming]]\n* [[Mathematical optimization]]\n* [[Heuristic (computer science)|Heuristic algorithms]]\n* [[Nurse scheduling problem]]\n* [[Traveling tournament problem]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.a4cp.org/ Association for Constraint Programming]\n*[http://www.a4cp.org/events/cp-conference-series CP Conference Series]\n*[http://kti.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/constraints/index.html Guide to Constraint Programming]\n*{{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/2012.12.05-051244/http://www.mozart-oz.org/ |date=December 5, 2012 |title=The Mozart Programming System}}, an [[Oz programming language|Oz]]-based free software ([[X11]]-style)\n*{{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/2013.01.07-222548/http://4c.ucc.ie/web/index.jsp |date=January 7, 2013 |title= Cork Constraint Computation Centre}}\n*[https://sofdem.github.io/gccat/index.html Global Constraint Catalog]\n\n{{Programming language}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Constraint programming| ]]\n[[Category:Programming paradigms]]\n[[Category:Declarative programming]]\n", "text_old": "{{Original research|date=June 2011}}\n{{Programming paradigms}}\n\n'''Constraint programming (CP)'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kjap9ZWcKOoC&pg=PP1&dq=handbook+of+constraint+programming|title=Handbook of Constraint Programming|last=Rossi|first=Francesca|last2=Beek|first2=Peter van|last3=Walsh|first3=Toby|date=2006-08-18|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080463803|language=en}}</ref> is a paradigm for solving combinatorial problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, [[computer science]], and [[operations research]].

It may require minor modifications to work\n% in other Prolog environments or using other constraint solvers.\n:- use_module(library(clpfd)).\nsendmore(Digits) :-\n   Digits = [S,E,N,D,M,O,R,N,Y],   % Create variables\n   Digits ins 0..9,                % Associate domains to variables\n   S #\\= 0,                        % Constraint: S must be different from 0\n   M #\\= 0,\n   all_different(Digits),          % all the elements must take different values\n                1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D     % Other constraints\n              + 1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E\n   #= 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y,\n   label(Digits).                  % Start the search\n</source>\n\nThe interpreter creates a variable for each letter in the puzzle. The operator <code>ins</code> is used to specify the domains of these variables, so that they range over the set of values {0,1,2,3, ..., 9}. The constraints <code>S#\\=0</code> and <code>M#\\=0</code> means that these two variables cannot take the value zero. When the interpreter evaluates these constraints, it reduces the domains of these two variables by removing the value 0 from them. Then, the constraint <code>all_different(Digits)</code> is considered; it does not reduce any domain, so it is simply stored. The last constraint specifies that the digits assigned to the letters must be such that \"SEND+MORE=MONEY\" holds when each letter is replaced by its corresponding digit. From this constraint, the solver infers that M=1. All stored constraints involving variable M are awakened: in this case, [[constraint propagation]] on the <code>all_different</code> constraint removes value 1 from the domain of all the remaining variables. Constraint propagation may solve the problem by reducing all domains to a single value, it may prove that the problem has no solution by reducing a domain to the empty set, but may also terminate without proving satisfiability or unsatisfiability. The '''label''' literals are used to actually perform search for a solution.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Combinatorial optimization]]\n* [[Constraint logic programming]]\n* [[Concurrent constraint logic programming]]\n* [[Mathematical optimization]]\n* [[Heuristic (computer science)|Heuristic algorithms]]\n* [[Nurse scheduling problem]]\n* [[Traveling tournament problem]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.a4cp.org/ Association for Constraint Programming]\n*[http://www.a4cp.org/events/cp-conference-series CP Conference Series]\n*[http://kti.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/constraints/index.html Guide to Constraint Programming]\n*{{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/2012.12.05-051244/http://www.mozart-oz.org/ |date=December 5, 2012 |title=The Mozart Programming System}}, an [[Oz programming language|Oz]]-based free software ([[X11]]-style)\n*{{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/2013.01.07-222548/http://4c.ucc.ie/web/index.jsp |date=January 7, 2013 |title= Cork Constraint Computation Centre}}\n*[https://sofdem.github.io/gccat/index.html Global Constraint Catalog]\n\n{{Programming language}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Constraint programming| ]]\n[[Category:Programming paradigms]]\n[[Category:Declarative programming]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming"}

He made significant contributions to the [[real analysis|theory of functions of a real variable]], the [[calculus of variations]], and [[measure theory]]. His work also includes important results in [[conformal mapping|conformal representations]] and in the theory of boundary correspondence. In 1909, Carath\u00e9odory pioneered the ''Axiomatic Formulation of Thermodynamics'' along a purely geometrical approach.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Caratheodory Constantin and Stephanos.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Constantin Caratheodory with his father, [[Alexander Karatheodori Pasha]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Governor]] of [[Crete]] and [[Ambassador]] of [[Berlin]].]]\n\nConstantin Carath\u00e9odory was born in [[Berlin]] to [[Greeks|Greek]] parents and grew up in [[Brussels]]. His father Stephanos, a lawyer, served as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ambassador to [[Belgium]], [[St. Petersburg]] and Berlin. His mother, Despina, n\u00e9e Petrokokkinos, was from the island of [[Chios]]. The Carath\u00e9odory family, originally from [[Bosnochori]] or [[Vyssa]], was well established and respected in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], and its members held many important governmental positions.\n\nThe Carath\u00e9odory family spent 1874\u201375 in Constantinople, where Constantin's paternal grandfather lived, while his father Stephanos was on leave. Then in 1875 they went to Brussels when Stephanos was appointed there as Ottoman Ambassador. In Brussels, Constantin's younger sister Julia was born. The year 1879 was a tragic one for the family since Constantin's paternal grandfather died in that year, but much more tragically, Constantin's mother Despina died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Cannes]]. Constantin's maternal grandmother took on the task of bringing up Constantin and Julia in his father's home in Belgium. They employed a German maid who taught the children to speak German. Constantin was already bilingual in French and Greek by this time.\n\nConstantin began his formal schooling at a private school in Vanderstock in 1881. He left after two years and then spent time with his father on a visit to Berlin, and also spent the winters of 1883\u201384 and 1884\u201385 on the [[Italian Riviera]]. Back in Brussels in 1885 he attended a grammar school for a year where he first began to become interested in mathematics. In 1886, he entered the high school Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Royal d'Ixelles and studied there until his graduation in 1891. Twice during his time at this school Constantin won a prize as the best mathematics student in Belgium.\n\n[[Image:Caratheodory family.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) pictured sitting with his father, brother in law and sister, Carlsbad 1898]]\n\nAt this stage Carath\u00e9odory began training as a military engineer. He attended the \u00c9cole Militaire de Belgique from October 1891 to May 1895 and he also studied at the \u00c9cole d'Application from 1893 to 1896. In 1897 [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a war broke out]] between the Ottoman Empire and Greece. This put Carath\u00e9odory in a difficult position since he sided with the Greeks, yet his father served the government of the Ottoman Empire. Since he was a trained engineer he was offered a job in the British colonial service. This job took him to Egypt where he worked on the construction of the [[Assiut]] dam until April 1900. During periods when construction work had to stop due to floods, he studied mathematics from some textbooks he had with him, such as [[Camille Jordan|Jordan's]] ''Cours d'Analyse'' and Salmon's text on the analytic geometry of [[conic sections]]. He also visited the [[Pyramid of Cheops|Cheops pyramid]] and made measurements which he wrote up and published in 1901.<ref>Brussells 1901 (Hayez);Ges. math. Schr. V. 273-281</ref> He also published a book on Egypt in the same year which contained a wealth of information on the history and geography of the country. <ref>H Aigyptos, Syllogos Ophelimon Biblion, no 14, 118 pp Athens 1901, 1928, New York 1920</ref>\n\n== Studies and university career ==\nCarath\u00e9odory studied engineering in [[Belgium]] at the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]], where he was considered a charismatic and brilliant student.\n\n===University career===\n\n* 1900  Studies at [[University of Berlin]].\n* 1902  Completed graduation at [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] (1904 Ph.D, 1905 Habilitation)\n* 1908  Dozent at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]]\n* 1909  Ordinary Professor at [[University of Hannover|Hannover Technical High School]].\n* 1910  Ordinary Professor at [[Wroc\u0142aw University of Technology|Breslau Technical High School]].\n* 1913  Professor following Klein at [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]].\n* 1919  Professor at [[University of Berlin]]\n* 1919  Elected to [[Prussian Academy of Science]].\n* 1920  University Dean at [[Ionian University of Smyrna]] (later, [[University of the Aegean]]).\n* 1922  Professor at [[University of Athens]].\n* 1922  Professor at [[Athens Polytechnic]].\n* 1924  Professor following Lindemann at [[University of Munich]].\n* 1938  Retirement from Professorship. Continued working from Bavarian Academy of Science\n\n===Doctoral students===\nCarath\u00e9odory had about 20 doctoral students among these being [[Hans Rademacher]], known for his work on analysis and number theory, and [[Paul Finsler]] known for his creation of [[Finsler space]].\n\n===Academic contacts in Germany===\nCarath\u00e9odory's contacts in Germany were many and included such famous names as: [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein|Klein]], [[Einstein]], [[Hermann Amandus Schwarz|Schwarz]], [[Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r|Fej\u00e9r]]. During the difficult period of World War II his close associates at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences were Perron and Tietze.\n\n===Academic contacts in Greece===\nWhile in Germany Carath\u00e9odory retained numerous links with the Greek academic world about which detailed information may be found in Georgiadou's book. He was directly involved with the reorganization of Greek universities. An especially close friend and colleague in Athens was Nicolaos Kritikos who had attended his lectures at G\u014fttingen, later going with him to Smyrna, then becoming professor at Athens Polytechnic. Kritikos and Carath\u00e9odory helped the Greek topologist [[Christos Papakyriakopoulos]] take a doctorate in topology at Athens University in 1943 under very difficult circumstances. While teaching in Athens University Carath\u00e9odory had as undergraduate student Evangelos Stamatis who subsequently achieved considerable distinction as a scholar of ancient Greek mathematical classics.<ref>J P Christianidis & N Kastanis: ''In memoriam Evangelos S Stamatis (1898\u20131990) Historia Mathematica 19 (1992) 99-105''</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Caratheodorys theorem example.png|thumb|200px|An illustration of [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (convex hull)]] for a square in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>.]]\n[[Image:Caratheodory and Fej\u00e9r.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) with Hungarian mathematician [[Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r]] (1880\u20131959) (standing to the right).]]\n\n===Calculus of variations===\nIn his doctoral dissertation Carath\u00e9odory originated his method based on the use of the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] to construct a field of extremals. The ideas are closely related to light propagation in optics. The method became known as ''the royal road to the calculus of variations''.<ref>H. Boerner, ''Carath\u00e9odory und die Variationsrechnung'', in A Panayotopolos (ed.), Proceedings of C. Carath\u00e9odory International Symposium, September 1973, Athens (Athens, 1974), 80\u201390.</ref> More recently the same idea has been taken into the theory of [[optimal control]].<ref>[[Richard Bellman|Bellman]] for his ''Dynamic programming'' in its continuous-time form used Carath\u00e9odory's work in the form of the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation]]. [[Rudolf E. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n|K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]] also explicitly used Carath\u00e9odory's formulation in his initial papers on optimal control. See e.g. R. E. Kalman: ''Contributions to the theory of optimal control''. Boletin de la Sociedad Matematica Mexicana 1960</ref> The method can also be extended to multiple integrals.\n\n===Real analysis===\nHe proved an [[Carath\u00e9odory's existence theorem|existence theorem]] for the  solution to ordinary differential equations under mild regularity conditions.\n\n===Theory of measure===\nHe is credited with the [[Carath\u00e9odory extension theorem]] which is fundamental to modern measure theory. Later Carath\u00e9odory extended the theory from sets to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.\n\n===Theory of functions of a complex variable===\nHe greatly extended the theory of [[conformal transformation]]<ref>A. Shields: ''Carath\u00e9odory and Conformal Mapping'' Math. Intelligencer vol.10(1), 1988</ref> proving his [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (conformal mapping)|theorem]] about the extension of conformal mapping to the boundary of Jordan domains.  In studying boundary correspondence he originated the theory of [[prime end]]s.\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nIn 1909, Carath\u00e9odory published a pioneering work \"Investigations on the Foundations of Thermodynamics\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carath\u00e9odory|first=Constantin|title=Untersuchungen ueber die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik|trans-title=Examination of the foundations of Thermodynamics| journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=67|issue=3|year=1909|pages=355\u2013386|doi=10.1007/bf01450409|translator-last=Delphinich|translator-first=D. H.|url=http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/caratheodory_-_thermodynamics.pdf}}</ref> in which he formulated the [[Laws of Thermodynamics]] axiomatically. It has been said{{according to whom|date=January 2014}} that he was using only mechanical concepts and the theory of [[Johann Friedrich Pfaff|Pfaff']]<nowiki/>s differential forms. But in reality he also relied heavily on the concept of an [[adiabatic process]]. The physical meaning of the term adiabatic rests on the concepts of [[heat]] and [[temperature]]. Thus, in Bailyn's survey of thermodynamics, Carath\u00e9odory's approach is called \"mechanical\", as distinct from \"thermodynamic\".<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, Woodbury NY, {{isbn|0-88318-797-3}}.</ref> Carath\u00e9odory's \"first axiomatically rigid foundation of thermodynamics\" was acclaimed by [[Max Born]]<ref>Max Born: ''The Born\u2013Einstein Letters'', MacMillan 1971</ref> but criticized by [[Max Planck]].<ref>[http://web.ist.utl.pt/ist12219/data/68.pdf Constantin Carath\u00e9odory and the axiomatic thermodynamics]'' by Lionello Pogliani and Mario N. Berberan-Santos</ref>\n\nIn his theory he simplified the basic concepts, for instance ''heat'' is not an essential concept but a derived one. He formulated the axiomatic principle of irreversibility in thermodynamics stating that inaccessibility of states is related to the existence of entropy, where temperature is the integration function. The [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] was expressed via the following axiom: \"In the neighbourhood of any initial state, there are states which cannot be approached arbitrarily close through adiabatic changes of state.\" In this connexion he coined the term [[adiabatic accessibility]].<ref>adiabatic accessibility = [[:de:Adiabatische Erreichbarkeit|adiabatische Erreichbarkeit]]; see also Elliott H. Lieb, Jakob Yngvason: [http://de.arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9708200 ''The Physics and Mathematics of the Second Law of Thermodynamics''], Phys. Rep. 310, 1\u201396 (1999) and Elliott H.

Lieb'', 2005, {{isbn|978-3-540-22297-2}}</ref>\n\n===Optics===\nCarath\u00e9odory's work in [[optics]] is closely related to his method in the calculus of variations.  In 1926<ref>''\u00dcber den Zusammenhang der Theorie der absoluten optischen Instrumente mit einem Satz der Variationsrechnung'', M\u00fcnchener Sitzb. Math. -naturw Abteilung 1926 1\u201318; Ges. Math. Schr. II 181\u2013197.</ref> he gave a strict and general proof that no system of lenses and mirrors can avoid [[Aberration in optical systems|aberration]], except for the trivial case of plane mirrors.\nIn his later work he gave the theory of the [[Schmidt telescope]].\n\n===Historical===\nDuring the 2nd World War Carath\u00e9odory edited two volumes of [[Euler]]'s Complete Works dealing with the Calculus of Variations which were submitted for publication in 1946.<ref>Euler Opera Omnia, Series 1 (a) vol.24: ''Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas maximi minimive gaudentes sive solutio problematis isoperimetrici latissimo sensu accepti''.

As of 2007, this conjecture remained unproven despite having attracted a large amount of research.\n\n== The University of Smyrna ==\n[[File:Ionian University of Smyrna.jpg|thumb|Photo of the [[Ionian University of Smyrna]].]]\n\nAt the time, Athens was the only major educational centre in the wider area and had limited capacity to sufficiently satisfy the growing educational need of the eastern part of the Aegean Sea and the [[Balkans]].

In 1920 Carath\u00e9odory was appointed Dean of the University and took a major part in establishing the institution, touring Europe to buy books and equipment. The university however never actually admitted students due to the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|War in Asia Minor]] which ended in the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]].

He later worked from the Bavarian Academy of Sciences until his death in 1950.\n\nThe new Greek University in the broader area of the Southeast Mediterranean region, as originally envisioned by Carath\u00e9odory, finally materialised with the establishment of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Brief History of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki\">{{cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/history|title=Brief History|publisher=Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistic talent ==\nCarath\u00e9odory excelled at languages, much like many members of his family did. [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[French language|French]] were his first languages, and he mastered [[German language|German]] with such perfection, that his writings composed in the German language are stylistic masterworks.<ref>Denker, Forscher und Entdecker: eine Geschichte der Bayerischen Akademie\n By Dietmar Willoweit p.263</ref> Carath\u00e9odory also spoke and wrote [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and the [[ancient languages]] without any effort. Such an impressive linguistic arsenal enabled him to communicate and exchange ideas directly with other mathematicians during his numerous travels, and greatly extend his fields of knowledge.\n\nMuch more than that, Carath\u00e9odory was a treasured conversation partner for his fellow professors in the Munich Department of Philosophy. The well-respected, German [[philology|philologist]], professor of ancient languages Kurt von Fritz praised Carath\u00e9odory, saying that from him one could learn an endless amount about the old and new Greece, the old Greek language, and Hellenic mathematics. Fritz had numerous philosophical discussions with Carath\u00e9odory.\n\nThe Greek language was spoken exclusively in Carath\u00e9odory's house \u2013 his son Stephanos and daughter Despina went to a German high school, but they obtained daily additional instruction in Greek language and culture from a Greek priest.

He made significant contributions to the [[real analysis|theory of functions of a real variable]], the [[calculus of variations]], and [[measure theory]]. His work also includes important results in [[conformal mapping|conformal representations]] and in the theory of boundary correspondence. In 1909, Carath\u00e9odory pioneered the ''Axiomatic Formulation of Thermodynamics'' along a purely geometrical approach.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Caratheodory Constantin and Stephanos.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Constantin Caratheodory with his father, [[Alexander Karatheodori Pasha]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Governor]] of [[Crete]] and [[Ambassador]] of [[Berlin]].]]\n\nConstantin Carath\u00e9odory was born in [[Berlin]] to [[Greeks|Greek]] parents and grew up in [[Brussels]]. His father Stephanos, a lawyer, served as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ambassador to [[Belgium]], [[St. Petersburg]] and Berlin. His mother, Despina, n\u00e9e Petrokokkinos, was from the island of [[Chios]]. The Carath\u00e9odory family, originally from [[Bosnochori]] or [[Vyssa]], was well established and respected in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], and its members held many important governmental positions.\n\nThe Carath\u00e9odory family spent 1874\u201375 in Constantinople, where Constantin's paternal grandfather lived, while his father Stephanos was on leave. Then in 1875 they went to Brussels when Stephanos was appointed there as Ottoman Ambassador. In Brussels, Constantin's younger sister Julia was born. The year 1879 was a tragic one for the family since Constantin's paternal grandfather died in that year, but much more tragically, Constantin's mother Despina died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Cannes]]. Constantin's maternal grandmother took on the task of bringing up Constantin and Julia in his father's home in Belgium. They employed a German maid who taught the children to speak German. Constantin was already bilingual in French and Greek by this time.\n\nConstantin began his formal schooling at a private school in Vanderstock in 1881. He left after two years and then spent time with his father on a visit to Berlin, and also spent the winters of 1883\u201384 and 1884\u201385 on the [[Italian Riviera]]. Back in Brussels in 1885 he attended a grammar school for a year where he first began to become interested in mathematics. In 1886, he entered the high school Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Royal d'Ixelles and studied there until his graduation in 1891. Twice during his time at this school Constantin won a prize as the best mathematics student in Belgium.\n\n[[Image:Caratheodory family.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) pictured sitting with his father, brother in law and sister, Carlsbad 1898]]\n\nAt this stage Carath\u00e9odory began training as a military engineer. He attended the \u00c9cole Militaire de Belgique from October 1891 to May 1895 and he also studied at the \u00c9cole d'Application from 1893 to 1896. In 1897 [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a war broke out]] between the Ottoman Empire and Greece. This put Carath\u00e9odory in a difficult position since he sided with the Greeks, yet his father served the government of the Ottoman Empire. Since he was a trained engineer he was offered a job in the British colonial service. This job took him to Egypt where he worked on the construction of the [[Assiut]] dam until April 1900. During periods when construction work had to stop due to floods, he studied mathematics from some textbooks he had with him, such as [[Camille Jordan|Jordan's]] ''Cours d'Analyse'' and Salmon's text on the analytic geometry of [[conic sections]]. He also visited the [[Pyramid of Cheops|Cheops pyramid]] and made measurements which he wrote up and published in 1901<ref>Brussells 1901 (Hayez);Ges. math. Schr. V. 273-281</ref>. He also published a book on Egypt in the same year which contained a wealth of information on the history and geography of the country. <ref>H Aigyptos, Syllogos Ophelimon Biblion, no 14, 118 pp Athens 1901, 1928, New York 1920</ref>\n\n== Studies and university career ==\nCarath\u00e9odory studied engineering in [[Belgium]] at the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]], where he was considered a charismatic and brilliant student.\n\n===University career===\n\n* 1900  Studies at [[University of Berlin]].\n* 1902  Completed graduation at [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] (1904 Ph.D, 1905 Habilitation)\n* 1908  Dozent at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]]\n* 1909  Ordinary Professor at [[University of Hannover|Hannover Technical High School]].\n* 1910  Ordinary Professor at [[Wroc\u0142aw University of Technology|Breslau Technical High School]].\n* 1913  Professor following Klein at [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]].\n* 1919  Professor at [[University of Berlin]]\n* 1919  Elected to [[Prussian Academy of Science]].\n* 1920  University Dean at [[Ionian University of Smyrna]] (later, [[University of the Aegean]]).\n* 1922  Professor at [[University of Athens]].\n* 1922  Professor at [[Athens Polytechnic]].\n* 1924  Professor following Lindemann at [[University of Munich]].\n* 1938  Retirement from Professorship. Continued working from Bavarian Academy of Science\n\n===Doctoral students===\nCarath\u00e9odory had about 20 doctoral students among these being [[Hans Rademacher]], known for his work on analysis and number theory, and [[Paul Finsler]] known for his creation of [[Finsler space]].\n\n===Academic contacts in Germany===\nCarath\u00e9odory's contacts in Germany were many and included such famous names as: [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein|Klein]], [[Einstein]], [[Hermann Amandus Schwarz|Schwarz]], [[Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r|Fej\u00e9r]]. During the difficult period of World War II his close associates at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences were Perron and Tietze.\n\n===Academic contacts in Greece===\nWhile in Germany Carath\u00e9odory retained numerous links with the Greek academic world about which detailed information may be found in Georgiadou's book. He was directly involved with the reorganization of Greek universities. An especially close friend and colleague in Athens was Nicolaos Kritikos who had attended his lectures at G\u014fttingen, later going with him to Smyrna, then becoming professor at Athens Polytechnic. Kritikos and Carath\u00e9odory helped the Greek topologist [[Christos Papakyriakopoulos]] take a doctorate in topology at Athens University in 1943 under very difficult circumstances. While teaching in Athens University Carath\u00e9odory had as undergraduate student Evangelos Stamatis who subsequently achieved considerable distinction as a scholar of ancient Greek mathematical classics.<ref>J P Christianidis & N Kastanis: ''In memoriam Evangelos S Stamatis (1898\u20131990) Historia Mathematica 19 (1992) 99-105''</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Caratheodorys theorem example.png|thumb|200px|An illustration of [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (convex hull)]] for a square in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>.]]\n[[Image:Caratheodory and Fej\u00e9r.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) with Hungarian mathematician [[Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r]] (1880\u20131959) (standing to the right).]]\n\n===Calculus of variations===\nIn his doctoral dissertation Carath\u00e9odory originated his method based on the use of the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] to construct a field of extremals. The ideas are closely related to light propagation in optics. The method became known as ''the royal road to the calculus of variations''.<ref>H. Boerner, ''Carath\u00e9odory und die Variationsrechnung'', in A Panayotopolos (ed.), Proceedings of C. Carath\u00e9odory International Symposium, September 1973, Athens (Athens, 1974), 80\u201390.</ref> More recently the same idea has been taken into the theory of [[optimal control]].<ref>[[Richard Bellman|Bellman]] for his ''Dynamic programming'' in its continuous-time form used Carath\u00e9odory's work in the form of the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equation]]. [[Rudolf E. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n|K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]] also explicitly used Carath\u00e9odory's formulation in his initial papers on optimal control. See e.g. R. E. Kalman: ''Contributions to the theory of optimal control''. Boletin de la Sociedad Matematica Mexicana 1960</ref> The method can also be extended to multiple integrals.\n\n===Real analysis===\nHe proved an [[Carath\u00e9odory's existence theorem|existence theorem]] for the  solution to ordinary differential equations under mild regularity conditions.\n\n===Theory of measure===\nHe is credited with the [[Carath\u00e9odory extension theorem]] which is fundamental to modern measure theory. Later Carath\u00e9odory extended the theory from sets to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.\n\n===Theory of functions of a complex variable===\nHe greatly extended the theory of [[conformal transformation]]<ref>A. Shields: ''Carath\u00e9odory and Conformal Mapping'' Math. Intelligencer vol.10(1), 1988</ref> proving his [[Carath\u00e9odory's theorem (conformal mapping)|theorem]] about the extension of conformal mapping to the boundary of Jordan domains.  In studying boundary correspondence he originated the theory of [[prime end]]s.\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nIn 1909, Carath\u00e9odory published a pioneering work \"Investigations on the Foundations of Thermodynamics\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carath\u00e9odory|first=Constantin|title=Untersuchungen ueber die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik|trans-title=Examination of the foundations of Thermodynamics| journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=67|issue=3|year=1909|pages=355\u2013386|doi=10.1007/bf01450409|translator-last=Delphinich|translator-first=D.

It has been said{{according to whom|date=January 2014}} that he was using only mechanical concepts and the theory of [[Johann Friedrich Pfaff|Pfaff']]<nowiki/>s differential forms. But in reality he also relied heavily on the concept of an [[adiabatic process]]. The physical meaning of the term adiabatic rests on the concepts of [[heat]] and [[temperature]]. Thus, in Bailyn's survey of thermodynamics, Carath\u00e9odory's approach is called \"mechanical\", as distinct from \"thermodynamic\".<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, Woodbury NY, {{isbn|0-88318-797-3}}.</ref> Carath\u00e9odory's \"first axiomatically rigid foundation of thermodynamics\" was acclaimed by [[Max Born]]<ref>Max Born: ''The Born\u2013Einstein Letters'', MacMillan 1971</ref> but criticized by [[Max Planck]].<ref>[http://web.ist.utl.pt/ist12219/data/68.pdf Constantin Carath\u00e9odory and the axiomatic thermodynamics]'' by Lionello Pogliani and Mario N. Berberan-Santos</ref>\n\nIn his theory he simplified the basic concepts, for instance ''heat'' is not an essential concept but a derived one. He formulated the axiomatic principle of irreversibility in thermodynamics stating that inaccessibility of states is related to the existence of entropy, where temperature is the integration function. The [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] was expressed via the following axiom: \"In the neighbourhood of any initial state, there are states which cannot be approached arbitrarily close through adiabatic changes of state.\" In this connexion he coined the term [[adiabatic accessibility]].<ref>adiabatic accessibility = [[:de:Adiabatische Erreichbarkeit|adiabatische Erreichbarkeit]]; see also Elliott H. Lieb, Jakob Yngvason: [http://de.arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9708200 ''The Physics and Mathematics of the Second Law of Thermodynamics''], Phys. Rep. 310, 1\u201396 (1999) and Elliott H.

He later worked from the Bavarian Academy of Sciences until his death in 1950.\n\nThe new Greek University in the broader area of the Southeast Mediterranean region, as originally envisioned by Carath\u00e9odory, finally materialised with the establishment of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Brief History of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki\">{{cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/history|title=Brief History|publisher=Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistic talent ==\nCarath\u00e9odory excelled at languages, much like many members of his family did.

The well-respected, German [[philology|philologist]], professor of ancient languages Kurt von Fritz praised Carath\u00e9odory, saying that from him one could learn an endless amount about the old and new Greece, the old Greek language, and Hellenic mathematics.

Its primary components are the \n[[Connecticut Army National Guard]], the [[Connecticut Air National Guard]], and four companies of the state militia. The Military Department of the [[State of Connecticut]] traces its origins to May 11, 1637, when the \"General Courts\" (colonial assembly - legislature) established a military arm of the provincial government. In 1939, the State's Military Department. was established to consolidate the offices of  [[Adjutant General]], [[Quartermaster General]], [[Armory (military)|Armory Board]], and Armory Board Inspector.<ref>per 1939 CGS Cum Suppl. sec. 215e. Military Dept. directs the Adjutant General.</ref>\n\n==Mission==\nThe Military Department of the State of Connecticut's principle public responsibility is to serve as the protector of American citizens of the State and their property in time of war, invasion, rebellion, riot or disaster. It serves as the main resource for the [[Governor of Connecticut|Governor]] in ensuring public safety in a variety of emergencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/mil/cwp/view.asp?a=1345&q=257166|title=CT Military Department Agency Information|publisher=CT Military Department|accessdate=24 December 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113230443/http://www.ct.gov/mil/cwp/view.asp?a=1345&q=257166|archivedate=13 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Connecticut National Guard as the state militia also has a Federal Constitutional mission to support the [[President of the United States]] as Commander-in-Chief of the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces of the United States]] and the [[United States Government|Federal Government]] in times of War or National Emergencies.\n\n==Components==\n\n===[[Connecticut National Guard]]===\nThe [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] specifically grants the U.S. Congress the power to \"raise armies.\" The U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force are armies raised under this provision. Additionally, the States, under the 2nd and 10th Amendments, have the right to raise their own armies, historically known as militias, today known as a State Defense Force (SDF). After the civil war, many states reduced funding for their militias and military training programs causing the threat of a reduction in war preparedness. As a result, Congress decided to raise a new federal army to be jointly administered by the states alongside the state defense forces: that army is known as the [[National Guard of the United States]]. Like the state militia/SDF, the National Guard is typically administered by the governors. Unlike the militia/SDF, the National Guard may be deployed abroad without the permission of the state governor, whereas the militia/SDF is under the exclusive authority of the states except in the rare event of invasion of the United States or domestic insurrection as specified in Article I Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe Federal mission assigned to the National Guard is: \"To provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war, National Emergency or as otherwise needed.\"\n\nThe state mission assigned to the National Guard is \"To provide trained and disciplined forces for domestic emergencies or as otherwise provided by state law.\"\n \nThe Connecticut National Guard bestows a number of decorations for services to or on behalf of the state.\n\nMajor General [[Francis J. Evon, Jr.]] is the current [[Connecticut Adjutant General]] (TAG).\n\n====Connecticut Army National Guard====\nThe Connecticut Army National Guard was originally formed in 1672. During the [[War of 1812]], the [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] state government refused to place the state militia under control of the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] national government, which resulted in friction, especially following British attacks on [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] and [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]].\n\nAfter the American Civil War came to an end in 1865, a segregated company was raised in the Fifth battalion of the Connecticut National Guard so that men of color in [[New Haven]] could serve their state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015483/1882-08-09/ed-1/seq-2/|title=Presentation: Company A, Fifth Battalion, Presented with a Life Size Portrait of Captain J.

Its primary components are the \n[[Connecticut Army National Guard]], the [[Connecticut Air National Guard]], and four companies of the state militia. The Military Department of the [[State of Connecticut]] traces its origins to May 11, 1637, when the \"General Courts\" (colonial assembly - legislature) established a military arm of the provincial government. In 1939, the State's Military Department. was established to consolidate the offices of  [[Adjutant General]], [[Quartermaster General]], [[Armory (military)|Armory Board]], and Armory Board Inspector.<ref>per 1939 CGS Cum Suppl. sec. 215e.

It serves as the main resource for the [[Governor of Connecticut|Governor]] in ensuring public safety in a variety of emergencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/mil/cwp/view.asp?a=1345&q=257166|title=CT Military Department Agency Information|publisher=CT Military Department|accessdate=24 December 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113230443/http://www.ct.gov/mil/cwp/view.asp?a=1345&q=257166|archivedate=13 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Connecticut National Guard as the state militia also has a Federal Constitutional mission to support the [[President of the United States]] as Commander-in-Chief of the [[United States Armed Forces|Armed Forces of the United States]] and the [[United States Government|Federal Government]] in times of War or National Emergencies.\n\n==Components==\n\n===[[Connecticut National Guard]]===\nThe [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] specifically grants the U.S. Congress the power to \"raise armies.\" The U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force are armies raised under this provision. Additionally, the States, under the 2nd and 10th Amendments, have the right to raise their own armies, historically known as militias, today known as a State Defense Force (SDF). After the civil war, many states reduced funding for their militias and military training programs causing the threat of a reduction in war preparedness. As a result, Congress decided to raise a new federal army to be jointly administered by the states alongside the state defense forces: that army is known as the [[National Guard of the United States]]. Like the state militia/SDF, the National Guard is typically administered by the governors. Unlike the militia/SDF, the National Guard may be deployed abroad without the permission of the state governor, whereas the militia/SDF is under the exclusive authority of the states except in the rare event of invasion of the United States or domestic insurrection as specified in Article I Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe Federal mission assigned to the National Guard is: \"To provide properly trained and equipped units for prompt mobilization for war, National Emergency or as otherwise needed.\"\n\nThe state mission assigned to the National Guard is \"To provide trained and disciplined forces for domestic emergencies or as otherwise provided by state law.\"\n \nThe Connecticut National Guard bestows a number of decorations for services to or on behalf of the state.\n\nMajor General [[Francis J. Evon, Jr.]] is the current [[Connecticut Adjutant General]] (TAG).\n\n====Connecticut Army National Guard====\nThe Connecticut Army National Guard was originally formed in 1672. During the [[War of 1812]], the [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] state government refused to place the state militia under control of the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] national government, which resulted in friction, especially following British attacks on [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] and [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]].\n\nAfter the American Civil War came to an end in 1865, a segregated company was raised in the Fifth battalion of the Connecticut National Guard so that men of color in [[New Haven]] could serve their state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015483/1882-08-09/ed-1/seq-2/|title=Presentation: Company A, Fifth Battalion, Presented with a Life Size Portrait of Captain J.

In 1937, the Bech government attempted to introduce the so-called ''[[Maulkuerfgesetz]]'' (\"Muzzle law\") which would have banned the party. The law was abandoned after failing to achieve popular support in a national referendum.\n\nFollowing the end of the [[Second World War]], the party, which won 11.1% in the legislative elections, joined the [[National Union Government (1945)|National Union Government]] (1945\u201347). Its first minister was [[Charles Marx]]. After Marx's death in a 1946 [[car accident]], he was replaced by [[Dominique Urbany]]. After the death of the leader of the [[Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party|LSAP]], the coalition collapsed. With the principle of an all-inclusive government gone, the KPL was excluded from the next government and never returned another member to the cabinet.\n\nIn 1964, the [[United States]] [[United States Department of State|State Department]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 500.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Benjamin |first=Roger W. |author2=Kautsky, John H. |date=March 1968 |title=Communism and Economic Development |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=110\u2013123 |jstor=1953329 |doi=10.2307/1953329}}</ref> In [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1964|legislative elections]] held in the same year, the party registered 10.4% of the vote, and won five of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]]' 56 seats. The party's representation in the Chamber peaked at the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1968|following election]], with six deputies, but fell, until the KPL lost its last remaining deputy in [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1994|1994]]. In the same year a minority opposing the Marxist-Leninist line of the party split and founded the [[New Left (Luxembourg)|New Left]] ({{lang-lb|Nei L\u00e9nk)}} together with the rest of the [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (Luxembourg)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]] ({{lang-lb|Revolution\u00e4r Sozialistesch Partei}}).   \n\nIn 1999, the KPL and the New Left agreed to found [[The Left (Luxembourg)|The Left]] ({{lang-lb|D\u00e9i L\u00e9nk}}). The Left had members of both parties and independents. Accordingly, KPL members ran on The Left lists in the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1999|1999]] and 2000 elections and no separate KPL lists existed. After disputes between a majority within the Left and leading KPL members shortly before the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 2004|2004 elections]] the party again ran separate lists. A number of the Left members were subsequently expelled from the KPL.\n\nThe KPL is represented locally on the councils of [[Differdange]] and [[Rumelange]].

This terminology has, in addition, been taken up in some universities in other English-speaking nations. The terms JCR, MCR, and SCR are used by [[Harvard University]], [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Toronto]].\n\nThese groups exist to represent their members in the organisation of college or [[halls of residence|residential hall]] life, to operate certain services within these institutions such as laundry or recreation, and to provide opportunities for socialising. There are variations based on institutional tradition and needs, but typically the following [[common room]]s will exist in a college or hall:\n* A junior common room (JCR) \u2013 for [[undergraduate]] junior members<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary of Cambridge jargon: C|url=http://www.quns.cam.ac.uk/Queens/Misc/jargon/CUjargon-C.html|accessdate=21 August 2012|author=R.D.H.

At the University of Cambridge, the term ''combination room'' (e.g., \"junior combination room\") is also used, with the same abbreviations. As a generalisation, JCRs are associations of [[undergraduate]]s and SCRs an association of [[tutor]]s and [[academic]]s associated with a college. [[Postgraduate]]s are sometimes given their own MCR, or placed in with either of the other groups.\n\n== Examples ==\nThe terms JCR, MCR and SCR originated from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. The terms are now used at ten British universities as well as [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in Ireland, [[Harvard College]] in the United States of America and at the [[University of Trinity College]] in the [[University of Toronto]], Canada. Due to the way that the terms have evolved over time and the [[idiosyncratic]] nature of university structure, the use of the three terms varies considerably from institution to institution. The main variations involve terminology, [[mature students]] and [[postgraduate education|postgraduate students]].\n\nIn addition to this, the terms may be used to refer to the elected groups that run the common rooms. Other names such as \"exec\" may exist for these.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n\n===Oxford===<!-- This section is linked from [[Oriel College]] -->\nAt the [[University of Oxford]], a typical college has a JCR for undergraduates, an MCR for graduates and an SCR<ref name=\"src-chch\" /> for its fellows. JCRs and MCRs have a committee, with a president and so on, that represent their students to college authorities, the [[Oxford University Student Union]] (OUSU), etc., in addition to being an actual room for the use of members. SCRs typically have a president, an academic member of the body who deals with higher-level administrative matters pertaining to the SCR, such as inviting proposed visiting fellows to the body and identifying invited lecturers to any particular college event. SCRs are typically characterised by a copious provision of coffee, newspapers, and moderately informal space for academics to think and discuss ideas.\n\n[[Wadham College]] is a notable exception: although it maintains an MCR, its entire student population is represented by a combined students' union (SU).\n\nThe JCR and MCR presidents of all affiliated Oxford common rooms, in addition to their OUSU reps, are automatically voting members of OUSU's governing council, which meets fortnightly during term to decide on virtually all aspects of OUSU's policy. the OUSU council meetings take place in odd-numbered weeks of the university term. JCR presidents also get together in even-numbered weeks for meetings of the presidents' committee (popularly known as ''prescom''). MCR presidents also get together up to three times a term for meetings of the MCR presidents' committee (popularly known as ''MCR-prescom'').\n\nAlternative names are sometimes used for college MCRs. [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]] has the \"Hulme Common Room\" (HCR), and [[University College, Oxford|University College]] has the \"Weir Common Room\", named in honour of college [[alumni]]. At [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's]] and [[Templeton College, Oxford|Templeton]] the representative bodies for postgraduate students are called \"graduate common rooms\" or \"GCRs\". At some graduate colleges such as [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson]], [[St. Cross College, Oxford|St. Cross]] and [[Linacre College, Oxford|Linacre College]], students and fellows share a single, egalitarian common room.\n\nIn addition, colleges sometimes have additional common rooms, such as the \"Summer Common Room\" at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], or the \"Alumni Common Room\" at [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]].<ref>https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/alumni/alumni-benefits/</ref> These are sometimes, but not always, associated with a particular section of the student or academic body.\n\n=== Cambridge ===\nAt the [[University of Cambridge]], most colleges have either common rooms or combination rooms, a tradition dating from the seventeenth century. The same abbreviations, JCR, MCR, and SCR are used for combination rooms. The JCR represents [[undergraduate]]s, with [[postgraduate student]]s being members of the middle combination room. In some colleges, postgraduates are members of both the MCR and JCR: for example, at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]], where the MCR is known as the [[Samuel Butler Room Society|Samuel Butler Room]] or at Peterhouse. Most colleges also have an SCR. At Pembroke College the common rooms are called \"parlours\", such as the Junior Parlour and Graduate Parlour. At [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], the JCR is known as \"The Jesus College Students' Union\", with its physical space being the Marshall Room.\n\nSimilarly, [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], has both a JCR, MCR, and SCR along with a Sidney Sussex College Students Union of which all students are members.\n\nJCRs and MCRs have elected committees to represent their interests within their colleges and in the central students' union.  The committees are almost universally led by a president and a range of other elected positions to cover specific areas or interest or functions (e.g. secretary, treasurer, entertainment). There is a great deal of variety between the colleges in terms of the roles that the JCRs and MCRs undertake, how much influence they have in college affairs and how many functions they provide. Nearly all are responsible for organising Freshers Week and frequent entertainments.\n\nJCR presidents and external officers in Cambridge are ''ex officio'' council members of the [[Cambridge University Students' Union]] (CUSU). Before the CUSU was established, individual JCRs were direct members of the NUS. This meant that [[Churchill College Junior Common Room|Churchill JCR]] was able to lead the NUS in its campaign for student representation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Unlike most universities, the CUSU serves the common rooms and common rooms may choose to disaffiliate. The CUSU is funded by the common rooms rather than funding them.\n\n=== Bristol ===\n[[Halls of residence|Halls]] of the [[University of Bristol]] cater mostly for first year undergraduate students, though there is a sizable undergraduate and postgraduate community who choose to stay on, either in the capacity as senior residents or ordinary residents. The term JCR refers to the entire undergraduate population, but more specifically and commonly to the elected committee of students who run the JCR for one academic year. Though most Bristol Hall JCRs are made up of first years, it is custom in [[Clifton Hill House]], [[Goldney Hall]], [[Wills Hall]] and Manor Hall to elect returning students to the majority of positions, including JCR president.\n\nThere is no MCR, but the SCR includes the warden, the vice/deputy warden, the senior residents and honourable guests at [[Formal Hall]].\n\nThe JCR refers also to a physical common room (for undergraduate students), with a separate and publicly inaccessible SCR room reserved elsewhere in the hall.\n\n=== Durham ===\n[[File:University College Durham Senior Common Room .jpg|thumb|University College Durham Senior Common Room]]\nAt [[Durham University|Durham]], the majority of the [[Colleges of Durham University|sixteen colleges]] divide their members into:\n* A JCR for [[undergraduate]] students\n* An MCR for [[postgraduate]] students\n* An SCR for [[academic]]s who are members of the college\n\nIn addition, there may be one or more rooms set aside for the use of these bodies referred to as \"the JCR\" or \"the MCR\" etc. The committees that run the JCR and MCR are called the \"executive committees\" or \"exec\". Membership of the JCR and MCR is not obligatory to students.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this. The [[College of St Hild and St Bede]] has a \"[[Students Representative Council]]\", which includes both undergraduates and [[postgraduate]]s at the college, with a special postgraduate committee. St.Aidan's College combines the MCR and SCR into one SCR whereby the postgraduates and senior members belong to one common room as a whole, while [[St Cuthbert's Society]] combines the JCR and MCR into one JCR. Following a referendum in 2011, students of [[St John's College, Durham|St. John's College]] are represented by the \"St. John's Common Room\" (SJCR) a composite body representing undergraduates, the MCR (postgraduates) and the Cranmer Common Room (representing the students of [[Cranmer Hall, Durham|Cranmer Hall]]) (pre-2011 the body was the joint junior common room JJCR). Ustinov College, which does not take undergraduates, has a graduate common room (GCR) for its students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ustinovgcrcharity.wordpress.com/|title=Graduate Common Room|publisher=Ustinov College Graduate Common Room|accessdate=17 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[Durham Students' Union]] is independent from the college common rooms, each college has a representative to the union.\n\n=== Exeter ===\nAt the [[University of Exeter]], a number of residential halls for first year undergraduates retain traditional common room structures. Lopes, Hope and Mardon halls are all home to extensive common room set ups, which form a central part of student life there. In such halls, committees are elected to represent the student body via the common room, and it is their job to liaise with the resident tutors who reside within the hall. Although somewhat under threat by mergers of Halls and changes to internal administration, the common rooms still play an active and important role within the university, by both providing welfare and recourse to higher authorities for the students, and by organising social events such as balls, formals and more casual activities.\n\n=== Kent ===\nAt [[University of Kent|Kent]] each of the colleges was initially built with one or more \"senior common room\" social spaces. However, over the passage of time a number of the common rooms have been transformed into eateries and more formalised social areas. Each college has a \"management committee\" (formerly \"junior college committee\" and before that, \"junior common room committee\") which acts to represent the students of each college at the students' union and organise cultural events.\n\nThe rooms and committees have traditionally been open to both undergraduates and postgraduates, with the senior common rooms provided for staff.\n\n=== Lancaster ===\nAt [[University of Lancaster|Lancaster]], undergraduates are members of one of eight colleges (with a further college for postgraduate students). Each undergraduate college is a quasi-autonomous body within the university, and each divides its members into junior and senior common rooms. These terms are more indicative of the collective student/staff bodies than actual space,  although each college has actual common rooms set aside for junior members. Senior members are less fortunate due to a current policy by the university's estates department of removing senior common room space from college control \u2013 refurbishing these as teaching rooms or putting them on the central booking system, so SCR members cannot just \"drop in\". The term \"JCR\", although intended to refer to all junior members of a college, is often used to refer to elected members of each college's JCR executive.  Each JCR executive organises a range of social and sporting activities for its college while also offering welfare support for its junior members. The president and vice president represent their college at the student union council and on a range of university committees, and many JCR executive members sit with SCR members on the college syndicate \u2013 the governing body of each college.\n\nWithin the graduate college, the graduate students' association (GSA) takes on the role of an \"MCR\". Lancaster has a students' union which co-ordinates activities between the different colleges, and the JCR and GSA executives are considered to be standing committees of the union council.\n\n=== Leicester ===\nAt [[University of Leicester|Leicester]]  the JCR is open to all members of the university, although its main focus is around the halls of residence of the university. The committee was responsible for running the various activities within the halls of residence and the represents students based at the halls. The term ''JCR'' also refers informally to the undergraduate population of the university as a whole . The committee of the JCR is main elected from its members within the halls of residence. The SCR for the university remains on its main campus. Membership of the common room is open to all full-time members of staff but not postgraduate students, although they may be entertained as guests of members in the bar. The common room itself and its activates are governed by a committee of elected academics and fellows.\n\n=== Nottingham ===\nAt [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]], the majority of the halls of residence predominantly house undergraduates, with a small number of postgraduates living in hall as part of the pastoral and disciplinary system; in this instance, the JCR refers to the undergraduate members of the hall. Postgraduates, along with a warden, comprise the SCR. The hall warden is a member of university staff, often an academic, that might reside either in a special residence within the hall, or in a nearby house.\n\nJCR activities include representation by elected students of their hallmates on accommodation issues, organised social events, and sports teams that compete in the [[University of Nottingham Students' Union|athletic union's]] inter-mural sports competitions. Since most students move out of halls after their first year, it is common for students to retain a sense of affiliation to their hall while living off-campus. Many JCRs include former residents of the hall in their sports teams.\n\nAll of the JCRs are now part of the [[University of Nottingham Students' Union|students' union]].\n\n[[Melton Hall]] houses only postgraduates, and the student organisation there forms the university's only MCR.\n\n=== Reading ===\n[[University of Reading]] JCRs are set up in a very similar way to their Oxford counterparts, as the University was founded as [[University College, Reading]], as part of [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. The JCRs at Reading are some of the oldest outside Oxbridge with some such as [[Wantage Hall|Wantage JCR]] founded in 1908, St Patrick's Hall JCR in 1913 and [[Wessex Hall|Wessex JCR]] later in 1915. Today there are thirteen JCRs operating independently of each other, although they do work with the students' union. JCRs represent all students in a particular hall as well as having a large number of attached members living in houses.\n\nEach year a new committee is elected in each halls.\n\nThe [[University of Reading]] Senior Common Room] began life in 1897 as the common room, but in 1908 a proposal was found to be necessary (and was carried) to have the title altered from staff common room to senior common room. The SCR functions as a \"staff social club\" of the university. The membership currently includes over 800 academic, administrative and technical staff within the various departments and offices from across the University. Postgraduates may become associated members.\n\n=== St Andrews ===\nAt the [[University of St Andrews]], each hall of residence has a common room for use by all the resident students. Each year, the residents of the hall elect a committee that is responsible for social events. A portion of the yearly residence fees are earmarked for use by the committee for such events. Each hall also has a warden, assisted by one or more subwardens, who is responsible for discipline in the hall (such as dealing with complaints of excessive noise), and who also acts as an advisor to the committee.\n\nThe hall common rooms may contain a television or hall library (some halls have dedicated rooms for these). The committee may also subscribe to newspapers and magazines, or buy books and DVDs, which are made available in the common room.\n\nIn addition [[St Mary's College, St Andrews|St Mary's College]] has a JCR for the use of undergraduates and an SCR for the use of staff.\n\nThe previous principal of St Andrews, [[Brian Lang]], was criticized and finally rebuked by the university court for requisitioning common rooms in certain halls for private parties, despite complaints by residents about noise and disruption to hall activities. His successor, [[Louise Richardson]], has indicated that she will not continue this or any similar practice.\n\n=== Southampton ===\nJCRs at the [[University of Southampton]] exist in each of the different halls of residences; Archers Road, Mayflower, Bencraft, Chamberlain, [[Connaught Hall, Southampton|Connaught Hall]], Erasmus Park (At Winchester School Of Art), [[Glen Eyre Halls|Glen Eyre]], Highfield halls and Montefiore. The JCRs provide a welfare and support role to new students, and coordinate social and sports activities around the halls. Yearly elections are held in December, with members serving one or two yearly terms. In 2009 JCRs became part of [[University of Southampton Students' Union|Southampton University Students' Union]] representative structure and operate under the JCR executive officer, with a budget of nearly \u00a392,000.\n\n=== York ===\nThe day-to-day running of the [[colleges of the University of York|colleges]] is managed by an elected committee of staff and student members chaired by the college's [[Provost (education)|provost]]. Colleges have a JCR for undergraduate students, which is managed by the elected JCR committee (JCRC), and a GCR for post-graduate students, as well as an SCR, which is managed by elected representatives of the college's academic and administrative members. The only exceptions to this are Wentworth which as a post-graduate only college does not have a JCR, and Halifax<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halifaxcollege.com/who-we-are/hcsa-committee/the-association/|title=Halifax College Students Association|publisher=[[Halifax College, York|Halifax Collenior Common Room (ge Students Association)]]|accessdate=26 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128012328/http://www.halifaxcollege.com/who-we-are/hcsa-committee/the-association/|archivedate=28 November 2013}}</ref> and Constantine<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constantinecollege.com/page/3/|title=Constantine College Referendum Results|publisher=[[Constantine College, York|Constantine College]]|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref> which are run by a student association that represents both undergraduates and postgraduates together. Langwith's JCR is branded as a \"student association\", however Langwith retains a GCR and an SCR and therefore its SA plays the same role as the JCRC in the other colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/colleges/langwith/about/whos-who/|title=Who's Who in Langwith|publisher=[[Langwith College, York|Langwith College]]|accessdate=26 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122024604/http://www.york.ac.uk/colleges/langwith/about/whos-who/|archivedate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe JCRs are run by a JCRC headed by an executive committee made up of a chair/president, vice chair/presidents, secretary, and treasurer who have signatory powers. Below the executive committee are the rest of the members of the committees who have responsibilities for welfare, activities, events and the general running of the committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yusu.org/colleges/elections|title=College Elections|publisher=[[University of York Students' Union|YUSU]]|accessdate=26 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114100617/http://www.yusu.org/colleges/elections|archive-date=14 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Annual elections are held in November with people coming forward to stand for the various positions. Each individual college's JCRC is slightly different in composition, however all are elected by the undergraduate population following a [[hustings]]. The successful candidates are then elected for a whole year, bar any extenuating circumstances e.g. a vote of no confidence. The JCRC's primary functions are to be representative of the specific needs of their undergraduate populations, and to provide welfare help to students in the form of welfare reps who can offer advice or give contact details of other groups to students through informal ''drop-in'' sessions. With York's collegiate system though, JCRCs are increasingly involved in fostering college spirit through organising the many major social events a college has, such as Christmas and summer formal balls.\n\n== United States ==\n\n=== Harvard ===\nAt [[Harvard College]], the term ''junior common room'' officially refers to the collection of undergraduates affiliated with one of Harvard's [[Harvard College#House system|12 houses]]. Every undergraduate is assigned to a house in the spring of his or her freshman year and thereafter is a member of that house's JCR, including students who have chosen to reside off campus.\n\nIn everyday usage, however, \"junior common room\" almost always refers to a large [[common room]] in an undergraduate house by the same name. JCRs are generally available for undergraduates to study or watch television, and student groups often reserve the space for meetings. This is in contrast to an SCR, which is for exclusive use of the houses' senior common room members, which includes the house masters, tutors, and other accomplished academics in the community.\n\n== Canada ==\n\n=== McGill University ===\nThe faculty of religious studies houses a JCR and SCR.  The JCR is a center for social activity among students, and the SCR is often used as a setting in films due to its luxurious setting.  The university residences also have areas which are designated as \"common rooms\".\n\n=== Memorial University of Newfoundland ===\nPaton College of Memorial University of Newfoundland has a JCR for undergraduates and all members of the university, and an SCR for use by academics.\n\n=== Lady Eaton College, Trent University ===\nLady Eaton College continues several [[Oxbridge]] traditions present at the founding of [[Trent University]] in 1964.  This includes a JCR for the use of students and an SCR for college fellows and staff.  It is the only college on the main campus that presently maintains both a JCR and SCR.\n\n=== St John's College, University of Manitoba ===\nSt John's College maintains an SCR for use by fellows and staff of the college. The Cross Common Room is a centre for social and academic events at the college and regularly hosts lectures, presentations, and other events for groups from the wider university.\n\n=== University of Toronto ===\nMost colleges at University of Toronto have a common room system. [[The University of Trinity College]], has maintained many of the traditions of [[Oxbridge]], including the wearing of academic gowns and several common rooms, including a JCR, divinity common room, and SCR, which are all communities within the college as well as physical rooms. All undergraduate students registered in the college are members of the JCR, which hosts a variety of lively social activities, as well as serving as a comfortable student lounge with newspapers from around the world. The divinity common room is available to students in Trinity's Faculty of Divinity, the oldest Anglican theological faculty in Canada. The SCR consists of college fellows with teaching appointments in the University of Toronto, teaching staff in the faculty of divinity, senior college administrators, postgraduate students who serve as academic dons, and divinity graduate students with fellowships. Other select members of the wider academic, social, and ecclesiastical community are also included. The SCR hosts a number of social and educational events and weekly high table dinners in Strachan Hall. The room, which overlooks the college quadrangle, is a faculty lounge hosting daily tea and weekly wine receptions. In [[University College, Toronto]], the JCR is a popular hangout for students.\n\n== Australia ==\n\n=== Newman College, University of Melbourne ===\nNewman College has two common rooms:\n\n* The JCR, for undergraduate students\n* The SCR, for graduates, postgraduates, tutors and staff\n\n=== Ormond College, University of Melbourne ===\nThe student population at [[Ormond College]] is split into four common rooms:\n\n* The JCR, for undergraduate students\n* The upper common room (UCR), for later year undergraduate students\n* The MCR, for graduate students\n* The SCR, for postgraduate students, tutors and staff\n\n=== Trinity College, University of Melbourne ===\nTrinity has three common rooms:\n\n* The JCR, for undergraduate students\n* The Cripps Middle Common Room, for graduate and postgraduate students\n* The SCR, for tutors and staff\n\n=== Women's College, University of Sydney ===\n[[The Women's College, University of Sydney]] has three common rooms:\n\n* An MCR \u2013 for all college members\n* A menzies common room'''  \u2013 for all college members\n* An SCR \u2013 for academics, postgraduates and invited senior undergraduate students\n\n=== St. Andrew's College, University of Sydney ===\nThe student population at [[St. Andrew's College, Sydney]] is organised around two common rooms, the JCR and the SCR.\n\n* The JCR is the community of undergraduate members of the college. The JCR is the centre of undergraduate life and reflects the history of student self-governance at St Andrew's.  Between 1896 and 1902, the undergraduate residents organised themselves into a fully representative body, the \"students' club\". By 1906, the students' club was in full operation with a formal constitution and a house committee elected annually. For well over a century, the house committee has been an independent advocate for student needs and the college, and still retains substantial organisational, budgetary and disciplinary responsibilities. For the first eighty-four years from 1876, the students' common room was housed in a large hall on the ground floor of the main building, now the reading room. At first, it also served as the dining hall, until the new [[John Sulman|Sulman]] Wing was added in 1893. When the college's third dining hall was built in a Jacobean style by the eminent architect, [[Ellice Nosworthy]], in 1960, it also contained new accommodation for the JCR.<ref name=\"Jack, R. I. 2013\">Jack, R. I., The Andrew's Book, 4th edition, Sydney: The Principal and Councillors of St Andrew's College, 2013.</ref> Facilities include a lounge, widescreen television, table tennis and pool tables, as well as a fully licensed bar.\n* The SCR is the egalitarian community of senior members of St Andrew's College, including academics, postgraduates and invited JCR members. Since 1960, the SCR has found a home in the former theological lecture hall in the Sulman Wing of the college. Its walls of honey-coloured Hawkesbury sandstone, leadlight windows and antique paintings give the room a distinguished air while its use as an informal shared space lends the SCR a homely feel. While there was no designated combination room for the SCR until 1950, resident scholars and senior members of the college had always gathered in each other's rooms after meals to fulfil the collegiate function of the common room. When [[George Arnold Wood]], the first [[Challis Professorship|Challis Professor of History]] at Sydney University was in residence in 1896, he and the college's principal,  Reverend John Kinross, would retire after dinner, either to the rooms of Kinross or Professor Wood, where they \"would smoke and discuss everything from predestination to tobacco\". Over the years, the SCR has had many distinguished members, including [[V. Gordon Childe]], [[Raymond Dart]], and [[H. V. Evatt]].<ref name=\"Jack, R. I. 2013\"/> Today, members of the SCR meet before formal dinners to socialise before ascending via a spiral staircase to Ellice Nosworthy's Jacobean Dining Hall. Following formal dinners, members descend to hear a learned paper or an occasional concert.\n\n=== St. Paul's College, University of Sydney ===\nThe student population at [[St. Paul's College, Sydney]] is split into two common rooms:\n\n* A JCR \u2013 for the junior undergraduate population\n* An SCR \u2013 for academics and postgraduates\n\n=== Jane Franklin Hall, University of Tasmania ===\n[[Jane Franklin Hall]] has three common rooms:\n\n* The Horton Junior Common Room \u2013 for undergraduate students\n* The Edwin Pitman Middle Common Room \u2013 for later year undergraduate students\n* The SCR \u2013 for postgraduate students, staff and fellows\n\n=== Christ College, University of Tasmania ===\n[[Christ College (University of Tasmania)|Christ College]] has two common rooms:\n\n* A JCR \u2013 for the general student population\n* An SCR \u2013 for study<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christcollegehobart.com/info-for-new-residents|title=Christ College Hobart|website=Christ College Hobart}}</ref>\n\n=== Trinity College, University of Western Australia ===\nTrinity has two common rooms:\n* The JCR, a smaller TV viewing room\n* The Jean Randall Common Room, a general meeting place for everyone in the cfollege.

This terminology has, in addition, been taken up in some universities in other English-speaking nations. The terms JCR, MCR, and SCR are used by [[Harvard University]], [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Toronto]].\n\nThese groups exist to represent their members in the organisation of college or [[halls of residence|residential hall]] life, to operate certain services within these institutions such as laundry or recreation, and to provide opportunities for socialising. There are variations based on institutional tradition and needs, but typically the following [[common room]]s will exist in a college or hall:\n* A junior common room (JCR) \u2013 for [[undergraduate]] junior members<ref>{{cite web|title=Glossary of Cambridge jargon: C|url=http://www.quns.cam.ac.uk/Queens/Misc/jargon/CUjargon-C.html|accessdate=21 August 2012|author=R.D.H.

At the University of Cambridge, the term ''combination room'' (e.g., \"junior combination room\") is also used, with the same abbreviations. As a generalisation, JCRs are associations of [[undergraduate]]s and SCRs an association of [[tutor]]s and [[academic]]s associated with a college. [[Postgraduate]]s are sometimes given their own MCR, or placed in with either of the other groups.\n\n== Examples ==\nThe terms JCR, MCR and SCR originated from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. The terms are now used at ten British universities as well as [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in Ireland, [[Harvard College]] in the United States of America and at the [[University of Trinity College]] in the [[University of Toronto]], Canada. Due to the way that the terms have evolved over time and the [[idiosyncratic]] nature of university structure, the use of the three terms varies considerably from institution to institution. The main variations involve terminology, [[mature students]] and [[postgraduate education|postgraduate students]].\n\nIn addition to this, the terms may be used to refer to the elected groups that run the common rooms. Other names such as \"exec\" may exist for these.\n\n== United Kingdom ==\n\n===Oxford===<!-- This section is linked from [[Oriel College]] -->\nAt the [[University of Oxford]], a typical college has a JCR for undergraduates, an MCR for graduates and an SCR<ref name=\"src-chch\" /> for its fellows. JCRs and MCRs have a committee, with a president and so on, that represent their students to college authorities, the [[Oxford University Student Union]] (OUSU), etc., in addition to being an actual room for the use of members. SCRs typically have a president, an academic member of the body who deals with higher-level administrative matters pertaining to the SCR, such as inviting proposed visiting fellows to the body and identifying invited lecturers to any particular college event. SCRs are typically characterised by a copious provision of coffee, newspapers, and moderately informal space for academics to think and discuss ideas.\n\n[[Wadham College]] is a notable exception: although it maintains an MCR, its entire student population is represented by a combined students' union (SU).\n\nThe JCR and MCR presidents of all affiliated Oxford common rooms, in addition to their OUSU reps, are automatically voting members of OUSU's governing council, which meets fortnightly during term to decide on virtually all aspects of OUSU's policy. the OUSU council meetings take place in odd-numbered weeks of the university term. JCR presidents also get together in even-numbered weeks for meetings of the presidents' committee (popularly known as ''prescom''). MCR presidents also get together up to three times a term for meetings of the MCR presidents' committee (popularly known as ''MCR-prescom'').\n\nAlternative names are sometimes used for college MCRs. [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]] has the \"Hulme Common Room\" (HCR), and [[University College, Oxford|University College]] has the \"Weir Common Room\", named in honour of college [[alumni]]. At [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's]] and [[Templeton College, Oxford|Templeton]] the representative bodies for postgraduate students are called \"graduate common rooms\" or \"GCRs\". At some graduate colleges such as [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson]], [[St. Cross College, Oxford|St. Cross]] and [[Linacre College, Oxford|Linacre College]], students and fellows share a single, egalitarian common room.\n\nIn addition, colleges sometimes have additional common rooms, such as the \"Summer Common Room\" at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], or the \"Alumni Common Room\" at [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]]<ref>https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/alumni/alumni-benefits/</ref>. These are sometimes, but not always, associated with a particular section of the student or academic body.\n\n=== Cambridge ===\nAt the [[University of Cambridge]], most colleges have either common rooms or combination rooms, a tradition dating from the seventeenth century. The same abbreviations, JCR, MCR, and SCR are used for combination rooms. The JCR represents [[undergraduate]]s, with [[postgraduate student]]s being members of the middle combination room. In some colleges, postgraduates are members of both the MCR and JCR: for example, at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]], where the MCR is known as the [[Samuel Butler Room Society|Samuel Butler Room]] or at Peterhouse. Most colleges also have an SCR. At Pembroke College the common rooms are called \"parlours\", such as the Junior Parlour and Graduate Parlour. At [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], the JCR is known as \"The Jesus College Students' Union\", with its physical space being the Marshall Room.\n\nSimilarly, [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], has both a JCR, MCR, and SCR along with a Sidney Sussex College Students Union of which all students are members.\n\nJCRs and MCRs have elected committees to represent their interests within their colleges and in the central students' union.  The committees are almost universally led by a president and a range of other elected positions to cover specific areas or interest or functions (e.g. secretary, treasurer, entertainment). There is a great deal of variety between the colleges in terms of the roles that the JCRs and MCRs undertake, how much influence they have in college affairs and how many functions they provide. Nearly all are responsible for organising Freshers Week and frequent entertainments.\n\nJCR presidents and external officers in Cambridge are ''ex officio'' council members of the [[Cambridge University Students' Union]] (CUSU). Before the CUSU was established, individual JCRs were direct members of the NUS. This meant that [[Churchill College Junior Common Room|Churchill JCR]] was able to lead the NUS in its campaign for student representation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Unlike most universities, the CUSU serves the common rooms and common rooms may choose to disaffiliate. The CUSU is funded by the common rooms rather than funding them.\n\n=== Bristol ===\n[[Halls of residence|Halls]] of the [[University of Bristol]] cater mostly for first year undergraduate students, though there is a sizable undergraduate and postgraduate community who choose to stay on, either in the capacity as senior residents or ordinary residents. The term JCR refers to the entire undergraduate population, but more specifically and commonly to the elected committee of students who run the JCR for one academic year. Though most Bristol Hall JCRs are made up of first years, it is custom in [[Clifton Hill House]], [[Goldney Hall]], [[Wills Hall]] and Manor Hall to elect returning students to the majority of positions, including JCR president.\n\nThere is no MCR, but the SCR includes the warden, the vice/deputy warden, the senior residents and honourable guests at [[Formal Hall]].\n\nThe JCR refers also to a physical common room (for undergraduate students), with a separate and publicly inaccessible SCR room reserved elsewhere in the hall.\n\n=== Durham ===\n[[File:University College Durham Senior Common Room .jpg|thumb|University College Durham Senior Common Room]]\nAt [[Durham University|Durham]], the majority of the [[Colleges of Durham University|sixteen colleges]] divide their members into:\n* A JCR for [[undergraduate]] students\n* An MCR for [[postgraduate]] students\n* An SCR for [[academic]]s who are members of the college\n\nIn addition, there may be one or more rooms set aside for the use of these bodies referred to as \"the JCR\" or \"the MCR\" etc. The committees that run the JCR and MCR are called the \"executive committees\" or \"exec\". Membership of the JCR and MCR is not obligatory to students.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this. The [[College of St Hild and St Bede]] has a \"[[Students Representative Council]]\", which includes both undergraduates and [[postgraduate]]s at the college, with a special postgraduate committee. St.Aidan's College combines the MCR and SCR into one SCR whereby the postgraduates and senior members belong to one common room as a whole, while [[St Cuthbert's Society]] combines the JCR and MCR into one JCR. Following a referendum in 2011, students of [[St John's College, Durham|St. John's College]] are represented by the \"St. John's Common Room\" (SJCR) a composite body representing undergraduates, the MCR (postgraduates) and the Cranmer Common Room (representing the students of [[Cranmer Hall, Durham|Cranmer Hall]]) (pre-2011 the body was the joint junior common room JJCR). Ustinov College, which does not take undergraduates, has a graduate common room (GCR) for its students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ustinovgcrcharity.wordpress.com/|title=Graduate Common Room|publisher=Ustinov College Graduate Common Room|accessdate=17 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[Durham Students' Union]] is independent from the college common rooms, each college has a representative to the union.\n\n=== Exeter ===\nAt the [[University of Exeter]], a number of residential halls for first year undergraduates retain traditional common room structures. Lopes, Hope and Mardon halls are all home to extensive common room set ups, which form a central part of student life there. In such halls, committees are elected to represent the student body via the common room, and it is their job to liaise with the resident tutors who reside within the hall. Although somewhat under threat by mergers of Halls and changes to internal administration, the common rooms still play an active and important role within the university, by both providing welfare and recourse to higher authorities for the students, and by organising social events such as balls, formals and more casual activities.\n\n=== Kent ===\nAt [[University of Kent|Kent]] each of the colleges was initially built with one or more \"senior common room\" social spaces. However, over the passage of time a number of the common rooms have been transformed into eateries and more formalised social areas. Each college has a \"management committee\" (formerly \"junior college committee\" and before that, \"junior common room committee\") which acts to represent the students of each college at the students' union and organise cultural events.\n\nThe rooms and committees have traditionally been open to both undergraduates and postgraduates, with the senior common rooms provided for staff.\n\n=== Lancaster ===\nAt [[University of Lancaster|Lancaster]], undergraduates are members of one of eight colleges (with a further college for postgraduate students). Each undergraduate college is a quasi-autonomous body within the university, and each divides its members into junior and senior common rooms. These terms are more indicative of the collective student/staff bodies than actual space,  although each college has actual common rooms set aside for junior members. Senior members are less fortunate due to a current policy by the university's estates department of removing senior common room space from college control \u2013 refurbishing these as teaching rooms or putting them on the central booking system, so SCR members cannot just \"drop in\". The term \"JCR\", although intended to refer to all junior members of a college, is often used to refer to elected members of each college's JCR executive.  Each JCR executive organises a range of social and sporting activities for its college while also offering welfare support for its junior members. The president and vice president represent their college at the student union council and on a range of university committees, and many JCR executive members sit with SCR members on the college syndicate \u2013 the governing body of each college.\n\nWithin the graduate college, the graduate students' association (GSA) takes on the role of an \"MCR\". Lancaster has a students' union which co-ordinates activities between the different colleges, and the JCR and GSA executives are considered to be standing committees of the union council.\n\n=== Leicester ===\nAt [[University of Leicester|Leicester]]  the JCR is open to all members of the university, although its main focus is around the halls of residence of the university. The committee was responsible for running the various activities within the halls of residence and the represents students based at the halls. The term ''JCR'' also refers informally to the undergraduate population of the university as a whole . The committee of the JCR is main elected from its members within the halls of residence. The SCR for the university remains on its main campus. Membership of the common room is open to all full-time members of staff but not postgraduate students, although they may be entertained as guests of members in the bar. The common room itself and its activates are governed by a committee of elected academics and fellows.\n\n=== Nottingham ===\nAt [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]], the majority of the halls of residence predominantly house undergraduates, with a small number of postgraduates living in hall as part of the pastoral and disciplinary system; in this instance, the JCR refers to the undergraduate members of the hall. Postgraduates, along with a warden, comprise the SCR. The hall warden is a member of university staff, often an academic, that might reside either in a special residence within the hall, or in a nearby house.\n\nJCR activities include representation by elected students of their hallmates on accommodation issues, organised social events, and sports teams that compete in the [[University of Nottingham Students' Union|athletic union's]] inter-mural sports competitions. Since most students move out of halls after their first year, it is common for students to retain a sense of affiliation to their hall while living off-campus. Many JCRs include former residents of the hall in their sports teams.\n\nAll of the JCRs are now part of the [[University of Nottingham Students' Union|students' union]].\n\n[[Melton Hall]] houses only postgraduates, and the student organisation there forms the university's only MCR.\n\n=== Reading ===\n[[University of Reading]] JCRs are set up in a very similar way to their Oxford counterparts, as the University was founded as [[University College, Reading]], as part of [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. The JCRs at Reading are some of the oldest outside Oxbridge with some such as [[Wantage Hall|Wantage JCR]] founded in 1908, St Patrick's Hall JCR in 1913 and [[Wessex Hall|Wessex JCR]] later in 1915. Today there are thirteen JCRs operating independently of each other, although they do work with the students' union. JCRs represent all students in a particular hall as well as having a large number of attached members living in houses.\n\nEach year a new committee is elected in each halls.\n\nThe [[University of Reading]] Senior Common Room] began life in 1897 as the common room, but in 1908 a proposal was found to be necessary (and was carried) to have the title altered from staff common room to senior common room. The SCR functions as a \"staff social club\" of the university. The membership currently includes over 800 academic, administrative and technical staff within the various departments and offices from across the University. Postgraduates may become associated members.\n\n=== St Andrews ===\nAt the [[University of St Andrews]], each hall of residence has a common room for use by all the resident students. Each year, the residents of the hall elect a committee that is responsible for social events. A portion of the yearly residence fees are earmarked for use by the committee for such events. Each hall also has a warden, assisted by one or more subwardens, who is responsible for discipline in the hall (such as dealing with complaints of excessive noise), and who also acts as an advisor to the committee.\n\nThe hall common rooms may contain a television or hall library (some halls have dedicated rooms for these). The committee may also subscribe to newspapers and magazines, or buy books and DVDs, which are made available in the common room.\n\nIn addition [[St Mary's College, St Andrews|St Mary's College]] has a JCR for the use of undergraduates and an SCR for the use of staff.\n\nThe previous principal of St Andrews, [[Brian Lang]], was criticized and finally rebuked by the university court for requisitioning common rooms in certain halls for private parties, despite complaints by residents about noise and disruption to hall activities. His successor, [[Louise Richardson]], has indicated that she will not continue this or any similar practice.\n\n=== Southampton ===\nJCRs at the [[University of Southampton]] exist in each of the different halls of residences; Archers Road, Mayflower, Bencraft, Chamberlain, [[Connaught Hall, Southampton|Connaught Hall]], Erasmus Park (At Winchester School Of Art), [[Glen Eyre Halls|Glen Eyre]], Highfield halls and Montefiore. The JCRs provide a welfare and support role to new students, and coordinate social and sports activities around the halls. Yearly elections are held in December, with members serving one or two yearly terms. In 2009 JCRs became part of [[University of Southampton Students' Union|Southampton University Students' Union]] representative structure and operate under the JCR executive officer, with a budget of nearly \u00a392,000.\n\n=== York ===\nThe day-to-day running of the [[colleges of the University of York|colleges]] is managed by an elected committee of staff and student members chaired by the college's [[Provost (education)|provost]]. Colleges have a JCR for undergraduate students, which is managed by the elected JCR committee (JCRC), and a GCR for post-graduate students, as well as an SCR, which is managed by elected representatives of the college's academic and administrative members. The only exceptions to this are Wentworth which as a post-graduate only college does not have a JCR, and Halifax<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halifaxcollege.com/who-we-are/hcsa-committee/the-association/|title=Halifax College Students Association|publisher=[[Halifax College, York|Halifax Collenior Common Room (ge Students Association)]]|accessdate=26 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128012328/http://www.halifaxcollege.com/who-we-are/hcsa-committee/the-association/|archivedate=28 November 2013}}</ref> and Constantine<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constantinecollege.com/page/3/|title=Constantine College Referendum Results|publisher=[[Constantine College, York|Constantine College]]|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref> which are run by a student association that represents both undergraduates and postgraduates together. Langwith's JCR is branded as a \"student association\", however Langwith retains a GCR and an SCR and therefore its SA plays the same role as the JCRC in the other colleges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/colleges/langwith/about/whos-who/|title=Who's Who in Langwith|publisher=[[Langwith College, York|Langwith College]]|accessdate=26 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122024604/http://www.york.ac.uk/colleges/langwith/about/whos-who/|archivedate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe JCRs are run by a JCRC headed by an executive committee made up of a chair/president, vice chair/presidents, secretary, and treasurer who have signatory powers. Below the executive committee are the rest of the members of the committees who have responsibilities for welfare, activities, events and the general running of the committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yusu.org/colleges/elections|title=College Elections|publisher=[[University of York Students' Union|YUSU]]|accessdate=26 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114100617/http://www.yusu.org/colleges/elections|archive-date=14 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Annual elections are held in November with people coming forward to stand for the various positions. Each individual college's JCRC is slightly different in composition, however all are elected by the undergraduate population following a [[hustings]]. The successful candidates are then elected for a whole year, bar any extenuating circumstances e.g. a vote of no confidence. The JCRC's primary functions are to be representative of the specific needs of their undergraduate populations, and to provide welfare help to students in the form of welfare reps who can offer advice or give contact details of other groups to students through informal ''drop-in'' sessions. With York's collegiate system though, JCRCs are increasingly involved in fostering college spirit through organising the many major social events a college has, such as Christmas and summer formal balls.\n\n== United States ==\n\n=== Harvard ===\nAt [[Harvard College]], the term ''junior common room'' officially refers to the collection of undergraduates affiliated with one of Harvard's [[Harvard College#House system|12 houses]]. Every undergraduate is assigned to a house in the spring of his or her freshman year and thereafter is a member of that house's JCR, including students who have chosen to reside off campus.\n\nIn everyday usage, however, \"junior common room\" almost always refers to a large [[common room]] in an undergraduate house by the same name. JCRs are generally available for undergraduates to study or watch television, and student groups often reserve the space for meetings. This is in contrast to an SCR, which is for exclusive use of the houses' senior common room members, which includes the house masters, tutors, and other accomplished academics in the community.\n\n== Canada ==\n\n=== McGill University ===\nThe faculty of religious studies houses a JCR and SCR.  The JCR is a center for social activity among students, and the SCR is often used as a setting in films due to its luxurious setting.  The university residences also have areas which are designated as \"common rooms\".\n\n=== Memorial University of Newfoundland ===\nPaton College of Memorial University of Newfoundland has a JCR for undergraduates and all members of the university, and an SCR for use by academics.\n\n=== Lady Eaton College, Trent University ===\nLady Eaton College continues several [[Oxbridge]] traditions present at the founding of [[Trent University]] in 1964.  This includes a JCR for the use of students and an SCR for college fellows and staff.  It is the only college on the main campus that presently maintains both a JCR and SCR.\n\n=== St John's College, University of Manitoba ===\nSt John's College maintains an SCR for use by fellows and staff of the college. The Cross Common Room is a centre for social and academic events at the college and regularly hosts lectures, presentations, and other events for groups from the wider university.\n\n=== University of Toronto ===\nMost colleges at University of Toronto have a common room system. [[The University of Trinity College]], has maintained many of the traditions of [[Oxbridge]], including the wearing of academic gowns and several common rooms, including a JCR, divinity common room, and SCR, which are all communities within the college as well as physical rooms. All undergraduate students registered in the college are members of the JCR, which hosts a variety of lively social activities, as well as serving as a comfortable student lounge with newspapers from around the world. The divinity common room is available to students in Trinity's Faculty of Divinity, the oldest Anglican theological faculty in Canada. The SCR consists of college fellows with teaching appointments in the University of Toronto, teaching staff in the faculty of divinity, senior college administrators, postgraduate students who serve as academic dons, and divinity graduate students with fellowships. Other select members of the wider academic, social, and ecclesiastical community are also included. The SCR hosts a number of social and educational events and weekly high table dinners in Strachan Hall. The room, which overlooks the college quadrangle, is a faculty lounge hosting daily tea and weekly wine receptions. In [[University College, Toronto]], the JCR is a popular hangout for students.\n\n== Australia ==\n\n=== Newman College, University of Melbourne ===\nNewman College has two common rooms:\n\n* The JCR, for undergraduate students\n* The SCR, for graduates, postgraduates, tutors and staff\n\n=== Ormond College, University of Melbourne ===\nThe student population at [[Ormond College]] is split into four common rooms:\n\n* The JCR, for undergraduate students\n* The upper common room (UCR), for later year undergraduate students\n* The MCR, for graduate students\n* The SCR, for postgraduate students, tutors and staff\n\n=== Trinity College, University of Melbourne ===\nTrinity has three common rooms:\n\n* The JCR, for undergraduate students\n* The Cripps Middle Common Room, for graduate and postgraduate students\n* The SCR, for tutors and staff\n\n=== Women's College, University of Sydney ===\n[[The Women's College, University of Sydney]] has three common rooms:\n\n* An MCR \u2013 for all college members\n* A menzies common room'''  \u2013 for all college members\n* An SCR \u2013 for academics, postgraduates and invited senior undergraduate students\n\n=== St. Andrew's College, University of Sydney ===\nThe student population at [[St. Andrew's College, Sydney]] is organised around two common rooms, the JCR and the SCR.\n\n* The JCR is the community of undergraduate members of the college. The JCR is the centre of undergraduate life and reflects the history of student self-governance at St Andrew's.  Between 1896 and 1902, the undergraduate residents organised themselves into a fully representative body, the \"students' club\". By 1906, the students' club was in full operation with a formal constitution and a house committee elected annually. For well over a century, the house committee has been an independent advocate for student needs and the college, and still retains substantial organisational, budgetary and disciplinary responsibilities. For the first eighty-four years from 1876, the students' common room was housed in a large hall on the ground floor of the main building, now the reading room. At first, it also served as the dining hall, until the new [[John Sulman|Sulman]] Wing was added in 1893. When the college's third dining hall was built in a Jacobean style by the eminent architect, [[Ellice Nosworthy]], in 1960, it also contained new accommodation for the JCR.<ref name=\"Jack, R. I. 2013\">Jack, R. I., The Andrew's Book, 4th edition, Sydney: The Principal and Councillors of St Andrew's College, 2013.</ref> Facilities include a lounge, widescreen television, table tennis and pool tables, as well as a fully licensed bar.\n* The SCR is the egalitarian community of senior members of St Andrew's College, including academics, postgraduates and invited JCR members. Since 1960, the SCR has found a home in the former theological lecture hall in the Sulman Wing of the college. Its walls of honey-coloured Hawkesbury sandstone, leadlight windows and antique paintings give the room a distinguished air while its use as an informal shared space lends the SCR a homely feel. While there was no designated combination room for the SCR until 1950, resident scholars and senior members of the college had always gathered in each other's rooms after meals to fulfil the collegiate function of the common room. When [[George Arnold Wood]], the first [[Challis Professorship|Challis Professor of History]] at Sydney University was in residence in 1896, he and the college's principal,  Reverend John Kinross, would retire after dinner, either to the rooms of Kinross or Professor Wood, where they \"would smoke and discuss everything from predestination to tobacco\". Over the years, the SCR has had many distinguished members, including [[V. Gordon Childe]], [[Raymond Dart]], and [[H. V. Evatt]].<ref name=\"Jack, R. I. 2013\"/> Today, members of the SCR meet before formal dinners to socialise before ascending via a spiral staircase to Ellice Nosworthy's Jacobean Dining Hall. Following formal dinners, members descend to hear a learned paper or an occasional concert.\n\n=== St. Paul's College, University of Sydney ===\nThe student population at [[St. Paul's College, Sydney]] is split into two common rooms:\n\n* A JCR \u2013 for the junior undergraduate population\n* An SCR \u2013 for academics and postgraduates\n\n=== Jane Franklin Hall, University of Tasmania ===\n[[Jane Franklin Hall]] has three common rooms:\n\n* The Horton Junior Common Room \u2013 for undergraduate students\n* The Edwin Pitman Middle Common Room \u2013 for later year undergraduate students\n* The SCR \u2013 for postgraduate students, staff and fellows\n\n=== Christ College, University of Tasmania ===\n[[Christ College (University of Tasmania)|Christ College]] has two common rooms:\n\n* A JCR \u2013 for the general student population\n* An SCR \u2013 for study<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christcollegehobart.com/info-for-new-residents|title=Christ College Hobart|website=Christ College Hobart}}</ref>\n\n=== Trinity College, University of Western Australia ===\nTrinity has two common rooms:\n* The JCR, a smaller TV viewing room\n* The Jean Randall Common Room, a general meeting place for everyone in the cfollege.

Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeically]] for its simple ''chiff-chaff'' song. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are now treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground, and assumes most of the responsibility for brooding and feeding the chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends [[territory (animal)|his territory]] against rivals, and attacks potential predators.\n\nA small [[insectivore|insectivorous bird]], it is subject to predation by mammals, such as cats and [[mustelidae|mustelids]], and birds, particularly hawks of the genus ''[[Accipiter]]''.

The male weighs 7\u20138&nbsp;grammes (0.28\u20130.31&nbsp;oz), and the female 6\u20137&nbsp;grammes (0.25\u20130.28&nbsp;oz). The spring adult of the western [[Subspecies#Nomenclature|nominate subspecies]] '' P. c. collybita'' has brown-washed dull green upperparts, off-white underparts becoming yellowish on the flanks, and a short whitish [[supercilium]]. It has dark legs, a fine dark bill, and short [[Flight feather#Primary extension|primary projection]] (extension of the [[flight feather]]s beyond the folded wing). As the plumage wears, it gets duller and browner, and the yellow on the flanks tends to be lost, but after the breeding season there is a prolonged complete [[moulting|moult]] before migration.<ref name= chiffchaff/> The newly fledged juvenile is browner above than the adult, with yellow-white underparts, but moults about 10 weeks after acquiring its first plumage. After moulting, both the adult and the juvenile have brighter and greener upperparts and a paler supercilium.<ref name= chiffchaff/> \n[[File:Common Chiffchaff.jpg|thumb|left|Common chiffchaff]]\n[[File:Phylloscopus collybita.jpg|Nominate subspecies <br />''P. c. collybita''|thumb]]\n\nThis warbler gets its name from its simple distinctive song, a repetitive cheerful ''{{not a typo|chiff-chaff}}''. This song is one of the first [[bird|avian]] signs that spring has returned. Its call is a ''{{not a typo|hweet}}'', less [[syllable|disyllabic]] than the ''{{not a typo|hooeet}}'' of the willow warbler or ''{{not a typo|hu-it}}'' of the [[western Bonelli's warbler]].<ref name= Collins>Mullarney, Killian; Svensson, Lars, Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter. (1999). ''Birds of Europe.'' London. HarperCollins. pp. 304\u2013306 {{ISBN|0-00-219728-6}}</ref>\n\nThe song differs from that of the Iberian chiffchaff, which has a shorter ''{{not a typo|djup djup djup wheep wheep chittichittichiittichitta}}''. However, mixed singers occur in the hybridisation zone and elsewhere, and can be difficult to allocate to species.<ref name = BB101/>\n\nWhen not singing, the common chiffchaff can be difficult to distinguish from other leaf warblers with greenish upperparts and whitish underparts, particularly the willow warbler. However, that species has a longer primary projection, a sleeker, brighter appearance and generally pale legs. Bonelli's warbler (''P. bonelli)'' might be confused with the common chiffchaff subspecies ''tristis'', but it has a plain face and green in the wings.<ref name= chiffchaff/> The common chiffchaff also has rounded wings in flight, and a diagnostic tail movement consisting of a dip, then sidewards wag, that distinguishes it from other ''Phylloscopus'' warblers<ref name= BWP/> and gives rise to the name \"tailwagger\" in India.<ref name=Simms/>\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge is distinguishing non-singing birds of the nominate subspecies from Iberian chiffchaff in the field. In [[Great Britain]] and the [[Netherlands]], all accepted records of vagrant Iberian chiffchaffs relate to singing males.<ref name = BB101/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe common chiffchaff breeds across Europe and Asia east to eastern [[Siberia]] and north to about 70\u00b0N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western [[Turkey]] and northwestern [[Iran]].<ref name= chiffchaff/> It is migratory, but it is one of the first [[passerine]] birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn.<ref name = Collins/><ref name =BWP/> When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5&nbsp;metres (16&nbsp;ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, [[bracken]], nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the [[willow warbler]] (''P. trochilus'') prefers younger trees, while the [[wood warbler]] (''P. sibilatrix'') prefers less undergrowth.<ref name= chiffchaff>{{cite book | last = Clement| first = Peter|title = The Chiffchaff| year = 1995 | publisher = Hamlyn| location = London|isbn = 978-0-600-57978-6}}</ref> In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern [[England]] and the mild urban [[microclimate]] of [[London]].<ref name= chiffchaff/> These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies ''abietinus'' and ''tristis'', so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.<ref name =BWP/>\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Territory===\n[[File:Siberian Chiffchaff I IMG 9454.jpg|thumb| upright| Siberian chiffchaff near [[Hodal]], India]]\nThe male common chiffchaff is highly territorial during the breeding season, with a core territory typically 20&nbsp;metres (66&nbsp;ft) across, which is fiercely defended against other males. Other small birds may also be attacked. The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the [[stoat]] if they approach the nest, as well as egg-thieves like the [[Eurasian jay]].<ref name=chiffchaff/> His song, given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears to be used to advertise an established territory and contact the female, rather than as a paternity guard strategy.<ref name= Rodrigues >{{cite journal|last= Rodrigues |first= Marcos |date=March 1996 |title= Song activity in the chiffchaff: territorial defence or mate guarding? |journal=  Animal Behaviour|volume= 51|issue= 3|pages= 709\u2013716 |doi= 10.1006/anbe.1996.0074|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0c6b6360219451be2359a78eb171700bea916139 }}</ref>\n\nBeyond the core territory, there is a larger feeding range which is variable in size, but typically ten or more times the area of the breeding territory. It is believed that the female has a larger feeding range than the male.<ref name=chiffchaff/> After breeding has finished, this species abandons its territory, and may join small flocks including other warblers prior to migration.<ref name=BWP/>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Phylloscopus collybita MWNH 2266.JPG|thumb|Eggs, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden, Germany]]]]\nThe male common chiffchaff returns to its breeding territory two or three weeks before the female and immediately starts singing to establish ownership and attract a female. When a female is located, the male will use a slow butterfly-like flight as part of the courtship ritual, but once a pair-bond has been established, other females will be driven from the territory. The male has little involvement in the nesting process other than defending the territory.<ref name=chiffchaff/> The female's nest is built on or near the ground in a concealed site in brambles, nettles or other dense low vegetation. The domed nest has a side entrance, and is constructed from coarse plant material such as dead leaves and grass, with finer material used on the interior before the addition of a lining of feathers.  The typical nest is 12.5&nbsp;centimetres (5&nbsp;in) high and 11&nbsp;centimetres (4&nbsp;in) across.<ref name=chiffchaff/>\n\nThe clutch is two to seven (normally five or six) cream-coloured eggs which have tiny ruddy, purple or blackish spots and are about 1.5&nbsp;centimetres (0.6&nbsp;in) long and 1.2&nbsp;centimetres (0.5&nbsp;in) across. They are incubated by the female for 13\u201314 days before hatching as naked, blind [[altricial]] chicks.<ref name=chiffchaff/> The female broods and feeds the chicks for another 14\u201315 days until they fledge. The male rarely participates in feeding, although this sometimes occurs, especially when bad weather limits insect supplies or if the female disappears. After fledging, the young stay in the vicinity of the nest for three to four weeks, and are fed by and roost with the female, although these interactions reduce after approximately the first 14 days. In the north of the range there is only time to raise one brood, due to the short summer, but a second brood is common in central and southern areas.<ref name=chiffchaff/>\n\nAlthough pairs stay together during the breeding season and [[polygamy]] is uncommon, even if the male and female return to the same site in the following year there is no apparent recognition or fidelity. Interbreeding with other species, other than those formerly considered as subspecies of ''P. collybita'',  is rare, but a few examples are known of hybridisation with the willow warbler. Such hybrids give mixed songs, but the latter alone is not proof of interspecific breeding.<ref name=chiffchaff/>\n\n===Feeding===\nLike most Old World warblers, this small species is [[insectivore|insectivorous]], moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been recorded as taking [[insect]]s, mainly [[fly|flies]], from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. It will take the eggs and [[larva]]e of [[lepidoptera|butterflies and moths]], particularly those of the [[winter moth]].<ref name=chiffchaff/> The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat as fuel for the long migration flight.<ref name=chiffchaff/>\n\n==Predators and threats==\nAs with most small birds, mortality in the first year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by [[stoat]]s, [[weasel]]s and crows such as the [[European magpie]], and the adults are hunted by [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], particularly the [[Accipitridae|sparrowhawk]]. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.<ref name =chiffchaff/>\n\nThe common chiffchaff is occasionally a host of [[brood parasite|brood parasitic]] [[cuckoo]]s, including the [[common cuckoo|common]] and [[Horsfield's cuckoo]]s,<ref name= Johnsgard >{{cite book | last = Johnsgard| first = Paul A. |title = The Avian Brood Parasites: Deception at the Nest | year = 1997 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-511042-5 |page =196}}</ref> but it recognises and rejects [[mimicry|non-mimetic]] eggs and is therefore only rarely successfully brood-parasitised.<ref name= Moksne>{{cite journal|last= Moksnes |first= Arne |author2=Roskaft, Eivin |date=January\u2013March 1992|title= Responses of Some Rare Cuckoo Hosts to Mimetic Model Cuckoo Eggs and to Foreign Conspecific Eggs |journal= Ornis Scandinavica |volume= 23|issue= 1|pages= 17\u201323| doi=10.2307/3676422|jstor= 3676422}}</ref> Like other passerine birds, the common chiffchaff can also acquire intestinal [[nematode]] parasites and external ticks.<ref name = Cork>{{cite web|title= Cork, Susan C, Grant Report - SEPG 1695  |work= The prevalence of nematode parasites in transcontinental songbirds|url= http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/articles/grants/reports/1695/|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071121050746/http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/articles/grants/reports/1695/|archivedate= 2007-11-21|publisher= British Ecological Society |accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref><ref name= Jaenson >{{cite journal|last= Jaenson|author2=Jensen, Jens-Kjeld |date=May 2007 |title=  Records of ticks (Acari, Ixodidae) from the Faroe Islands |url = http://www.entomologi.no/journals/nje/2007-1/abs/NJE-54-jaenson.pdf |journal= Norwegian Journal of Entomology.|volume= 54|issue= |pages=11\u201315|first= Thomas G.T.}}</ref>\n\nThe main effect of humans on this species is indirect, through woodland clearance which affects the habitat, predation by cats, and collisions with windows, buildings and cars. Only the first of these has the potential to seriously affect populations, but given the huge geographical spread of ''P. c. abietinus'' and ''P. c. tristis'', and woodland conservation policies in the range of ''P. c. collybita'', the chiffchaff's future seems assured.<ref name =chiffchaff/>\n\n==Status==\nThe common chiffchaff has an enormous range, with an estimated global extent of 10&nbsp;million&nbsp;square kilometres (3.8&nbsp;million square miles) and a population of 60\u2013120 million individuals in Europe alone. Although global population trends have not been quantified, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the [[IUCN Red List]] (that is, declining more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as \"least concern\".<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNone of the major subspecies is under threat, but ''exsul'', as noted above, is probably extinct.

Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeically]] for its simple ''chiff-chaff'' song. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are now treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground, and assumes most of the responsibility for brooding and feeding the chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends [[territory (animal)|his territory]] against rivals, and attacks potential predators.\n\nA small [[insectivore|insectivorous bird]], it is subject to predation by mammals, such as cats and [[mustelidae|mustelids]], and birds, particularly hawks of the genus ''[[Accipiter]]''. Its large range and population mean that its status is secure, although one subspecies is probably extinct.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[Great Britain|British]] naturalist [[Gilbert White]] was one of the first people to separate the similar-looking common chiffchaff, [[willow warbler]] and [[wood warbler]] by their songs, as detailed in 1789 in ''[[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'',<ref name= white>{{cite book | last = White | first = Gilbert |title = The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne | year =  1887 |origyear=1789 |location=London | publisher =Cassell & Company| oclc=3423785 |pages=38\u201339 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20933/20933-h/20933-h.htm | isbn = 978-0-905418-96-4}}</ref> but the common chiffchaff was first formally described as ''Sylvia collybita'' by [[France|French]] [[ornithology|ornithologist]] [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot|Louis Vieillot]] in 1817 in his ''Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle''.<ref name= viellot>{{in lang|fr}} Vieillot, Louis Jean Pierre (1817): ''Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle'' nouvelle \u00e9dition, 11, 235.</ref>\n\nDescribed by German zoologist [[Friedrich Boie]] in 1826, the genus ''Phylloscopus'' contains about 50 species of small insectivorous Old World woodland warblers which are either greenish or brown above and yellowish, white or buff below.

The male weighs 7\u20138&nbsp;grammes (0.28\u20130.31&nbsp;oz), and the female 6\u20137&nbsp;grammes (0.25\u20130.28&nbsp;oz). The spring adult of the western [[Subspecies#Nomenclature|nominate subspecies]] '' P. c. collybita'' has brown-washed dull green upperparts, off-white underparts becoming yellowish on the flanks, and a short whitish [[supercilium]]. It has dark legs, a fine dark bill, and short [[Flight feather#Primary extension|primary projection]] (extension of the [[flight feather]]s beyond the folded wing). As the plumage wears, it gets duller and browner, and the yellow on the flanks tends to be lost, but after the breeding season there is a prolonged complete [[moulting|moult]] before migration.<ref name= chiffchaff/> The newly fledged juvenile is browner above than the adult, with yellow-white underparts, but moults about 10 weeks after acquiring its first plumage. After moulting, both the adult and the juvenile have brighter and greener upperparts and a paler supercilium.<ref name= chiffchaff/> \n[[File:Common Chiffchaff.jpg|thumb|left|Common chiffchaff]]\n[[File:Phylloscopus collybita.jpg|Nominate subspecies <br />''P. c. collybita''|thumb]]\n\nThis warbler gets its name from its simple distinctive song, a repetitive cheerful ''{{not a typo|chiff-chaff}}''. This song is one of the first [[bird|avian]] signs that spring has returned. Its call is a ''{{not a typo|hweet}}'', less [[syllable|disyllabic]] than the ''{{not a typo|hooeet}}'' of the willow warbler or ''{{not a typo|hu-it}}'' of the [[western Bonelli's warbler]].<ref name= Collins>Mullarney, Killian; Svensson, Lars, Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter. (1999). ''Birds of Europe.'' London. HarperCollins. pp. 304\u2013306 {{ISBN|0-00-219728-6}}</ref>\n\nThe song differs from that of the Iberian chiffchaff, which has a shorter ''{{not a typo|djup djup djup wheep wheep chittichittichiittichitta}}''. However, mixed singers occur in the hybridisation zone and elsewhere, and can be difficult to allocate to species.<ref name = BB101/>\n\nWhen not singing, the common chiffchaff can be difficult to distinguish from other leaf warblers with greenish upperparts and whitish underparts, particularly the willow warbler. However, that species has a longer primary projection, a sleeker, brighter appearance and generally pale legs. Bonelli's warbler (''P. bonelli)'' might be confused with the common chiffchaff subspecies ''tristis'', but it has a plain face and green in the wings.<ref name= chiffchaff/> The common chiffchaff also has rounded wings in flight, and a diagnostic tail movement consisting of a dip, then sidewards wag, that distinguishes it from other ''Phylloscopus'' warblers<ref name= BWP/> and gives rise to the name \"tailwagger\" in India.<ref name=Simms/>\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge is distinguishing non-singing birds of the nominate subspecies from Iberian chiffchaff in the field. In [[Great Britain]] and the [[Netherlands]], all accepted records of vagrant Iberian chiffchaffs relate to singing males.<ref name = BB101/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe common chiffchaff breeds across Europe and Asia east to eastern [[Siberia]] and north to about 70\u00b0N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western [[Turkey]] and northwestern [[Iran]].<ref name= chiffchaff/> It is migratory, but it is one of the first [[passerine]] birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn.<ref name = Collins/><ref name =BWP/> When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5&nbsp;metres (16&nbsp;ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, [[bracken]], nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the [[willow warbler]] (''P. trochilus'') prefers younger trees, while the [[wood warbler]] (''P. sibilatrix'') prefers less undergrowth.<ref name= chiffchaff>{{cite book | last = Clement| first = Peter|title = The Chiffchaff| year = 1995 | publisher = Hamlyn| location = London|isbn = 978-0-600-57978-6}}</ref> In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern [[England]] and the mild urban [[microclimate]] of [[London]].<ref name= chiffchaff/> These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies ''abietinus'' and ''tristis'', so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.<ref name =BWP/>\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Territory===\n[[File:Siberian Chiffchaff I IMG 9454.jpg|thumb| upright| Siberian chiffchaff near [[Hodal]], India]]\nThe male common chiffchaff is highly territorial during the breeding season, with a core territory typically 20&nbsp;metres (66&nbsp;ft) across, which is fiercely defended against other males. Other small birds may also be attacked. The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the [[stoat]] if they approach the nest, as well as egg-thieves like the [[Eurasian jay]].<ref name=chiffchaff/> His song, given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears to be used to advertise an established territory and contact the female, rather than as a paternity guard strategy.<ref name= Rodrigues >{{cite journal|last= Rodrigues |first= Marcos |date=March 1996 |title= Song activity in the chiffchaff: territorial defence or mate guarding? |journal=  Animal Behaviour|volume= 51|issue= 3|pages= 709\u2013716 |doi= 10.1006/anbe.1996.0074|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0c6b6360219451be2359a78eb171700bea916139 }}</ref>\n\nBeyond the core territory, there is a larger feeding range which is variable in size, but typically ten or more times the area of the breeding territory. It is believed that the female has a larger feeding range than the male.<ref name=chiffchaff/> After breeding has finished, this species abandons its territory, and may join small flocks including other warblers prior to migration.<ref name=BWP/>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Phylloscopus collybita MWNH 2266.JPG|thumb|Eggs, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden, Germany]]]]\nThe male common chiffchaff returns to its breeding territory two or three weeks before the female and immediately starts singing to establish ownership and attract a female. When a female is located, the male will use a slow butterfly-like flight as part of the courtship ritual, but once a pair-bond has been established, other females will be driven from the territory. The male has little involvement in the nesting process other than defending the territory.<ref name=chiffchaff/> The female's nest is built on or near the ground in a concealed site in brambles, nettles or other dense low vegetation. The domed nest has a side entrance, and is constructed from coarse plant material such as dead leaves and grass, with finer material used on the interior before the addition of a lining of feathers.  The typical nest is 12.5&nbsp;centimetres (5&nbsp;in) high and 11&nbsp;centimetres (4&nbsp;in) across.<ref name=chiffchaff/>\n\nThe clutch is two to seven (normally five or six) cream-coloured eggs which have tiny ruddy, purple or blackish spots and are about 1.5&nbsp;centimetres (0.6&nbsp;in) long and 1.2&nbsp;centimetres (0.5&nbsp;in) across. They are incubated by the female for 13\u201314 days before hatching as naked, blind [[altricial]] chicks.<ref name=chiffchaff/> The female broods and feeds the chicks for another 14\u201315 days until they fledge. The male rarely participates in feeding, although this sometimes occurs, especially when bad weather limits insect supplies or if the female disappears. After fledging, the young stay in the vicinity of the nest for three to four weeks, and are fed by and roost with the female, although these interactions reduce after approximately the first 14 days. In the north of the range there is only time to raise one brood, due to the short summer, but a second brood is common in central and southern areas.<ref name=chiffchaff/>\n\nAlthough pairs stay together during the breeding season and [[polygamy]] is uncommon, even if the male and female return to the same site in the following year there is no apparent recognition or fidelity. Interbreeding with other species, other than those formerly considered as subspecies of ''P. collybita'',  is rare, but a few examples are known of hybridisation with the willow warbler. Such hybrids give mixed songs, but the latter alone is not proof of interspecific breeding.<ref name=chiffchaff/>\n\n===Feeding===\nLike most Old World warblers, this small species is [[insectivore|insectivorous]], moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been recorded as taking [[insect]]s, mainly [[fly|flies]], from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates.

Only the first of these has the potential to seriously affect populations, but given the huge geographical spread of ''P. c. abietinus'' and ''P. c. tristis'', and woodland conservation policies in the range of ''P. c. collybita'', the chiffchaff's future seems assured.<ref name =chiffchaff/>\n\n==Status==\nThe common chiffchaff has an enormous range, with an estimated global extent of 10&nbsp;million&nbsp;square kilometres (3.8&nbsp;million square miles) and a population of 60\u2013120 million individuals in Europe alone. Although global population trends have not been quantified, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the [[IUCN Red List]] (that is, declining more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as \"least concern\".<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNone of the major subspecies is under threat, but ''exsul'', as noted above, is probably extinct.

It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'' since September 8, 2016, with the chapters collected into 17 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of January 8, 2020. The story takes place in a world of modern, civilized, [[anthropomorphic]] animals with a cultural divide between the [[carnivore]]s and [[herbivore]]s. The series takes its name from the in-universe rank of Beastar, an individual of great talent, service and notoriety.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Orange (animation studio)|Orange]] aired from October 8 to December 26, 2019 on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[+Ultra]] programming block. A second season is scheduled for release in 2021. ''Beastars'' has won multiple awards, including being the first [[Akita Shoten]] title to take home the [[Manga Taish\u014d]] Award. The manga is licensed for English release in North America by [[Viz Media]], while the anime is licensed by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nLegoshi, a large gray [[wolf]], is a timid and quiet student of Cherryton Academy where he lives in a dorm with several other carnivorous students including his outgoing [[Labrador Retriever|Labrador]] friend, Jack. As a member of the school's drama club, Legoshi works as a stagehand and supports the actors of the club headed by the star pupil Louis, a [[red deer]]. \n\nOut of nowhere, Tem the [[alpaca]] is brutally murdered and devoured in the night, setting off a wave of unease and distrust between the herbivore and carnivore students. At the same time, Legoshi has a fateful encounter with Haru, a small [[dwarf rabbit]], and begins developing complex feelings for her.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Nihongo|'''Legoshi'''|\u30ec\u30b4\u30b7|Regoshi}}\n:{{Voiced by|Chikahiro Kobayashi<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-07/chikahiro-kobayashi-sayaka-senbongi-star-in-beastars-anime/.148771|title=Chikahiro Kobayashi, Sayaka Senbongi Star in BEASTARS Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 8, 2019|accessdate=July 8, 2019}}</ref>|Jonah Scott<ref name=\"Beastars ENG Cast\">{{cite web |last1=Mateo |first1=Alex |title=BEASTARS Anime Reveals English Dub Cast|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-02-20/beastars-anime-reveals-english-dub-cast/.156674 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=February 20, 2020 |date=February 20, 2020}}</ref>}}\n:Legoshi, 17 years old at the start of the story,<ref name=Vol1ENVizp204>{{cite book|author=Itagaki, Paru|translator=Tomoko Kimura|title=Beastars|language=en|publisher=[[VIZ Media]]|date=July 2019|volume=1|page=204}} - First printing, and Annette Roman did the adaptation.</ref> is a towering gray [[wolf]] with a quiet personality contrasting his appearance.

At first, goods may not even be intentionally produced for the explicit purpose of exchanging them, but as a regular market for goods develops and a cash economy grows, this becomes more and more the case, and production increasingly becomes integrated in commodity trade.  \"The product becomes a commodity\" and \"exchange value of the commodity acquires a separate existence alongside the commodity\"<ref>Karl Marx, \"Outlines of the Critique of Political Capital\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'', p. 102.</ref>\n\nEven so, in simple commodity production, not all inputs and outputs of the production process are necessarily commodities or priced goods, and it is compatible with a variety of different [[relations of production]] ranging from self-employment and family labour to serfdom and slavery. Typically, however, it is the producer himself who trades his surpluses.\n\nHowever, as the [[division of labour]] becomes more complex, a class of merchants emerges which specialises in trading commodities, buying here and selling there, without producing products themselves, and parallel to this, property owners emerge who extend credit and charge rents. This process goes together with the increased use of [[money]], and the aim of merchants, bankers and renters becomes to gain ''income'' from the trade, by acting as intermediaries between producers and consumers.\n\nThe transformation of a labor-product into a commodity (its \"marketing\") is in reality not a simple process, but has many technical and social preconditions. These often include the following ten (10) main ones:\n#The existence of a reliable supply of a product, or at least a surplus or surplus product.\n#The existence of a social need for it (a market demand) that must be met through trade, or at any event cannot be met otherwise.\n#The legally sanctioned assertion of private ownership rights to the commodity.\n#The enforcement of these rights, so that ownership is secure.\n#The transferability of these private rights from one owner to another.\n#The right to buy and sell the commodity, and/or obtain (privately) and keep income from such trade\n#The (physical) transferability of the commodity itself, i.e. the ability to store, package, preserve and transport it from one owner to another.\n#The imposition of exclusivity of access to the commodity.\n#The possibility of the owner to use or consume the commodity privately.\n#Guarantees about the quality and safety of the commodity, and possibly a guarantee of replacement or service, should it fail to function as intended.\n\nThus, the \"commodification\" of a good or service often involves a considerable practical accomplishment in trade. It is a process that may be influenced not just by economic or technical factors, but also political and cultural factors, insofar as it involves property rights, claims to access to resources, and guarantees about quality or safety of use.\n\nIn absolute terms, exchange values can also be measured as quantities of average labour-hours. Commodities which contain the same amount of socially necessary labor have the same exchange value. By contrast, prices are normally measured in money-units. For practical purposes, prices are, however, usually preferable to labour-hours, as units of account, although in capitalist work processes the two are related to each other (see labor power).\n\n==Forms of commodity trade==\nThe seven basic forms of commodity trade can be summarised as follows:\n* M-C (an act of purchase: a sum of money purchases a commodity, or \"money is changed into a commodity\")<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 147 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p.159.</ref>\n* C-M (an act of sale: a commodity is sold for money)<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 147 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35''. p. 159.</ref>\n* M-M' (a sum of money is lent out at interest to obtain more money, or, one currency or financial claim is traded for another.  \"Money begets money.\")<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 155 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 166.</ref>\n* C-C' (countertrade, in which a commodity trades directly for a different commodity, with money possibly being used as an accounting referent, for example, food for oil, or weapons for diamonds)\n* {{visible anchor|C-M-C'}} (a commodity is sold for money, which buys another, different commodity with an equal or higher value)\n* {{visible anchor|M-C-M'}} (money is used to buy a commodity which is resold to obtain a larger sum of money)<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 150 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 161.</ref>\n* M-C...P...-C'-M' (money buys [[means of production]] and [[labour power]] used in production to create a new commodity, which is sold for more money than the original outlay.  \"The circular course of capital\")<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume II'' (International Publishers: New York, 1967) p. 56.</ref>\n\nThe hyphens (\"-\") here refer to a transaction applying to an exchange involving goods or money; the dots in the last-mentioned circuit (\"...\") indicate that a value-forming process (\"P\") occurs ''in between'' purchase of commodities and the sales of different commodities. Thus, while at first merchants are intermediaries between producers and consumers, later capitalist ''production'' becomes an intermediary between buyers and sellers of commodities. In that case, the valuation of labour is determined by the value of its products.\n\nThe [[Reification (Marxism)|reifying]] effects of universalised trade in commodities, involving a process Marx calls \"[[commodity fetishism]],\"<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', pp. 71-83 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', pp. 81-94.</ref> mean that [[social relations]] become expressed as relations between things;<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital'', pp. 71-72 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', pp. 81-82.</ref> for example, price relations. Markets mediate a complex network of interdependencies and [[supply chain]]s emerging among people who may not even know who produced the goods they buy, or where they were produced.\n\nSince no one agency can control or regulate the myriad of transactions that occur (apart from blocking some trade here, and permitting it there), the whole of production falls under the sway of the [[law of value]], and economics becomes a science aiming to understand ''market behaviour'', i.e. the aggregate effects of a multitude of people interacting in markets. How quantities of [[use-value]]s are allocated in a market economy depends mainly on their [[exchange value]], and this allocation is mediated by the \"cash nexus\".\n\nIn Marx's analysis of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], commodity sales increase the amount of exchange-value in the possession of the owners of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], i.e., they yield [[profit (economics)|profit]] and thus augment their capital ([[capital accumulation]]).\n\n==Cost structure of commodities==\nIn considering the ''unit cost'' of a capitalistically produced commodity (in contrast to [[simple commodity production]]), Marx claims that the ''value'' of any such commodity is reducible to four components equal to:\n* [[Variable capital]] used up to produce it.\n* Fixed and circulating [[constant capital]] used up per unit.\n* Incidental expenses which cost labour-time ([[faux frais of production]]).\n* [[Surplus value]] per unit.\n\nThese components reflect respectively labour costs, the cost of materials and operating expenses including depreciation, and generic profit.\n\nIn capitalism, Marx argues, commodity values are commercially expressed as the [[prices of production]] of commodities (cost-price + average profit). Prices of production are established jointly by average input costs ''and'' by the ruling profit margins applying to outputs sold. They reflect the fact that production has become totally integrated into the circuits of commodity trade, in which [[capital accumulation]] becomes the dominant motive. But what prices of production simultaneously hide is the social nature of the [[valorisation]] process, i.e. how an increase in capital-value occurs through production.\n\nLikewise, in considering the gross output of capitalist production in an economy as a whole, Marx divides its value into these four components. He argues that the total new value added in production, which he calls the [[value product]], consists of the equivalent of variable capital, plus surplus value. Thus, the workers produce by their labor both a new value equal to their own wages, plus an additional new value which is claimed by capitalists by virtue of their ownership and supply of productive capital.\n\nBy producing new capital in the form of new commodities, Marx argues the working class continuously [[reproduction (economics)|reproduces]] the capitalist [[relations of production]]; by their work, workers create a new value distributed as both labour-income and property-income. If, as free workers, they choose to stop working, the system begins to break down; hence, capitalist civilisation strongly emphasizes the [[work ethic]], regardless of religious belief. People must work, because work is the source of new value, profits and capital.\n\n==Pseudo-commodities==\nMarx acknowledged explicitly that not all commodities are products of human labour; all kinds of things can be traded \"as if\" they are commodities, so long as property rights can be attached to them. These are \"fictitious commodities\" or \"pseudo-commodities\" or \"fiduciary commodities\", i.e. their existence as commodities is only nominal or conventional. They may not even be tangible objects, but exist only ideally. A property right or financial claim, for instance, may be traded as a commodity.\n\n==See also==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Commodification]]\n* [[Commodity]]\n* [[Commodity fetishism]]\n* [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|Commodity production]]\n* [[Exchange value]]\n* [[Labour theory of value]]\n* [[Law of value]]\n* [[Simple commodity production]]\n* [[Use value]]\n* [[Value-form (Marxism)]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\nThe concept of the commodity is explored at length by Marx in the following works:\n* ''[[Contribution to a Critique of Political Economy]]'' [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm]\n* ''[[Das Kapital]]'' Volume 1 Part 1 Chapter 1 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm]\n* Commodities- from the first chapter of Das Capital [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm]\n\nA useful commentary on the Marxian concept is provided in: [[Costas Lapavitsas]], \"Commodities and Gifts: Why Commodities Represent More than Market Relations\".

For practical purposes, prices are, however, usually preferable to labour-hours, as units of account, although in capitalist work processes the two are related to each other (see labor power).\n\n==Forms of commodity trade==\nThe seven basic forms of commodity trade can be summarised as follows:\n* M-C (an act of purchase: a sum of money purchases a commodity, or \"money is changed into a commodity\")<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 147 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p.159.</ref>\n* C-M (an act of sale: a commodity is sold for money)<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 147 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35''. p. 159.</ref>\n* M-M' (a sum of money is lent out at interest to obtain more money, or, one currency or financial claim is traded for another.  \"Money begets money.\")<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 155 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 166.</ref>\n* C-C' (countertrade, in which a commodity trades directly for a different commodity, with money possibly being used as an accounting referent, for example, food for oil, or weapons for diamonds)\n* {{visible anchor|C-M-C'}} (a commodity is sold for money, which buys another, different commodity with an equal or higher value)\n* {{visible anchor|M-C-M'}} (money is used to buy a commodity which is resold to obtain a larger sum of money)<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 150 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 161.</ref>\n* M-C...P...-C'-M' (money buys [[means of production]] and [[labour power]] used in production to create a new commodity, which is sold for more money than the original outlay.  \"The circular course of capital\")<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume II'' (International Publishers: New York, 1967) p. 56.</ref>\n\nThe hyphens (\"-\") here refer to a transaction applying to an exchange involving goods or money; the dots in the last-mentioned circuit (\"...\") indicate that a value-forming process (\"P\") occurs ''in between'' purchase of commodities and the sales of different commodities. Thus, while at first merchants are intermediaries between producers and consumers, later capitalist ''production'' becomes an intermediary between buyers and sellers of commodities. In that case, the valuation of labour is determined by the value of its products.\n\nThe [[Reification (Marxism)|reifying]] effects of universalised trade in commodities, involving a process Marx calls \"[[commodity fetishism]],\"<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', pp. 71-83 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', pp. 81-94.</ref> mean that [[social relations]] become expressed as relations between things;<ref>Karl Marx, ''Capital'', pp. 71-72 and \"Capital\" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', pp. 81-82.</ref> for example, price relations. Markets mediate a complex network of interdependencies and [[supply chain]]s emerging among people who may not even know who produced the goods they buy, or where they were produced.\n\nSince no one agency can control or regulate the myriad of transactions that occur (apart from blocking some trade here, and permitting it there), the whole of production falls under the sway of the [[law of value]], and economics becomes a science aiming to understand ''market behaviour'', i.e. the aggregate effects of a multitude of people interacting in markets. How quantities of [[use-value]]s are allocated in a market economy depends mainly on their [[exchange value]], and this allocation is mediated by the \"cash nexus\".\n\nIn Marx's analysis of the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], commodity sales increase the amount of exchange-value in the possession of the owners of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], i.e., they yield [[profit (economics)|profit]] and thus augment their capital ([[capital accumulation]]).\n\n==Cost structure of commodities==\nIn considering the ''unit cost'' of a capitalistically produced commodity (in contrast to [[simple commodity production]]), Marx claims that the ''value'' of any such commodity is reducible to four components equal to:\n* [[Variable capital]] used up to produce it.\n* Fixed and circulating [[constant capital]] used up per unit.\n* Incidental expenses which cost labour-time ([[faux frais of production]]).\n* [[Surplus value]] per unit.\n\nThese components reflect respectively labour costs, the cost of materials and operating expenses including depreciation, and generic profit.\n\nIn capitalism, Marx argues, commodity values are commercially expressed as the [[prices of production]] of commodities (cost-price + average profit). Prices of production are established jointly by average input costs ''and'' by the ruling profit margins applying to outputs sold. They reflect the fact that production has become totally integrated into the circuits of commodity trade, in which [[capital accumulation]] becomes the dominant motive. But what prices of production simultaneously hide is the social nature of the [[valorisation]] process, i.e. how an increase in capital-value occurs through production.\n\nLikewise, in considering the gross output of capitalist production in an economy as a whole, Marx divides its value into these four components. He argues that the total new value added in production, which he calls the [[value product]], consists of the equivalent of variable capital, plus surplus value. Thus, the workers produce by their labor both a new value equal to their own wages, plus an additional new value which is claimed by capitalists by virtue of their ownership and supply of productive capital.\n\nBy producing new capital in the form of new commodities, Marx argues the working class continuously [[reproduction (economics)|reproduces]] the capitalist [[relations of production]]; by their work, workers create a new value distributed as both labour-income and property-income. If, as free workers, they choose to stop working, the system begins to break down; hence, capitalist civilisation strongly emphasizes the [[work ethic]], regardless of religious belief. People must work, because work is the source of new value, profits and capital.\n\n==Pseudo-commodities==\nMarx acknowledged explicitly that not all commodities are products of human labour; all kinds of things can be traded \"as if\" they are commodities, so long as property rights can be attached to them. These are \"fictitious commodities\" or \"pseudo-commodities\" or \"fiduciary commodities\", i.e. their existence as commodities is only nominal or conventional. They may not even be tangible objects, but exist only ideally. A property right or financial claim, for instance, may be traded as a commodity.\n\n==See also==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Commodification]]\n* [[Commodity]]\n* [[Commodity fetishism]]\n* [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|Commodity production]]\n* [[Exchange value]]\n* [[Labour theory of value]]\n* [[Law of value]]\n* [[Simple commodity production]]\n* [[Use value]]\n* [[Value-form (Marxism)]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\nThe concept of the commodity is explored at length by Marx in the following works:\n* ''[[Contribution to a Critique of Political Economy]]'' [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/index.htm]\n* ''[[Das Kapital]]'' Volume 1 Part 1 Chapter 1 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm]\n* Commodities- from the first chapter of Das Capital [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm]\n\nA useful commentary on the Marxian concept is provided in: [[Costas Lapavitsas]], \"Commodities and Gifts: Why Commodities Represent More than Market Relations\".
