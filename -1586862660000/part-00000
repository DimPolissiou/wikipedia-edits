Each sign contained 30\u00b0 of [[celestial longitude]], thus creating the first known celestial coordinate system.

Contemporary use of the coordinate system is presented with the choice of interpreting the system either as [[sidereal astrology|sidereal]], with the signs fixed to the [[Fixed stars|stellar background]], or as [[tropical astrology|tropical]], with the signs fixed to the point ([[Euclidean vector|vector]] of the Sun) at the [[March equinox]].<ref>Rochberg, Francesca (1998), \"Babylonian Horoscopes\", ''American Philosophical Society'', New Series, Vol. 88, No. 1, pp i-164</ref>\n\n[[Western astrology]] takes the tropical approach, whereas [[Hindu astrology]] takes the sidereal one. This results in the originally unified zodiacal coordinate system drifting apart gradually, with a clockwise (westward) precession of 1.4 degrees per century.\n\nFor the tropical zodiac used in Western astronomy and astrology, this means that the tropical ''sign'' of Aries currently lies somewhere within the ''constellation'' Pisces (\"[[Age of Pisces]]\").\n\nThe sidereal coordinate system takes into account the [[ayanamsa]], ''ayan'' meaning ''transit'' or ''movement'', and ''amsa'' meaning ''small part'', i.e. movement of equinoxes in small parts. It is unclear when Indians became aware of the precession of the equinoxes, but [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara 2]]'s 12th-century treatise ''[[Siddhanta Shiromani]]'' gives equations for measurement of precession of equinoxes, and says his equations are based on some lost equations of ''[[Suryasiddhanta]]'' plus the equation of Munjaala.\n\nThe discovery of precession is attributed to [[Hipparchus]] around 130 BC. [[Ptolemy]] quotes from Hipparchus' now lost work entitled \"On the Displacement of the Solstitial and Equinoctial Points\" in the seventh book of his 2nd century astronomical text, ''[[Almagest]]'', where he describes the phenomenon of precession and estimates its value.<ref name=\"Springer\"/> Ptolemy clarified that the convention of Greek mathematical astronomy was to commence the zodiac from the point of the vernal equinox and to always refer to this point as \"the first degree\" of Aries.<ref name=Geminos2>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=James|last2=Berggren|first2=J.

Geminus explains that Greek astronomers of his era associate the first degrees of the zodiac signs with the two solstices and the two equinoxes, in contrast to the older Chaldean (Babylonian) system, which placed these points within the zodiac signs.<ref name=Geminos2/> This illustrates that Ptolemy merely clarified the convention of Greek astronomers and did not originate the principle of the tropical zodiac, as is sometimes assumed.\n\nPtolemy also demonstrates that the principle of the tropical zodiac was well known to his predecessors within his astrological text, the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', where he explains why it would be an error to associate the regularly spaced signs of the seasonally aligned zodiac with the irregular boundaries of the visible constellations:\n\n::The beginnings of the signs, and likewise those of the terms, are to be taken from the equinoctial and tropical points. This rule is not only clearly stated by writers on the subject, but is also especially evident by the demonstration constantly afforded, that their natures, influences and familiarities have no other origin than from the tropics and equinoxes, as has been already plainly shown. And, if other beginnings were allowed, it would either be necessary to exclude the natures of the signs from the theory of prognostication, or impossible to avoid error in then retaining and making use of them; as the regularity of their spaces and distances, upon which their influence depends, would then be invaded and broken in upon.<ref name=\"Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos\"/>\n\n== In modern astronomy ==\n\nAstronomically, the zodiac defines a belt of space extending 9\u00b0 either side of the [[ecliptic]], within which the orbits of the Moon and the principal planets remain.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Zodiac|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/657680/zodiac|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> It is a feature of a [[celestial coordinate system]] centered upon the [[ecliptic]], (the plane of the Earth's orbit and the Sun's apparent path), by which [[celestial longitude]] is measured in degrees east of the [[vernal equinox]] (the ascending intersection of the ecliptic and [[equator]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Ecliptic|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/178159/ecliptic|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> Stars within the zodiac are subject to [[occultation]]s by the Moon and other solar system bodies.

The Hindu zodiac signs and corresponding Greek signs sound very different, being in Sanskrit and Greek respectively, but their symbols are nearly identical.<ref name=\"Schmidt\">{{cite web |last1=Schmidt |first1=Robert H. |title=The Relation of Hellenistic to Indian Astrology |url=http://www.projecthindsight.com/articles/vedic.html |publisher=Project Hindsight |accessdate=4 July 2016}}</ref> For example, ''dhanu'' means \"bow\" and corresponds to Sagittarius, the \"archer\", and ''kumbha'' means \"water-pitcher\" and corresponds to Aquarius, the \"water-carrier\".<ref name=\"Dalal2010\">{{cite book |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&pg=PA89 |year=2010 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-341421-6 |page=89}}</ref>\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[File:Angers Cathedral South Rose Window of Christ with Zodiac.jpg|thumb|Angers Cathedral South Rose Window of Christ (centre) with elders (bottom half) and Zodiac (top half).

Contemporary use of the coordinate system is presented with the choice of interpreting the system either as [[sidereal astrology|sidereal]], with the signs fixed to the [[Fixed stars|stellar background]], or as [[tropical astrology|tropical]], with the signs fixed to the point ([[Euclidean vector|vector]] of the Sun) at the [[March equinox]].<ref>Rochberg, Francesca (1998), \"Babylonian Horoscopes\", ''American Philosophical Society'', New Series, Vol. 88, No. 1, pp i-164</ref>\n\n[[Western astrology]] takes the tropical approach, whereas [[Hindu astrology]] takes the sidereal one. This results in the originally unified zodiacal coordinate system drifting apart gradually, with a clockwise (westward) precession of 1.4 degrees per century.\n\nFor the tropical zodiac used in Western astronomy and astrology, this means that the tropical ''sign'' of Aries currently lies somewhere within the ''constellation'' Pisces (\"[[Age of Pisces]]\").\n\nThe sidereal coordinate system takes into account the [[ayanamsa]], ''ayan'' meaning ''transit'' or ''movement'', and ''amsa'' meaning ''small part'', i.e. movement of equinoxes in small parts. It is unclear when Indians became aware of the precession of the equinoxes, but [[Bh\u0101skara II|Bhaskara 2]]'s 12th-century treatise ''[[Siddhanta Shiromani]]'' gives equations for measurement of precession of equinoxes, and says his equations are based on some lost equations of ''[[Suryasiddhanta]]'' plus the equation of Munjaala.\n\nThe discovery of precession is attributed to [[Hipparchus]] around 130 BC. [[Ptolemy]] quotes from Hipparchus' now lost work entitled \"On the Displacement of the Solstitial and Equinoctial Points\" in the seventh book of his 2nd century astronomical text, ''[[Almagest]]'', where he describes the phenomenon of precession and estimates its value.<ref name=\"Springer\"/> Ptolemy clarified that the convention of Greek mathematical astronomy was to commence the zodiac from the point of the vernal equinox and to always refer to this point as \"the first degree\" of Aries.<ref name=Geminos2>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=James|last2=Berggren|first2=J. Lennart|title=Geminos's Introduction to the Phenomena|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=069112339X|page=115}}</ref> This is known as the \"tropical zodiac\" (from the Greek word tr\u00f3pos, turn)<ref>{{cite web|title=tropo-|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tropo-|website=Dictionary.com|publisher=Random House, Inc.|accessdate=21 May 2015}}</ref> because its starting point revolves through the circle of background constellations over time.\n\nThe principle of the vernal point acting as the first degree of the zodiac for Greek astronomers is also described in the 1st century BC astronomical text of [[Geminus]] of Rhodes. Geminus explains that Greek astronomers of his era associate the first degrees of the zodiac signs with the two solstices and the two equinoxes, in contrast to the older Chaldean (Babylonian) system, which placed these points within the zodiac signs.<ref name=Geminos2/> This illustrates that Ptolemy merely clarified the convention of Greek astronomers and did not originate the principle of the tropical zodiac, as is sometimes assumed.\n\nPtolemy also demonstrates that the principle of the tropical zodiac was well known to his predecessors within his astrological text, the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', where he explains why it would be an error to associate the regularly spaced signs of the seasonally aligned zodiac with the irregular boundaries of the visible constellations:\n\n::The beginnings of the signs, and likewise those of the terms, are to be taken from the equinoctial and tropical points. This rule is not only clearly stated by writers on the subject, but is also especially evident by the demonstration constantly afforded, that their natures, influences and familiarities have no other origin than from the tropics and equinoxes, as has been already plainly shown. And, if other beginnings were allowed, it would either be necessary to exclude the natures of the signs from the theory of prognostication, or impossible to avoid error in then retaining and making use of them; as the regularity of their spaces and distances, upon which their influence depends, would then be invaded and broken in upon.<ref name=\"Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos\"/>\n\n== In modern astronomy ==\n\nAstronomically, the zodiac defines a belt of space extending 9\u00b0 either side of the [[ecliptic]], within which the orbits of the Moon and the principal planets remain.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\">{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Zodiac|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/657680/zodiac|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> It is a feature of a [[celestial coordinate system]] centered upon the [[ecliptic]], (the plane of the Earth's orbit and the Sun's apparent path), by which [[celestial longitude]] is measured in degrees east of the [[vernal equinox]] (the ascending intersection of the ecliptic and [[equator]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Ecliptic|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/178159/ecliptic|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> Stars within the zodiac are subject to [[occultation]]s by the Moon and other solar system bodies.

The first 30\u00b0 along the ecliptic is nominally designated as the zodiac sign Aries, which no longer falls within the proximity of the constellation Aries since the effect of [[precession]] is to move the vernal point through the backdrop of visible constellations (it is currently located near the end of the constellation Pisces, having been within that constellation since the 2nd century AD).<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite web|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Astronomical map|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/40018/astronomical-map/52787/The-ecliptic-system|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> The subsequent 30\u00b0 of the ecliptic is nominally designated the zodiac sign Taurus, and so on through the twelve signs of the zodiac so that each occupies 1/12th (30\u00b0) of the zodiac's great circle. Zodiac signs have never been used to determine the boundaries of astronomical constellations that lie in the vicinity of the zodiac, which are, and always have been, irregular in their size and shape.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\"/>\n\nThe convention of measuring celestial longitude within individual signs was still being used in the mid-19th century,<ref>{{cite book|author=G.

She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]].]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland.

It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]).

Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to mathematics in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M.

She notices a talking, clothed [[White Rabbit|white rabbit]] with a [[pocket watch]] run past. She follows it down a rabbit hole where she suddenly falls a long way to a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a little key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it, she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled \"DRINK ME,\" the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she had left on the table. She subsequently eats a cake labelled \"EAT ME\" in currants as the chapter closes.\n\n'''Chapter Two \u2013 The Pool of Tears''': The chapter opens with Alice growing to such a tremendous size that her head hits the ceiling. Unhappy, Alice begins to cry and her tears literally flood the hallway. Shrinking down again due to a fan she had picked up, Alice swims through her own tears and meets a [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|mouse]], who is swimming as well. Alice, thinking he may be a French mouse, tries to make small talk with him in elementary French. Her opening gambit \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" ({{Trans|\"Where is my cat?\"}}), however, offends the mouse, who then tries to escape her.\n\n'''Chapter Three \u2013 The Caucus Race and a Long Tale''': {{anchor|Caucus Race}}The sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again. Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on [[William the Conqueror]]. A [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|dodo]] decides that the best thing to dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.\n\n'''Chapter Four \u2013 The Rabbit Sends a Little Bill''': White Rabbit appears again in search of the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]]'s gloves and fan. Mistaking her for his [[maidservant]], Mary Ann, Rabbit orders Alice to go into the house and retrieve them. Inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it, immediately beginning to grow again. The horrified Rabbit orders his gardener, [[Bill the Lizard]], to climb on the roof and go down the chimney. Outside, Alice hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm. The crowd hurls pebbles at her, which turn into little cakes. Alice eats them, and they reduce her again in size.\n\n'''Chapter Five \u2013 Advice from a Caterpillar''': Alice comes upon a mushroom and sitting on it is a [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|blue caterpillar]] smoking a [[hookah]]. Caterpillar questions Alice, who begins to admit to her current identity crisis, compounded by [[How Doth the Little Crocodile|her inability to remember a poem]]. Before crawling away, the caterpillar tells Alice that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter. She breaks off two pieces from the mushroom. One side makes her shrink smaller than ever, while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees, where a pigeon mistakes her for a serpent. With some effort, Alice brings herself back to her normal height. She stumbles upon a small estate and uses the mushroom to reach a more appropriate height.\n\n[[File:De Alice's Abenteuer im Wunderland Carroll pic 23 edited 1 of 2.png|thumb|right|The [[Cheshire Cat]]]]\n'''Chapter Six \u2013 Pig and Pepper''': A fish-[[footman]] has an invitation for the [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Duchess]] of the house, which he delivers to a frog-footman. Alice observes this transaction and, after a perplexing conversation with the frog, lets herself into the house. The Duchess's cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that has too much pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning [[Cheshire Cat]]) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and, to Alice's surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the [[March Hare]]'s house. He disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.\n\n'''Chapter Seven \u2013 A Mad Tea-Party''': Alice becomes a guest at a \"mad\" tea party along with the [[March Hare]], the [[The Hatter|Hatter]], and a very tired [[Dormouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dormouse]], who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the March Hare and the Hatter. The characters give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous \"[[why is a raven like a writing desk?]].\" The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because [https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Time Time] has punished him by eternally standing still at 6&nbsp;PM (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to.\n\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|left|upright|Alice trying to play [[croquet]] with a [[Flamingo]].]]\n'''Chapter Eight \u2013 The Queen's Croquet Ground''': Alice leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on a rose tree red because [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]] hates white roses. A procession of more cards, kings and queens and even the White Rabbit enters the garden. Alice then meets the King and Queen. The Queen, a figure difficult to please, introduces her signature phrase \"Off with his head!\" which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with a subject. Alice is invited (or some might say ordered) to play a game of croquet with the Queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos. Live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and Alice once again meets the Cheshire Cat. The Queen of Hearts then orders the Cat to be beheaded, only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him. Because the cat belongs to the Duchess, the Queen is prompted to release the Duchess from prison to resolve the matter.\n\n'''Chapter Nine \u2013 The Mock Turtle's Story''': The Duchess is brought to the croquet ground at Alice's request. She ruminates on finding morals in everything around her. The Queen of Hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces Alice to the [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Gryphon]], who takes her to the [[Mock Turtle]]. The Mock Turtle is very sad, even though he has no sorrow. He tries to tell his story about how he used to be a real turtle in school, which the Gryphon interrupts so they can play a game.\n\n{{anchor|Lobster Quadrille}}\n'''Chapter Ten \u2013 Lobster Quadrille''': The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon dance to the Lobster Quadrille, while Alice recites (rather incorrectly) \"[['Tis the Voice of the Lobster]]\". The Mock Turtle sings them \"Beautiful Soup\" during which the Gryphon drags Alice away for an impending trial.\n\n'''Chapter Eleven \u2013 Who Stole the Tarts?''': Alice attends a trial whereby the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]] is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The jury is composed of various animals, including [[Bill the Lizard]], the White Rabbit is the court's trumpeter, and the judge is the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]].\nDuring the proceedings, Alice finds that she is steadily growing larger. The dormouse scolds Alice and tells her she has no right to grow at such a rapid pace and take up all the air. Alice scoffs and calls the dormouse's accusation ridiculous because everyone grows and she cannot help it. Meanwhile, witnesses at the trial include the Hatter, who displeases and frustrates the King through his indirect answers to the questioning, and the Duchess's cook.\n\n'''Chapter Twelve \u2013 Alice's Evidence''': Alice is then called up as a witness. She accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the King orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues. The King and Queen order Alice to be gone, citing Rule 42 (\"All persons more than a mile high to leave the court\"), but Alice disputes their judgement and refuses to leave. She argues with the King and Queen of Hearts over the ridiculous proceedings, eventually refusing to hold her tongue, only to say, \"It's not that I was the one who stole the tarts in the first place\", in the process. Finally, the Queen confirms that Alice was the culprit responsible of stealing the tarts after all (which automatically pardons the Knave of Hearts of his charges), and shouts, \"Off with her head!\", but Alice is unafraid, calling them just a pack of cards; although Alice holds her own for a time, the card guards soon gang up and start to swarm all over her. Alice's sister wakes her up from a dream, brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not a shower of playing cards from Alice's face. Alice leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself.\n\n== Characters ==\n{{further|List of minor characters in the Alice series}}\n\nThe main characters in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' are the following:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]]\n* [[White Rabbit|The White Rabbit]]\n* [[Mouse (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Mouse]]\n* [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Dodo]]\n* [[Lory (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Lory]]\n* [[Eaglet (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Eaglet]]\n* [[Duck (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duck]]\n* [[Pat (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Pat]]\n* [[Bill the Lizard]]\n* [[The Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Puppy]]\n* [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Caterpillar]]\n* [[Duchess (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Duchess]]\n* [[Cheshire Cat|The Cheshire Cat]]\n* [[The Hatter|The Mad Hatter]]\n* [[March Hare|The March Hare]]\n* [[The Dormouse]]\n* [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Queen of Hearts]]\n* [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The King of Hearts]]\n* [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Knave of Hearts]]\n* [[Gryphon (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|The Gryphon]]\n* [[Mock Turtle|The Mock Turtle]]\n}}\n\n=== Character allusions ===\n[[File:Jessie Willcox Smith Boys and Girls in Bookland.jpg|thumb|[[Jessie Willcox Smith]]'s illustration of Alice surrounded by the characters of Wonderland.

It is most likely that these are references to French lessons\u2014a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: \"''O\u00f9 est ma chatte?''\" (\"Where is my cat?\"). In Henri Bu\u00e9's French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.\n\nPat's \"Digging for apples\" could be a [[cross-language pun]], as ''pomme de terre'' (literally; \"apple of the earth\") means potato and ''pomme'' means apple.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis Carroll|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V-g1dR6en90C&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22Digging+for+apples%22+alice+in+wonderland+potatoes#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955829-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as \"O Mouse\", based on her memory of the noun [[Declension|declensions]] \"in her brother's [[Instruction in Latin#Order of cases|Latin Grammar]], 'A mouse \u2013 of a mouse \u2013 to a mouse \u2013 a mouse \u2013 O mouse!'\" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: ''mus'' ([[nominative]]), ''muris'' ([[genitive]]), ''muri'' ([[dative]]), ''murem'' ([[accusative]]), ''(O) mus'' ([[vocative]]).

Literary scholar Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'' that Dodgson wrote ''Alice in Wonderland'' in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bayley|first=Melanie|title=Alice's adventures in algebra: Wonderland solved|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20427391.600-alices-adventures-in-algebra-wonderland-solved.html?full=true|magazine=New Scientist|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of references to mathematics in ''Alice'' include:\n\n* Chapter 1 (\"Down the Rabbit-Hole\"): in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps \"''going out altogether, like a candle''\"; this pondering reflects the concept of a [[limit of a function|limit]].\n* Chapter 2 (\"The Pool of Tears\"): Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: \"''Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!''\" This explores the representation of numbers using different [[Base (exponentiation)|bases]] and [[Positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]]s: 4 \u00d7 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 \u00d7 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 \u00d7 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 \u00d7 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 \u00d7 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)\n* Chapter 7 (\"A Mad Tea-Party\"): The March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence '''A''' is not the same value of the [[Antimetabole|converse]] of '''A''' (for example, \"''Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!''\"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing a [[converse relation]]. Alice also ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the [[ring of integers]] [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] N.\n* The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.\n\n=== Eating and devouring ===\nCarina Garland notes how the world is \"expressed via representations of food and appetite\", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1353/uni.2008.0004 |title = Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll's Alice Texts |journal = The Lion and the Unicorn |volume = 32 |pages = 22\u201339 |year = 2008 |last1 = Garland |first1 = C. }}</ref> Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images.

Saville Clark (book) and [[Walter Slaughter]] (music), which played at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]]. The musical was frequently revived during West End Christmas seasons during the four decades after its premiere, including a London production at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in 1888, with [[Isa Bowman]] as Alice.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Lewis Carroll in Wonderland and at Home: The Story of His Life | first=Belle | last=Moses | publisher=BiblioBazaar | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-103-29348-3 | pages=244\u2013247 }}</ref> \n\nAs the book and its sequel are Carroll's most widely recognised works, they have also inspired numerous live performances, including plays, operas, ballets, and traditional English [[pantomime]]s. These works range from fairly faithful adaptations to those that use the story as a basis for new works. An example of the latter is ''The Eighth Square'', a murder mystery set in Wonderland, written by [[Matthew Fleming]] and music and lyrics by Ben J. Macpherson. This goth-toned rock musical premiered in 2006 at the [[New Theatre Royal]] in [[Portsmouth]], England. The TA Fantastika, a popular [[Black light theatre]] in Prague performs \"Aspects of Alice\"; written and directed by Petr Kratochv\u00edl. This adaptation is not faithful to the books, but rather explores Alice's journey into adulthood while incorporating allusions to the history of Czech Republic.\n\nOver the years, many notable people in the performing arts have been involved in ''Alice'' productions. Actress [[Eva Le Gallienne]] famously adapted both Alice books for the stage in 1932; this production has been revived in New York in 1947 and 1982. One of the most well-known American productions was [[Joseph Papp]]'s 1980 staging of ''Alice in Concert'' at the [[Public Theater]] in New York City. [[Elizabeth Swados]] wrote the book, lyrics, and music. Based on both ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass'', Papp and Swados had previously produced a version of it at the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. [[Meryl Streep]] played Alice, the White Queen, and Humpty Dumpty. The cast also included [[Debbie Allen]], [[Michael Jeter]], and [[Mark Linn-Baker]]. Performed on a bare stage with the actors in modern dress, the play is a loose adaptation, with song styles ranging the globe. A community theater production of Alice was [[Olivia de Havilland]]'s first foray onto the stage.\n\nSimilarly, the 1992 operatic production ''Alice'' used both ''Alice'' books as its inspiration. It also employs scenes with Charles Dodgson, a young Alice Liddell, and an adult Alice Liddell, to frame the story. Paul Schmidt wrote the play, with [[Tom Waits]] and [[Kathleen Brennan]] writing the music. Although the original production in [[Hamburg]], Germany, received only a small audience, Tom Waits released the songs as the album ''[[Alice (Tom Waits album)|Alice]]'' in 2002. A musical adaption was written by Michael Sirotta and Heather M. Dominick in 1997, titled ''Alice in Wonderland, a Musical Adventure''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Children's Theatre \"Alice in Wonderland\" Runs Through March 24th|url=http://www.northcoastoregon.com/2013/03/12/winter-childrens-theatre-alice-in-wonderland-runs-through-march-24th/|publisher=North Coast Oregon|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First Redeemer conservatory of music and fine arts presents Alice in Wonderland|url=http://northfulton.com/stories/First-Redeemer-conservatory-of-music-and-fine-arts-presents-Alice-in-Wonderland,31808|publisher=APPEN MEDIA GROUP|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA ballet by [[Christopher Wheeldon]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2056483,00.html |work=Time |title=Royal Ballet Takes a Chance on Alice |date=3 March 2011}}</ref> and [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chesternovello.com/Default.aspx?TabId=2432&State_3041=2&workId_3041=43051 |title=Joby Talbot \u2013 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (2010) \u2013 Music Sales Classical |publisher=Chesternovello.com |date= |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> commissioned for [[The Royal Ballet]] entitled \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" premiered in February 2011 at the [[Royal Opera House]] in Covent Garden, London.

If executed, Bibi would be the first woman in Pakistan to be lawfully killed for blasphemy.<ref name=\"aps\">{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101111/wl_sthasia_afp/pakistanunrestreligionchristian |first=Waqar |last=Hussain |title=Christian Woman Sentenced to Death|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=11 November 2010|accessdate=11 November 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114071047/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101111/wl_sthasia_afp/pakistanunrestreligionchristian| archivedate=14 November 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"tele\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/8120142/Christian-woman-sentenced-to-death-in-Pakistan-for-blasphemy.html |first1=Rob |last1=Crilly |first2=Aoun |last2=Sahi |title=Christian Woman sentenced to Death in Pakistan for blasphemy |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010 |location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101111174909/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/8120142/Christian-woman-sentenced-to-death-in-Pakistan-for-blasphemy.html| archivedate=11 November 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"fears\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11923701 | title = Fear for Pakistan's death row Christian woman|date=5 December 2010|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=5 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206045829/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11923701|archivedate=6 December 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, [[Rimsha Masih blasphemy case|Rimsha Masih]], a Christian girl, reportedly 11 or 14 years old, and an [[illiterate]] with [[mental disabilities]] was accused of blasphemy for  burning pages from a book containing Quranic verses.

The study concluded: <blockquote>\n*Public school textbooks used by all children often had a strong Islamic orientation, \n*Public school and madrassa teachers had limited awareness or understanding of religious minorities and their beliefs, and were divided on whether religious minorities were citizens;\n*Teachers often expressed very negative views about Ahmadis, Christians, and Jews, and successfully transmitted these biases to their students;\n*Interviewees' expressions of tolerance often were intermixed with neutral and intolerant comments, leaving some room for improvement.<ref name=USCIRF>{{cite web|last=Leo|first=Leonard|title=Pakistan's Educational System Fuels Religious Discrimination|url=https://www.uscirf.gov/news-room/press-releases/pakistans-educational-system-fuels-religious-discrimination|publisher=USCIRF}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Constitution ==\nTolerance for religious discrimination can be found in the [[Constitution of Pakistan]]. Islam is named as the religion of the state, and whilst there is a provision allowing for minorities to practice their religions, they are still subject to the principles of 'democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam'.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCertain provisions are outrightly discriminatory - such as article 41(2) which provides that only Muslims can become President, thereby denying minorities the chance to hold the highest position of power.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Constitution also provides for the set up of the Islamic Council, created to safeguard Islamic ideology. The Islamic Council can shape governmental decisions, actions and policy, which creates an institutionalised priority for Islamic ideas to the detriment of religious minorities.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan]]\n* [[Asia Bibi blasphemy case]]\n* [[Freedom of religion in Pakistan]]\n* [[Sectarian violence in Pakistan]]\n* [[LGBT rights in Pakistan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17936651 Pakistan's Shias fear sectarian attacks]\n* [https://eptoday.com/files/Religious%20Minorities%20Report.pdf Religious Minorities Report of Pakistan by European Parliament]\n\n{{Social issues in Pakistan}}\n\n[[Category:Religious discrimination]]\n[[Category:Religiously motivated violence in Pakistan| ]]\n", "name_user": "Koreangauteng", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHindus:Hinduism in Pakistan", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_discrimination_in_Pakistan"}
