The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010). Originally, the record was thought to be released as a deluxe edition of ''Animal'', but was instead sold and released as both an EP and a deluxe edition of ''Animal''. Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as executive producer [[Dr. Luke]], [[Benny Blanco]], [[Ammo (musician)|Ammo]], [[Max Martin]], Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on ''Cannibal'' are of the [[dance-pop]] genre, with some songs incorporating elements of [[Electro music|electro]] and [[electropop]] in their production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of [[Auto-Tune]] and [[vocoder]]s is prominent. Lyrically, the songs on ''Cannibal'' speak of ignoring judgement or hate and experiences based on love and heartbreak.\n\n''Cannibal'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. However, a common complaint amongst critics was the overuse of Auto-Tune, while the album's production was generally highlighted. The album's lyrics generally polarized music critics; some praised her boldness, while others criticized them as being too raunchy. In the United States, the EP reached a peak of fifteen on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, selling 74,000 copies in its first week of release. In Canada, the album achieved similar success, reaching a peak of fourteen on the country's albums chart. ''Cannibal'' was certified [[RIAA certifications|Platinum]] in 2018 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales of 1,000,000 copies.\n\nTwo singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"[[We R Who We R]]\", was a worldwide success, reaching number one in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and charting within the top ten in numerous other countries. In the United States, the song became the seventeenth song in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]'s history to debut at number one. The album's second single, \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", was released on February 8, 2011. The song reached top ten positions in multiple countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Kesha promoted the EP and her debut album by her first headlining concert tour, entitled the [[Get Sleazy Tour]], in 2011. In January 2020, the title track \u201c[[Cannibal (Kesha song)|Cannibal]]\u201d enjoyed a resurgence in popularity due to its use on social media site TikTok. The song went so far as to reach the top forty on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=\"This year has been carnivorous and life-changing.

Erlewine was somewhat critical of the choice to release the EP noting that the only real reason for the release was that ''Animal'' had been \"squeezed dry of hits\".<ref name=\"Stephen\"/> Although critical of the re-release, Thomas' consensus of the album was positive, writing: \"aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal\u2019s brevity trumping the scattershot Animal \u2013 but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice. She\u2019s all ravenous id, spitting at strangers and backstabbing friends, humiliating hotties, and laughing at the wreckage in her wake. She is who she is and she offers no apologies.\"<ref name=\"Stephen\"/> Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented on Kesha's writing of the album noting that her \"herky-jerky rhymes still sound like they came from the bathroom wall of a reform-school kindergarten\", not citing that as a negative but instead noting that the album had a \"sulfurous end-of-days whiff about it\".<ref name=\"Leah1\"/> Greenblatt ended her review of the album giving it a rating of \"B+\" and called \"Sleazy\" and \"Blow\" the standout tracks on the album.<ref name=\"Leah1\"/> Will Hermes from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that Kesha's main pop competitor was [[Lady Gaga]] writing, \"This EP proves Kesha would kick Gaga's ass in a freestyle battle\" praising her rhyming and production by Dr. Luke calling Kesha the \"snap queen of clubland.\"<ref name=\"Will\"/> Chad Grischow from [[IGN]] met the album with a positive review, giving the album a score of 6.5 out of 10. Grischow was critical of the production of the album and overuse of [[Auto-Tune]] writing that there was \"so much overdubbing and autotune used that most of the songs may as well be sung by a spunky robot\". He also noted that when Kesha's vocals were stripped down she could actually sing, highlighting the ballads \"The Harold Song\" and \"C U Next Tuesday\" in the album's review.<ref name=\"Grischow\">{{cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/113/1135585p1.html |title=Kesha: Cannibal Review.

A complaint on the review was that the album was too similar to ''Animal'', noting that she failed to \"branch out in any significant way\" and the overuse of processed vocals.<ref name=\"Cinquemani\"/> Cinquemani ended the review praising the \"Animal (Billboard Remix)\" for its \"promise of something deeper, something beyond Dr. Luke's latest recycled formula.\"<ref

the album] nearly irrelevant.\"<ref name=\"Walters\"/> Mesfin Fekadu from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' was mixed in his review of the album.<ref name=\"Fekadu\"/> Fekadu criticized the album's lyrical depth and use of auto-tune writing that the album was \"filled with vapid lyrics and battles any T-Pain album for most use of the auto-tune.\" Kesha's mother, Pebe, was also targeted in the review

The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010). Originally, the record was thought to be released as a deluxe edition of ''Animal'', but was instead sold and released as both an EP and a deluxe edition of ''Animal''. Kesha worked with a variety of producers and writers such as executive producer [[Dr. Luke]], [[Benny Blanco]], [[Ammo (musician)|Ammo]], [[Max Martin]], Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on ''Cannibal'' are of the [[dance-pop]] genre, with some songs incorporating elements of [[Electro music|electro]] and [[electropop]] in their production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of [[Auto-Tune]] and [[vocoder]]s is prominent. Lyrically, the songs on ''Cannibal'' speak of ignoring judgement or hate and experiences based on love and heartbreak.\n\n''Cannibal'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. However, a common complaint amongst critics was the overuse of Auto-Tune, while the album's production was generally highlighted. The album's lyrics generally polarized music critics; some praised her boldness, while others criticized them as being too raunchy. In the United States, the EP reached a peak of fifteen on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, selling 74,000 copies in its first week of release. In Canada, the album achieved similar success, reaching a peak of fourteen on the country's albums chart. ''Cannibal'' was certified [[RIAA certifications|Platinum]] in 2018 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for sales of 1,000,000 copies.\n\nTwo singles were released from the album. The lead single, \"[[We R Who We R]]\", was a worldwide success, reaching number one in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and charting within the top ten in numerous other countries. In the United States, the song became the seventeenth song in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]'s history to debut at number one. The album's second single, \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", was released on February 8, 2011. The song reached top ten positions in multiple countries, including Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Kesha promoted the EP and her debut album by her first headlining concert tour, entitled the [[Get Sleazy Tour]], in 2011. In January 2020, the title track \u201c[[Cannibal (Kesha song)|Cannibal]]\u201d enjoyed a resurgence in popularity due to its use on social media site TikTok. The song went so far as to reach the top forty on the [[Canadian Hot 100]].\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=\"This year has been carnivorous and life-changing.

Erlewine was somewhat critical of the choice to release the EP noting that the only real reason for the release was that ''Animal'' had been \"squeezed dry of hits\".<ref name=\"Stephen\"/> Although critical of the re-release, Thomas' consensus of the album was positive, writing: \"aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal\u2019s brevity trumping the scattershot Animal \u2013 but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice. She\u2019s all ravenous id, spitting at strangers and backstabbing friends, humiliating hotties, and laughing at the wreckage in her wake. She is who she is and she offers no apologies.\"<ref name=\"Stephen\"/> Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented on Kesha's writing of the album noting that her \"herky-jerky rhymes still sound like they came from the bathroom wall of a reform-school kindergarten\", not citing that as a negative but instead noting that the album had a \"sulfurous end-of-days whiff about it\".<ref name=\"Leah1\"/> Greenblatt ended her review of the album giving it a rating of \"B+\" and called \"Sleazy\" and \"Blow\" the standout tracks on the album.<ref name=\"Leah1\"/> Will Hermes from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that Kesha's main pop competitor was [[Lady Gaga]] writing, \"This EP proves Kesha would kick Gaga's ass in a freestyle battle\" praising her rhyming and production by Dr. Luke calling Kesha the \"snap queen of clubland.\"<ref name=\"Will\"/> Chad Grischow from [[IGN]] met the album with a positive review, giving the album a score of 6.5 out of 10. Grischow was critical of the production of the album and overuse of [[Auto-Tune]] writing that there was \"so much overdubbing and autotune used that most of the songs may as well be sung by a spunky robot\". He also noted that when Kesha's vocals were stripped down she could actually sing, highlighting the ballads \"The Harold Song\" and \"C U Next Tuesday\" in the album's review.<ref name=\"Grischow\">{{cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/113/1135585p1.html |title=Kesha: Cannibal Review.

A complaint on the review was that the album was too similar to ''Animal'', noting that she failed to \"branch out in any significant way\" and the overuse of processed vocals.<ref

the album] nearly irrelevant.\"<ref name=\"Walters\"/> Mesfin Fekadu from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' was mixed in his review of the album.<ref name=\"Fekadu\"/> Fekadu criticized the album's lyrical depth and use of auto-tune writing that the album was \"filled with vapid lyrics and battles any T-Pain album for most use of the auto-tune.\" Kesha's mother, Pebe, was also targeted in the review criticizing her for helping write the album's title track, \"Cannibal\" which was called \"disturbing\" and \"sad\".<ref name=\"Fekadu\">{{cite

Before roads were developed,Thiruvalla village developed at the mouth of river Vallayar,connected far and near places through waterways, hence known as ''Valla v\u0101i''(v\u0101y in old Malayalam means mouth of river).<ref name=\":0\" /> Later the Dravidian Prefix 'Thiru (means holy /revered) attached to it and became Thiruvalla.\n\nAt the time of Aryan migration to south India it became one of the 64 Brahmin settlements. They correlated the name to \"Sree Vallabha\" means Husband of Lakshmi Devi. Sree Vallabha is the presiding deity of the Thiruvalla Temple and argues that shreevallabha Puram (Land of Vallabhan) became Thiruvalla.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thiruvalla as per the Sanskrit work \"\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0935\u0932\u094d\u0932\u092d \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u093e\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d\" (\u0d36\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d40\u0d35\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d2d \u0d15\u0d4d\u0d37\u0d47\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30 \u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d39\u0d3e\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02) (\u015br\u012bvallabha k\u1e63\u0113tra m\u0101h\u0101tmya\u1e41) is \"\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0935\u0932\u094d\u0932\u092d\u092a\u0941\u0930\u092e\u094d\" (\u0d36\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d40\u0d35\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d2d\u0d2a\u0d41\u0d30\u0d02)(\u015br\u012bvallabhapura\u1e41).

Thiruvalla has a large [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Non-Resident Indian Community]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nOld tradition tells that the name Thiruvalla comes from the word \"''Valla Vaay''\", named after the river Manimala which was known as ''Vallay\u0101r'' in ancient times. Before roads were developed,Thiruvalla village developed at the mouth of river Vallayar,connected far and near places through waterways, hence known as ''Valla v\u0101i''(v\u0101y in old Malayalam means mouth of river).<ref name=\":0\" /> Later the Dravidian Prefix 'Thiru (means holy /revered) attached to it and became Thiruvalla.\n\nAt the time of Aryan migration to south India it became one of the 64 Brahmin settlements. They correlated the name to \"Sree Vallabha\" means Husband of Lakshmi Devi. Sree Vallabha is the presiding deity of the Thiruvalla Temple and argues that shreevallabha Puram (Land of Vallabhan) became Thiruvalla.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thiruvalla as per the Sanskrit work \"\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0935\u0932\u094d\u0932\u092d \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u093e\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d\" (\u0d36\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d40\u0d35\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d2d \u0d15\u0d4d\u0d37\u0d47\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30 \u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d39\u0d3e\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02) (\u015br\u012bvallabha k\u1e63\u0113tra m\u0101h\u0101tmya\u1e41) is \"\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0935\u0932\u094d\u0932\u092d\u092a\u0941\u0930\u092e\u094d\" (\u0d36\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d40\u0d35\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d2d\u0d2a\u0d41\u0d30\u0d02)(\u015br\u012bvallabhapura\u1e41).

The Cathedral seats 720 people and is noted for its [[Franz Mayer & Co.]] stained glass, hand\u2013painted [[Stations of the Cross]], and [[neo-gothic architecture]]. The lower church includes a crypt where Bishop England (with his sister, Joanna) and four other Charleston bishops are buried. The spire was not built at the time due to the lack of funds during the construction of the cathedral and its numerous renovations. The church was finally completed on March 25, 2010, with the addition of the steeple and bells.<ref name=\"CentComp\">{{cite journal| last=Bergeron| first=Angelle| title=Centennial Completion| journal=Constructor| volume=93| issue=5| pages=15\u201316| publisher=McGraw-Hill Construction for Associated General Contractors of America| location=Arlington, Virginia| date=September\u2013October 2011| url=http://constructor.agc.org/mag/2011/Sept-Oct/1110-CentennialCompletion.asp| accessdate=October 24, 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006141858/http://constructor.agc.org/mag/2011/Sept-Oct/1110-CentennialCompletion.asp| archivedate=October 6, 2011}}</ref> The front iron fence to the east, is all that remains of the 1815 St. Andrews Society Hall, which also burned in 1861.\n\n==Architecture==\nKeely designed the cathedral in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]]; it is constructed of Connecticut [[brownstone]].<ref name=charcath>[https://charlestoncathedral.com/history/ \"History\", The Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist]</ref> The pews are of carved Flemish oak.\n\n==Chapels==\n*Sacred Heart - The chapel is situated just to the left of the [[cathedra]]. It originally served as the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, reflecting the fact that in certain Masses prior to 1968, when the bishop sat in front of the altar, the Blessed Sacrament was removed to this altar so that he would not have his back to the reserved Sacrament. It contains seven windows depicting symbols related to the [[Eucharist]]. In 2008, it briefly became the Chapel of Saint Paul for the ''Year of Saint Paul''. Then in 2009, it became the Sacred Heart Chapel, housing an early 1900s statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus with hands extended in blessing.\n*Blessed Virgin Mary - The altar in this chapel is adorned with an Italian Marble statue of the [[Madonna and Child]], sculpted by the German artist [[Ferdinand Pettrich]]. The statue is considered unique as it depicts Mary without a head covering, holding the child Jesus as a toddler. It is sometimes referred to as Our Lady of the South or Our Lady of the Confederacy (though not officially) having been purchased by Bishop Lynch, the Confederate Ambassador to the [[Holy See]] and third Bishop of Charleston. The chapel is adorned with seven windows depicting symbols related to Mary, Mother of God, and one floral design window completely obscured by the altar.\n*Our Lady of Grace - The main lower chapel used for daily Masses. The Chapel is adorned on one side with eight stained-glass windows removed from the former Immaculate Conception Church in Charleston. It originally had 20 windows from the church, but 12 were removed for various reasons over the years.\n*Saint John the Baptist Crypt Chapel - The resting place of the first five bishops of Charleston and Joanna Monica England, sister of the first Bishop of Charleston, [[John England (bishop)|John England]]. The bishops vest here for Holy Mass. The chapel contains one altar with a custom hand painted altarpiece depicting [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]] over the [[South Carolina]] landscape holding a lamb with two adoring angels, one holding a crosier and the other the diocesan coat of arms. In this chapel is a [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] holding a statue of [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] and the child [[Jesus]]. The crypt chapel is adorned with windows made from pieces of windows recovered from that were removed from Immaculate Conception Church.\n\n==Windows==\n[[File:Prodigal Son CHS cathedral.jpg|thumb|150px|left|alt=The return of the prodigal son is one of the many beautiful windows of the Cathedral.]]\n\nThe Cathedral is noted for its [[Franz Mayer & Co.]] stained-glass windows.

Each window has a coat of arms in its center.\n**The Main Doors - Bishop Northop's Coat of arms\n**The East Doors - the State of [[South Carolina]]'s Coat of arms<ref name=charcath/>\n**The West Doors - [[Pope Pius X]]'s Coat of arms\n*The large Life of Christ windows adorn the sides of the lower nave.\n*The windows in the upper nave are known as the Gallery of the Saints. They depict 28 saints.\n*The clerestory in the Sanctuary is adorned with windows depicting the four evangelists. Above the High Altar is the Chancel window.

The Cathedral seats 720 people and is noted for its [[Franz Mayer & Co.]] stained glass, hand\u2013painted [[Stations of the Cross]], and [[neo-gothic architecture]]. The lower church includes a crypt where Bishop England (with his sister, Joanna) and four other Charleston bishops are buried. The spire was not built at the time due to the lack of funds during the construction of the cathedral and its numerous renovations.

It originally served as the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, reflecting the fact that in certain Masses prior to 1968, when the bishop sat in front of the altar, the Blessed Sacrament was removed to this altar so that he would not have his back to the reserved Sacrament. It contains seven windows depicting symbols related to the [[Eucharist]]. In 2008, it briefly became the Chapel of Saint Paul for the ''Year of Saint Paul''. Then in 2009, it became the Sacred Heart Chapel, housing an early 1900s statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus with hands extended in blessing.\n*Blessed Virgin Mary - The altar in this chapel is adorned with an Italian Marble statue of the [[Madonna and Child]], sculpted by the German artist [[Ferdinand Pettrich]]. The statue is considered unique as it depicts Mary without a head covering, holding the child Jesus as a toddler. It is sometimes referred to as Our Lady of the South or Our Lady of the Confederacy (though not officially) having been purchased by Bishop Lynch, the Confederate Ambassador to the [[Holy See]] and third Bishop of Charleston. The chapel is adorned with seven windows depicting symbols related to Mary, Mother of God, and one floral design window completely obscured by the altar.\n*Our Lady of Grace - The main lower chapel used for daily Masses. The Chapel is adorned on one side with eight stained-glass windows removed from the former Immaculate Conception Church in Charleston. It originally had 20 windows from the church, but 12 were removed for various reasons over the years.\n*Saint John the Baptist Crypt Chapel - The resting place of the first five bishops of Charleston and Joanna Monica England, sister of the first Bishop of Charleston, [[John England (bishop)|John England]]. The bishops vest here for Holy Mass. The chapel contains one altar with a custom hand painted altarpiece depicting [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]] over the [[South Carolina]] landscape holding a lamb with two adoring angels, one holding a crosier and the other the diocesan coat of arms. In this chapel is a [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] holding a statue of [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] and the child [[Jesus]]. The crypt chapel is adorned with windows made from pieces of windows recovered from that were removed from Immaculate Conception Church.\n\n==Windows==\n[[File:Prodigal Son CHS cathedral.jpg|thumb|150px|left|alt=The return of the prodigal son is one of the many beautiful windows of the Cathedral.]]\n\nThe Cathedral is noted for its [[Franz Mayer & Co.]] stained-glass windows.

During the Reformation, Esztergom welcomed Jewish merchants and craftsmen, who built a synagogue for themselves. In 1858 another synagogue was erected on the site of today's synagogue - in the former village of Szenttam\u00e1s {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. About thirty years later, architect [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]], along with his colleague, [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]], was commissioned to design a new synagogue. This was Baumhorn's first solo work. The synagogue was designed in the style of late romance, originally single-story with a gallery for the women of the congregation. It was inaugurated in 1888 by [[Ign\u00e1c Weisz]], rabbi of Esztergom and [[Immanuel L\u00f6w|Imm\u00e1nuel L\u0151w]], the rabbi of [[Szeged]] {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Until World War II, it was frequented by the Jews of Esztergom and the surrounding villages. During World War II, the synagogue was bombed and badly damaged. Most of the Jews \u2014 about five hundred \u2014 were deported, and have not had a significant community in the city ever since. Since then, only the name Imah\u00e1z utca remains of the original purpose of the building {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\nThe empty building was awarded in 1964 to the organization of MTESZ (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in the city. This was when the first major renovations began. Space was partitioned with reinforced concrete slabs, breaking down the women's gallery. From 1980 to 1981, it housed the Tech House, which until 2006 served as a conference center. Over the next few years, the organization has continually renovated and completely restructured to be able to hold conferences and lectures. It has created lecture rooms, interpreting booths, rooms suitable for receptions, and district heating has been introduced. In 1996, the roof and dome shells were renovated. Accordingly, several prestigious events took place between the walls of the former Jewish temple. Politicians often gave lectures here on their tours {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. In 2006, the municipality bought the Technika House for 70 million HUF. After that, the office of the Ister-Granum Euroregion operated there for a short time, until in 2008 it moved to the building of the County Hall of Botty\u00e1n J\u00e1nos Street {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe two-story monument synagogue is 1216 square meters. On both sides of the fa\u00e7ade, there is a column-shaped, tower-like part of the building. These are connected by a triple-arched, arcaded foyer. There is a conference room upstairs with interpreting booths. The original 1888 marble staircase leads here. \n\nThe Martyr Monument in front of the building was made according to the plans of Istv\u00e1n Martsa. The original 2.5-meter bronze work was made for the monument competition in Mauthausen and was placed in the Hungarian barracks of the Auschwitz camp museum. Today's statue was erected in 1985. Its pedestal is a bonfire made of railway sleepers. A plaque commemorates the abductees on the wall of the building {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n== Sources ==\n* [http://epiteszforum.hu/node/12112 \u00c9p\u00edt\u00e9szf\u00f3rum - Az esztergomi zsinag\u00f3ga \u00fajj\u00e1\u00e9led\u00e9se]\n* Pifk\u00f3 P\u00e9ter \u2013 Zachar Anna:Esztergom helyt\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gi\u00e1ja a kezdetekt\u0151l 1950-ig\n* Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom megye m\u0171eml\u00e9kjegyz\u00e9ke (2006)\n* Esztergom 2000 enciklop\u00e9dia\n* Annales Strigonienses 1994, 145. o.\n\n[[Category:Synagogues in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Esztergom]]\n{{improve categories|date=April 2020}}\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}{{No footnotes|date=April 2020}}\n{{Short description|Synagogue in Hungary}}\n}}\n{{Infobox Historic building\n|image=Esztergom.Synagogue.jpg\n|caption=\n|name=Esztergom Synagogue\n|location_town=[[Esztergom]]\n|location_country=[[Hungary]]\n|architect=\n|client=\n|engineer=\n|construction_start_date=\n|completion_date=1888\n|date_demolished=\n|cost=\n|structural_system=\n|style= \n}}\n\nThe '''Esztergom Synagogue''' was the only synagogue of the [[Judaism|Jewish]] congregation in [[Hungary]] located in the [[Esztergom]]\ufffc\ufffc city between 1888 and the deportation of the [[Judaism]] during the Holocaust{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.
