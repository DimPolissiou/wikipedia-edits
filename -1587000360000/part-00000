As a follow-up to One Direction's internationally successful debut album ''[[Up All Night (One Direction album)|Up All Night]]'' (2011), ''Take Me Home'' was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Largely recorded and composed in Sweden during 2012, [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Rami Yacoub]] and [[Carl Falk]], who composed One Direction's hits, \"[[What Makes You Beautiful]]\" and \"[[One Thing (One Direction song)|One Thing]]\", spent six months in [[Stockholm]] developing songs for the album, and were able to shape [[melody|melodies]] around the members' tones.\n\nThe album's songs are characterised by [[Metronome|metronomic]] [[Pop music|pop]], vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, bright synthesisers, a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] sound and message, and rotations of [[lead vocal]]s. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, [[unrequited love]], the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. ''Take Me Home'' garnered mostly positive reviews from [[music critics]]. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.\n\nGlobally, the album topped the charts in more than 35 countries. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Take Me Home'' was the fourth-global-best-selling album of 2012, selling 4.4 million units.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/documents/RIN2013.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2013|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=8 June 2013|page=11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409080309/http://www.aria.com.au/documents/RIN2013.pdf|archive-date=9 April 2013}}</ref> The album's number-one debut on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart made One Direction the first group to bow atop the ''Billboard'' 200 with their first two albums since American girl group [[Danity Kane]] entered with ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse (album)|Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'' in 2008 and their [[Danity Kane (album)|self-titled debut]] in 2006. One Direction also became the second act in 2012 to achieve two number-one albums within a 12-month period, and the first boy band in US chart history to land two number-one albums in a calendar year. Their debut album and ''Take Me Home'' were the third and fifth-best-selling albums of 2012 in the United States, respectively, making the band the first act to place two albums in the year-end top five in the [[Nielsen SoundScan]] era.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"[[Live While We're Young]]\", released on 28 September 2012, peaked inside the top ten in almost every country it charted in and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-U.S. artist. The subsequent singles, \"[[Little Things (One Direction song)|Little Things]]\" and \"[[Kiss You (One Direction song)|Kiss You]]\", were less successful, although the former topped the [[UK Singles Chart]]. To promote the album, One Direction performed the album's songs on several televised programmes and a headlining sold-out concert at the [[Madison Square Garden]]. Furthermore, One Direction embarked on their second worldwide concert tour entitled the ''[[Take Me Home Tour (One Direction)|Take Me Home Tour]]'' in 2013.\n\n==Background and production==\n[[File:One Direction 2012 Stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One Direction greet Swedish fans in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], May 2012, as the recording commenced at Kinglet Studios]]\nIn 2012, One Direction revealed that a follow-up release to their debut album, ''[[Up All Night (One Direction album)|Up All Night]]'' (2011), was in development. \"In the summer, we're going to get back and start a new record.

As a follow-up to One Direction's internationally successful debut album ''[[Up All Night (One Direction album)|Up All Night]]'' (2011), ''Take Me Home'' was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Largely recorded and composed in Sweden during 2012, [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Rami Yacoub]] and [[Carl Falk]], who composed One Direction's hits, \"[[What Makes You Beautiful]]\" and \"[[One Thing (One Direction song)|One Thing]]\", spent six months in [[Stockholm]] developing songs for the album, and were able to shape [[melody|melodies]] around the members' tones.\n\nThe album's songs are characterised by [[Metronome|metronomic]] [[Pop music|pop]], vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, bright synthesisers, a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] sound and message, and rotations of [[lead vocal]]s. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, [[unrequited love]], the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. ''Take Me Home'' garnered mostly positive reviews from [[music critics]]. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.\n\nGlobally, the album topped the charts in more than 35 countries. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Take Me Home'' was the fourth-global-best-selling album of 2012, selling 4.4 million units.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/documents/RIN2013.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2013|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=8 June 2013|page=11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409080309/http://www.aria.com.au/documents/RIN2013.pdf|archive-date=9 April 2013}}</ref> The album's number-one debut on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart made One Direction the first group to bow atop the ''Billboard'' 200 with their first two albums since American girl group [[Danity Kane]] entered with ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse (album)|Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'' in 2008 and their [[Danity Kane (album)|self-titled debut]] in 2006. One Direction also became the second act in 2012 to achieve two number-one albums within a 12-month period, and the first boy band in US chart history to land two number-one albums in a calendar year. Their debut album and ''Take Me Home'' were the third and fifth-best-selling albums of 2012 in the United States, respectively, making the band the first act to place two albums in the year-end top five in the [[Nielsen SoundScan]] era.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"[[Live While We're Young]]\", released on 28 September 2012, peaked inside the top ten in almost every country it charted in and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-U.S. artist. The subsequent singles, \"[[Little Things (One Direction song)|Little Things]]\" and \"[[Kiss You (One Direction song)|Kiss You]]\", were less successful, although the former topped the [[UK Singles Chart]]. To promote the album, One Direction performed the album's songs on several televised programmes and a headlining sold-out concert at the [[Madison Square Garden]]. Furthermore, One Direction embarked on their second worldwide concert tour entitled the ''[[Take Me Home Tour (One Direction)|Take Me Home Tour]]'' in 2013.\n\n==Background and production==\n[[File:One Direction 2012 Stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One Direction greet Swedish fans in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], May 2012, as the recording commenced at Kinglet Studios]]\nIn 2012, One Direction revealed that a follow-up release to their debut album, ''[[Up All Night (One Direction album)|Up All Night]]'' (2011), was in development. \"In the summer, we're going to get back and start a new record.

The design is based on the Al-Ahram typeface designed by Zapf in 1956 but reworked and modified to fit the Palatino nova family. The design is [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] in style but with a strong influence of [[Thuluth]] style.\n\nThis family only comes in 1 font, with the Arabic characters based on Palatino nova Regular.

([[Antiqua (typeface class)|\"Antiqua\"]] is another word for the \"[[Roman type|Roman]]\" style of typefaces that Palatino is based on, as opposed to [[blackletter]]. The genre, inspired by Italian traditions of handwriting and calligraphy, has been a dominant influence on most typefaces and lettering created in the Western world since the Renaissance.<ref name=\"Eisenstein2005\">{{cite book|first=Elizabeth|last=Eisenstein|author-link=Elizabeth Eisenstein|title=The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe|url=https://archive.org/details/printingrevoluti00eise_0|url-access=registration|date=12 September 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84543-4|pages=[https://archive.org/details/printingrevoluti00eise_0/page/123 123]\u2013163}}</ref>)\n\nIn 1993, Zapf resigned from l'Association Typographique Internationale ([[ATypI]]) over what he viewed as its hypocritical attitude toward unauthorized copying by prominent ATypI members (namely [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]]).
