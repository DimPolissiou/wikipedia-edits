The last remnant of Tuniit were [[Sadlermiut]] who disappeared in the early 1900s. \n\nInuit replaced the local [[Dorset culture]] over the course of around 200 years in the first millennium CE.\n\nDisplacement of the Tuniit ''\u1450\u14c3\u1466'', or the Dorset people, and arrival of the Inuit (whose ancestors are often called [[Thule people|Thule]]) occurred in the 1100-1300s CE. Coming from [[Siberia]] where they split from the [[Aleut]] and other related peoples about 4,000 years ago, Inuit had reached Inughuit Nunaat in western Greenland by about 1300 CE, bringing with them transport dogs and various new technologies.\n\nTrade relations were and remain strong with bordering countries and nations,<ref>{{cite web |title=Inuit Trade in the Central Arctic |url=http://www.inuitcontact.ca/index.php?/vignettes_en/inuit_trade_eng |website=Inuit contact and colonization |publisher=Inuit Heritage Trust |accessdate=20 June 2019}}</ref> such as with the [[Gwich'in]]<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Black |editor1-first=Scott |editor2-last=Montgomery |editor2-first=Georgina |editor3-last=Fehr |editor3-first=Alan |title=Canada's Western Arctic |date=2002 |publisher=Western Arctic Handbook Committee |location=Inuvik, Denendeh/Nunangit, Canada |isbn=0-9687910-0-X |pages=342 |url=https://www.gwichin.ca/sites/default/files/gsci_kritsch_andre_2002_w_arctic_handbook.pdf |accessdate=20 June 2019}}</ref> and [[Chipewyan]] (D\u00ebnes\u0173\u0142\u0131\u0328n\u00e9)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Csonka |first1=Yvon |title=A stereotype further dispelled: Inuit-Dene relations west of Hudson Bay, 1920\u20131956 |journal=\u00c9tudes/Inuit/Studies |date=1999 |volume=23 |issue=1/2 |pages=117\u2013144 |jstor=42870948 }}</ref> of Denendeh and [[Innu]] of [[Nitassinan]] ''\u14c2\u1455\u1505\u14ef\u14c7\u14d0'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Innu Culture |url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/aboriginal/innu-culture.php |website=Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador |publisher=Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador |accessdate=20 June 2019}}</ref> though occasional conflicts arose.

Nunangit came under the jurisdiction of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation two years after the 1984 ''Inuvialuit Final Agreement'', and Nunatsiavut was granted an autonomous government in 2005 after the 2002 Labrador Inuit Association proposal for a separate government. Beginning with a land claim in 1977, negotiations launched in 1988 between the Labrador Inuit Association, the governments of Newfoundland and Labrador and that of Canada. In Northern Quebec, the [[Makivik Corporation]] was established upon the ''[[James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement]]'' signing in 1978, taking the mantle from the previous Nunavimmiut \"Northern Quebec Inuit Association\" (''\u146f\u1438\u1403\u1483 \u1455\u1550\u154b\u1593\u14c2 \u1403\u14c4\u1403\u1466 \u1472\u1450\u153e\u1528\u1583\u144e\u148c\u158f\u1466 Kupaik Tarrangani Inuit Katujjiqatigiingit'').\n\nFinally, not formally within Inuit Nunangat is NunatuKavut whose treaty with the British extends back to 1765 and remains in force,<ref>{{cite web |title=British-Inuit Treaty of 1765 |url=http://www.nunatukavut.ca/home/330 |website=NunatuKavut Our Ancient Land |publisher=NunatuKavut |accessdate=20 June 2019}}</ref> with the NunatuKavut Community Council (NCC) overseeing governance in this region.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Governance |url=http://www.nunatukavut.ca/home/335 |website=NunatuKavut Our Ancient Land |publisher=NunatuKavut |accessdate=20 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:NWT-YT Inuvialuit Settlement Locator.svg|thumb|[[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]]]]\n[[File:Localisation Nunavut.svg|thumb|[[Nunavut]]]]\n[[File:Quebec Nunavik location map.svg|thumb|[[Nunavik]]]]\n[[File:Nunatsiavut.png|thumb|[[Nunatsiavut]]]]\nAs of the [[2016 Canadian Census]] the population of Inuit Nunangat was 56,585.

The [[type species]] ''D. terrelli'' was originally described in 1873 as a species of ''[[Dinichthys]]''. ''Dunkleosteus'' is an [[arthrodire]] originally placed in the family [[Dinichthyidae]], which is composed mostly of large, carnivorous fish like ''[[Gorgonichthys]]''. Anderson (2009) suggests, because of its primitive [[Fish jaw|jaw structure]], ''Dunkleosteus'' should be placed outside the family Dinichthyidae, perhaps close to the base of the clade Pachyosteomorpha, near ''[[Eastmanosteus]]''.

It has a rounded snout. ''D. terrelli''{{'s}} fossil remains are found in Upper Frasnian to Upper Famennian Late Devonian strata of the United States (Huron and [[Cleveland Shale]] of Ohio, the Conneaut of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Chattanooga Shale]] of Tennessee, [[Lost Burro Formation]], California, and possibly Ives [[breccia]] of Texas<ref name=Denison/>) and Europe.\n\n''D. belgicus'' (?) is known from fragments described from the [[Famennian]] of [[Belgium]].

It was originally described as \"''[[Dinichthys]] magnificus''\" by Hussakof and Bryant in 1919, then as \"'' Dinichthys mirabilis''\" by Heintz in 1932. Dunkle and Lane moved it to ''Dunkleosteus'' in 1971.<ref name=Denison/>\n\n''D. missouriensis'' is known from fragments from Frasnian [[Missouri]].

The species name means \"blunt spear\" and refers to the way the [[nuchal]] and [[paranuchal]] plates in the back of the head form the shape of a blunted spearhead.

Besides its small size, it had comparatively large eyes. Because ''D. raveri'' was found in the strata directly below the strata where the remains of ''D. terrelli'' are found, ''D. raveri'' may have given rise to ''D. terrelli''.

However, an exceptionally preserved specimen of ''D. terrelli'' preserves ceratotrichia in a pectoral fin, implying that the fin morphology of placoderms was much more variable than previously thought, and was heavily influenced by locomotory requirements. This knowledge, coupled with the knowledge that fish morphology is more heavily influenced by feeding niche than phylogeny, allowed a 2017 study to infer the body shape of ''D. terrelli''.

The name ''Dunkleosteus'' combines the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f40\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd}}, ''osteon'', meaning \"bone\", and ''Dunkle'', in honor of David Dunkle of the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]]. It consists of ten species: ''D. terrelli'', ''D. belgicus'', ''D. denisoni'', ''D. marsaisi'', ''D. magnificus'', ''D. missouriensis'', ''D. newberryi'', ''D. amblyodoratus'', and ''D. raveri''; some of which are among the largest placoderms to have ever lived. The largest species, ''D. terrelli'' grew up to {{convert|8.79|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} long<ref name=\"Ferron2017\"></ref> and {{convert|4|MT|ST|abbr=on}} in weight. Dunkleosteus could quickly open and close its jaw, like modern day [[Aquatic feeding mechanisms#Suction feeding|suction feeders]], and had a bite force of {{convert|6000|N|kg-f lb-f|0|abbr=on}} at the tip and {{convert|7400|N|kg-f lb-f|0|abbr=on}} at the blade edge. Numerous [[fossils]] of the various species have been found in [[North America]], [[Poland]], [[Belgium]], and [[Morocco]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Dunkleosteus Artist's Impression.png|thumb|Restoration and size comparison of ''D. terrelli'']]\n''Dunkleosteus'' was named in 1956 to honour [[David Dunkle]], then curator of [[vertebrate paleontology]] at the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]]. The [[type species]] ''D. terrelli'' was originally described in 1873 as a species of ''[[Dinichthys]]''. ''Dunkleosteus'' is an [[arthrodire]] originally placed in the family [[Dinichthyidae]], which is composed mostly of large, carnivorous fish like ''[[Gorgonichthys]]''. Anderson (2009) suggests, because of its primitive [[Fish jaw|jaw structure]], ''Dunkleosteus'' should be placed outside the family Dinichthyidae, perhaps close to the base of the clade Pachyosteomorpha, near ''[[Eastmanosteus]]''.

It was originally described as \"''[[Dinichthys]] magnificus''\" by Hussakof and Bryant in 1919, then as \"'' Dinichthys mirabilis''\" by Heintz in 1932. Dunkle and Lane moved it to ''Dunkleosteus'' in 1971.<ref name=Denison/>\n\n''D. missouriensis'' is known from fragments from Frasnian [[Missouri]].

The species name means \"blunt spear\" and refers to the way the [[nuchal]] and [[paranuchal]] plates in the back of the head form the shape of a blunted spearhead. Although it is known only from fragments, it is estimated to have been about {{convert|6|m|ft|1}} long in life.<ref name=\"Carr+2010\"/>\n\n''D. raveri'' is a small species, possibly 1 meter long, known from an uncrushed skull roof found in a carbonate concretion from near the bottom of the Huron Shale, of the Famennian [[Ohio Shale]] strata. Besides its small size, it had comparatively large eyes. Because ''D. raveri'' was found in the strata directly below the strata where the remains of ''D. terrelli'' are found, ''D. raveri'' may have given rise to ''D. terrelli''.

However, an exceptionally preserved specimen of ''D. terrelli'' preserves ceratotrichia in a pectoral fin, implying that the fin morphology of placoderms was much more variable than previously thought, and was heavily influenced by locomotory requirements. This knowledge, coupled with the knowledge that fish morphology is more heavily influenced by feeding niche than phylogeny, allowed a 2017 study to infer the body shape of ''D. terrelli''.

The scene as written had minimal direction, but Seehorn, in preparing for the shot, saw a number of subtleties with the scene that suggested she knew Jimmy intimately, that she had boundaries, and she was used to cleaning up after Jimmy's mistakes. She also felt from this scene that Kim would prefer to listen before speaking and using that as a position of power. The writers saw how Seehorn acted out the scene and realizes how much more it defined the character going forward, someone that prioritized work and placed boundaries on her relationship with Jimmy but still cared for him. Gilligan considered Seehorn's ongoing performance as Kim essential to her development.<ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nWith this change, the writers saw Kim no longer being as moral as planned and gave her a darker side that arose from her childhood, something that gave her a chip on her shoulder that would make her give in to more unethical approaches if it got the job done, and thus one that readily feel into work alongside Jimmy in his cons after fighting her reluctant nature to join in.<ref name=\"vulture\" /> During the first two seasons, Kim was rarely seen without a business suit or a tight [[ponytail]], a choice made between Seehorn, Gilligan, Gould and stylist Trish Almeida to show that Kim was \"all business\". In the third season, Kim gets into a car accident, breaking her arm which in actuality would make it difficult for Kim to put up her hair in a ponytail without significant effort. At this point, as Kim's character was starting to become unraveled, Almeida and Seeborn used how tight the ponytail was set as an implicit sign of Kim's internal turmoil: when it was set tight, Kim was focused on her job, but if was loose, it meant she was struggling with sadness and worry.<ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nGilligan has called Kim's arc through the fifth season an \"impending tragedy\", as her nearly-illegal actions are towards \"self-destructive behavior\".<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Katie Beth Hall portrays a young Kim in a flashback in \"[[Wexler v. Goodman]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-6-wexler-goodman-969907/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Recap: Girl, Interrupted |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=March 23, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401233911/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-6-wexler-goodman-969907/ |archive-date=April 1, 2020 |access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n=== Background ===\nAs described in flashbacks, Kim Wexler says she was raised in several [[Nebraska]] towns, including [[Red Cloud, Nebraska|Red Cloud]], but is intentionally vague about her past. In a flashback in \"Wexler v. Goodman\", Kim as a teenager is shown to have become self-reliant due to her mother's alcoholism. In \"[[The Guy for This]]\", she claims that as a child, her mother frequently moved them from place to place to keep one step ahead of landlords to whom they owed back rent, and never had a place to call home herself. Kim further claims she moved to Albuquerque because of the limited opportunities available in her hometown. Kim worked in the mailroom at Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill (HHM), where Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill were lead partners.  Chuck's younger brother Jimmy was employed in the mailroom because of Chuck's insistence that he work a legitimate job and rid himself of his [[con artist]] past. With HHM loaning her the money to pay for law school, she completed her education and then joined the firm as an associate.  She soon became one of HHM's top lawyers, and her success inspired Jimmy to secretly attend a distance learning law school and become an attorney.  With Kim's encouragement, Jimmy started a solo practice after HHM decided against hiring him as an associate.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nIn the show's present (2002), Jimmy, angered by how Chuck and Howard have treated him, has run-ins with HHM, including stealing a case from them and placing a billboard ad for his firm that copies Howard's signature look, the HHM colors, and HHM's logo. Kim follows Howard's direction to talk to Jimmy, but finds Jimmy's use of con games interesting; Jimmy, suggests that she should leave HHM and set up a firm with him. The fallout from Jimmy's actions cause Kim to lose some of her standing within HHM. She becomes more disenchanted with HHM after Jimmy brings the firm a potentially multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit against the Sandpiper retirement communities, only for Chuck to use Howard in blocking Jimmy's participation on the case.  When the case grows in size, HHM calls on the services of another firm, Davis & Main, and Kim recommends Jimmy to them due to his familiarity with the case and rapport with the clients. Her recommendation results in Jimmy being offered an associate's position with D&M, which would enable him to continue working on the Sandpiper case.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy is reluctant to take the job at Davis & Main, and hides away at a luxury hotel using an assumed name and stolen credit card. Kim tracks him down and tries to convince him to take the job. Instead, Jimmy brings her in on a con, convincing another hotel patron to pay for an expensive bottle of tequila. The con is a success, and they spend the night together; Kim keeps the elaborate bottle stopper as a memento.\n\nJimmy accepts the Davis & Main job and works with Kim on the Sandpiper lawsuit. Jimmy skirts the law in soliciting Sandpiper residents to join the class, creating the potential for damage to Davis & Main's reputation among its more conservative clients.  Later, he prepares a television advertisement to attract more members for the class, and airs it without getting the approval of his D&M superiors. Kim covers for him at HHM, staining her reputation even further.  Jimmy offers to quit Davis & Main if it will help restore's Kim's reputation, but she insists she reclaim her standing at the firm on her own.  Kim works her law school and professional contacts in the hopes of obtaining a major new client for HHM, and succeeds in convincing a large regional bank, Mesa Verde, to retain HHM as outside counsel.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Reduced to entry-level document review and arguing unwinnable motions in court, Kim's courtroom proficiency draws the attention of Richard Schweikart, a partner at Schweikart & Cokely. Schweikart tells Kim HHM is not appreciative of her talents and offers her a position at his firm. Kim considers the offer while sitting at a bar, and begins talking to a man she recognizes as a potential mark.  She calls Jimmy to join her, and they successfully complete another con, followed by another night together. Kim decides to leave HHM and establish her own solo practice, with Jimmy forming a solo practice in the same office so they can share expenses.  Kim tries to bring Mesa Verde with her, and appears to succeed, but Chuck wins them back to HHM.  Knowing that Kim wants Mesa Verde, Jimmy tampers with important documents in one of Chuck's filings on the bank's behalf.  Inconsistencies in the documents at the state banking board meeting call Chuck's competence into question.  Mesa Verde signs on with Kim, and Chuck becomes obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt, and tells him that if there is any evidence, Chuck will find it. Jimmy realizes the clerk at the copy store where he altered the documents can identify him, so he goes to the store to buy the clerk's silence.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck becomes increasingly obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage and tricks him into an incriminating statement, which Chuck records. Learning of the recording from Ernesto, Kim counsels Jimmy to wait and see what Chuck intends to do with it, but Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to confront him, enabling Chuck to have Jimmy arrested.  Jimmy faces a bar investigation, and Kim and Jimmy's strategy of exposing Chuck's [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] as a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] illness discredits his testimony.  Jimmy is suspended from practicing law for a year, but not disbarred.  Chuck's paranoid performance as a witness degrades his professional reputation, and HHM loses standing in Albuquerque's legal community. While Jimmy tries various ways to generate income so Kim and he can keep their shared office, Kim takes on a second client. Rushing to a meeting after little sleep, she crashes her car and breaks her arm.  To save money, Kim and Jimmy break the lease on their office and Kim practices from home, while Jimmy helps her with day-to-day activities because her arm is in a cast during her recovery.  Howard forces Chuck out of HHM, and an increasingly erratic Chuck sets a fire in his home by knocking over a camping lantern, but makes no attempt to leave.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nFollowing Chuck's suicide, Kim tries without success to break Jimmy out of his despondent mood.  Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he thinks that his decision to force Chuck's retirement from HHM after their malpractice insurance rates rose led to Chuck's death.  Jimmy conceals his role in causing the rate increase, allows Howard to shoulder the blame, and regains his usual happy-go-lucky demeanor.  Unaware of Jimmy's actions, Kim later berates Howard for mistreating Jimmy.

The scene as written had minimal direction, but Seehorn, in preparing for the shot, saw a number of subtleties with the scene that suggested she knew Jimmy intimately, that she had boundaries, and she was used to cleaning up after Jimmy's mistakes. She also felt from this scene that Kim would prefer to listen before speaking and using that as a position of power. The writers saw how Seehorn acted out the scene and realizes how much more it defined the character going forward, someone that prioritized work and placed boundaries on her relationship with Jimmy but still cared for him. Gilligan considered Seehorn's ongoing performance as Kim essential to her development.<ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nWith this change, the writers saw Kim no longer being as moral as planned and gave her a darker side that arose from her childhood, something that gave her a chip on her shoulder that would make her give in to more unethical approaches if it got the job done, and thus one that readily feel into work alongside Jimmy in his cons after fighting her reluctant nature to join in.<ref name=\"vulture\" /> During the first two seasons, Kim was rarely seen without a business suit or a tight [[ponytail]], a choice made between Seehorn, Gilligan, Gould and stylist Trish Almeida to show that Kim was \"all business\". In the third season, Kim gets into a car accident, breaking her arm which in actuality would make it difficult for Kim to put up her hair in a ponytail without significant effort. At this point, as Kim's character was starting to become unraveled, Almeida and Seeborn used how tight the ponytail was set as an implicit sign of Kim's internal turmoil: when it was set tight, Kim was focused on her job, but if was loose, it meant she was struggling with sadness and worry.<ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nGilligan has called Kim's arc through the fifth season an \"impending tragedy\", as her nearly-illegal actions are towards \"self-destructive behavior\".<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Katie Beth Hall portrays a young Kim in a flashback in \"[[Wexler v. Goodman]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-6-wexler-goodman-969907/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Recap: Girl, Interrupted |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=March 23, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401233911/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-6-wexler-goodman-969907/ |archive-date=April 1, 2020 |access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Character biography ==\n=== Background ===\nAs described in flashbacks, Kim Wexler says she was raised in several [[Nebraska]] towns, including [[Red Cloud, Nebraska|Red Cloud]], but is intentionally vague about her past. In a flashback in \"Wexler v. Goodman\", Kim as a teenager is shown to have become self-reliant due to her mother's alcoholism. In \"[[The Guy for This]]\", she claims that as a child, her mother frequently moved them from place to place to keep one step ahead of landlords to whom they owed back rent, and never had a place to call home herself. Kim further claims she moved to Albuquerque because of the limited opportunities available in her hometown. Kim worked in the mailroom at Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill (HHM), where Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill were lead partners.  Chuck's younger brother Jimmy was employed in the mailroom because of Chuck's insistence that he work a legitimate job and rid himself of his [[con artist]] past. With HHM loaning her the money to pay for law school, she completed her education and then joined the firm as an associate.  She soon became one of HHM's top lawyers, and her success inspired Jimmy to secretly attend a distance learning law school and become an attorney.  With Kim's encouragement, Jimmy started a solo practice after HHM decided against hiring him as an associate.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nIn the show's present (2002), Jimmy, angered by how Chuck and Howard have treated him, has run-ins with HHM, including stealing a case from them and placing a billboard ad for his firm that copies Howard's signature look, the HHM colors, and HHM's logo. Kim follows Howard's direction to talk to Jimmy, but finds Jimmy's use of con games interesting; Jimmy, suggests that she should leave HHM and set up a firm with him. The fallout from Jimmy's actions cause Kim to lose some of her standing within HHM. She becomes more disenchanted with HHM after Jimmy brings the firm a potentially multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit against the Sandpiper retirement communities, only for Chuck to use Howard in blocking Jimmy's participation on the case.  When the case grows in size, HHM calls on the services of another firm, Davis & Main, and Kim recommends Jimmy to them due to his familiarity with the case and rapport with the clients. Her recommendation results in Jimmy being offered an associate's position with D&M, which would enable him to continue working on the Sandpiper case.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy is reluctant to take the job at Davis & Main, and hides away at a luxury hotel using an assumed name and stolen credit card. Kim tracks him down and tries to convince him to take the job. Instead, Jimmy brings her in on a con, convincing another hotel patron to pay for an expensive bottle of tequila. The con is a success, and they spend the night together; Kim keeps the elaborate bottle stopper as a memento.\n\nJimmy accepts the Davis & Main job and works with Kim on the Sandpiper lawsuit. Jimmy skirts the law in soliciting Sandpiper residents to join the class, creating the potential for damage to Davis & Main's reputation among its more conservative clients.  Later, he prepares a television advertisement to attract more members for the class, and airs it without getting the approval of his D&M superiors. Kim covers for him at HHM, staining her reputation even further.  Jimmy offers to quit Davis & Main if it will help restore's Kim's reputation, but she insists she reclaim her standing at the firm on her own.  Kim works her law school and professional contacts in the hopes of obtaining a major new client for HHM, and succeeds in convincing a large regional bank, Mesa Verde, to retain HHM as outside counsel.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Reduced to entry-level document review and arguing unwinnable motions in court, Kim's courtroom proficiency draws the attention of Richard Schweikart, a partner at Schweikart & Cokely. Schweikart tells Kim HHM is not appreciative of her talents and offers her a position at his firm. Kim considers the offer while sitting at a bar, and begins talking to a man she recognizes as a potential mark.  She calls Jimmy to join her, and they successfully complete another con, followed by another night together. Kim decides to leave HHM and establish her own solo practice, with Jimmy forming a solo practice in the same office so they can share expenses.  Kim tries to bring Mesa Verde with her, and appears to succeed, but Chuck wins them back to HHM.  Knowing that Kim wants Mesa Verde, Jimmy tampers with important documents in one of Chuck's filings on the bank's behalf.  Inconsistencies in the documents at the state banking board meeting call Chuck's competence into question.  Mesa Verde signs on with Kim, and Chuck becomes obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt, and tells him that if there is any evidence, Chuck will find it. Jimmy realizes the clerk at the copy store where he altered the documents can identify him, so he goes to the store to buy the clerk's silence.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck becomes increasingly obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage and tricks him into an incriminating statement, which Chuck records. Learning of the recording from Ernesto, Kim counsels Jimmy to wait and see what Chuck intends to do with it, but Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to confront him, enabling Chuck to have Jimmy arrested.  Jimmy faces a bar investigation, and Kim and Jimmy's strategy of exposing Chuck's [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] as a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] illness discredits his testimony.  Jimmy is suspended from practicing law for a year, but not disbarred.  Chuck's paranoid performance as a witness degrades his professional reputation, and HHM loses standing in Albuquerque's legal community. While Jimmy tries various ways to generate income so Kim and he can keep their shared office, Kim takes on a second client. Rushing to a meeting after little sleep, she crashes her car and breaks her arm.  To save money, Kim and Jimmy break the lease on their office and Kim practices from home, while Jimmy helps her with day-to-day activities because her arm is in a cast during her recovery.  Howard forces Chuck out of HHM, and an increasingly erratic Chuck sets a fire in his home by knocking over a camping lantern, but makes no attempt to leave.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nFollowing Chuck's suicide, Kim tries without success to break Jimmy out of his despondent mood.  Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he thinks that his decision to force Chuck's retirement from HHM after their malpractice insurance rates rose led to Chuck's death.  Jimmy conceals his role in causing the rate increase, allows Howard to shoulder the blame, and regains his usual happy-go-lucky demeanor.  Unaware of Jimmy's actions, Kim later berates Howard for mistreating Jimmy. Kim works on Mesa Verde's rapid regional expansion, but is increasingly bored with banking law, so she begins taking ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases, which she finds more interesting and satisfying. After she is reprimanded by Paige for putting her ''pro bono'' work ahead of Mesa Verde's, Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely to hire her as a partner to manage a new banking division, which enables her to handle the Mesa Verde work while continuing to devote time and effort to criminal defense cases.  With her career becoming more successful, she becomes more distant from Jimmy, who works a boring job as a cellular phone store manager while he serves out the suspension of his law license.\n\nBy 2004 Jimmy has a lucrative side business reselling prepaid cellular phones on the street under the alias Saul Goodman, and hires Huell Babineaux as his bodyguard.  Huell has a run-in with a police officer, who arrests him, and Jimmy convinces Kim to defend Huell to keep him from receiving a prison sentence. Finding it impossible to convince the prosecuting attorney to enter into a plea bargain, Kim and Jimmy run a con to fake a show of support for Huell in his hometown.  They keep Huell out of prison, and then engage in a con that enables Kim to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in [[Lubbock, Texas]] with plans for a larger building, saving time and expense by bypassing the city zoning and planning approval processes.
