The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], who defeated an army commanded by [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to Constantinople and established his court there.\n\nThe capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.\n\nIt was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of [[gunpowder]] (which powered formidable cannons).<ref name=\"econfallmill\" />\n\nThe conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event in the [[Late Middle Ages]] which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.<ref name=\"GpAG8\" />\n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century. Thessaloniki was captured by the Ottomans in 1430. A few islands in the Aegean and the [[Propontis]] remained under Byzantine rule until 1453 (not shown on the map).]]\n\nIn the summer of 1452, when [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumel\u0131 Hisari]] was completed and the threat had become imminent, Constantine wrote to the Pope, promising to implement the Union, which was declared valid by a half-hearted imperial court on 12 December 1452.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}} Although he was eager for an advantage, Pope Nicholas V did not have the influence the Byzantines thought he had over the Western kings and princes, some of whom were wary of increasing papal control, and these had not the wherewithal to contribute to the effort, especially in light of the weakened state of France and England from the [[Hundred Years' War]], Spain, being in the final part of the [[Reconquista]], the internecine fighting in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and Hungary and Poland's defeat at the [[Battle of Varna]] of 1444. Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the [[Golden Horn]] offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from [[Venice]], and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|81}}\n\nIn Venice, meanwhile, deliberations were taking place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set out late in April, it was already too late for it to be able to take part in the battle.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}} Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors\u2014even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}}<ref name=\"ThackerayFindling2012\" /><ref name=\"Norwich1998\" /><ref name=\"Somerwil-Ayrton2007\" /><ref name=\"Roberts1973\" /><ref name=\"Brownworth2009\" /><ref name=\"Norwich v.3\" />\n\n[[File:Walls of Constantinople.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1|Restored Walls of Constantinople]]\n[[File:Hali\u00e7 zinciri (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[boom (navigational barrier)|chain]] that closed off the entrance to the Golden Horn in 1453, now on display in the [[\u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]\n\nFearing a possible naval attack along the shores of the Golden Horn, Emperor Constantine XI ordered that a [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] be placed at the mouth of the harbour. This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards. The land fortifications comprised a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide moat fronting inner and outer [[Battlement|crenellated walls]] studded with towers every 45\u201355 metres.<ref name=\"f6GY9\" />\n\n===Strength===\n[[File:Siege of Constantinople 1453 map-fr.svg|thumb|left|Map of Constantinople and the dispositions of the defenders and the besiegers]]\n\nThe army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totalling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners.{{NoteTag|According to Sphrantzes, whom Constantine had ordered to make a census, the Emperor was appalled when the number of native men capable of bearing arms turned out to be only 4,983. Leonardo di Chio gave a number of 6,000 Greeks.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}}}} At the onset of the siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|32}} {{NoteTag|The Spanish [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villal\u00f3n]] claims there were ' 60,000 Turkish households, 40,000 Greek and Armenian, 10,000 Jewish.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}}}} Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople in the pay of the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally [[monks]]. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the citizens repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers.\n\nThe Ottomans had a much larger force. Recent studies and Ottoman archival data state that there were about 50,000\u201380,000 Ottoman soldiers including between 5,000 and 10,000 [[Janissary|Janissaries]],<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}, 70 [[cannon]]s<ref name=\"battle100\" />{{rp|139\u2013140}}<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"halilosmanimpklas\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}, an elite infantry corps, and thousands of Christian troops, notably 1,500 Serbian cavalry{{cn|date=February 2020}} that the [[Serbs|Serbian]] lord [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] was forced to supply as part of his obligation to the Ottoman sultan\u2014just a few months before, he had supplied the money for the reconstruction of the walls of Constantinople.

They were built at [[foundries]] that employed Turkish cannon founders and technicians, most notably Saruca, in addition to at least one foreign cannon founder, [[Orban]] (also called Urban). Most of the cannons at the siege were built by Turkish engineers, including a large bombard by Saruca, while one cannon was built by Orban, who contributed a large bombard.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" />\n\nOrban, a Hungarian (though some suggest he was German), was a somewhat mysterious figure.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|374}} His cannon was named \"[[Basilic (cannon)|Basilica]]\" and was {{convert|27|ft|m}} long, and able to hurl a 600&nbsp;lb (272&nbsp;kg) stone ball over a mile (1.6&nbsp;km).<ref name=\"q6rsq\" /> The founder initially tried to sell his services to the Byzantines, who were unable to secure the funds needed to hire him. Orban then left Constantinople and approached Mehmed II, claiming that his weapon could blast 'the walls of [[Babylon]] itself'. Given abundant funds and materials, the Hungarian engineer built the gun within three months at [[Edirne]], from which it was dragged by sixty oxen to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|77\u201378}}  This was the only cannon that Orban built for the Ottoman forces at Constantinople.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" /> Orban's cannon had several drawbacks: it took three hours to reload; cannonballs were in very short supply; and the cannon is said to have collapsed under its own recoil after six weeks. The account of the cannon's collapse is disputed,<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} given that it was only reported in the letter of Archbishop Leonardo di Chio<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" /> and in the later, and often unreliable, Russian chronicle of [[Nestor Iskander]].{{NoteTag|Another expert who was employed by the Ottomans was [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli]], also known as Ciriaco of [[Ancona]], a traveler and collector of antiquities.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}}}\n\n[[File:Conquest_of_Constantinople,_Zonaro.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Modern painting of Mehmed and the Ottoman Army approaching Constantinople with a giant bombard, by [[Fausto Zonaro]].]]\n\nHaving previously established a large foundry about {{convert|150|mi|km}} away, Mehmed now had to undertake the painstaking process of transporting his massive artillery pieces. Orban's giant cannon was said to have been accompanied by a crew of 60 oxen and over 400 men.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|374}} There was another large bombard, independently built by Turkish engineer Saruca, that was also used in the battle.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" />\n\nIn preparation for the final assault, Mehmed had an artillery train of seventy large pieces dragged from his headquarters at Edirne, in addition to the bombards cast on the spot.<ref name=\"n61Q6\" />\n\nMehmed planned to attack the Theodosian Walls, the intricate series of walls and ditches protecting Constantinople from an attack from the West, the only part of the city not surrounded by water. His army encamped outside the city on the Monday after [[Easter]], 2 April 1453.\n\nThe bulk of the Ottoman army were encamped south of the Golden Horn. The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn. Communication was maintained by a road that had been constructed over the marshy head of the Horn.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94\u201395}}\n\n====Byzantine dispositions and strategies====\n[[File:Fall-of-constantinople-22.jpg|thumb|Painting of the Fall of Constantinople, by [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]]]]\n\nThe city had about 20&nbsp;km of walls ([[Theodosian Walls|land walls]]: 5.5&nbsp;km; sea walls along the Golden Horn: 7&nbsp;km; sea walls along the Sea of Marmara: 7.5&nbsp;km), one of the strongest sets of fortified walls in existence. The walls had recently been repaired (under [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]]) and were in fairly good shape, giving the defenders sufficient reason to believe that they could hold out until help from the West arrived.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|39}} In addition, the defenders were relatively well-equipped with a fleet of 26 ships: 5 from [[Genoa]], 5 from [[Venice]], 3 from Venetian [[Crete]], 1 from [[Ancona]], 1 from [[Aragon]], 1 from France, and about 10 Byzantine.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|45}}\n\nOn 5 April, the Sultan himself arrived with his last troops, and the defenders took up their positions. As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers. Minotto and his Venetians were stationed in the Blachernae palace, together with Teodoro Caristo, the Langasco brothers, and Archbishop Leonardo of Chios.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nTo the left of the emperor, further south, were the commanders Cataneo, with Genoese troops, and Theophilus Palaeologus, who guarded the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of the Spring|Pegae Gate]] with Greek soldiers. The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom.

[[Zagan Pasha]] argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defence by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\n===Final assault===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\n\nPreparations for the final assault were started in the evening of 26 May and continued to the next day.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} For 36 hours after the war council decision to attack, the Ottomans extensively mobilized their manpower in order to prepare for the general offensive.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} Prayer and resting would be then granted to the soldiers on the 28th, and then the final assault would be launched.

The Christian troops of the Ottoman Empire attacked first, followed by the successive waves of the irregular [[azap]]s, who were poorly trained and equipped, and [[Anatolia]]ns who focused on a section of the [[Blachernae]] walls in the north-west part of the city, which had been damaged by the cannon. This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the eleventh century, and was much weaker. The [[Anatolians]] managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders. Finally, as the battle was continuing, the last wave, consisting of elite Janissaries, attacked the city walls.

The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defence collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]] pressed forward. Many Greek soldiers ran back home to protect their families, the Venetians ran over to their ships, and a few of the Genoese got over to Galata. The rest committed suicide by jumping off the city walls or surrendered.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} The Greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the Ottomans. It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers. On the other hand, Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, a Venetian eyewitness to the siege, wrote in his diary that it was said that Constantine hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate, although his ultimate fate remains unknown.{{NoteTag|Barbaro added the description of the emperor's heroic last moments to his diary based on information he received afterward.

Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}\nThe Army converged upon the [[Augusteum]], the vast square that fronted the great church of Hagia Sophia whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection.

The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan.

In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire.

[[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam.

However, Istanbul only became the official name of the city in 1930 by the revised Turkish Postal Law as part of [[Atat\u00fcrk]]'s reforms.<ref name=\"ZooPt\" /><ref name=\"DwbQb\" /><ref name=\"YEruk\" />\n\n===In historical fiction===\n* [[Lew Wallace]], ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell''.

{{lang-tr|{{italics correction|\u0130stanbul'un Fethi}}|lit= '''Conquest of Istanbul'''}}) was the capture of the [[capital city]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] by an invading [[Ottoman army]] on 29 May 1453. The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], who defeated an army commanded by [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to Constantinople and established his court there.\n\nThe capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.\n\nIt was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of [[gunpowder]] (which powered formidable cannons).<ref name=\"econfallmill\" />\n\nThe conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event in the [[Late Middle Ages]] which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.<ref name=\"GpAG8\" />\n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century.

Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor.

This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards.

The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn.

As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers.

The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. The sea walls at the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]] were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under [[Gabriele Trevisano]].<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nTwo tactical reserves were kept behind in the city, one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], under the command of [[Loukas Notaras]] and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively. The Venetian Alviso Diedo commanded the ships in the harbour.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94}}\n\nAlthough the Byzantines also had cannons, they were much smaller than those of the Ottomans and the [[recoil]] tended to damage their own walls.<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" />\n\nAccording to [[David Nicolle]], despite many odds, the idea that Constantinople was inevitably doomed is wrong, and the overall situation was not as one-sided as a simple glance at a map might suggest.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|40}} It has also been claimed that Constantinople was \"the best-defended city in Europe\" at that time.<ref name=\"bZgqW\" />\n\n==Siege==\nAt the beginning of the siege, Mehmed sent out some of his best troops to reduce the remaining Byzantine strongholds outside the city of Constantinople. The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days.

Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships{{NoteTag|These were the three Genoese ships sent by the Pope, joined by a large Imperial transport ship which had been sent on a foraging mission to Sicily previous to the siege and was on its way back to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|100}}}} managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.\n\nMehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across [[Galata]] on the north side of the Golden Horn, and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} This seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the\u2014nominally neutral\u2014colony of [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], and demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using [[fire ship]]s, but the Ottomans forced the Christians to retreat with heavy losses. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore.  On orders of Mehmed, they were [[Impalement|impaled]] on stakes, in sight of the city's defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|108}}<ref name=\"MoRBA\" /> With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.\n\nThe Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but were always repelled with heavy losses.<ref name=\"FdrIR\" /> Venetian surgeon [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]], describing in his diary one of such frequent land attacks especially by the Janissaries, wrote:\n\n{{quote|They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries&nbsp;... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones&nbsp;... without caring how near they came to the city walls.

However, an engineer named [[Johannes Grant]], a German{{NoteTag|[[Steven Runciman|Runciman]] speculates that he may have been Scottish<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|84}}}} who came together with the Genoese contingent, had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, and destroyed with [[Greek fire]] and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref name=\"TQ2Lp\" />\n\nOn 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city. Constantine XI only agreed to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possession.\n\n{{quote|As to surrendering the city to you, it is not for me to decide or for anyone else of its citizens; for all of us have reached the mutual decision to die of our own free will, without any regard for our lives.{{NoteTag|Original text: \u03a4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u1fd6 \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f10\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3\u2022 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1fc7 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u1fc3 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd.<ref name=\"29maiouiefemerida\" />}}}}\n\nAround this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers.

According to some Ottoman sources Constantine was killed in an accidental encounter with Turkish marines a little further to the south, presumably while making his way to the Sea of Marmara in order to escape by sea.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}}}\n\nAfter the initial assault, the Ottoman Army fanned out along the main thoroughfare of the city, the Mese, past the great forums, and past the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], which Mehmed II wanted to provide a seat for his newly appointed patriarch which would help him better control his Christian subjects. Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}\nThe Army converged upon the [[Augusteum]], the vast square that fronted the great church of Hagia Sophia whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection. After the doors were breached, the troops separated the congregation according to what price they might bring in the slave markets.\n\nOttoman casualties are unknown but they are believed by most historians to be very heavy due to several unsuccessful Ottoman attacks made during the siege and final assault.{{cn|date=February 2020}} According to the Venetian surgeon Nicolo Barbaro \"all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city\". Barbaro described blood flowing in the city \"like rainwater in the gutters after a sudden storm\", and bodies of Turks and Christians floating in the sea \"like melons along a canal\".<ref name=\"Barbaro\" />\n\n===Plundering phase===\nMehmed II granted his soldiers three days to plunder the city, as he had promised them and in accordance with the custom of the time.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|145}}<ref name=\"mCj01\" /> Soldiers fought over the possession of some of the [[War looting|spoils of war]].<ref name=\"histbyzoxon\" />{{rp|283}} Most of the Greek women were raped and enslaved<ref name=\"hRhtW\" />. According to the Venetian surgeon Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, \"all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city\". According to Philip Mansel, widespread persecution of the city's civilian inhabitants took place, resulting in thousands of murders and rapes and 30,000 civilians being enslaved or forcibly deported.<ref name=\"iK51W\" />\n\nThe looting was extremely thorough in certain parts of the city. Four days later on 2 June, the Sultan would find the city largely deserted and half in ruins; churches had been desecrated and stripped, houses were no longer habitable and stores and shops were emptied. He is famously reported to have been moved to tears by this, speaking \"What a city we have given over to plunder and destruction.\"<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|152}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n<!--Linked from infobox above-->\nOn the third day of the conquest, [[Mehmed II]] ordered all [[looting]] to stop and issued a proclamation that all Christians who had avoided capture or who had been ransomed could return to their homes without further molestation, although many had no homes to return to, and many more had been taken captive and not ransomed.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|150\u201351}} Byzantine historian [[George Sphrantzes]], an eyewitness to the fall of Constantinople, described the Sultan's actions:<ref name=\"ttHMm\" /><ref name=\"vCvPQ\" /><!-- there was a ref to p.&nbsp;133, but it is not clear which edition of which book (Sphrantzes or Kritovoulos) it referred to-->\n\n{{quote | On the third day after the fall of our city, the Sultan celebrated his victory with a great, joyful triumph. He issued a proclamation: the citizens of all ages who had managed to escape detection were to leave their hiding places throughout the city and come out into the open, as they were to remain free and no question would be asked. He further declared the restoration of houses and property to those who had abandoned our city before the siege. If they returned home, they would be treated according to their rank and religion, as if nothing had changed. | George Sphrantzes}}\n\nThe ''Hagia Sophia'' was converted into a mosque, but the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]] was allowed to remain intact and [[Gennadius Scholarius]] was appointed [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. This was once thought to be the origin of the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman ''millet'' system]]; however, it is now considered a myth and no such system existed in the fifteenth century.<ref name=\"aMn4U\" /><ref name=\"AIhgF\" />\n\n[[File:Hagia-Sophia-Laengsschnitt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Following the city's conquest, the Church of the [[Holy Wisdom]] (the ''[[Hagia Sophia]]'') was converted into a [[mosque]].]]\n\nAfter the sack, many feared other European Christian kingdoms would suffer the same fate as Constantinople. Two possible responses emerged amongst the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and churchmen of that era: [[Crusade]] or dialogue. [[Pope Pius II]] strongly advocated for another Crusade, while the German [[Nicholas of Cusa]] supported engaging in a dialogue with the Ottomans.<ref name=\"NqTxI\" />\n\nThe [[Morea]]n (Peloponnesian) fortress of Mystras, where Constantine's brothers [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrius]] ruled, constantly in conflict with each other and knowing that Mehmed would eventually invade them as well, held out until 1460. Long before the fall of Constantinople, Demetrius had fought for the throne with Thomas, Constantine, and their other brothers [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]] and [[Theodore II Palaiologos, Lord of Morea|Theodore]].<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}} Thomas escaped to Rome when the Ottomans invaded Morea while Demetrius expected to rule a puppet state, but instead was imprisoned and remained there for the rest of his life. In Rome, Thomas and his family received some monetary support from the Pope and other Western rulers as Byzantine emperor in exile, until 1503. In 1461 the independent Byzantine state in [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] fell to Mehmed.<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}}\n\n[[Constantine XI]] had died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he likely would have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed to Murad, became a personal favourite of Mehmed and served as [[Beylerbey]] (Governor-General) of [[Rumeli]] (the Balkans). The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, [[Bayezid II]].<ref name=\"nsxzN\" />\n\nWith the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed II had acquired the \"natural\" capital of its kingdom, albeit one in decline due to years of war. The loss of the city was a crippling blow to Christendom, and it exposed the Christian west to a vigorous and aggressive foe in the east. The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan. As Western Europe entered the 16th century, the [[Crusades|age of Crusading]] began to come to an end.\n\nFor some time Greek scholars had gone to [[Italian city-states]], a cultural exchange begun in 1396 by [[Coluccio Salutati]], chancellor of Florence, who had invited [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], a Byzantine scholar to lecture at the [[University of Florence]].<ref name=\"Mw3eQ\" /> After the conquest many Greeks, such as [[John Argyropoulos]] and [[Constantine Lascaris]], fled the city and found refuge in the Latin West, [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|bringing with them knowledge and documents from the Greco-Roman tradition to Italy]] and other regions that further propelled the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"J2i2B\" /><ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" /> Those Greeks who stayed behind in Constantinople mostly lived in the [[Phanar]] and [[Galata]] districts of the city. The [[Phanariotes]], as they were called, provided many capable advisers to the Ottoman rulers.\n\n===Third Rome===\n{{Main|Third Rome}}\n\n[[File:Gentile Bellini 003.jpg|thumb|''Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror'', by [[Gentile Bellini]]]]\n\n[[Byzantium]] is a term used by modern historians to refer to the later Roman Empire. In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire. Other potential claimants, such as the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] have disintegrated into history.<ref name=\"W8pk7\" />\n\n===Impact on the Churches===\nIn 17th-century Russia, the fall of Constantinople had a role in the fierce theological and political controversy between adherents and opponents of the [[Raskol|reforms]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] carried out by [[Patriarch Nikon]], which he intended to bring the Russian Church closer to the norms and practices of other Orthodox churches. [[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam. As a result of this process, the centre of authority in the Orthodox Church changed and migrated to Eastern Europe (e.g., [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]]) rather than remaining in the former Byzantine Near East.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Cultural references==\n===Legends===\nThere are many legends in Greece surrounding the Fall of Constantinople. It was said that [[May 1453 lunar eclipse|the partial lunar eclipse]] that occurred on 22 May 1453 represented a fulfilment of a prophecy of the city's demise.<ref name=\"L0Kni\" /> Four days later, the whole city was blotted out by a thick [[fog]], a condition unknown in that part of the world in May. When the fog lifted that evening, a strange light was seen playing about the dome of the Hagia Sophia, which some interpreted as the [[Holy Spirit]] departing from the city. \"This evidently indicated the departure of the Divine Presence, and its leaving the City in total abandonment and desertion, for the Divinity conceals itself in cloud and appears and again disappears.\"<ref name=\"OBWWf\" /> For others, there was still a distant hope that the lights were the campfires of the troops of [[John Hunyadi]] who had come to relieve the city.{{NoteTag|It is possible that all these phenomena were local effects of the cataclysmic [[Kuwae]] volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean. The \"fire\" seen may have been an optical illusion due to the reflection of intensely red twilight glow by clouds of volcanic ash high in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"nasakuwae\" />}}\n\nAnother legend holds that two priests saying [[divine liturgy]] over the crowd disappeared into the cathedral's walls as the first Turkish soldiers entered. According to the legend, the priests will appear again on the day that Constantinople returns to Christian hands.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|147}} Another legend refers to the ''Marble King'' (Constantine XI), holding that an angel rescued the emperor when the Ottomans entered the city, turning him into marble and placing him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again (a variant of the [[sleeping hero]] legend).<ref name=\"3otvo\" /><ref name=\"hatzfallhec\" />\n\n===Cultural impact===\n[[Guillaume Dufay]] composed several songs lamenting the fall of the Eastern church, and the duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]], [[Feast of the Pheasant|avowed]] to take up arms against the Turks. However, as the growing Ottoman power from this date on coincided with the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent [[Counter-Reformation]], the recapture of Constantinople became an ever-distant dream. Even France, once a fervent participant in the Crusades, became an ally of the Ottomans.\n\nNonetheless, depictions of Christian coalitions taking the city and of the late Emperor's resurrection by [[Leo the Wise]] persisted.<ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" />{{rp|280}}\n\n29 May 1453, the day of the fall of Constantinople, fell on a Tuesday, and since then Tuesday has been considered an unlucky day by Greeks generally.<ref name=\"QMrK6\" />\n\n===Impact on the Renaissance===\n{{Main|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\nThe migration waves of [[Byzantine]] scholars and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking of Constantinople]] and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered by many scholars key to the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies that led to the development of the [[Renaissance humanism]]<ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" />{{dead link|date=November 2016}}{{better source|reason=Tall claim requires high-quality academic citation, not a website|date=November 2016}} and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]].

''Islambol'' ({{lang|ota| \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0644}}, ''Full of Islam'') or ''Islambul'' (''find Islam'') or ''Islam(b)ol'' (''old [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: be Islam''), both in Turkish Language, were [[folk etymology|folk-etymological]] adaptations of ''Istanbul'' created after the Ottoman conquest of 1453 to express the city's new role as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan [[Mehmed II]] himself.<ref name=\"istanbulunadlari\" />\n\nThe [[Names of Istanbul|name of Istanbul]] is thought to be derived from the Greek phrase ''\u012bs t\u012bmbol\u012b(n)'' ({{lang-el|\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''eis t\u0113n p\u00f3lin'', \"to the City\"), and it is claimed that it had already spread among the Turkish populace of the Ottoman Empire before the conquest.

He worked as a concert pianist, as a musical director at the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Leipzig University Church]], as a professor at the [[Leipzig Conservatory|Royal Conservatory in Leipzig]], and as a music director at the court of Duke [[Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen]].\n\nReger first composed mainly ''[[Lied]]er'', chamber music, choral music and works for piano and organ. He later turned to orchestral compositions, such as the popular ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart]]'' (1914), and to works for choir and orchestra such as ''[[Gesang der Verkl\u00e4rten]]'' (1903), ''{{lang|de|[[Der 100. Psalm]]}}'' (1909), ''[[Der Einsiedler]]'' and the ''[[Requiem (Reger)|Hebbel Requiem]]'' (both 1915).\n\n== Career ==\nBorn in [[Brand, Bavaria|Brand]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], Reger studied music theory in [[Sondershausen]], then piano and theory in [[Wiesbaden]].{{sfn|Biography|2012}} The [[Max Reger works#Table of compositions|first compositions]] to which he assigned [[opus number]]s were [[chamber music]] and ''[[Lied]]er''. A concert pianist himself, he composed works for both piano and organ.{{sfn|Biography|2012}} His first work for choir and piano to which he assigned an opus number was ''[[Drei Ch\u00f6re, Op. 6|Drei Ch\u00f6re]]'' (1892).\n\nReger returned to his parental home in 1898, where he composed his first work for choir and orchestra, ''{{lang|de|Hymne an den Gesang}}'' (Hymn to singing), [[Max Reger works#21|Op. 21]]. From 1899, he courted [[Elsa Reger|Elsa von{{nbsp}}Bercken]] who at first rejected him.{{sfn|Lux|1963}} He composed many songs such as [[Sechs Lieder, Op. 35|''Sechs Lieder'', Op. 35]], on love poems by five authors.{{sfn|SWR|2016}} Reger moved to Munich in September 1901, where he obtained concert offers and where his rapid rise to fame began. During his first Munich season, Reger appeared in ten concerts as an organist, chamber pianist and accompanist. Income from publishers, concerts and private teaching enabled him to marry in 1902. Because his wife Elsa was a [[divorce]]d [[Protestantism|Protestant]], he was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] from the Catholic Church.  He continued to compose without interruption, for example ''[[Gesang der Verkl\u00e4rten]]'', [[Max Reger works#71|Op. 71]].{{sfn|Biography|2012}}\n\nIn 1907, Reger was appointed musical director at the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Leipzig University Church]], a position he held until 1908, and professor at the [[Leipzig Conservatory|Royal Conservatory in Leipzig]].{{sfn|Biography|2012}}{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|1990}}  In 1908 he began to compose ''{{lang|de|[[Der 100. Psalm]]}}'' (The 100th Psalm), Op. 106, a setting of Psalm 100 for mixed choir and orchestra, for the 350th anniversary of [[Jena University]]. Part I was premiered on 31 July that year. Reger completed the composition in 1909, premiered in 1910 simultaneously in both [[Chemnitz]] and [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]].{{sfn|Op106|2016}}\n\nIn 1911 Reger was appointed ''[[Kapellmeister#Similar terms and equivalents|Hofkapellmeister]]'' (music director) at the court of Duke [[Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen]], responsible also for music at the [[Meiningen Court Theatre]]. He retained his master class at the Leipzig conservatory.{{sfn|Biography|2012}} In 1913 he composed four [[tone poem]]s on paintings by [[Arnold B\u00f6cklin]] (''Vier Tongedichte nach Arnold B\u00f6cklin''), including ''Die Toteninsel'' (''[[Isle of the Dead (painting)|Isle of the Dead]]''), as his [[Max Reger works#128|Op. 128]]. \n[[File:N\u00f6lken, Reger.jpg|thumb|left|The composer at work, painting by [[Franz N\u00f6lken]], 1913]]He gave up the court position in 1914 for health reasons. In response to [[World War I]], he thought in 1914 already to compose a choral work to commemorate the fallen of the war. He began to set the Latin [[Requiem]] but abandoned the work as a fragment.{{sfn|Biography|2012}} He composed eight motets forming ''[[Acht geistliche Ges\u00e4nge (Reger)|Acht geistliche Ges\u00e4nge f\u00fcr gemischten Chor]]'' (Eight Sacred Songs), Op. 138, as a master of \"new simplicity\".{{sfn|Op138|2016}} \nIn 1915 he moved to Jena, commuting once a week to teach in Leipzig. He composed in Jena the ''[[Requiem (Reger)|Hebbel Requiem]]'' for soloist, choir and orchestra.{{sfn|Biography|2012}} Reger died of a heart attack while staying at a hotel in Leipzig on 11 May 1916.{{sfn|Biography|2012}}{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|1990}} The [[Galley proof|proofs]] of ''[[Acht geistliche Ges\u00e4nge (Reger)|Acht geistliche Ges\u00e4nge]]'', including \"[[Der Mensch lebt und bestehet|Der Mensch lebt und bestehet nur eine kleine Zeit]]\", were found next to his bed.{{sfn|Krumbiegel|2014}}{{sfn|Brock-Reger|1953}}\n\nReger had also been active internationally as a conductor and pianist. Among his students were [[Joseph Haas]], [[S\u00e1ndor Jemnitz]], [[Jaroslav Kvapil (composer)|Jaroslav Kvapil]], [[Ruben Liljefors]], [[Rudolf Serkin]], [[George Szell]] and [[Crist\u00f2for Taltabull]].\n\nReger was the cousin of [[Hans von Koessler]].\n\n== Works ==\n{{Main|List of compositions by Max Reger}}\nReger produced an enormous output in just over 25 years, nearly always in abstract forms. His work was well known in Germany during his lifetime. <!--By the 1970s, few of his compositions were widely performed.<ref name=\"Botstein\">{{cite journal |last1=Botstein |first1=Leon |title=History and Max Reger |journal=Musical Quarterly |volume=87 |issue=4 Winter 2004 |page=617-627 |url=https://academic.oup.com/mq/article/87/4/617/1011460 |accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>{{Failed verification |date=March 2020|reason=Botstein does not verify anything about the performance of Reger's works after the early 20th century}}<ref>{{cite news |first=Harold | last=Schonberg | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/nobody-wants-to-play-max-reger.html |title=Nobody Wants To Play Max Reger |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 1973 }}</ref>--> Many of his works are [[fugue]]s or in [[Variation (music)|variation form]], including the ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart]]'' based on the opening theme of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata in A major, K. 331]].\n\n[[File:WelteMaxReger1913.jpg|thumb|Recording session with Max Reger for the [[Welte-Mignon|Welte]]-Philharmonic-Organ, 1913]]\nReger wrote a large amount of music for [[organ (music)|organ]], the most popular being his ''Fantasy and Fugue on [[BACH motif|BACH]]'', Op. [[Max Reger works#46|46]] and the ''Toccata and Fugue'' in D minor from the collection Op. [[Max Reger works#129|129]]. While a student under [[Hugo Riemann]] in [[Wiesbaden]], Reger met the German organist, [[Karl Straube]]; they became friends and Straube premiered many of Reger's organ works, such as the [[Three chorale fantasias, Op. 52]]. Reger recorded some of his works on the [[Welte-Mignon|Welte Philharmonic organ]], including excerpt from [[52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67]]. He composed organ works for secular use, such as [[Introduction, Passacaglia and Fugue]], Op. 127, dedicated to [[Karl Straube]] who played the premiere during the 1913 opening of the Breslau [[Centennial Hall]], when {{ill|Organ of the Centennial Halle|de|Orgel der Jahrhunderthalle (Breslau)|lt=the Sauer organ}} was inaugurated.{{sfn|M\u00fchle|2015}}{{sfn|Biography 1913|2016}}\n\nReger was particularly attracted to the fugal form and created music in almost every genre, save for [[opera]] and the [[symphony]] (he did, however, compose a [[Sinfonietta (symphony)|Sinfonietta]], his op. 90). A similarly firm supporter of [[absolute music]], he saw himself as being part of the tradition of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. His work often combined the classical structures of these composers with the extended harmonies of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], to which he added the complex [[counterpoint]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. Reger's organ music, though also influenced by Liszt, was provoked by that tradition.\n\nSome of the works for solo string instruments turn up often on recordings, though less regularly in recitals. His solo piano and two-piano music places him as a successor to Brahms in the central German tradition. He pursued intensively Brahms's continuous development and free [[modulation (music)|modulation]], whilst being rooted in Bach-influenced polyphony.\n\nReger was a prolific writer of vocal works, [[Lied]]er, works for mixed chorus, [[men's chorus]] and female chorus, and extended choral works with orchestra such as ''[[Der 100. Psalm]]'' and ''[[Requiem (Reger)|Requiem]]'', a setting of a poem by [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel|Friedrich Hebbel]], which Reger dedicated to the soldiers of World War I. He composed music to texts by poets such as [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], [[Otto Julius Bierbaum]], [[Adelbert von Chamisso]], [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], [[Emanuel Geibel]], [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel|Friedrich Hebbel]], [[Nikolaus Lenau]], [[Detlev von Liliencron]], [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert]] and [[Ludwig Uhland]]. Reger assigned opus numbers to major works himself.{{sfn|Biography|2012}}\n\nHis works could be considered retrospective as they followed classical and baroque compositional techniques such as fugue and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|continuo]]. The influence of the latter can be heard in his chamber works which are deeply reflective and unconventional.\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 1898 [[Caesar Hochstetter]], an arranger, composer and critic, published an article entitled \"Noch einmal Max Reger\" in a music magazine (''Die redenden K\u00fcnste'' 5 no. 49, pp.&nbsp;943 f). Caesar recommended Reger as \"a highly talented young composer\" to the publishers. Reger thanked Hochstetter with the dedications of his piano pieces ''Aquarellen'', Op. [[Max Reger works#25|25]], and ''Cinq Pi\u00e8ces pittoresques'', Op. [[Max Reger works#34|34]].{{sfn|Biography|2012}}\n\nReger had an acrimonious relationship with [[Rudolf Louis]], the music critic of the ''M\u00fcnchener Neueste Nachrichten'', who usually had negative opinions of his compositions. After the first performance of the Sinfonietta in A major, Op. [[Max Reger works#90|90]], on 2 February 1906, Louis wrote a typically negative review on 7 February.  Reger wrote back to him: \"''Ich sitze in dem kleinsten Zimmer in meinem Hause. Ich habe Ihre Kritik vor mir. Im n\u00e4chsten Augenblick wird sie hinter mir sein!''\" (\"I am sitting in the smallest room of my house. I have your review before me. In a moment it will be behind me!\").{{sfn|Slonimsky|1965}}{{sfn|Kirshnit|2006}} Another source has the German composer Sigfrid Karg-Elert as the targeted critic of this letter.<ref>{{cite news |first=Harold | last=Schonberg | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/nobody-wants-to-play-max-reger.html |title=Nobody Wants To Play Max Reger |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 1973 }}</ref>\n\n== Films ==\nThe documentary ''Max Reger &mdash; Music as a perpetual state,'' by Andreas Pichler and Ewald Kontschieder, Miramonte Film, was released in 2002. It was the first factually based film documentation about Max Reger. It was produced in cooperation with the [[Max-Reger-Institute]].{{sfn|Muspilli|2016}}\n\n''Max Reger: The Last Giant'', a documentary film about the life and works of Max Reger, was released on 6 DVDs around December 2016 to mark the 100th anniversary of Reger's death. It is produced by Fugue State Films and includes excerpts from Reger's most important works for orchestra, piano, chamber ensemble and organ, with performances by Frauke May, [[Bernhard Haas]], Bernhard Buttmann and the [[Brandenburgisches Staatsorchester Frankfurt (Oder)|Brandenburgisches Staatsorchester Frankfurt]].{{sfn|Fugue State|2016}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Albright, Daniel, ed.

He worked as a concert pianist, as a musical director at the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Leipzig University Church]], as a professor at the [[Leipzig Conservatory|Royal Conservatory in Leipzig]], and as a music director at the court of Duke [[Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen]].\n\nReger first composed mainly ''[[Lied]]er'', chamber music, choral music and works for piano and organ. He later turned to orchestral compositions, such as the popular ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart]]'' (1914), and to works for choir and orchestra such as ''[[Gesang der Verkl\u00e4rten]]'' (1903), ''{{lang|de|[[Der 100. Psalm]]}}'' (1909), ''[[Der Einsiedler]]'' and the ''[[Requiem (Reger)|Hebbel Requiem]]'' (both 1915).\n\n== Career ==\nBorn in [[Brand, Bavaria|Brand]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], Reger studied music theory in [[Sondershausen]], then piano and theory in [[Wiesbaden]].{{sfn|Biography|2012}} The [[Max Reger works#Table of compositions|first compositions]] to which he assigned [[opus number]]s were [[chamber music]] and ''[[Lied]]er''. A concert pianist himself, he composed works for both piano and organ.{{sfn|Biography|2012}} His first work for choir and piano to which he assigned an opus number was ''[[Drei Ch\u00f6re, Op. 6|Drei Ch\u00f6re]]'' (1892).\n\nReger returned to his parental home in 1898, where he composed his first work for choir and orchestra, ''{{lang|de|Hymne an den Gesang}}'' (Hymn to singing), [[Max Reger works#21|Op. 21]]. From 1899, he courted [[Elsa Reger|Elsa von{{nbsp}}Bercken]] who at first rejected him.{{sfn|Lux|1963}} He composed many songs such as [[Sechs Lieder, Op. 35|''Sechs Lieder'', Op. 35]], on love poems by five authors.{{sfn|SWR|2016}} Reger moved to Munich in September 1901, where he obtained concert offers and where his rapid rise to fame began. During his first Munich season, Reger appeared in ten concerts as an organist, chamber pianist and accompanist. Income from publishers, concerts and private teaching enabled him to marry in 1902. Because his wife Elsa was a [[divorce]]d [[Protestantism|Protestant]], he was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] from the Catholic Church.  He continued to compose without interruption, for example ''[[Gesang der Verkl\u00e4rten]]'', [[Max Reger works#71|Op. 71]].{{sfn|Biography|2012}}\n\nIn 1907, Reger was appointed musical director at the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Leipzig University Church]], a position he held until 1908, and professor at the [[Leipzig Conservatory|Royal Conservatory in Leipzig]].{{sfn|Biography|2012}}{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|1990}}  In 1908 he began to compose ''{{lang|de|[[Der 100. Psalm]]}}'' (The 100th Psalm), Op. 106, a setting of Psalm 100 for mixed choir and orchestra, for the 350th anniversary of [[Jena University]]. Part I was premiered on 31 July that year. Reger completed the composition in 1909, premiered in 1910 simultaneously in both [[Chemnitz]] and [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]].{{sfn|Op106|2016}}\n\nIn 1911 Reger was appointed ''[[Kapellmeister#Similar terms and equivalents|Hofkapellmeister]]'' (music director) at the court of Duke [[Georg II of Saxe-Meiningen]], responsible also for music at the [[Meiningen Court Theatre]]. He retained his master class at the Leipzig conservatory.{{sfn|Biography|2012}} In 1913 he composed four [[tone poem]]s on paintings by [[Arnold B\u00f6cklin]] (''Vier Tongedichte nach Arnold B\u00f6cklin''), including ''Die Toteninsel'' (''[[Isle of the Dead (painting)|Isle of the Dead]]''), as his [[Max Reger works#128|Op. 128]]. \n[[File:N\u00f6lken, Reger.jpg|thumb|left|The composer at work, painting by [[Franz N\u00f6lken]], 1913]]He gave up the court position in 1914 for health reasons. In response to [[World War I]], he thought in 1914 already to compose a choral work to commemorate the fallen of the war. He began to set the Latin [[Requiem]] but abandoned the work as a fragment.{{sfn|Biography|2012}} He composed eight motets forming ''[[Acht geistliche Ges\u00e4nge (Reger)|Acht geistliche Ges\u00e4nge f\u00fcr gemischten Chor]]'' (Eight Sacred Songs), Op. 138, as a master of \"new simplicity\".{{sfn|Op138|2016}} \nIn 1915 he moved to Jena, commuting once a week to teach in Leipzig. He composed in Jena the ''[[Requiem (Reger)|Hebbel Requiem]]'' for soloist, choir and orchestra.{{sfn|Biography|2012}} Reger died of a heart attack while staying at a hotel in Leipzig on 11 May 1916.{{sfn|Biography|2012}}{{sfn|Schr\u00f6der|1990}} The [[Galley proof|proofs]] of ''[[Acht geistliche Ges\u00e4nge (Reger)|Acht geistliche Ges\u00e4nge]]'', including \"[[Der Mensch lebt und bestehet|Der Mensch lebt und bestehet nur eine kleine Zeit]]\", were found next to his bed.{{sfn|Krumbiegel|2014}}{{sfn|Brock-Reger|1953}}\n\nReger had also been active internationally as a conductor and pianist. Among his students were [[Joseph Haas]], [[S\u00e1ndor Jemnitz]], [[Jaroslav Kvapil (composer)|Jaroslav Kvapil]], [[Ruben Liljefors]], [[Rudolf Serkin]], [[George Szell]] and [[Crist\u00f2for Taltabull]].\n\nReger was the cousin of [[Hans von Koessler]].\n\n== Works ==\n{{Main|List of compositions by Max Reger}}\nReger produced an enormous output in just over 25 years, nearly always in abstract forms. His work was well known in Germany during his lifetime. <!--By the 1970s, few of his compositions were widely performed.<ref name=\"Botstein\">{{cite journal |last1=Botstein |first1=Leon |title=History and Max Reger |journal=Musical Quarterly |volume=87 |issue=4 Winter 2004 |page=617-627 |url=https://academic.oup.com/mq/article/87/4/617/1011460 |accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>{{Failed verification |date=March 2020|reason=Botstein does not verify anything about the performance of Reger's works after the early 20th century}}<ref>{{cite news |first=Harold | last=Schonberg | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/nobody-wants-to-play-max-reger.html |title=Nobody Wants To Play Max Reger |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 1973 }}</ref>--> Many of his works are [[fugue]]s or in [[Variation (music)|variation form]], including the ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart]]'' based on the opening theme of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata in A major, K. 331]].\n\n[[File:WelteMaxReger1913.jpg|thumb|Recording session with Max Reger for the [[Welte-Mignon|Welte]]-Philharmonic-Organ, 1913]]\nReger wrote a large amount of music for [[organ (music)|organ]], the most popular being his ''Fantasy and Fugue on [[BACH motif|BACH]]'', Op. [[Max Reger works#46|46]] and the ''Toccata and Fugue'' in D minor from the collection Op. [[Max Reger works#129|129]]. While a student under [[Hugo Riemann]] in [[Wiesbaden]], Reger met the German organist, [[Karl Straube]]; they became friends and Straube premiered many of Reger's organ works, such as the [[Three chorale fantasias, Op. 52]]. Reger recorded some of his works on the [[Welte-Mignon|Welte Philharmonic organ]], including excerpt from [[52 Chorale Preludes, Op. 67]]. He composed organ works for secular use, such as [[Introduction, Passacaglia and Fugue]], Op. 127, dedicated to [[Karl Straube]] who played the premiere during the 1913 opening of the Breslau [[Centennial Hall]], when {{ill|Organ of the Centennial Halle|de|Orgel der Jahrhunderthalle (Breslau)|lt=the Sauer organ}} was inaugurated.{{sfn|M\u00fchle|2015}}{{sfn|Biography 1913|2016}}\n\nReger was particularly attracted to the fugal form and created music in almost every genre, save for [[opera]] and the [[symphony]] (he did, however, compose a [[Sinfonietta (symphony)|Sinfonietta]], his op. 90). A similarly firm supporter of [[absolute music]], he saw himself as being part of the tradition of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. His work often combined the classical structures of these composers with the extended harmonies of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], to which he added the complex [[counterpoint]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. Reger's organ music, though also influenced by Liszt, was provoked by that tradition.\n\nSome of the works for solo string instruments turn up often on recordings, though less regularly in recitals. His solo piano and two-piano music places him as a successor to Brahms in the central German tradition. He pursued intensively Brahms's continuous development and free [[modulation (music)|modulation]], whilst being rooted in Bach-influenced polyphony.\n\nReger was a prolific writer of vocal works, [[Lied]]er, works for mixed chorus, [[men's chorus]] and female chorus, and extended choral works with orchestra such as ''[[Der 100. Psalm]]'' and ''[[Requiem (Reger)|Requiem]]'', a setting of a poem by [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel|Friedrich Hebbel]], which Reger dedicated to the soldiers of World War I. He composed music to texts by poets such as [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], [[Otto Julius Bierbaum]], [[Adelbert von Chamisso]], [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], [[Emanuel Geibel]], [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel|Friedrich Hebbel]], [[Nikolaus Lenau]], [[Detlev von Liliencron]], [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert]] and [[Ludwig Uhland]]. Reger assigned opus numbers to major works himself.{{sfn|Biography|2012}}\n\nHis works could be considered retrospective as they followed classical and baroque compositional techniques such as fugue and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|continuo]]. The influence of the latter can be heard in his chamber works which are deeply reflective and unconventional.\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 1898 [[Caesar Hochstetter]], an arranger, composer and critic, published an article entitled \"Noch einmal Max Reger\" in a music magazine (''Die redenden K\u00fcnste'' 5 no. 49, pp.&nbsp;943 f). Caesar recommended Reger as \"a highly talented young composer\" to the publishers. Reger thanked Hochstetter with the dedications of his piano pieces ''Aquarellen'', Op. [[Max Reger works#25|25]], and ''Cinq Pi\u00e8ces pittoresques'', Op. [[Max Reger works#34|34]].{{sfn|Biography|2012}}\n\nReger had an acrimonious relationship with [[Rudolf Louis]], the music critic of the ''M\u00fcnchener Neueste Nachrichten'', who usually had negative opinions of his compositions. After the first performance of the Sinfonietta in A major, Op. [[Max Reger works#90|90]], on 2 February 1906, Louis wrote a typically negative review on 7 February.  Reger wrote back to him: \"''Ich sitze in dem kleinsten Zimmer in meinem Hause. Ich habe Ihre Kritik vor mir. Im n\u00e4chsten Augenblick wird sie hinter mir sein!''\" (\"I am sitting in the smallest room of my house. I have your review before me. In a moment it will be behind me!\").{{sfn|Slonimsky|1965}}{{sfn|Kirshnit|2006}} Another source has the German composer Sigfrid Karg-Elert as the targeted critic of this letter.<ref>{{cite news |first=Harold | last=Schonberg | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/02/archives/nobody-wants-to-play-max-reger.html |title=Nobody Wants To Play Max Reger |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 1973 }}</ref>\n\n== Films ==\nThe documentary ''Max Reger &mdash; Music as a perpetual state,'' by Andreas Pichler and Ewald Kontschieder, Miramonte Film, was released in 2002.

Petit published another paper on his 1846 observations in 1861, basing the second moon's existence on perturbations in movements of the actual Moon.<ref name=\"Schlyter\" /> This second moon hypothesis was not confirmed either.\n\nPetit's proposed moon became a plot point in [[Jules Verne]]'s 1870 science fiction novel ''[[Around the Moon]]''.{{r|ley195707}}\n\n=== Waltemath's moons ===\nIn 1898 [[Hamburg]] scientist Dr. [[Georg Waltemath]] announced that he had located a system of tiny moons orbiting Earth.<ref>Bakich, Michael E.

He said it was also probably the \"green crescent moon\" seen in New Zealand and later in North America in 1886, for periods of less than a half-hour each time.
