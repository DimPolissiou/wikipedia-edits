He added that \"Kingsley once again shines in the role of Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans.\"<ref name=\"IGNAHTK\" /> Faraci felt that the character \"was used the perfect amount in ''Iron Man Three'', and giving him more screen time here, in a side project, feels the right way to return to him.

The character, created by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Jed Whedon]] and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], first appeared in the 2013 [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|pilot episode]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' and has continually been portrayed by [[Elizabeth Henstridge]].\n\nIn the series, Simmons is one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top scientific minds. Though her experience is vast, she is particularly expert in biological sciences. Many of her storylines involve her relationship with her best friend, and later lover, [[Leo Fitz]]. Over the course of the series, she develops from a relatively young and inexperienced S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist to one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most senior agents, also clocking significant experience as a field agent. She is distinguished from her colleagues by taking very determined and sometimes coldly rational decisions in the pursuit of what she believes is right.\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nIn [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The character, created by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Jed Whedon]] and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]], first appeared in the 2013 [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|pilot episode]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' and has continually been portrayed by [[Elizabeth Henstridge]].\n\nIn the series, Simmons is one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top scientific minds. Though her experience is vast, she is particularly expert in biological sciences. Many of her storylines involve her relationship with her best friend, and later lover, [[Leo Fitz]]. Over the course of the series, she develops from a relatively young and inexperienced S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist to one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most senior agents, also clocking significant experience as a field agent. She is distinguished from her colleagues by taking very determined and sometimes coldly rational decisions in the pursuit of what she believes is right.\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nIn [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Now, \"she's had a traumatic event and she's gone straight back to what she knows of trying to make everything black and white\", and so \"It makes sense [to her] if there are these people\u2014call them what you want; Inhumans\u2014that cause destruction, and you can get rid of them, then they won't be {{sic|a destruction}} anymore....Of course it isn't\" that simple.<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" />\n\nAfter Simmons is trapped on the planet Maveth for six months, she becomes \"profoundly different\", with Henstridge describing her as \"definitely still her essence\u2014she doesn't just completely change.

[[Wari culture|Wari]] and [[Tiwanaku]] cultures receded in power and influence while [[Chachapoya]] and [[Chim\u00fa]] cultures rose toward florescence in South America.  In [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Maya people|Maya]] [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]] period saw the decline of many grand polities of the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin|Pet\u00e9n]] like [[Palenque]] and [[Tikal]] yet a renewed vigor and greater construction phases of sites in the [[Yucat\u00e1n region]] like [[Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]] and [[Uxmal]]. [[Mitla]], with Mixtec influence, became the more important site of the Zapotec, overshadowing the waning [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]].

The [[Congress of Gniezno]] (with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry]]) was part of his [[pilgrimage]]. In [[Rome]], he built the basilica of [[San Bartolomeo all'Isola]], to host the relics of St. [[Bartholomew]].\n\nIn [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Robert II of France|Robert II]], the son of [[Hugh Capet]], was the first of the [[House of Capet|Capetian kings]].\n\nThe [[Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty]] was engaged in a [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|long and hard war]] with the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. In the year 1000, the Byzantine generals [[Theodorokanos]] and [[Nikephoros Xiphias]] captured the former Bulgarian capitals of [[Pliska]] and [[Great Preslav]], along with [[Little Preslav]], extending Byzantine control over the northeastern portion of the Bulgarian state ([[Mysia]] and [[Scythia Minor]]). At the same time, Byzantium was instrumental in the [[Christianization of the Kievan Rus']] and of other medieval Slavic states.\n\nIn Great Britain, a unified [[Kingdom of England]] had developed out of the various [[Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]].\nIn [[Scandinavia]], [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianization]] was in its early stages, with the [[Althingi]] of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] embracing Christianity in the year 1000.\n\nOn [[September 9]],  King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was defeated by an alliance of his enemies in the [[Battle of Svolder]].\n[[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn I]] established [[Denmark|Danish]] control over part of [[Norway]]. [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], was founded (the exact year is debatable, but the 1,000 year anniversary was held in the year [[2000]]).\n\nThe [[Papacy]] during this time was in a period of decline, in retrospect known as the [[saeculum obscurum]] (\"Dark Age\") or \"[[Saeculum obscurum|pornocracy]]\" (\"rule of harlots\"), a state of affairs that would result in the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] later in the 11th century.\n\n[[kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] was established in 1000 as a Christian state.

In the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], it was a [[common year starting on Wednesday|non-leap century year starting on Wednesday]] (like [[1800]]).

[[Wari culture|Wari]] and [[Tiwanaku]] cultures receded in power and influence while [[Chachapoya]] and [[Chim\u00fa]] cultures rose toward florescence in South America.  In [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Maya people|Maya]] [[Mesoamerican chronology|Terminal Classic]] period saw the decline of many grand polities of the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin|Pet\u00e9n]] like [[Palenque]] and [[Tikal]] yet a renewed vigor and greater construction phases of sites in the [[Yucat\u00e1n region]] like [[Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]] and [[Uxmal]]. [[Mitla]], with Mixtec influence, became the more important site of the Zapotec, overshadowing the waning [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]].  [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]] flourished in central Mexico, as did [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], the center of [[Toltec]] culture.\n\n[[World population]] is estimated to have been between c. 250 and 310 million.<ref>310 million:  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. 254 million:  Jean-No\u00ebl Biraben, 1980, \"An Essay Concerning Mankind's Evolution\", Population, Selected Papers, Vol. 4, pp. 1\u201313.</ref>\n\n== Events ==\n=== Christendom ===\n{{main|Europe in AD 1000}}\n[[File:Europe 1000.jpg|thumb|Europe in 1000]]\nIn continental Europe, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] established itself as the most powerful state. \n[[Otto III]] made a pilgrimage from [[Rome]] to [[Aachen]] and [[Gniezno]] ([[Gnesen]]), stopping at [[Regensburg]], [[Meissen]], [[Magdeburg]], and Gniezno. The [[Congress of Gniezno]] (with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry]]) was part of his [[pilgrimage]]. In [[Rome]], he built the basilica of [[San Bartolomeo all'Isola]], to host the relics of St. [[Bartholomew]].\n\nIn [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Robert II of France|Robert II]], the son of [[Hugh Capet]], was the first of the [[House of Capet|Capetian kings]].\n\nThe [[Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty]] was engaged in a [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|long and hard war]] with the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. In the year 1000, the Byzantine generals [[Theodorokanos]] and [[Nikephoros Xiphias]] captured the former Bulgarian capitals of [[Pliska]] and [[Great Preslav]], along with [[Little Preslav]], extending Byzantine control over the northeastern portion of the Bulgarian state ([[Mysia]] and [[Scythia Minor]]). At the same time, Byzantium was instrumental in the [[Christianization of the Kievan Rus']] and of other medieval Slavic states.\n\nIn Great Britain, a unified [[Kingdom of England]] had developed out of the various [[Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]].\nIn [[Scandinavia]], [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianization]] was in its early stages, with the [[Althingi]] of the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] embracing Christianity in the year 1000.\n\nOn [[September 9]],  King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was defeated by an alliance of his enemies in the [[Battle of Svolder]].\n[[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sweyn I]] established [[Denmark|Danish]] control over part of [[Norway]]. [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], was founded (the exact year is debatable, but the 1,000 year anniversary was held in the year [[2000]]).\n\nThe [[Papacy]] during this time was in a period of decline, in retrospect known as the [[saeculum obscurum]] (\"Dark Age\") or \"[[Saeculum obscurum|pornocracy]]\" (\"rule of harlots\"), a state of affairs that would result in the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]] later in the 11th century.\n\n[[kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] was established in 1000 as a Christian state.

Turkey]] is the process by which people [[human migration|migrate]] to [[Turkey]] to reside in the country. After the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] and following [[Turkish War of Independence]], an [[Emigration|exodus]] by the large portion of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] ([[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]) and [[Islam|Muslim]] peoples from the [[Balkans]] ([[Turks in the Balkans|Balkan Turks]], [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Pomaks]]), [[Caucasus]] ([[Abkhaz people|Abkhazians]], [[Ajarians]], '[[Circassians]]', [[Chechen people|Chechens]]), [[Crimea]] ([[Crimean Tatar diaspora]]), and [[Crete]] ([[Cretan Turks]]) took refuge in present-day Turkey and moulded the country's fundamental features. Trends of immigration towards Turkey continue to this day, although the motives are more varied and are usually in line with the patterns of global [[immigration]] movements &mdash; Turkey, for example, receives many economic migrants from nearby countries such as [[Armenia]], the [[Moldova]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], and [[Azerbaijan]], but also from [[Central Asia]]. [[Turkey's migrant crisis]] is a period during 2010s characterized by high numbers of people arriving in Turkey.\n\n== Internal migration ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Place of origin (rows) versus place of residence (columns) for Turkish citizens in 2014<ref>TurkStat</ref>\n!

[[Secularism|secular]] (''Laiklik'', Turkish adaptation of French ''[[La\u00efcit\u00e9]]''), i.e. without a [[state religion]], or separate ethnic divisions/ identities. The concept of \"minorities\" has only been accepted by the Republic of Turkey as defined by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] and thence strictly limited to Greeks, Jews and Armenians, only on religious matters, excluding from the scope of the concept the ethnic identities of these minorities as of others such as the Kurds who make up 15% of the country; others include Assyrians/Syriacs of various Christian denominations, Alevis and all the others.\n\nThere are many reports from sources such as ([[Human Rights Watch]], [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]], national parliaments in EU member states, [[Amnesty International]] etc.) on persistent yet declining discrimination.\n\nCertain current trends are:\n* Turkish [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|imams]] get salaries from the state, whereas Turkish Alevi as well as non-Orthodox and non-Armenian clerics are not paid\n* Imams can be trained freely at the numerous religious schools and theology departments of universities throughout the country; minority religions can not re-open schools for training of their local clerics due to legislation and international treaties dating back to the end of [[Turkish War of Independence]]. The closing of the [[Halki seminary|Theological School of Halki]] is a sore bone of contention between Turkey and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] world;\n* The Turkish state sends out paid imams, working under authority from the Presidency of Religious Affairs ([[Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131]]) to various European or Asian countries with Turkish- or Turkic-speaking populations, with as local heads officials from the Turkish consulates;\n* Turkey has recently engaged in promulgating a series of legal enactments aiming at removal of the procedural hurdles before the use of several local languages spoken by Turkish citizens such as Kurdish (Kurmanji), Arabic and Zaza as medium of public communication, together with several other smaller ethnic group languages. A few private Kurdish teaching centers have recently been allowed to open. Kurdish-language TV broadcasts on 7/24 basis at the public frequency denominated in the government-owned [[TRT 6]], while the private national channels show no interest yet. However, there are already several satellite Kurdish TV stations operating from Kurdish Autonomous Region at Northern Iraq and Western Europe, broadcasting in Kurdish, Turkish and Neo-Aramaic languages, [[Kurdistan TV]], [[Kurdsat TV|KurdSAT]], etc.;\n* Non-Muslim minority numbers are said to be falling rapidly, mainly as a result of aging, migration (to [[state of Israel|Israel]], [[Greece]], the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe]]).\n*There is concern over the future of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which suffers from a lack of trained clergy due to the closure of the Halki school. The state does not recognise the Ecumenical status of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].\n\nAccording to figures released by the Foreign Ministry in December 2008, there are 89,000 Turkish citizens designated as belonging to a minority, two thirds of Armenian descent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=161291

Turkey]] is the process by which people [[human migration|migrate]] to [[Turkey]] to reside in the country. Many, but not all, become [[Turkish nationality law|Turkish citizens]]. After the  [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] and following [[Turkish War of Independence]], an [[Emigration|exodus]] by the large portion of [[Turkish people|Turkish]] ([[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]) and [[Islam|Muslim]] peoples from the [[Balkans]] ([[Turks in the Balkans|Balkan Turks]], [[Albanians]], [[Bosniaks]], [[Pomaks]]), [[Caucasus]] ([[Abkhaz people|Abkhazians]], [[Ajarians]], '[[Circassians]]', [[Chechen people|Chechens]]), [[Crimea]] ([[Crimean Tatar diaspora]]), and [[Crete]] ([[Cretan Turks]]) took refuge in present-day Turkey and moulded the country's fundamental features. Trends of immigration towards Turkey continue to this day, although the motives are more varied and are usually in line with the patterns of global [[immigration]] movements &mdash; Turkey, for example, receives many economic migrants from nearby countries such as [[Armenia]], the [[Moldova]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], and [[Azerbaijan]], but also from [[Central Asia]]. [[Turkey's migrant crisis]] is a period during 2010s characterized by high numbers of people arriving in Turkey.\n\n== Internal migration ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Place of origin (rows) versus place of residence (columns) for Turkish citizens in 2014<ref>TurkStat</ref>\n!

[[Secularism|secular]] (''Laiklik'', Turkish adaptation of French ''[[La\u00efcit\u00e9]]''), i.e. without a [[state religion]], or separate ethnic divisions/ identities. The concept of \"minorities\" has only been accepted by the Republic of Turkey as defined by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] and thence strictly limited to Greeks, Jews and Armenians, only on religious matters, excluding from the scope of the concept the ethnic identities of these minorities as of others such as the Kurds who make up 15% of the country; others include Assyrians/Syriacs of various Christian denominations, Alevis and all the others.\n\nThere are many reports from sources such as ([[Human Rights Watch]], [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]], national parliaments in EU member states, [[Amnesty International]] etc.) on persistent yet declining discrimination.\n\nCertain current trends are:\n* Turkish [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|imams]] get salaries from the state, whereas Turkish Alevi as well as non-Orthodox and non-Armenian clerics are not paid\n* Imams can be trained freely at the numerous religious schools and theology departments of universities throughout the country; minority religions can not re-open schools for training of their local clerics due to legislation and international treaties dating back to the end of [[Turkish War of Independence]]. The closing of the [[Halki seminary|Theological School of Halki]] is a sore bone of contention between Turkey and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] world;\n* The Turkish state sends out paid imams, working under authority from the Presidency of Religious Affairs ([[Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131]]) to various European or Asian countries with Turkish- or Turkic-speaking populations, with as local heads officials from the Turkish consulates;\n* Turkey has recently engaged in promulgating a series of legal enactments aiming at removal of the procedural hurdles before the use of several local languages spoken by Turkish citizens such as Kurdish (Kurmanji), Arabic and Zaza as medium of public communication, together with several other smaller ethnic group languages. A few private Kurdish teaching centers have recently been allowed to open. Kurdish-language TV broadcasts on 7/24 basis at the public frequency denominated in the government-owned [[TRT 6]], while the private national channels show no interest yet. However, there are already several satellite Kurdish TV stations operating from Kurdish Autonomous Region at Northern Iraq and Western Europe, broadcasting in Kurdish, Turkish and Neo-Aramaic languages, [[Kurdistan TV]], [[Kurdsat TV|KurdSAT]], etc.;\n* Non-Muslim minority numbers are said to be falling rapidly, mainly as a result of aging, migration (to [[state of Israel|Israel]], [[Greece]], the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe]]).\n*There is concern over the future of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which suffers from a lack of trained clergy due to the closure of the Halki school. The state does not recognise the Ecumenical status of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]].\n\nAccording to figures released by the Foreign Ministry in December 2008, there are 89,000 Turkish citizens designated as belonging to a minority, two thirds of Armenian descent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=161291 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501063653/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=161291 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-05-01 |accessdate=2008-12-15 |title=Foreign Ministry: 89,000 minorities live in Turkey |date=2008-12-15 |work=[[Today's Zaman]] }}</ref>\n\n== CIA World Factbook demographic statistics ==\nThe following demographic statistics are from the [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]]:<ref name=\"ciawfb\"/>\n\n'''Age structure'''\n<br>''0\u201314 years:'' 24.26% (male 10,085,558/female 9,627,967)\n<br>''15\u201324 years:'' 15.88% (male 6,589,039/female 6,311,113)\n<br>''25\u201354 years:'' 43.26% (male 17,798,864/female 17,349,228)\n<br>55\u201364 years: 8.82% (male 3,557,329/female 3,606,120)\n<br>''65 years and over:'' 7.79% (male 2,825,738/female 3,506,283) (2018 est.)\n\n'''Median age'''\n<br />''total population:''\n31.2 years\n<br />''male:''\n30.9 years\n<br />''female:''\n31.9 years (2018 est.)\n\n'''Sex ratio'''\n<br />''at birth:''\n1.05 male(s)/female\n<br />''under 15 years:''\n1.05 male(s)/female\n<br />''15\u201324 years:''\n1.04 male(s)/female\n<br />''25\u201354 years:''\n1.03 male(s)/female\n<br />''55\u201364 years:''\n0.99 male(s)/female\n<br />''65 years and over:''\n0.8 male(s)/female\n<br />''total population:''\n1.01 male(s)/female (2017 est.)\n\n'''Life expectancy at birth'''\n<br />''total population:''\n75.3 years\n<br />''male:''\n72.9 years\n<br />''female:''\n77.7 years (2018 est.)\n\n'''Urbanization'''\n<br />urban population: 75.1% of total population (2018)\n<br />rate of urbanization: 2.04% annual rate of change (2015\u201320 est.)\n\n'''Nationality'''\n<br />''noun:''\nTurk(s)\n<br />''adjective:''\nTurkish\n\n'''Literacy'''\n<br />''definition:''\nage 15 and over can read and write\n<br />total population: 96.2%\n<br />male: 98.8%\n<br />female: 93.6% (2016 est.)\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Census in Turkey]]\n* [[Minorities in Turkey]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Demographics of Turkey}}\n* [https://archive.today/20150404121423/http://itbulk.org/population/population-by-country/ Build Turkey population graph: from 1960 till now (World Bank data)]\n* [https://archive.today/20150220095949/http://itbulk.org/population/population-projection-by-country/ Build Turkey population projection graph till 2100 (United Nation data)]\n* [https://archive.today/20150404121433/http://itbulk.org/population/life-expectancy-by-country/ Build Turkey life expectancy at birth graph: from 1950 till now (United Nation data)]\n\n{{Turkey topics}}\n{{Demographics of Turkey}}\n{{Asia topic|Demographics of}}\n{{Europe topic|Demographics of}}\n{{Demographics of Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Demographics of Turkey| ]]\n", "name_user": "Sems\u00fbr\u00ee", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eImmigration:not notable", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Turkey"}
{"title_page": "Dirichlet series inversion", "text_new": "{{footnotes|date=April 2020}}\nIn [[analytic number theory]], a [[Dirichlet series]], or [[Dirichlet generating function]] (DGF), of a sequence is a common way of understanding and summing [[arithmetic functions]] in a meaningful way. A little known, or at least often forgotten about, way of expressing formulas for arithmetic functions and their [[summatory function]]s is to perform an integral transform that inverts the operation of forming the DGF of a sequence. This inversion is analogous to performing an [[inverse Z-transform]] to the [[generating function]] of a sequence to express formulas for the series coefficients of a given ordinary generating function. \n\nFor now, we will use this page as a compendia of \"oddities\" and oft-forgotten facts about transforming and inverting Dirichlet series, DGFs, and relating the inversion of a DGF of a sequence to the sequence's summatory function.

Her widely praised 1951 bestseller ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'' won her a U.S. [[National Book Award]],<ref name=nba1952 /> recognition as a gifted writer, and financial security. Her next book, ''The Edge of the Sea'', and the reissued version of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'', were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.\n\nLate in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially some problems that she believed were caused by synthetic [[pesticide]]s. The result was the book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although ''Silent Spring'' was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on [[DDT]] and other pesticides. It also inspired a [[grassroots]] environmental movement that led to the creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref name=CarsonPaull>Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/22934/7/22934.pdf \"The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring\"], ''Sage Open'', 3(July): 1\u201312. {{doi|10.1177/2158244013494861}}</ref> Carson was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\n==Life and work==\n{{Listen|filename=Rachel Carson (As Told By EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy).ogg|title=Rachel Carson (As Told By EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy)}}\n\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:RachelCarsonHomestead.jpg|thumb|left|Carson's childhood home is now preserved as the [[Rachel Carson Homestead]] (photo taken November 7, 2009)]]\nRachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near [[Springdale, Pennsylvania]], just up the [[Allegheny River]] from [[Pittsburgh]]. She was the daughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.une.edu/mwwc/research/featured-writers/rachel-l.-carson-collection-1946-1964 |title=Maine Women Writers Collection\u2014Research\u2014Featured Writers\u2014Rachel L.

An avid reader, she began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight and had her first story published at age ten. She especially enjoyed the ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'' (which carried her first published stories), the works of [[Beatrix Potter]], and the novels of [[Gene Stratton-Porter]], and in her teen years, [[Herman Melville]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature. Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania|Parnassus, Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-four students.<ref>Lear, 7\u201324</ref>\n\nAt the Pennsylvania College for Women (today known as [[Chatham University]]), as in high school, Carson was somewhat of a loner. She originally studied English, but switched her major to biology in January 1928, though she continued contributing to the school's student newspaper and literary supplement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rachel Carson|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/rachelcarson/carsonbio.html|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=23 April 2014}}</ref> Though admitted to graduate standing at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1928, she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated ''[[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]]'' in 1929. After a summer course at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], she continued her studies in [[zoology]] and [[genetics]] at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=27\u201362}}</ref>\n\nAfter her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in [[Raymond Pearl]]'s laboratory, where she worked with rats and ''[[Drosophila]]'', to earn money for tuition. After false starts with [[pit viper]]s and [[squirrel]]s, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the [[pronephros]] in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family during the Great Depression.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=Autumn 2011|title=\"Silence, Miss Carson!\" Science, Gender, and the Reception of \"Silent Spring\"|jstor=3178817|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=27|issue=3|pages=733\u2013752|doi=10.2307/3178817}}</ref> In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the [[United States Fish Commission|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled ''Romance Under the Waters''. The series of 52 seven-minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and in the work of the bureau, a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=63\u201379}}</ref>\n\nCarson's supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in 1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=79\u201382}}</ref>\n\n===Early career and publications===\nAt the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main responsibilities were to analyze and report field data on fish populations, and to write brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote a steady stream of articles for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=82\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1937, the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'' accepted a revised version of an essay, ''The World of Waters'', that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as ''Undersea'', was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house [[Simon & Schuster]], impressed by ''Undersea'', contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'' (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued\u2014her features appeared in ''Sun Magazine'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', and ''[[Collier's]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=85\u2013113}}</ref> Carson attempted to leave the Bureau (by then transformed into the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]) in 1945, but few jobs for naturalists were available, as most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the [[Manhattan Project]]. In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of [[DDT]], a revolutionary new pesticide\u2014lauded as the \"insect bomb\" after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]\u2014that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and [[Ecology|ecological]] effects. DDT was but one of Carson's many writing interests at the time, and editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=114\u201320}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Rachel Carson Conducts Marine Biology Research with Bob Hines.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rachel Carson and [[Robert W.

Though her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was working on material for a second book and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, [[Marie Rodell]]; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=121\u201360}}</ref>\n\n[[Oxford University Press]] expressed interest in Carson's book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become ''[[The Sea Around Us]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=163\u201364}}.<br />\u2022 An apocryphal story holds that the book was rejected by over twenty publishers before Oxford University Press.

Freeman had written to Carson welcoming her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the beginning of an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book ''Always, Rachel'', published in 1995 by Beacon Press.\n\nCarson's biographer, [[Linda J. Lear]], writes that \"Carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=248}}</ref> She found this in Freeman. The two women had a number of common interests, nature chief among them, and began exchanging letters regularly while apart. They would share summers for the remainder of Carson's life, and meet whenever else their schedules permitted.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=243\u201388}}</ref>\n\nIn regard to the extent of their relationship, commentators have said that: \"the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Montefiore, Janet|title='The fact that possesses my imagination': Rachel Carson, Science and Writing|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|volume=12|issue=1|page=48|year=2001|doi=10.1080/09574040110034110}}</ref> Freeman shared parts of Carson's letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=255\u201356}}</ref> Some believe Freeman and Carson's relationship was romantic in nature.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/deliberate-pace-rachel-carson/|title=A Deliberate Pace: On Rachel Carson|last=Gornick|first=Vivian|date=2013-02-19|access-date=2019-08-05|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/26/the-right-way-to-remember-rachel-carson|title=The Right Way to Remember Rachel Carson|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=2018-03-19|access-date=2019-08-05|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> One of the letters from Carson to Freeman reads: \u201cBut, oh darling, I want to be with you so terribly that it hurts!\u201d, while in another, Freeman writes: \u201cI love you beyond expression...

Her brother, Robert Carson, insisted that her cremated remains be buried beside their mother in Maryland. This was against her own wishes to be buried in Maine. In the end, a compromise was reached. Carson's own wishes were carried out by an organizing committee, including her agent (Marie Rodell), her editor (Paul Brooks) and Dorothy Freeman. In the Spring of 1964, Dorothy received half of Rachel's ashes in the mail sent to her by Robert Carson. In the summer of that year, Dorothy carried out Rachel's final wishes, scattering her ashes along the rocky shores of Sheepscot Bay in Maine.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=482\u2013483}}</ref>\n\n===<span id=\"The Edge of the Sea\"></span> ''The Edge of the Sea'' and transition to conservation work ===\nEarly in 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=223\u201344}}</ref> In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, ''The Edge of the Sea'', which focuses on life in [[coast]]al ecosystems, particularly along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It appeared in ''The New Yorker'' in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; ''The Edge of the Sea'' received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for ''The Sea Around Us''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=261\u201376}}</ref>\n\nThrough 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on a number of projects\u2014including the script for an ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'' episode, \"Something About the Sky\"\u2014and wrote articles for popular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address [[evolution]], but the publication of [[Julian Huxley]]'s ''Evolution in Action''\u2014and her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic\u2014led her to abandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She considered an environment-themed book project tentatively titled ''Remembrance of the Earth'' and became involved with [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other conservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in Maine she and Freeman called the \"Lost Woods.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=276\u2013300}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1957, a family tragedy struck for a third time when one of her nieces she had cared for since the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving her 5-year-old son, Roger Christie an orphan. Carson took on the responsibility of Roger Christie when she adopted him, alongside caring for her aging mother. Carson moved to [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] to care for Roger, and much of 1957 was spent putting together a new living situation and studying on specific environmental threats\n\nBy late 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying; the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) planned to eradicate [[Red imported fire ant|fire ants]], and other spraying programs involving [[Organochloride|chlorinated hydrocarbons]] and [[organophosphate]]s were on the rise.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=305\u201313}}</ref> For the rest of her life, Carson's main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse.\n\n===''Silent Spring''===\n{{Main|Silent Spring}}\n{{See also|DDT|}}\n\n''[[Silent Spring]]'', Carson's best-known book, was published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] on 27 September 1962.<ref name=McLaughlin>{{cite web |author=McLaughlin, Dorothy |title=Fooling with Nature: ''Silent Spring'' Revisited |work=Frontline |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html |access-date=August 24, 2010}}</ref> The book described the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, and is widely credited with helping launch the [[environmental movement]].<ref>Josie Glausiusz.

It was the United States federal government's 1957 [[gypsy moth]] eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with [[fuel oil]]), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on [[Long Island]] filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely.<ref name=CarsonPaull /> Though the suit was lost, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.<ref name=CarsonPaull /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fay|first=S.|title=Marjorie Spock |journal=The Ellsworth American |date=January 30, 2008 |page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Jennifer|title=Obituary for Marjorie Spock|journal=Newsletter of the Portland Branch of Anthroposophical Society in Portland, Oregon|date=February 2008|volume=4|issue=2|page=7|url=http://www.portlandanthroposophy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/February2008PortlandBranchNewsletter.pdf|access-date=29 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829182612/http://www.portlandanthroposophy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/February2008PortlandBranchNewsletter.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Audubon Naturalist Society]] also actively opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to help make public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=312\u201317}}</ref> Carson began the four-year project of what would become ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist [[E. B. White]], and a number of journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with ''[[Newsweek]]'' science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when ''The New Yorker'' commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of ''Silent Spring'').<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=317\u201327}}</ref>\n\nAs her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides.<ref name=CarsonPaull /> She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as [[biological pest control]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=327\u201336}}</ref>\n\nShe also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of [[biodynamic agriculture]] organic market gardeners, their adviser, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, other contacts, and their suite of legal actions (1957-1960) against the U.S. Government.  According to recent research by Paull (2013), this may have been the primary and (for strategic reasons) uncredited source for Carson's book. [[Marjorie Spock]] and Mary T. Richards, of Long Island, New York, contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). They  compiled their evidence and shared it with Carson, who used it, their extensive contacts, and the trial transcripts, as a primary input for ''Silent Spring''. Carson wrote of the content as \"a gold mine of information\" and says, \"I feel guilty about the mass of your material I have here\"<ref>Carson, R. (1958c). MS typewritten letter: Dear Miss Spock; 12/8/1958. New Haven, CT: Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.</ref> and makes multiple references to Pfeiffer and to his correspondence.<ref>Paull, John. \"The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring.\" Sage Open 3, no. 3 (2013) doi:10.1177/2158244013494861.</ref><ref>Carson, R. (1958f). MS typewritten letter: Dear Mrs. Spock; 26/3/1958 (1 p.). New Haven, CT: Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.</ref>\n\nBy 1959, the USDA's [[Agricultural Research Service]] responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, ''Fire Ant on Trial''; Carson characterized it as \"flagrant [[propaganda]]\" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially [[dieldrin]] and [[heptachlor]]) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', that attributed the recent decline in bird populations\u2014in her words, the \"silencing of birds\"\u2014to pesticide overuse.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=342\u201346}}</ref> That was also the year of the \"Great Cranberry Scandal\": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. [[cranberry|cranberries]] were found to contain high levels of the herbicide [[3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole|aminotriazole]] (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible \"financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=358\u201361}}</ref>\n\nResearch at the [[United States National Library of Medicine|Library of Medicine]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of [[National Cancer Institute]] researcher and environmental cancer section founding director [[Wilhelm Hueper]], who classified many pesticides as [[carcinogen]]s. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide [[carcinogenesis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=355\u201358}}</ref>\n\nBy 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of ''Silent Spring''. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a [[mastectomy]]. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was [[malignant]] and the cancer had [[metastasized]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=360\u201368}}</ref> Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of ''The Sea Around Us'', and by a collaborative photo essay with [[Erich Hartmann (photographer)|Erich Hartmann]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=372\u201373}}. The photo essay, ''The Sea'', was published in ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'', May/June 1961; Carson provided the captions for Hartmann's photographs.</ref> Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on [[biological pest control]]s and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=376\u201377}}</ref> During this time while writing the book Carson had to hide her illness so that the pesticide companies couldn't use it against her. She worried that if the companies knew it would give them additional ammunition to make her book look untrustworthy and biased.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Koehn |first1=Nancy |title=Forged in crisis : the power of courageous leadership in turbulent times |date=3 October 2017 |isbn=9781501174445 |page=416 |edition=First Scribner hardcoverition}}</ref>\n\nIt was difficult finding a title for the book; \"Silent Spring\" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: ''Silent Spring'' would be a metaphorical title for the entire book, suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world, rather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377\u201378, 386\u201387, 389}}</ref> With Carson's approval, editor [[Paul Brooks (author)|Paul Brooks]] at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, ''A Fable for Tomorrow'', which Carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing, and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=390\u201397}}</ref>\n\n====Content====\nAs biographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson \"quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the [[paradigm]] of [[scientific progress]] that defined [[post-war]] American culture.\" The overriding theme of ''Silent Spring'' is the powerful\u2014and often adverse\u2014effect humans have on the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166\u201376}}</ref>\n\nCarson's main argument is that [[pesticide]]s have detrimental effects on the environment; they are more properly termed ''[[biocide]]s'', she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny as well, many of which are subject to [[bioaccumulation]]. Carson also accuses the [[chemical industry]] of intentionally spreading [[disinformation]] and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166\u201372}}</ref> About DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson says only a little:\n{{quote|In laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver tumors. Scientists of the Food and Drug Administration who reported the discovery of these tumors were uncertain how to classify them, but felt there was some \"justification for considering them low grade hepatic cell carcinomas.\" Dr. Hueper [author of ''Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases''] now gives DDT the definite rating of a \"chemical carcinogen.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=225}}</ref>}}\n\nCarson predicted increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted pests develop [[pesticide resistance]], while weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated [[invasive species]]. The book closes with a call for a [[biotic material|biotic]] approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=169, 173}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to the pesticide DDT, Carson never actually called for an outright ban. Part of the argument she made in ''Silent Spring'' was that even if DDT and other insecticides had ''no'' environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counter-productive because it would create insect resistance to the pesticide(s), making the pesticides useless in eliminating the target insect populations:\n\n{{quote|No responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored. The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease through the control of insect vectors of infection, but it has heard little of the other side of the story\u2014the defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now strongly support the alarming view that the insect enemy has been made actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our very means of fighting.<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=266}}</ref>}}\n\nCarson further noted that \"Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes\"<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=267}}</ref> and emphasized the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: \"Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity' ... Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.\"<ref name=\"Carson 1962 275\">{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=275}}</ref>\n\n====Promotion and reception====\nCarson and the others involved with publication of ''Silent Spring'' expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for [[Defamation|libel]]. Carson was also undergoing [[radiation therapy]] to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=397\u2013400}}</ref>\n\nMost of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the [[White House]] Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of ''Silent Spring'' to many of the delegates, and promoted the upcoming ''New Yorker'' serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice [[William O. Douglas]], a longtime environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377, 400\u201307}}. Douglas's dissenting opinion on the rejection of the case, ''Robert Cushman Murphy et al., v. Butler et al.'', from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, is from March 28, 1960.</ref>\n\nThough ''Silent Spring'' had generated a fairly high level of interest based on prepublication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', which began in the June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time Carson also learned that ''Silent Spring'' had been selected as the [[Book of the Month Club|Book of the Month]] for October; as she put it, this would \"carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like\u2014much less ''The New Yorker''.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=407\u201308}}. Quotation (p. 408) from a June 13, 1962, letter from Carson to Dorothy Freeman.</ref> Other publicity included a positive editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and excerpts of the serialized version in ''[[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]]'' magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug [[thalidomide]] broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=409\u201313}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Silent Spring Book-of-the-Month-Club edition.JPG|thumb|The [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] edition of ''[[Silent Spring]]'', including an endorsement by Justice Douglas, had a first print run of 150,000 copies, two-and-a-half times the combined size of the two conventional printings of the initial release.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=416, 419}}</ref>]] -->\nIn the weeks leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to ''Silent Spring'' from the chemical industry. [[DuPont]] (a main manufacturer of DDT and [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]]) and [[Velsicol Chemical Corporation]] (exclusive manufacturer of [[chlordane]] and [[heptachlor]]) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as ''The New Yorker'' and ''Audubon'' unless the planned ''Silent Spring'' features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process ''Silent Spring'' had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=412\u201320}}</ref>\n\n[[American Cyanamid]] biochemist [[Robert White-Stevens]] and former Cyanamid chemist [[Thomas H. Jukes|Thomas Jukes]] were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=433\u201334}}</ref> According to White-Stevens, \"If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth.\"<ref name=\"frontline_Cyanamid\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html Fooling with nature: special reports: Silent Spring revisited:]. Retrieved September 23, 2007.</ref> Others went further, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her personal character. White-Stevens labeled her \"...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature,\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=434}}</ref> while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture [[Ezra Taft Benson]], in a letter to former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was \"probably a [[Communism|Communist]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=429\u201330}}. Benson's supposed comments were widely repeated at the time, but have not been directly confirmed.</ref>\n\nMany critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem.<ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2005||p=9}}</ref> In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in ''Silent Spring'' not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.<ref name=\"Carson 1962 275\" />\n\nThe academic community, including prominent defenders such as [[Hermann Joseph Muller|H. J. Muller]], [[Loren Eiseley]], [[Clarence Cottam]], and [[Frank Edwin Egler|Frank Egler]], by and large backed the book's scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson's way as well. The chemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as ''Silent Spring'' book sales. Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the ''[[CBS Reports]]'' TV special ''The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson'' that aired April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from ''Silent Spring'' and interviews with a number of other experts, mostly critics (including White-Stevens); according to biographer [[Linda Lear]], \"in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=437\u201349}}; quotation from 449.</ref> Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=449\u201350}}</ref> Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and on Carson had largely lost momentum.<ref name=\"time100\">[http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/carson03.html The Time 100: Scientists and Thinkers], accessed September 23, 2007</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=461}}</ref>\n\nIn one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President [[John F.

Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she was unable to accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the [[National Audubon Society#Audubon Medal|Audubon Medal]] (from the [[National Audubon Society]]), the [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] (from the [[American Geographical Society]]), and induction into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=451\u201361, 469\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWeakened from [[breast cancer]] and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964.

Her longtime agent and literary executor [[Marie Rodell]] spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=467\u201358, 477, 482\u201383}} See also the Beinecke [http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/beinecke.carson finding aid for the Rachel Carson Papers].</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Rodell arranged for the publication of an essay Carson had intended to expand into a book: ''The Sense of Wonder''. The essay, which was combined with photographs by [[Charles Pratt II|Charles Pratt]] and others, exhorts parents to help their children experience the \"...lasting pleasures of contact with the natural world ... available to anyone who will place himself under the influence of earth, sea and sky and their amazing life.\"<ref name=\"Murphy 25\">Murphy, 25; quotations from ''The Sense of Wonder'', 95.

All of Carson's books remain in print.<ref name=\"Murphy 25\" />\n\n===Grassroots environmentalism and the EPA===\nCarson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. ''Silent Spring'', in particular, was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, \"''Silent Spring'' altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|p=3}}</ref> Carson's work, and the activism it inspired, are at least partly responsible for the [[deep ecology]] movement, and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential on the rise of [[ecofeminism]] and on many feminist scientists.<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nWhile there remains no evidence that Carson was openly a women's rights activist, her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy for the ecofeminist movement.<ref name=\":0\" /> Attacks on Carson's credibility included criticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an \"amateur\" and it was said that her writing was too \"emotional.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Ecofeminist scholars argue that not only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint Carson as hysterical, but was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of large agri-business corporations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Others, such as Yaakov Garb, suggest that in addition to not being a women's rights activist, Carson also had no anti-capitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the way photos of Carson were used to portray her are often questioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a scientist, but instead, of her leisure activities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCarson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world). Though environmental concerns about DDT had been considered by government agencies as early as Carson's testimony before the President's Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] was the first major milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to \"establish a citizen's right to a clean environment,\" and the arguments employed against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=46\u201347}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had brought to light. Until then, the same agency (the USDA) was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a [[conflict of interest]], since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as \"the extended shadow of ''Silent Spring''.\" Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcing the 1972 [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]], was directly related to Carson's work.<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=47\u201348, 148\u201363}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, the policies of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] emphasized economic growth, rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to Carson and her work.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=217\u201320}}; Jeffrey K.

Her widely praised 1951 bestseller ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'' won her a U.S. [[National Book Award]],<ref name=nba1952 /> recognition as a gifted writer, and financial security. Her next book, ''The Edge of the Sea'', and the reissued version of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'', were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.\n\nLate in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially some problems that she believed were caused by synthetic [[pesticide]]s. The result was the book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although ''Silent Spring'' was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on [[DDT]] and other pesticides. It also inspired a [[grassroots]] environmental movement that led to the creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref name=CarsonPaull>Paull, John (2013) [http://orgprints.org/22934/7/22934.pdf \"The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring\"], ''Sage Open'', 3(July): 1\u201312. {{doi|10.1177/2158244013494861}}</ref> Carson was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\n==Life and work==\n{{Listen|filename=Rachel Carson (As Told By EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy).ogg|title=Rachel Carson (As Told By EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy)}}\n\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:RachelCarsonHomestead.jpg|thumb|left|Carson's childhood home is now preserved as the [[Rachel Carson Homestead]] (photo taken November 7, 2009)]]\nRachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near [[Springdale, Pennsylvania]], just up the [[Allegheny River]] from [[Pittsburgh]]. She was the daughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.une.edu/mwwc/research/featured-writers/rachel-l.-carson-collection-1946-1964 |title=Maine Women Writers Collection\u2014Research\u2014Featured Writers\u2014Rachel L. Carson Collection, 1946\u20131964 |publisher=University of New England |date= |access-date=2014-08-04}}</ref> She spent a lot of time exploring around her family's {{convert|65|acre||adj=on}} farm. An avid reader, she began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight and had her first story published at age ten. She especially enjoyed the ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'' (which carried her first published stories), the works of [[Beatrix Potter]], and the novels of [[Gene Stratton-Porter]], and in her teen years, [[Herman Melville]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature. Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania|Parnassus, Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-four students.<ref>Lear, 7\u201324</ref>\n\nAt the Pennsylvania College for Women (today known as [[Chatham University]]), as in high school, Carson was somewhat of a loner. She originally studied English, but switched her major to biology in January 1928, though she continued contributing to the school's student newspaper and literary supplement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rachel Carson|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/rachelcarson/carsonbio.html|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=23 April 2014}}</ref> Though admitted to graduate standing at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1928, she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated ''[[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]]'' in 1929. After a summer course at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], she continued her studies in [[zoology]] and [[genetics]] at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=27\u201362}}</ref>\n\nAfter her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in [[Raymond Pearl]]'s laboratory, where she worked with rats and ''[[Drosophila]]'', to earn money for tuition. After false starts with [[pit viper]]s and [[squirrel]]s, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the [[pronephros]] in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family during the Great Depression.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=Autumn 2011|title=\"Silence, Miss Carson!\" Science, Gender, and the Reception of \"Silent Spring\"|jstor=3178817|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=27|issue=3|pages=733\u2013752|doi=10.2307/3178817}}</ref> In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the [[United States Fish Commission|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled ''Romance Under the Waters''. The series of 52 seven-minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and in the work of the bureau, a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=63\u201379}}</ref>\n\nCarson's supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in 1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=79\u201382}}</ref>\n\n===Early career and publications===\nAt the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main responsibilities were to analyze and report field data on fish populations, and to write brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote a steady stream of articles for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=82\u201385}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1937, the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'' accepted a revised version of an essay, ''The World of Waters'', that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as ''Undersea'', was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house [[Simon & Schuster]], impressed by ''Undersea'', contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'' (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued\u2014her features appeared in ''Sun Magazine'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', and ''[[Collier's]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=85\u2013113}}</ref> Carson attempted to leave the Bureau (by then transformed into the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]) in 1945, but few jobs for naturalists were available, as most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the [[Manhattan Project]]. In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of [[DDT]], a revolutionary new pesticide\u2014lauded as the \"insect bomb\" after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]\u2014that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and [[Ecology|ecological]] effects. DDT was but one of Carson's many writing interests at the time, and editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=114\u201320}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Rachel Carson Conducts Marine Biology Research with Bob Hines.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rachel Carson and [[Robert W. Hines|Bob Hines]] conducting research off the Atlantic coast in 1952]]\nCarson rose within the Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 becoming chief editor of publications. Though her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was working on material for a second book and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, [[Marie Rodell]]; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=121\u201360}}</ref>\n\n[[Oxford University Press]] expressed interest in Carson's book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become ''[[The Sea Around Us]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=163\u201364}}.<br />\u2022 An apocryphal story holds that the book was rejected by over twenty publishers before Oxford University Press. In fact, it may have only been sent to one other publisher before being accepted, though Rodell and Carson worked extensively to place chapters and excerpts in periodicals.</ref> Chapters appeared in ''[[Science Digest]]'' and ''[[The Yale Review]]''\u2014the latter chapter, \"The Birth of an Island\", winning the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]'s George Westinghouse Science Writing Prize.

She also licensed a documentary film based on it. ''The Sea''{{'s}} success led to the republication of ''Under the Sea Wind'', which became a bestseller itself.

This led to many scientific inconsistencies inside the film.  Allen then proceeded in spite of Carson's objections to fix the problems to produce a very successful documentary.  It then proceeded to win the 1953 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]], but Carson was so embittered by the experience that she never again sold film rights to her work.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=239\u201340}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with Dorothy Freeman===\nCarson first met Dorothy Freeman in the summer of 1953 in [[Southport, Maine|Southport Island, Maine]]. Freeman had written to Carson welcoming her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the beginning of an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book ''Always, Rachel'', published in 1995 by Beacon Press.\n\nCarson's biographer, [[Linda J. Lear]], writes that \"Carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=248}}</ref> She found this in Freeman. The two women had a number of common interests, nature chief among them, and began exchanging letters regularly while apart. They would share summers for the remainder of Carson's life, and meet whenever else their schedules permitted.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=243\u201388}}</ref>\n\nIn regard to the extent of their relationship, commentators have said that: \"the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Montefiore, Janet|title='The fact that possesses my imagination': Rachel Carson, Science and Writing|journal=Women: A Cultural Review|volume=12|issue=1|page=48|year=2001|doi=10.1080/09574040110034110}}</ref> Freeman shared parts of Carson's letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=255\u201356}}</ref> Some believe Freeman and Carson's relationship was romantic in nature.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/deliberate-pace-rachel-carson/|title=A Deliberate Pace: On Rachel Carson|last=Gornick|first=Vivian|date=2013-02-19|access-date=2019-08-05|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/26/the-right-way-to-remember-rachel-carson|title=The Right Way to Remember Rachel Carson|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=2018-03-19|access-date=2019-08-05|language=en|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> One of the letters from Carson to Freeman reads: \u201cBut, oh darling, I want to be with you so terribly that it hurts!\u201d, while in another, Freeman writes: \u201cI love you beyond expression...

The surviving correspondence was published in 1995 as ''Always, Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952\u20131964: An Intimate Portrait of a Remarkable Friendship'', edited by Freeman's granddaughter. Editor Martha Freeman, Dorothy's granddaughter, wrote at publication: \"A few comments in early letters indicate that Rachel and Dorothy were initially cautious about the romantic tone and terminology of their correspondence.

Her brother, Robert Carson, insisted that her cremated remains be buried beside their mother in Maryland. This was against her own wishes to be buried in Maine. In the end, a compromise was reached. Carson's own wishes were carried out by an organizing committee, including her agent (Marie Rodell), her editor (Paul Brooks) and Dorothy Freeman. In the Spring of 1964, Dorothy received half of Rachel's ashes in the mail sent to her by Robert Carson. In the summer of that year, Dorothy carried out Rachel's final wishes, scattering her ashes along the rocky shores of Sheepscot Bay in Maine.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=482\u2013483}}</ref>\n\n===<span id=\"The Edge of the Sea\"></span> ''The Edge of the Sea'' and transition to conservation work ===\nEarly in 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=223\u201344}}</ref> In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, ''The Edge of the Sea'', which focuses on life in [[coast]]al ecosystems, particularly along the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It appeared in ''The New Yorker'' in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; ''The Edge of the Sea'' received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for ''The Sea Around Us''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=261\u201376}}</ref>\n\nThrough 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on a number of projects\u2014including the script for an ''[[Omnibus (U.S. TV series)|Omnibus]]'' episode, \"Something About the Sky\"\u2014and wrote articles for popular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address [[evolution]], but the publication of [[Julian Huxley]]'s ''Evolution in Action''\u2014and her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic\u2014led her to abandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She considered an environment-themed book project tentatively titled ''Remembrance of the Earth'' and became involved with [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other conservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in Maine she and Freeman called the \"Lost Woods.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=276\u2013300}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1957, a family tragedy struck for a third time when one of her nieces she had cared for since the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving her 5-year-old son, Roger Christie an orphan. Carson took on the responsibility of Roger Christie when she adopted him, alongside caring for her aging mother. Carson moved to [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] to care for Roger, and much of 1957 was spent putting together a new living situation and studying on specific environmental threats\n\nBy late 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying; the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) planned to eradicate [[Red imported fire ant|fire ants]], and other spraying programs involving [[Organochloride|chlorinated hydrocarbons]] and [[organophosphate]]s were on the rise.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=305\u201313}}</ref> For the rest of her life, Carson's main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse.\n\n===''Silent Spring''===\n{{Main|Silent Spring}}\n{{See also|DDT|}}\n\n''[[Silent Spring]]'', Carson's best-known book, was published by [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]] on 27 September 1962.<ref name=McLaughlin>{{cite web |author=McLaughlin, Dorothy |title=Fooling with Nature: ''Silent Spring'' Revisited |work=Frontline |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html |access-date=August 24, 2010}}</ref> The book described the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, and is widely credited with helping launch the [[environmental movement]].<ref>Josie Glausiusz.

It was the United States federal government's 1957 [[gypsy moth]] eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with [[fuel oil]]), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on [[Long Island]] filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely.<ref name=CarsonPaull /> Though the suit was lost, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.<ref name=CarsonPaull /><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fay|first=S.|title=Marjorie Spock |journal=The Ellsworth American |date=January 30, 2008 |page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Jennifer|title=Obituary for Marjorie Spock|journal=Newsletter of the Portland Branch of Anthroposophical Society in Portland, Oregon|date=February 2008|volume=4|issue=2|page=7|url=http://www.portlandanthroposophy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/February2008PortlandBranchNewsletter.pdf|access-date=29 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829182612/http://www.portlandanthroposophy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/February2008PortlandBranchNewsletter.pdf|archivedate=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Audubon Naturalist Society]] also actively opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to help make public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=312\u201317}}</ref> Carson began the four-year project of what would become ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist [[E. B. White]], and a number of journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with ''[[Newsweek]]'' science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when ''The New Yorker'' commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of ''Silent Spring'').<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=317\u201327}}</ref>\n\nAs her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides.<ref name=CarsonPaull /> She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as [[biological pest control]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=327\u201336}}</ref>\n\nShe also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of [[biodynamic agriculture]] organic market gardeners, their adviser, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, other contacts, and their suite of legal actions (1957-1960) against the U.S. Government.  According to recent research by Paull (2013), this may have been the primary and (for strategic reasons) uncredited source for Carson's book. [[Marjorie Spock]] and Mary T. Richards, of Long Island, New York, contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). They  compiled their evidence and shared it with Carson, who used it, their extensive contacts, and the trial transcripts, as a primary input for ''Silent Spring''. Carson wrote of the content as \"a gold mine of information\" and says, \"I feel guilty about the mass of your material I have here\"<ref>Carson, R. (1958c). MS typewritten letter: Dear Miss Spock; 12/8/1958. New Haven, CT: Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.</ref> and makes multiple references to Pfeiffer and to his correspondence.<ref>Paull, John. \"The Rachel Carson Letters and the Making of Silent Spring.\" Sage Open 3, no. 3 (2013) doi:10.1177/2158244013494861.</ref><ref>Carson, R. (1958f). MS typewritten letter: Dear Mrs. Spock; 26/3/1958 (1 p.). New Haven, CT: Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.</ref>\n\nBy 1959, the USDA's [[Agricultural Research Service]] responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, ''Fire Ant on Trial''; Carson characterized it as \"flagrant [[propaganda]]\" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially [[dieldrin]] and [[heptachlor]]) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', that attributed the recent decline in bird populations\u2014in her words, the \"silencing of birds\"\u2014to pesticide overuse.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=342\u201346}}</ref> That was also the year of the \"Great Cranberry Scandal\": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. [[cranberry|cranberries]] were found to contain high levels of the herbicide [[3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole|aminotriazole]] (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible \"financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=358\u201361}}</ref>\n\nResearch at the [[United States National Library of Medicine|Library of Medicine]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of [[National Cancer Institute]] researcher and environmental cancer section founding director [[Wilhelm Hueper]], who classified many pesticides as [[carcinogen]]s. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide [[carcinogenesis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=355\u201358}}</ref>\n\nBy 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of ''Silent Spring''. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a [[mastectomy]]. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was [[malignant]] and the cancer had [[metastasized]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=360\u201368}}</ref> Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of ''The Sea Around Us'', and by a collaborative photo essay with [[Erich Hartmann (photographer)|Erich Hartmann]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=372\u201373}}. The photo essay, ''The Sea'', was published in ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'', May/June 1961; Carson provided the captions for Hartmann's photographs.</ref> Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on [[biological pest control]]s and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=376\u201377}}</ref> During this time while writing the book Carson had to hide her illness so that the pesticide companies couldn't use it against her. She worried that if the companies knew it would give them additional ammunition to make her book look untrustworthy and biased.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Koehn |first1=Nancy |title=Forged in crisis : the power of courageous leadership in turbulent times |date=3 October 2017 |isbn=9781501174445 |page=416 |edition=First Scribner hardcoverition}}</ref>\n\nIt was difficult finding a title for the book; \"Silent Spring\" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: ''Silent Spring'' would be a metaphorical title for the entire book, suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world, rather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377\u201378, 386\u201387, 389}}</ref> With Carson's approval, editor [[Paul Brooks (author)|Paul Brooks]] at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, ''A Fable for Tomorrow'', which Carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing, and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=390\u201397}}</ref>\n\n====Content====\nAs biographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson \"quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the [[paradigm]] of [[scientific progress]] that defined [[post-war]] American culture.\" The overriding theme of ''Silent Spring'' is the powerful\u2014and often adverse\u2014effect humans have on the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166\u201376}}</ref>\n\nCarson's main argument is that [[pesticide]]s have detrimental effects on the environment; they are more properly termed ''[[biocide]]s'', she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny as well, many of which are subject to [[bioaccumulation]]. Carson also accuses the [[chemical industry]] of intentionally spreading [[disinformation]] and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166\u201372}}</ref> About DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson says only a little:\n{{quote|In laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver tumors. Scientists of the Food and Drug Administration who reported the discovery of these tumors were uncertain how to classify them, but felt there was some \"justification for considering them low grade hepatic cell carcinomas.\" Dr. Hueper [author of ''Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases''] now gives DDT the definite rating of a \"chemical carcinogen.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=225}}</ref>}}\n\nCarson predicted increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted pests develop [[pesticide resistance]], while weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated [[invasive species]]. The book closes with a call for a [[biotic material|biotic]] approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=169, 173}}</ref>\n\nIn regards to the pesticide DDT, Carson never actually called for an outright ban. Part of the argument she made in ''Silent Spring'' was that even if DDT and other insecticides had ''no'' environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counter-productive because it would create insect resistance to the pesticide(s), making the pesticides useless in eliminating the target insect populations:\n\n{{quote|No responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored. The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease through the control of insect vectors of infection, but it has heard little of the other side of the story\u2014the defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now strongly support the alarming view that the insect enemy has been made actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our very means of fighting.<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=266}}</ref>}}\n\nCarson further noted that \"Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes\"<ref>{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=267}}</ref> and emphasized the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: \"Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity' ... Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.\"<ref name=\"Carson 1962 275\">{{harvnb|Carson|1962|p=275}}</ref>\n\n====Promotion and reception====\nCarson and the others involved with publication of ''Silent Spring'' expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for [[Defamation|libel]]. Carson was also undergoing [[radiation therapy]] to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=397\u2013400}}</ref>\n\nMost of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the [[White House]] Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of ''Silent Spring'' to many of the delegates, and promoted the upcoming ''New Yorker'' serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice [[William O. Douglas]], a longtime environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377, 400\u201307}}. Douglas's dissenting opinion on the rejection of the case, ''Robert Cushman Murphy et al., v. Butler et al.'', from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, is from March 28, 1960.</ref>\n\nThough ''Silent Spring'' had generated a fairly high level of interest based on prepublication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', which began in the June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time Carson also learned that ''Silent Spring'' had been selected as the [[Book of the Month Club|Book of the Month]] for October; as she put it, this would \"carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like\u2014much less ''The New Yorker''.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=407\u201308}}. Quotation (p. 408) from a June 13, 1962, letter from Carson to Dorothy Freeman.</ref> Other publicity included a positive editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and excerpts of the serialized version in ''[[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]]'' magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug [[thalidomide]] broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=409\u201313}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Silent Spring Book-of-the-Month-Club edition.JPG|thumb|The [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] edition of ''[[Silent Spring]]'', including an endorsement by Justice Douglas, had a first print run of 150,000 copies, two-and-a-half times the combined size of the two conventional printings of the initial release.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=416, 419}}</ref>]] -->\nIn the weeks leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to ''Silent Spring'' from the chemical industry. [[DuPont]] (a main manufacturer of DDT and [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]]) and [[Velsicol Chemical Corporation]] (exclusive manufacturer of [[chlordane]] and [[heptachlor]]) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as ''The New Yorker'' and ''Audubon'' unless the planned ''Silent Spring'' features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process ''Silent Spring'' had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=412\u201320}}</ref>\n\n[[American Cyanamid]] biochemist [[Robert White-Stevens]] and former Cyanamid chemist [[Thomas H. Jukes|Thomas Jukes]] were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=433\u201334}}</ref> According to White-Stevens, \"If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth.\"<ref name=\"frontline_Cyanamid\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html Fooling with nature: special reports: Silent Spring revisited:]. Retrieved September 23, 2007.</ref> Others went further, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her personal character. White-Stevens labeled her \"...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature,\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=434}}</ref> while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture [[Ezra Taft Benson]], in a letter to former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was \"probably a [[Communism|Communist]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=429\u201330}}. Benson's supposed comments were widely repeated at the time, but have not been directly confirmed.</ref>\n\nMany critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem.<ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2005||p=9}}</ref> In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in ''Silent Spring'' not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.<ref name=\"Carson 1962 275\" />\n\nThe academic community, including prominent defenders such as [[Hermann Joseph Muller|H. J. Muller]], [[Loren Eiseley]], [[Clarence Cottam]], and [[Frank Edwin Egler|Frank Egler]], by and large backed the book's scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson's way as well. The chemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as ''Silent Spring'' book sales. Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the ''[[CBS Reports]]'' TV special ''The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson'' that aired April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from ''Silent Spring'' and interviews with a number of other experts, mostly critics (including White-Stevens); according to biographer [[Linda Lear]], \"in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=437\u201349}}; quotation from 449.</ref> Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=449\u201350}}</ref> Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and on Carson had largely lost momentum.<ref name=\"time100\">[http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/carson03.html The Time 100: Scientists and Thinkers], accessed September 23, 2007</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=461}}</ref>\n\nIn one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President [[John F.

Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she was unable to accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'' and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the [[National Audubon Society#Audubon Medal|Audubon Medal]] (from the [[National Audubon Society]]), the [[Cullum Geographical Medal]] (from the [[American Geographical Society]]), and induction into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=451\u201361, 469\u201373}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWeakened from [[breast cancer]] and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964.

It was also influential on the rise of [[ecofeminism]] and on many feminist scientists.<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nWhile there remains no evidence that Carson was openly a women's rights activist, her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy for the ecofeminist movement.<ref name=\":0\" /> Attacks on Carson's credibility included criticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an \"amateur\" and it was said that her writing was too \"emotional.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Ecofeminist scholars argue that not only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint Carson as hysterical, but was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of large agri-business corporations.<ref name=\":0\" /> Others, such as Yaakov Garb, suggest that in addition to not being a women's rights activist, Carson also had no anti-capitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the way photos of Carson were used to portray her are often questioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a scientist, but instead, of her leisure activities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCarson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world). Though environmental concerns about DDT had been considered by government agencies as early as Carson's testimony before the President's Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] was the first major milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to \"establish a citizen's right to a clean environment,\" and the arguments employed against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=46\u201347}}</ref>\n\nThe creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) by the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had brought to light. Until then, the same agency (the USDA) was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a [[conflict of interest]], since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as \"the extended shadow of ''Silent Spring''.\" Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcing the 1972 [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]], was directly related to Carson's work.<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=47\u201348, 148\u201363}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, the policies of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] emphasized economic growth, rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to Carson and her work.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=217\u201320}}; Jeffrey K.

The franchise features a fictional history of Earth and the human race after the year 1999, as well as the history of humanoid civilization in the [[Milky Way]]. It consists of four TV series, four movies, six [[Original video animation|OVAs]], one [[light novel]], and five [[manga]] series, all sponsored by [[Big West Advertising]], in addition to 40 [[List of Macross video games|video games set in the Macross universe]], 2 [[Crossovers in video games|crossover games]], and a wide variety of physical merchandise.\n\nWithin the series, the term ''Macross'' is used to denote the main [[capital ship]]. This theme began in the original Macross, the [[SDF-1 Macross|SDF-1 ''Macross'']].\n\n''Overtechnology'' refers to the scientific advances discovered in an alien starship ASS-1 (''Alien Star Ship - One'' later renamed ''Super Dimension Fortress - One Macross'') that crashed on ''South Ataria'' island. Humans were able to reverse engineer the technology to create the [[mecha]] ([[variable fighter]]s and destroids), [[faster-than-light]] [[space fold]] drive for starships and other advanced technologies that the series features. The first TV series  was adapted into the first season of ''[[Robotech]]'' in 1985, with edited content and a revised script.\n\n==Title==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Macross Box Set.jpg|thumb|252px|The cover to the ''Macross'' Memorial DVD Box Set which shows several characters from the first animated series of the franchise, ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'']] -->\nThe series title comes from the name of the main human spacecraft (which is usually shortened from ''Super Dimension Fortress'' to SDF-1 ''Macross'' as it is the first). The original name for the ''Macross'' project was ''Battle City Megarodo'' (or ''Battle City Megaroad'', as the Japanese transliteration to either \"L\" or \"R\" gives the title a double meaning in reference to the story line: ''Megaload'', referring to the spacecraft containing an entire city of people; and ''Megaroad'', referring to the long journey through space back to Earth); however, one of the sponsors of the project, [[Big West Advertising]], was a fan of Shakespeare and wanted the series and the spacecraft to be named {{nihongo|''[[Macbeth]]''|\u30de\u30af\u30d9\u30b9|Makubesu}}. A compromise was made with the title {{nihongo|''Macross''|\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30b9|Makurosu}} due to its similar pronunciation to ''Macbeth'' in Japanese and because it still contained connotations to the original title. The word ''Macross'' comes from a wordplay combination of the prefix \"macro\" in reference to its massive size in comparison to human vehicles (though when compared with the alien ships in the series, it is a relatively small gun destroyer) and the distance they must cross.\n\n==Themes==\nThe following are themes commonly seen and established among the various series in the Macross franchise.\n\n===U.N. Spacy===\n[[File:U.N. Spacy Roundel.svg|thumb|Right|200px|U.N. Spacy Roundel]]\nThe {{nihongo|U.N. Spacy|\u7d71\u5408\u5b87\u5b99\u8ecd|T\u014dg\u014d Uch\u016bgun}} is a fictional space military arm of the {{nihongo|[[Earth]] Unified Government|\u5730\u7403\u7d71\u5408\u653f\u5e9c|Chiky\u016b T\u014dg\u014d Seifu}}. It was established by the successor to the modern [[United Nations]] in order to defend Earth from a possible attack by hostile [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], and was involved in Space War I against an extraterrestrial race called the [[Zentradi]]. Later operations of the U.N. Spacy expanded into interstellar [[Space colonization|colonization]] and general [[peacekeeping]] of off-world Earth settlements.\n\nThe term \"Spacy\" is a portmanteau of the terms ''Space'' and ''Army'' or ''Navy''. Some Japanese sources also use the term ''Space Army'' and some English-language sources use the term ''Space Navy'', suggesting that the term is a contraction.\n\n===Variable fighters===\nA [[variable fighter]] (also known as a \"veritech\" fighter in the ''[[Robotech]]'' adaptation of the series), is one of a series of transformable aerospace [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], primarily designed by [[Studio Nue]]'s [[Shoji Kawamori]] and [[Kazutaka Miyatake]]. They are generally able to transform into jet/space fighters, a humanoid robot and a hybrid of the two modes, better known as Gerwalk (Guardian). The original [[VF-1 Valkyrie]] was actually named \"Valkyrie\", but the craft have generically been referred to as such in the series since then.\n\n===Music===\nMusic is integral part to almost every Macross title by having significances in a series' antagonists behavior towards it. Music idols also play a central role to various Macross stories. Often, the protagonist will be involved in a love triangle with a series' music idol; most notably, [[Lynn Minmay]].\n\n===Space fold===\nSpace folding permits nearly-instantaneous ultra-long distance travel: a space-fold transports a spacecraft in a very short amount of time by first swapping the location of the spacecraft with ''super dimension'' space or subspace, and then swapping the ''Super Dimension'' space with the space at the destination. \n \nAccording to U.N. Spacy First Lieutenant Hayase Misa during Space War I (2009\u20132012) an hour passes in super dimension space as approximately ten days passes in normal space. One of the latest ''Macross'' TV series, ''[[Macross Frontier]]'', further expands on that concept by introducing fold faults or dislocations, which further retard fold travel and interfere with fold communications. Also explained in ''Macross Frontier'' are the limitations of space folding, such as the geometric increase in energy requirement with the mass of the object to be folded, which prevents very large objects from being folded with ease across vast distances.\n\nThe act of entering ''Super Dimension'' space is called \"fold in\". When arriving at the destination, the act of leaving ''Super Dimension'' space is called a \"defold\" or a \"fold out\".\n\n===Ancient astronauts===\nThe metaplot of the franchise is centered on a purportedly extinct humanoid alien race called the {{nihongo|Protoculture|[[w:ja:\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30ab\u30eb\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc (\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba)|\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30ab\u30eb\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc]]|Purotokaruch\u0101}}. It was first conceptualized during the pre-production of ''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' when the creators were researching cultural studies to develop concepts used in the plot.\n\nAccording to official sources, the Protoculture was the [[cradle of civilization|first advanced humanoid race]] in the universe\u2014advanced Protoculture civilization started 500,000 years ago\u2014and is the creator of the [[Zentradi]] and [[homo sapiens]]. Phases of colonization resulted in the establishment of an \"Interstellar Republic\", (similar to a [[galactic empire]]) which covers much of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy 2800 years after Protoculture civilization started (498,000 years ago).\n\nA civil war happened sixty years later, resulting in a split in the Republic. One of the factions' created \"super-Zentradi\" forces, which was later possessed by interdimensional beings\u2014these forces are later called the \"Protodeviln\", which feeds on [[life energy]] of both Protoculture and Zentradi; some of both the Protoculture and Zentradi was later brainwashed into the \"Supervision Army\".\n\nThe Supervision Army continued to battle both the Protoculture and Zentradi, which resulted in the dwindling of Protoculture population; they revoked the prime directive that banned Zentradi to attack the Supervision Army. This, however, made the war even more intense, and the Protoculture population sharply decreased; to avoid extinction, they seeded uninhabited planets by means of [[pantropy]] and avoided any conflict as much as possible. This action included the genetic engineering of [[human|homo sapiens]] on Earth by combining Protoculture genes with native genes; a \"sub-Protoculture\" race meant for preparing the Earth for a future Protoculture colonization. The genetic engineering crew, however, was immediately destroyed by anti-Interstellar Republic military ships.\n\nThe final blow of the war happened because of the Protoculture lost control of the Zentradi; 475,000 years ago, the Protoculture was believed extinct. However it was discovered that 10,000 years ago, the Protoculture remnants made contact with humans in \"Mayan Island\", genetically re-engineering the native inhabitants to utilize the artifacts left by them. This included the \"Bird Human\" bio-mecha, tasked to destroy humanity if they are still in war.\n\n===Other elements===\nThe franchise also explores minor themes including [[culture shock]], [[capitalism]], [[coming of age]] and [[nostalgia]].\n\nThe new era following the end of Space War I is part of the ongoing fictional time-line of the ''Macross'' franchise. The most recent series, ''[[Macross Delta]]'', is set 59 years after the start of the war with the Zentradi. Its main plot is about the spread of a rage virus on a star system and the combined efforts of singing idols and valkyrie fighters to stop it spreading.\n\nAlong with ''[[Gundam]],'' a [[real robot]] [[mecha]] series of which [[Shoji Kawamori]] is a fan, ''Macross'' explored how individuals cope with warfare. Whereas ''Gundam'' is far more political and direct on the horrors of war, each ''Macross'' television series is unique for never depicting the antagonists as inherently evil and proved in the end that love, culture, and music can be used to defeat them.\n\n==Series chronology==\nSeveral sequel series and one prequel have followed. Most use a chronology created by the Studio Nue creators, and those that followed their own chronologies were regarded as \"parallel storylines\" by the studio. Several different studios were involved with Studio Nue in the Macross franchise along the years, but since 2002's ''[[Macross Zero]]'', production has been handled exclusively between Nue and [[Satelight]], from which Sh\u014dji Kawamori is one of the main key members. The main of Macross production consists of (in chronological release order):\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Release Dates\n!Episodes\n!Work\n!Title (original)\n!Chronology\n|-\n|1982/10 to<br>1983/06||36||TV series||''[[Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]''<ref>[http://www.macross.co.jp/ The Super Dimension Fortress Macross (TV Series).

This movie was later described as a \"historical drama\" movie within the Macross universe (similar to World War II films in the real world). In ''Macross Plus'' and ''Macross 7'', it is revealed that there was a movie produced after [[First Space War|Space War I]] (the original Earth-Zentradi conflict). Kawamori described the relation between the two depictions of Space War I: \"The real Macross is out there, somewhere. If I tell the story in the length of a TV series, it looks one way, and if I tell it as a movie-length story, it's organized another way.\"<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite news | title=Shoji Kawamori Interview | work=Animerica Vol. 3 No. 1 | publisher = Viz, LLC }}</ref> (An edited, English-dubbed version of the feature was also released to video as ''Clash of the Bionoids''.)\n\n''[[Macross II]]'', the only animated project without Studio Nue's direct involvement, was declared a parallel-world story by Studio Nue.\n\nIn March 2007, Studio Victor placed a casting call for a voice actress to play the heroine, [[Ranka Lee]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-08-18/yoko-kanno-heroine's-voice-announced-for-new-macross|title=Yoko Kanno, Heroine's Voice Announced for New Macross}}</ref> in a then untitled new Macross series.<ref>[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-03-09/follow-up-victor-voice-actress-auditions-for-macross Follow Up: Victor Voice Actress Auditions for Macross]</ref> Eighteen-year-old Nakajima Megumi was selected in the nationwide singing and acting audition for the role of Ranka Lee in Japan. The project was given the tentative title of ''Macross 25''. Later, as part of the 25th anniversary concert, a trailer was shown that revealed the new tentative title of ''[[Macross frontier|Macross F (Frontier)]]''. During the concert, [[Kawamori Shoji]] mentioned that the timeframe of Macross Frontier was about 2070 AD. Kawamori also announced that [[Yoko Kanno]] would be the music co-composer of the new Macross series. According to Newtype Magazine, this new series were supposed to take place in a school. The pilot episode aired on December 23, 2007. The new series were finally set in the year 2059 AD and took place in a new Macross Colony Fleet called \"Macross Frontier\". The new show was produced by [[Satelight]] and its episodes began their regular broadcast on April 4, 2008, in [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]] channel of Japan.

[[anime]] [[media franchise]]/[[media mix]], created by [[Studio Nue]] (most prominently mechanical designer [[Sh\u014dji Kawamori]]) and [[Artland (company)|Artland]] in 1982. The franchise features a fictional history of Earth and the human race after the year 1999, as well as the history of humanoid civilization in the [[Milky Way]]. It consists of four TV series, four movies, six [[Original video animation|OVAs]], one [[light novel]], and five [[manga]] series, all sponsored by [[Big West Advertising]], in addition to 40 [[List of Macross video games|video games set in the Macross universe]], 2 [[Crossovers in video games|crossover games]], and a wide variety of physical merchandise.\n\nWithin the series, the term ''Macross'' is used to denote the main [[capital ship]]. This theme began in the original Macross, the [[SDF-1 Macross|SDF-1 ''Macross'']].\n\n''Overtechnology'' refers to the scientific advances discovered in an alien starship ASS-1 (''Alien Star Ship - One'' later renamed ''Super Dimension Fortress - One Macross'') that crashed on ''South Ataria'' island. Humans were able to reverse engineer the technology to create the [[mecha]] ([[variable fighter]]s and destroids), [[faster-than-light]] [[space fold]] drive for starships and other advanced technologies that the series features. The first TV series  was adapted into the first season of ''[[Robotech]]'' in 1985, with edited content and a revised script.\n\n==Title==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Macross Box Set.jpg|thumb|252px|The cover to the ''Macross'' Memorial DVD Box Set which shows several characters from the first animated series of the franchise, ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'']] -->\nThe series title comes from the name of the main human spacecraft (which is usually shortened from ''Super Dimension Fortress'' to SDF-1 ''Macross'' as it is the first). The original name for the ''Macross'' project was ''Battle City Megarodo'' (or ''Battle City Megaroad'', as the Japanese transliteration to either \"L\" or \"R\" gives the title a double meaning in reference to the story line: ''Megaload'', referring to the spacecraft containing an entire city of people; and ''Megaroad'', referring to the long journey through space back to Earth); however, one of the sponsors of the project, [[Big West Advertising]], was a fan of Shakespeare and wanted the series and the spacecraft to be named {{nihongo|''[[Macbeth]]''|\u30de\u30af\u30d9\u30b9|Makubesu}}. A compromise was made with the title {{nihongo|''Macross''|\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30b9|Makurosu}} due to its similar pronunciation to ''Macbeth'' in Japanese and because it still contained connotations to the original title. The word ''Macross'' comes from a wordplay combination of the prefix \"macro\" in reference to its massive size in comparison to human vehicles (though when compared with the alien ships in the series, it is a relatively small gun destroyer) and the distance they must cross.\n\n==Themes==\nThe following are themes commonly seen and established among the various series in the Macross franchise.\n\n===U.N. Spacy===\n[[File:U.N. Spacy Roundel.svg|thumb|Right|200px|U.N. Spacy Roundel]]\nThe {{nihongo|U.N. Spacy|\u7d71\u5408\u5b87\u5b99\u8ecd|T\u014dg\u014d Uch\u016bgun}} is a fictional space military arm of the {{nihongo|[[Earth]] Unified Government|\u5730\u7403\u7d71\u5408\u653f\u5e9c|Chiky\u016b T\u014dg\u014d Seifu}}. It was established by the successor to the modern [[United Nations]] in order to defend Earth from a possible attack by hostile [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], and was involved in Space War I against an extraterrestrial race called the [[Zentradi]]. Later operations of the U.N. Spacy expanded into interstellar [[Space colonization|colonization]] and general [[peacekeeping]] of off-world Earth settlements.\n\nThe term \"Spacy\" is a portmanteau of the terms ''Space'' and ''Army'' or ''Navy''. Some Japanese sources also use the term ''Space Army'' and some English-language sources use the term ''Space Navy'', suggesting that the term is a contraction.\n\n===Variable fighters===\nA [[variable fighter]] (also known as a \"veritech\" fighter in the ''[[Robotech]]'' adaptation of the series), is one of a series of transformable aerospace [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], primarily designed by [[Studio Nue]]'s [[Shoji Kawamori]] and [[Kazutaka Miyatake]]. They are generally able to transform into jet/space fighters, a humanoid robot and a hybrid of the two modes, better known as Gerwalk (Guardian). The original [[VF-1 Valkyrie]] was actually named \"Valkyrie\", but the craft have generically been referred to as such in the series since then.\n\n===Music===\nMusic is integral part to almost every Macross title by having significances in a series' antagonists behavior towards it. Music idols also play a central role to various Macross stories. Often, the protagonist will be involved in a love triangle with a series' music idol; most notably, [[Lynn Minmay]].\n\n===Space fold===\nSpace folding permits nearly-instantaneous ultra-long distance travel: a space-fold transports a spacecraft in a very short amount of time by first swapping the location of the spacecraft with ''super dimension'' space or subspace, and then swapping the ''Super Dimension'' space with the space at the destination. \n \nAccording to U.N. Spacy First Lieutenant Hayase Misa during Space War I (2009\u20132012) an hour passes in super dimension space as approximately ten days passes in normal space. One of the latest ''Macross'' TV series, ''[[Macross Frontier]]'', further expands on that concept by introducing fold faults or dislocations, which further retard fold travel and interfere with fold communications. Also explained in ''Macross Frontier'' are the limitations of space folding, such as the geometric increase in energy requirement with the mass of the object to be folded, which prevents very large objects from being folded with ease across vast distances.\n\nThe act of entering ''Super Dimension'' space is called \"fold in\". When arriving at the destination, the act of leaving ''Super Dimension'' space is called a \"defold\" or a \"fold out\".\n\n===Ancient astronauts===\nThe metaplot of the franchise is centered on a purportedly extinct humanoid alien race called the {{nihongo|Protoculture|[[w:ja:\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30ab\u30eb\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc (\u30de\u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba)|\u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30ab\u30eb\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc]]|Purotokaruch\u0101}}. It was first conceptualized during the pre-production of ''The Super Dimension Fortress Macross'' when the creators were researching cultural studies to develop concepts used in the plot.\n\nAccording to official sources, the Protoculture was the [[cradle of civilization|first advanced humanoid race]] in the universe\u2014advanced Protoculture civilization started 500,000 years ago\u2014and is the creator of the [[Zentradi]] and [[homo sapiens]]. Phases of colonization resulted in the establishment of an \"Interstellar Republic\", (similar to a [[galactic empire]]) which covers much of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy 2800 years after Protoculture civilization started (498,000 years ago).\n\nA civil war happened sixty years later, resulting in a split in the Republic. One of the factions' created \"super-Zentradi\" forces, which was later possessed by interdimensional beings\u2014these forces are later called the \"Protodeviln\", which feeds on [[life energy]] of both Protoculture and Zentradi; some of both the Protoculture and Zentradi was later brainwashed into the \"Supervision Army\".\n\nThe Supervision Army continued to battle both the Protoculture and Zentradi, which resulted in the dwindling of Protoculture population; they revoked the prime directive that banned Zentradi to attack the Supervision Army. This, however, made the war even more intense, and the Protoculture population sharply decreased; to avoid extinction, they seeded uninhabited planets by means of [[pantropy]] and avoided any conflict as much as possible. This action included the genetic engineering of [[human|homo sapiens]] on Earth by combining Protoculture genes with native genes; a \"sub-Protoculture\" race meant for preparing the Earth for a future Protoculture colonization. The genetic engineering crew, however, was immediately destroyed by anti-Interstellar Republic military ships.\n\nThe final blow of the war happened because of the Protoculture lost control of the Zentradi; 475,000 years ago, the Protoculture was believed extinct. However it was discovered that 10,000 years ago, the Protoculture remnants made contact with humans in \"Mayan Island\", genetically re-engineering the native inhabitants to utilize the artifacts left by them. This included the \"Bird Human\" bio-mecha, tasked to destroy humanity if they are still in war.\n\n===Other elements===\nThe franchise also explores minor themes including [[culture shock]], [[capitalism]], [[coming of age]] and [[nostalgia]].\n\nThe new era following the end of Space War I is part of the ongoing fictional time-line of the ''Macross'' franchise. The most recent series, ''[[Macross Delta]]'', is set 59 years after the start of the war with the Zentradi. Its main plot is about the spread of a rage virus on a star system and the combined efforts of singing idols and valkyrie fighters to stop it spreading.\n\nAlong with ''[[Gundam]],'' a [[real robot]] [[mecha]] series of which [[Shoji Kawamori]] is a fan, ''Macross'' explored how individuals cope with warfare. Whereas ''Gundam'' is far more political and direct on the horrors of war, each ''Macross'' television series is unique for never depicting the antagonists as inherently evil and proved in the end that love, culture, and music can be used to defeat them.\n\n==Series chronology==\nSeveral sequel series and one prequel have followed. Most use a chronology created by the Studio Nue creators, and those that followed their own chronologies were regarded as \"parallel storylines\" by the studio. Several different studios were involved with Studio Nue in the Macross franchise along the years, but since 2002's ''[[Macross Zero]]'', production has been handled exclusively between Nue and [[Satelight]], from which Sh\u014dji Kawamori is one of the main key members. The main of Macross production consists of (in chronological release order):\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Release Dates\n!Episodes\n!Work\n!Title (original)\n!Chronology\n|-\n|1982/10 to<br>1983/06||36||TV series||''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]''<ref>[http://www.macross.co.jp/ The Super Dimension Fortress Macross (TV Series).

[[Nick Fury]], director of S.H.I.E.L.D., later reveals this to Stark, and Romanoff then helps Stark to thwart the plans of villains [[Justin Hammer]] and [[Ivan Vanko]], the latter of whom has remotely taken control of an army of military drones and the armor of Stark's friend James Rhodes. Romanoff successfully defeats Hammer's security forces to return control of the Rhodes' armor, allowing Stark and Rhodes to defeat Vanko and the drones.\n===Battle of New York===\nSome months later, while Loki begins his attack on Earth, Romanoff is being held prisoner and interrogated by Russians. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] is able to contact Romanoff to inform her that Loki has compromised Barton, and Romanoff promptly overcomes her captors, whom she had only allowed to capture her as a ploy to extract information. Romanoff recruits [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] from his seclusion in [[Kolkata]] to use his expertise to track the gamma signature of Loki's scepter. On board S.H.I.E.L.D.'s helicarrier, she tricks Loki into revealing his plan to cause Banner to become the Hulk, but is too late, as Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and pursue Romanoff until he is distracted by [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rogers]], Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and Hulk then rally in defense of Loki's next target, New York City.\n===Working with Captain America===\nTwo years after the [[The Avengers (2012 film)|Battle of New York]], Romanoff and Rogers are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[counter-terrorism]] [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]] team to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from [[Batroc the Leaper|Georges Batroc]] and his mercenaries. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. After an attempt on Fury's life, Rogers becomes a fugitive hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., and meets with Romanoff. Using data in the flash drive, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the [[mind uploading|preserved consciousness]] of [[Arnim Zola]]. Zola reveals that ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after [[World War II]], [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and realize that Secretary of Internal Security [[Alexander Pierce]] is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D. To prevent Hydra from using helicarriers to attack the world's superheroes, Romanoff, disguised as a World Security Council member, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Romanoff later appears before a Senate subcommittee, while Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells.\n===Battle of Sokovia and Civil War===\nRomanoff continues to work with the Avengers, helping them to attack a Hydra facility where they recover Loki's scepter. She becomes romantically involved with Banner, but he and Stark accidentally create Ultron, who captures Romanoff and takes her to Sokovia. Rescued by Banner, she pushes him off a ledge to force his transformation into the Hulk to aid in the battle against Ultron, an act which later influences Hulk to leave Earth altogether. Sokovia is destroyed in the battle, leading to the passage of the Sokovia Accords, over which Tony Stark and Steve Rogers have a falling out. Romanoff initially sides with Stark's team, accompanying them to battle Rogers and his allies at Leipzig Airport, but Romanoff then switches sides to allow Rogers to escape with Bucky Barnes.\n===The Infinity War===\nRomanoff later reconnects with a fugitive Rogers, and, two years after the passing of the Sokovia Accords, when Thanos sends his minions to retrieve Infinity Stones on Earth, she, Rogers, and [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]] arrive in Scotland in time to defend [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] and [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] from an attack by members of the Black Order. She travels to [[Wakanda]] to aid in the battle against the forces of Thanos, but the defenders are unable to prevent Thanos from obtaining the stones and using them to eliminate half of all life in the Universe. \n\nRomanoff survives the snap, and travels with the newly arrived Captain Marvel and other surviving Avengers to Thanos' garden planet to attempt to recover the Infinity Stones, only to learn that Thanos has already destroyed them. Romanoff then returns to Earth to continue to lead the remnants of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers from the former Avengers headquarters in upstate New York.\n\nFive years after the Infinity War, [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] comes to the Avengers headquarters and informs Romanoff and Rogers that he has been trapped in the quantum realm, where time passes differently, affording a means to steal the Infinity Stones from the past and bring back those who were destroyed by Thanos. After working to recruit Stark and Banner to the cause, Romanoff travels to a past version of the planet Vormir with Barton. After an initial scuffle with him over the decision regarding whom to sacrifice for the Soul Stone, Romanoff sacrifices her life so that Barton can obtain the Soul Stone and eventually return to his family. The original five members following the mission later mourn her death and honor her sacrifice, with Banner finally using the Stark Gauntlet to bring the disintegrated back to life. Banner later notes that he had tried at that time to also bring Romanoff back, and had been unable.\n\n==Differences from the comics==\nRomanoff in the MCU is a founding member of the Avengers, while in the comics she is a much later addition, and initially an antagonist to the team. This version also showed a romance with [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] that was mostly explored in ''Age of Ultron'' but hinted at in later and previous films. She is also very close to Clint Barton's family, unlike in the Ultimate Comics where she murders each member before she is killed by Hawkeye.\n\n==Reception==\nDavid Edelstein of ''[[New York Magazine]]'' described the presence of the female leads in ''Iron Man 2'' as \"a gam-off between Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson in which Paltrow wins on length and then disappears in the glare of her opponent's headlights\".<ref name=\"NewYorkMagReview\">{{Cite web|date=May 2, 2010 |url=https://nymag.com/movies/reviews/65745/ |author=David Edelstein |title=Battle of the Rehabbed Stars |work=[[New York Magazine]] |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AJTLsz4h?url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/65745/ |archivedate=August 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' notes that her entrance in that film \"famously chose to focus on her desirability rather than her staggering combat skills\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/avengers-endgame-black-widow-death-scarlett-johansson|title=How Avengers: Endgame Failed Black Widow|first=Laura|last=Bradley|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA ''Daily Beast'' review of the character's role in ''Age of Ultron'' lamented that the character had been made to \"function as a cog that services the storylines\" of the male characters.<ref name=\"Disgrace\"/> ''Vanity Fair'' described the development of the character across the films as \"a trajectory that's been as all over the map as Black Widow's varying hairstyles\", stating that she \"spent her years in the MCU as an accessory to narratives foregrounding other heroes\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\"/>\n\nVox notes that in ''Avengers: Endgame'', \"Johansson takes Romanoff \u2014 usually the dependable, no-frills assassin \u2014 into quiet, stoic suffering\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/23/18512851/avengers-endgame-review-marvel-miracle|title=Avengers: Endgame is a Marvel miracle|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santosalex|publisher=Vox|date=April 23, 2019}}</ref> while ''Vanity Fair'' laments that the film \"never gives her or her death room to breathe\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

[[Nick Fury]], director of S.H.I.E.L.D., later reveals this to Stark, and Romanoff then helps Stark to thwart the plans of villains [[Justin Hammer]] and [[Ivan Vanko]], the latter of whom has remotely taken control of an army of military drones and the armor of Stark's friend James Rhodes. Romanoff successfully defeats Hammer's security forces to return control of the Rhodes' armor, allowing Stark and Rhodes to defeat Vanko and the drones.\n===Battle of New York===\nSome months later, while Loki begins his attack on Earth, Romanoff is being held prisoner and interrogated by Russians. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] is able to contact Romanoff to inform her that Loki has compromised Barton, and Romanoff promptly overcomes her captors, whom she had only allowed to capture her as a ploy to extract information. Romanoff recruits [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] from his seclusion in [[Kolkata]] to use his expertise to track the gamma signature of Loki's scepter. On board S.H.I.E.L.D.'s helicarrier, she tricks Loki into revealing his plan to cause Banner to become the Hulk, but is too late, as Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and pursue Romanoff until he is distracted by [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rogers]], Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and Hulk then rally in defense of Loki's next target, New York City.\n===Working with Captain America===\nTwo years after the [[The Avengers (2012 film)|Battle of New York]], Romanoff and Rogers are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[counter-terrorism]] [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]] team to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from [[Batroc the Leaper|Georges Batroc]] and his mercenaries. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. After an attempt on Fury's life, Rogers becomes a fugitive hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., and meets with Romanoff. Using data in the flash drive, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the [[mind uploading|preserved consciousness]] of [[Arnim Zola]]. Zola reveals that ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after [[World War II]], [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and realize that Secretary of Internal Security [[Alexander Pierce]] is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D. To prevent Hydra from using helicarriers to attack the world's superheroes, Romanoff, disguised as a World Security Council member, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Romanoff later appears before a Senate subcommittee, while Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells.\n===Battle of Sokovia and Civil War===\nRomanoff continues to work with the Avengers, helping them to attack a Hydra facility where they recover Loki's scepter. She becomes romantically involved with Banner, but he and Stark accidentally create Ultron, who captures Romanoff and takes her to Sokovia. Rescued by Banner, she pushes him off a ledge to force his transformation into the Hulk to aid in the battle against Ultron, an act which later influences Hulk to leave Earth altogether. Sokovia is destroyed in the battle, leading to the passage of the Sokovia Accords, over which Tony Stark and Steve Rogers have a falling out. Romanoff initially sides with Stark's team, accompanying them to battle Rogers and his allies at Leipzig Airport, but Romanoff then switches sides to allow Rogers to escape with Bucky Barnes.\n===The Infinity War===\nRomanoff later reconnects with a fugitive Rogers, and, two years after the passing of the Sokovia Accords, when Thanos sends his minions to retrieve Infinity Stones on Earth, she, Rogers, and [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]] arrive in Scotland in time to defend [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] and [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] from an attack by members of the Black Order. She travels to [[Wakanda]] to aid in the battle against the forces of Thanos, but the defenders are unable to prevent Thanos from obtaining the stones and using them to eliminate half of all life in the Universe. \n\nRomanoff survives the snap, and travels with the newly arrived Captain Marvel and other surviving Avengers to Thanos' garden planet to attempt to recover the Infinity Stones, only to learn that Thanos has already destroyed them. Romanoff then returns to Earth to continue to lead the remnants of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers from the former Avengers headquarters in upstate New York.\n\nFive years after the Infinity War, [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] comes to the Avengers headquarters and informs Romanoff and Rogers that he has been trapped in the quantum realm, where time passes differently, affording a means to steal the Infinity Stones from the past and bring back those who were destroyed by Thanos. After working to recruit Stark and Banner to the cause, Romanoff travels to a past version of the planet Vormir with Barton. After an initial scuffle with him over the decision regarding whom to sacrifice for the Soul Stone, Romanoff sacrifices her life so that Barton can obtain the Soul Stone and eventually return to his family. The original five members following the mission later mourn her death and honor her sacrifice, with Banner finally using the Stark Gauntlet to bring the disintegrated back to life. Banner later notes that he had tried at that time to also bring Romanoff back, and had been unable.\n\n==Differences from the comics==\nRomanoff in the MCU is a founding member of the Avengers, while in the comics she is a much later addition, and initially an antagonist to the team. This version also showed a romance with [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] that was mostly explored in ''Age of Ultron'' but hinted at in later and previous films. She is also very close to Clint Barton's family, unlike in the Ultimate Comics where she murders each member before she is killed by Hawkeye.\n\n==Reception==\nDavid Edelstein of ''[[New York Magazine]]'' described the presence of the female leads in ''Iron Man 2'' as \"a gam-off between Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson in which Paltrow wins on length and then disappears in the glare of her opponent's headlights\".<ref name=\"NewYorkMagReview\">{{Cite web|date=May 2, 2010 |url=https://nymag.com/movies/reviews/65745/ |author=David Edelstein |title=Battle of the Rehabbed Stars |work=[[New York Magazine]] |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AJTLsz4h?url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/65745/ |archivedate=August 30, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' notes that her entrance in that film \"famously chose to focus on her desirability rather than her staggering combat skills\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/avengers-endgame-black-widow-death-scarlett-johansson|title=How Avengers: Endgame Failed Black Widow|first=Laura|last=Bradley|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA ''Daily Beast'' review of the character's role in ''Age of Ultron'' lamented that the character had been made to \"function as a cog that services the storylines\" of the male characters.<ref name=\"Disgrace\"/> ''Vanity Fair'' described the development of the character across the films as \"a trajectory that's been as all over the map as Black Widow's varying hairstyles\", stating that she \"spent her years in the MCU as an accessory to narratives foregrounding other heroes\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\"/>\n\nVox notes that in ''Avengers: Endgame'', \"Johansson takes Romanoff \u2014 usually the dependable, no-frills assassin \u2014 into quiet, stoic suffering\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/4/23/18512851/avengers-endgame-review-marvel-miracle|title=Avengers: Endgame is a Marvel miracle|first=Alex|last=Abad-Santosalex|publisher=Vox|date=April 23, 2019}}</ref> while ''Vanity Fair'' laments that the film \"never gives her or her death room to breathe\".<ref name=\"VFHowEndgame\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
