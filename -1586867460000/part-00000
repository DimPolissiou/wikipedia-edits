The following year, at {{age in years and days|1994|1|6|2013|12|14}} old, Florida State quarterback [[Jameis Winston]] became the youngest Heisman Trophy winner at that time as a freshman. Both, however, were in their second year of college, having been [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirted]] during their first year of attendance, meaning that no ''true'' freshman has yet won the award. No sophomore won the Heisman in its first 72 years, at which point there were three consecutive sophomore winners \u2014 [[Tim Tebow]] in 2007, followed by [[Sam Bradford]] and [[Mark Ingram Jr.]] \u2014 with [[Lamar Jackson]], who also surpassed Winston's record as the youngest Heisman winner, becoming the fourth in 2016. Of the four sophomores to have won the award, only Bradford had been redshirted; the others all won during their second year of college attendance. Only a few juniors have won the award, starting with the eleventh winner in 1945, [[Doc Blanchard]].\n\nFive players have finished in the top three of the Heisman voting as freshmen or sophomores before later winning the award: [[Angelo Bertelli]], [[Glenn Davis (halfback)|Glenn Davis]], [[Doc Blanchard]], [[Doak Walker]], and [[Herschel Walker]]. Eight players have finished in the top three as freshmen or sophomores but never won a Heisman: [[Clint Castleberry]], [[Marshall Faulk]], [[Michael Vick]], [[Rex Grossman]], [[Larry Fitzgerald]], [[Adrian Peterson]], [[Deshaun Watson]], and [[Christian McCaffrey]]. Four players have specifically finished second in consecutive years: Glenn Davis (second in 1944 and 1945, winner in 1946), Charlie Justice (second 1948 and 1949), [[Darren McFadden]] (second 2006 and 2007), and [[Andrew Luck]] (second 2010 and 2011).\n\nThe oldest and youngest Heisman winners ever both played for [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] schools. The oldest, [[Chris Weinke]], was 28 years old when he won in 2000; he spent six years in [[minor league baseball]] before enrolling at [[Florida State University|Florida State]]. The youngest winner is 2016 recipient Lamar Jackson of [[University of Louisville|Louisville]] at the age of {{age in years and days|1997|1|7|2016|12|10}}, four days younger than Jameis Winston was when he won in 2013.<!--The 2013 ceremony was on December 14; the 2016 ceremony was on December 10.-->\n\n==Position==\nThe Heisman is usually awarded either to a [[running back]] or a [[quarterback]]; very few players have won the trophy playing a position other than those two aforementioned. Two tight ends have won the trophy, [[Larry Kelley]] and [[Leon Hart]]. Also, [[Desmond Howard]] and [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]] won as wide receivers. [[Charles Woodson]] is the only primarily [[Defense (sport)|defensive]] player to win the award, doing so as a [[defensive back]], kick returner, and occasional wide receiver for [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] in 1997. Legendary [[linebacker]] [[Dick Butkus]] only placed sixth in [[1963 college football season|1963]] and third in [[1964 college football season|1964]] and could qualify as an interior lineman, as he played center on offense during his era when two-way players were still common. The highest finish ever for any individual who played exclusively on defense is second, by defensive end [[Hugh Green (American football)|Hugh Green]] of [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] in 1980 and linebacker [[Manti Te'o]] of Notre Dame in 2012. Although the Heisman is named in honor of [[John Heisman|an interior lineman]], no interior [[Lineman (American football)|lineman]] on either side of the ball has ever won the award. Offensive guard [[Tom Brown (defensive lineman)|Tom Brown]] of [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] and the offensive tackle [[John Hicks (American football)|John Hicks]] of [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] placed second in 1960 and 1973, respectively. Rich Glover, a defensive lineman from Nebraska, finished 3rd in the 1972 vote\u2014which was won by his Cornhusker teammate Johnny Rodgers. [[Washington Huskies football|Washington's]] DT [[Steve Emtman]] finished 4th in voting in 1991. [[Ndamukong Suh]] of [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] finished fourth in 2009 as a defensive tackle. Also, [[Kurt Burris]], a center for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football]] team, was a runner-up for the award in 1954 and [[Orlando Pace]] finished fourth in 1996 as an offensive tackle for [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\n==Venue==\nBecause of damage to the [[Downtown Athletic Club#September 11 and subsequent bankruptcy|Downtown Athletic Club]]'s facilities following [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], the 2001 award ceremony was moved to the [[New York Marriott Marquis]] in [[Times Square]].

Although [[Terry Baker]], quarterback from [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]], won the trophy in 1962, and [[Gary Beban]] from [[UCLA football|UCLA]] won in 1967, no non-USC player from the West Coast had won between [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]]'s [[Jim Plunkett]] in 1970 and [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon's]] [[Marcus Mariota]] in 2014.

All four were Stanford players who finished second in the Heisman balloting each year from 2009 to 2011, 2015, and 2017.\n\nThe West Coast bias discussion usually centers on the idea that East Coast voters see few West Coast games, because of television coverage contracts, [[time zone]] differences, or cultural interest. At Heisman-projection website StiffArmTrophy.com, commentator [[Kari Chisholm]] claims that the Heisman balloting process itself is inherently biased:\n\n<blockquote>\"For Heisman voting purposes, the nation is divided into six regions\u2014each of which get 145 votes. Put another way, each region gets exactly 16.67 percent of the votes. However, each region does not constitute an even one-sixth of the population. Three regions (Far West, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic) have larger populations than 16.67% of the national population; and three have less (Northeast, South, and Southwest). In fact, the Far West has the greatest population at 21.2% of the country and the Northeast has the least at 11.9%.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.stiffarmtrophy.com/2003/10/west_coast_bias.html |title=West Coast Bias |publisher=StiffArmTrophy |accessdate=2007-11-20}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==={{anchor|vacation}}Nullification of 2005 award===\n{{see also|Reggie Bush#NCAA investigation and lawsuits}}\nIn 2010 [[USC Trojans football|University of Southern California]] athletic director [[Pat Haden]] announced the university would return its replica of the 2005 Heisman Trophy due to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] sanctions requiring the university to dissociate itself from [[Reggie Bush]].

The first was [[Gordon Lockbaum|Gordie Lockbaum]] from [[Holy Cross Crusaders football|Holy Cross]] in 1987, followed by [[Steve McNair]], from [[Alcorn State University|Alcorn State]] in 1993. [[Armanti Edwards]], from [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State University]], was also briefly mentioned as a candidate for the award following [[2007 Appalachian State Mountaineers football team|Appalachian's]] [[2007 Appalachian State vs. Michigan football game|upset]] of No. 5-ranked [[2007 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] in 2007.\n\nBesides Griffin winning consecutive Heismans at Ohio State, four other programs had two different players win the Heisman Trophy in consecutive years: Yale (1936\u201337), [[Army Black Knights football|Army]] (1945\u201346), [[USC Trojans football|Southern California (USC)]] (2004\u201305, though [[Reggie Bush]] voluntarily [[#Nullification of 2005 award|forfeited his 2005 award]] in September 2010 and sent the trophy back to the Heisman Trust<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Erick|title=Reggie Bush announces he is giving back his Heisman Trophy|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/campusrivalry/post/2010/09/reggie-bush-announces-he-is-returing-his-heisman-trophy/1|accessdate=September 14, 2010|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 14, 2010}}</ref>), and Oklahoma (2017-2018). With an earlier win in 2002, the USC program actually had three different winners within four years.\n\nOnly three high schools have produced multiple Heisman trophy winners. The first was [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Dallas, Texas)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]] ([[Davey O'Brien]] in 1938 and [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]] in 1987) (Woodrow remains the only ''public'' high school to be so recognized). Thereafter, two private high schools also achieved this distinction:  [[Fork Union Military Academy]] in [[Fork Union, Virginia]] ([[Vinny Testaverde]] as a Postgraduate in 1982, and [[Eddie George]] in 1996) and [[Mater Dei High School (Santa Ana, California)|Mater Dei High School]] in [[Santa Ana, California]] ([[John Huarte]] in 1964 and [[Matt Leinart]] in 2004).\n\nOf the colleges where trophy namesake [[John Heisman]] coached, only [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn University]] has produced Heisman winners, with [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] in 1971, [[Bo Jackson]] in 1985, and [[Cam Newton]] in 2010.\n\n==Class and age==\nFor most of its history, most winners of the Heisman have been seniors.<ref>{{cite web |website=The Heisman Trophy |url=http://www.heisman.com/index.php/heismanWinners#winners-year |title=Heisman Winners |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801004040/http://www.heisman.com/index.php/heismanWinners#winners-year |archive-date=2014-08-01 |access-date=2009-12-13 }}</ref>\n\nTexas A&M quarterback [[Johnny Manziel]] became the first freshman to win the Heisman in 2012. The following year, at {{age in years and days|1994|1|6|2013|12|14}} old, Florida State quarterback [[Jameis Winston]] became the youngest Heisman Trophy winner at that time as a freshman. Both, however, were in their second year of college, having been [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirted]] during their first year of attendance, meaning that no ''true'' freshman has yet won the award. No sophomore won the Heisman in its first 72 years, at which point there were three consecutive sophomore winners \u2014 [[Tim Tebow]] in 2007, followed by [[Sam Bradford]] and [[Mark Ingram Jr.]] \u2014 with [[Lamar Jackson]], who also surpassed Winston's record as the youngest Heisman winner, becoming the fourth in 2016. Of the four sophomores to have won the award, only Bradford had been redshirted; the others all won during their second year of college attendance. Only a few juniors have won the award, starting with the eleventh winner in 1945, [[Doc Blanchard]].\n\nFive players have finished in the top three of the Heisman voting as freshmen or sophomores before later winning the award: [[Angelo Bertelli]], [[Glenn Davis (halfback)|Glenn Davis]], [[Doc Blanchard]], [[Doak Walker]], and [[Herschel Walker]]. Eight players have finished in the top three as freshmen or sophomores but never won a Heisman: [[Clint Castleberry]], [[Marshall Faulk]], [[Michael Vick]], [[Rex Grossman]], [[Larry Fitzgerald]], [[Adrian Peterson]], [[Deshaun Watson]], and [[Christian McCaffrey]]. Four players have specifically finished second in consecutive years: Glenn Davis (second in 1944 and 1945, winner in 1946), Charlie Justice (second 1948 and 1949), [[Darren McFadden]] (second 2006 and 2007), and [[Andrew Luck]] (second 2010 and 2011).\n\nThe oldest and youngest Heisman winners ever both played for [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] schools. The oldest, [[Chris Weinke]], was 28 years old when he won in 2000; he spent six years in [[minor league baseball]] before enrolling at [[Florida State University|Florida State]]. The youngest winner is 2016 recipient Lamar Jackson of [[University of Louisville|Louisville]] at the age of {{age in years and days|1997|1|7|2016|12|10}}, four days younger than Jameis Winston was when he won in 2013.<!--The 2013 ceremony was on December 14; the 2016 ceremony was on December 10.-->\n\n==Position==\nThe Heisman is usually awarded either to a [[running back]] or a [[quarterback]]; very few players have won the trophy playing a position other than those two aforementioned. Two tight ends have won the trophy, [[Larry Kelley]] and [[Leon Hart]]. Also, [[Desmond Howard]] and [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]] won as wide receivers. [[Charles Woodson]] is the only primarily [[Defense (sport)|defensive]] player to win the award, doing so as a [[defensive back]], kick returner, and occasional wide receiver for [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] in 1997. Legendary [[linebacker]] [[Dick Butkus]] only placed sixth in [[1963 college football season|1963]] and third in [[1964 college football season|1964]] and could qualify as an interior lineman, as he played center on offense during his era when two-way players were still common. The highest finish ever for any individual who played exclusively on defense is second, by defensive end [[Hugh Green (American football)|Hugh Green]] of [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] in 1980 and linebacker [[Manti Te'o]] of Notre Dame in 2012. Although the Heisman is named in honor of [[John Heisman|an interior lineman]], no interior [[Lineman (American football)|lineman]] on either side of the ball has ever won the award. Offensive guard [[Tom Brown (defensive lineman)|Tom Brown]] of [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] and the offensive tackle [[John Hicks (American football)|John Hicks]] of [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] placed second in 1960 and 1973, respectively. Rich Glover, a defensive lineman from Nebraska, finished 3rd in the 1972 vote\u2014which was won by his Cornhusker teammate Johnny Rodgers. [[Washington Huskies football|Washington's]] DT [[Steve Emtman]] finished 4th in voting in 1991. [[Ndamukong Suh]] of [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] finished fourth in 2009 as a defensive tackle. Also, [[Kurt Burris]], a center for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football]] team, was a runner-up for the award in 1954 and [[Orlando Pace]] finished fourth in 1996 as an offensive tackle for [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\n==Venue==\nBecause of damage to the [[Downtown Athletic Club#September 11 and subsequent bankruptcy|Downtown Athletic Club]]'s facilities following [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], the 2001 award ceremony was moved to the [[New York Marriott Marquis]] in [[Times Square]].

Three [[USC Trojans football|Southern California]] (USC) players have won the trophy in the early years of the 21st century and two won it subsequent to Palmer. Although [[Terry Baker]], quarterback from [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]], won the trophy in 1962, and [[Gary Beban]] from [[UCLA football|UCLA]] won in 1967, no non-USC player from the West Coast had won between [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]]'s [[Jim Plunkett]] in 1970 and [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon's]] [[Marcus Mariota]] in 2014. Other than Mariota's win, the closest since Plunkett's wins have been [[Toby Gerhart]], [[Andrew Luck]], [[Christian McCaffrey]], and [[Bryce Love]]. All four were Stanford players who finished second in the Heisman balloting each year from 2009 to 2011, 2015, and 2017.\n\nThe West Coast bias discussion usually centers on the idea that East Coast voters see few West Coast games, because of television coverage contracts, [[time zone]] differences, or cultural interest. At Heisman-projection website StiffArmTrophy.com, commentator [[Kari Chisholm]] claims that the Heisman balloting process itself is inherently biased:\n\n<blockquote>\"For Heisman voting purposes, the nation is divided into six regions\u2014each of which get 145 votes. Put another way, each region gets exactly 16.67 percent of the votes. However, each region does not constitute an even one-sixth of the population. Three regions (Far West, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic) have larger populations than 16.67% of the national population; and three have less (Northeast, South, and Southwest). In fact, the Far West has the greatest population at 21.2% of the country and the Northeast has the least at 11.9%.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.stiffarmtrophy.com/2003/10/west_coast_bias.html |title=West Coast Bias |publisher=StiffArmTrophy |accessdate=2007-11-20}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==={{anchor|vacation}}Nullification of 2005 award===\n{{see also|Reggie Bush#NCAA investigation and lawsuits}}\nIn 2010 [[USC Trojans football|University of Southern California]] athletic director [[Pat Haden]] announced the university would return its replica of the 2005 Heisman Trophy due to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] sanctions requiring the university to dissociate itself from [[Reggie Bush]]. The NCAA found that Bush had received gifts from an agent while at USC. On September 14, 2010, Bush voluntarily forfeited his title as a Heisman winner.

He wrote, \"Since the Heisman folks won't re-vote, we did. Vince Young is the ''new'' winner of the 2005 Heisman.\" A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' piece argued that Bush's Heisman was \"tainted\" but lamented that the decision came five years after Bush was awarded the trophy and, therefore, four years after the expiration of Bush's term as current holder of the Heisman title.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/16/vince-young-heisman-troph_n_718887.html |title=Vince Young: Heisman Trophy Should Not Be Mine |date=16 September 2010 |work=Huffington Post |access-date=2018-10-11 |language=en-US |department=Sports}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/6270202/24752749 |title=Vince Young wins the 2005 Heisman! |date=September 22, 2010 |website=CBS Sports |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924045527/http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/6270202/24752749 |archive-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/Reggie-Bush-Heisman-Trophy-asterisk-091410, |title=Bush's return of Heisman is wrong move |date=14 September 2010 |publisher=FOX Sports}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/16/opinion/la-ed-bush-20100916 |title=Reggie Bush's tainted Heisman |date=16 September 2010 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2018-10-11 |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035}}</ref>\n\n=== Elections involving notable controversy===\n\n* 2013\n** Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston won the 2013 Heisman Trophy amidst a sexual assault investigation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/16/jameis-winston-heisman-trophy-sexual-assault|title=Jameis Winston's Heisman win dogged by fallout from sexual assault case|date=December 16, 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2019-03-03}}</ref>\nWinston was never charged as Florida State Attorney Willie Meggs failed to find sufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations.\n* 2010\n** Auburn Quarterback Cam Newton won the 2010 Heisman Trophy amidst an NCAA eligibility inquiry.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Auburn's Cam Newton timeline: From recruitment to NCAA ruling|url = http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2010/12/auburns_cam_newton_timeline_fr.html|website = AL.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}</ref>\n*1967\n**Despite his team's beating the Bruins during the hours before the ceremony, USC's O.J.
