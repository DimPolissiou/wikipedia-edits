An excavation was conducted in July of the same year. This was the second survey on the Paleolithic period after a study of the [[Iwajuku]] archaeological site in [[Gunma Prefecture]]. It became clear that Paleolithic culture, which is older than that from the [[J\u014dmon period]], had spread universally in Japan. In addition, the knife-shaped stoneware excavated in this survey had a very distinctive form and was named \"Moro-type knife stoneware\". The archaeological site was designated as a [[cultural property]] of Tokyo in 1969, registered as a monument in Itabashi Ward in 1984, and listed as an archaeological site in 1999. Currently it is in [[J\u014dhoku-Ch\u016b\u014d Park]] in Tokyo, but it is not accessible so as to protect the wooded area around the site.
