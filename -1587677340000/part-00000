After they perform covers of famous songs, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to guess who the celebrities could be after each performs, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. It was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] as \"Monster\" and [[Wayne Brady]] as \"Fox\", respectively. While noted for being more positive than other [[reality television]] shows, the series has received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. However, its costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination. The series has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from being revealed before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider it at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020.

After they perform covers of famous songs, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to guess who the celebrities could be after each performs, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. It was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] as \"Monster\" and [[Wayne Brady]] as \"Fox\", respectively. While noted for being more positive than other [[reality television]] shows, the series has received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. However, its costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination. The series has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from being revealed before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider it at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. In an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

After he studied law in [[Paris]] he returned to Martinique inspired by [[\u00c9douard Glissant]] to take a close interest in Creole culture. Chamoiseau is the author of a historical work on the [[Antilles]] under the reign of [[Napoleon I of France|Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] and several non-fiction books which include ''\u00c9loge de la [[cr\u00e9olit\u00e9]]'' (In Praise of Creoleness), co-authored with [[Jean Bernab\u00e9]] and [[Rapha\u00ebl Confiant]]. \nAwarded the [[Prix Carbet de la Cara\u00efbe et du Tout-Monde|Prix Carbet]] (1990) for ''Antan d\u2019enfance''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tout-monde.com/pdf/2009-DP-PrixCarbet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717080226/http://www.tout-monde.com/pdf/2009-DP-PrixCarbet.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}</ref> ''Antan d'enfance'',  ''Chemin d'\u00e9cole'' and ''\u00c0 Bout d'enfance'' form the autobiographical trilogy ''Une enfance Cr\u00e9ole''. His novel ''[[Texaco (novel)|Texaco]]'' was awarded the [[Prix Goncourt]] in 1992, and was chosen as a ''[[New York Times]]'' ''Notable Book of the Year''. It has been described as \"a masterpiece, the work of a genius, a novel that deserves to be known as much as Fanon\u2019s ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' and Cesaire\u2019s ''[[Return to My Native Land]]''.<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/2012-08-24-refuge-for-the-wretched Refuge for the wretched], by PERCY ZVOMUYA, ''Mail & Guardian'', 24 August 2012.</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Chamoiseau was honoured with a [[Prince Claus Award]] for his contribution to Caribbean society.\n\nChamoiseau may also safely be considered as one of the most innovative writers to hit the French literary scene since [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]]. His freeform use of French language \u2014 a highly complex yet fluid mixture of constant invention and \"creolism\" \u2014 fuels a poignant and sensuous depiction of Martinique people in particular and humanity at large.\n\n== Writing Style and Approach ==\n\n=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===\nThe dynamics and relationship between men and women has been a long-time subject of literature in the Caribbean. The concept of \u2018[[masculinity]]\u2019 versus \u2018[[femininity]]\u2019 is a literary theme that is indicative of Caribbean literature. Patrick Chamoiseau, like many other authors from the Caribbean, uses this theme in many of his literary works. However, as there are a larger number of male writer that come out of the Caribbean, this topic of conversation is primarily male driven, and takes the \u2018masculinist\u2019 perspective.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nChamoiseau has often been criticized as being a somewhat patriarchal literary figure after having founded the masculinist Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9 movement in the [[Antilles|Antilles archipelago]]. The founding of this movement was intended to bring pride and nationalism to the male Antillean population that had been emasculated for centuries by being barred from holding positions of power and authority by their European colonizers. The practice of slavery can be argued to have had a more detrimental effect on the male slave population than the female slave population, as white slave owners attempting to have sexual affairs with female slaves would often offer them more privileges compared to their male counterparts. However, his literary work in the children's book \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\" is in stark contrast to his typical patriarchal and masculine nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nThe representation of men in Caribbean literature is typically portrayed in a negative light; however, in Chamoiseau's children's book \"Kosto et ses deux enfants,\" this theme is contrasted by the main male character becoming an upstanding and respectable father figure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Cr\u00e9olit\u00e9]] ===\nA question that many writers from the Caribbean try to answer is 'What does it mean to be Caribbean?'. This question is the subject of a search for identity, and the word that Chamoiseau and his colleagues used to answer this question is \"Creoleness\". Creoleness refers to how different cultures adapt and blend together on islands or isolated areas, which in the case of the Caribbean, refers to the blending of African, Polynesian, and Asian cultures with that of their European colonizers. This idea of Creoleness contrasts the idea of \"Americanness\" in that it existed prior to America, and that \"Americanness\" excludes it interaction with the indigenous population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\nThis relates to Patrick Chamoiseau's writing style in that his choices are purposeful as his overall goal is to express this concept of Creoleness. ''Creole Folktales'' is a prime example from his works. The collection itself takes place around the 17th century in the French Antilles and Chamoiseau casts storyteller-narrator and uses creole in order to recreate the tradition of storytelling in the Antilles that was primarily oral. Chamoiseau chooses these aspects to add to his writings as oral and historical accuracy are important in the representation of the Antilles and are crucial in bring awareness to Creoleness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gaeta|first=Jill M.|date=2010|title=Reevaluating the 'Masculine' and 'Feminine': Patrick Chamoiseau's \"Kosto et ses deux enfants\"|journal=The French Review|volume=84|issue=1|pages=140\u2013149|issn=0016-111X|jstor=25758340}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Novels===\n* ''Chronique des sept mis\u00e8res'' (1986).

{"title_page": "Ancient Maya art", "text_new": "{{Maya civilization}}\n'''Ancient Mayan art''' refers to the material arts of the Mayan civilization, an eastern and south-eastern Mesamerican culture that took shape in the course of the later Preclassic Period (500 BC to 200 AD). Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the Classic Period (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Mayan art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities.  Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.\n\n==Mayan art history==\nFollowing the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century publications on Maya art and archaeology by [[John Lloyd Stephens|Stephens]], [[Frederick Catherwood|Catherwood]], [[Alfred Maudslay|Maudslay]], [[Teoberto Maler|Maler]] and [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Charnay|Charnay]], that for the first time made available reliable drawings and photographs of major Classic Maya monuments. The 1913 publication of Herbert Spinden's 'A Study of Maya Art' ( now over a century ago ) laid the foundation for all later developments of Maya art history (including iconography).<ref>Spinden 1975</ref> The book gives an analytical treatment of themes and motifs, particularly the ubiquitous serpent and dragon motifs, and a review of the 'material arts', such as the composition of temple facades, roof combs and mask panels. Spinden's chronological treatment of Maya art was later (1950) refined by the motif analysis of the architect and specialist in archaeological drawing, [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], in her book 'A Study of Classic Maya Sculpture'.<ref>Proskouriakoff 1950</ref> [[George Kubler|Kubler's]] 1969 inventory of Maya iconography, containing a site-by-site treatment of 'commemorative' images and a topical treatment of ritual and mythical images (such as the 'triadic sign'), conclude a period of gradual increase of knowledge that was soon to be overshadowed by new developments.\n\nDon't forget your pants\n\nStarting in the early 1970s, the historiography of the Mayan kingdoms \u2013 first of all Palenque \u2013 came to occupy the forefront. Art-historical interpretation joined the historical approach pioneered by Proskouriakoff as well as the mythological approach initiated by [[Michael D. Coe|M.D. Coe]], with a professor of art, Linda Schele, serving as a driving force. Schele's seminal interpretations of Maya art are found throughout her work, especially in ''The Blood of Kings'', written together with art historian [[Mary Miller (art historian)|M. Miller]].<ref>Schele and Miller 1986</ref> Maya art history was also spurred by the enormous increase in sculptural and ceramic imagery, due to extensive archaeological excavations, as well as to organized looting on an unprecedented scale. On from 1973, M.D. Coe published a series of books offering pictures and interpretations of unknown Maya vases, with the Popol Vuh Twin myth for an explanatory model.<ref>Coe 1973, 1975, 1978, 1982</ref> In 1981, Robicsek and Hales added an inventory and classification of Maya vases painted in codex style,<ref>Robicsek and Hales 1981</ref> thereby revealing even more of a hitherto barely known spiritual world.\n\nAs to subsequent developments, important issues in Schele's iconographic work have been elaborated by [[Karl Taube]].<ref>E.g., Miller and Taube 1993; Taube et al. 2010</ref> New approaches to Maya art include studies of ancient Maya ceramic workshops,<ref>Reents-Budet 1994</ref> the representation of bodily experience and the senses in Maya art,<ref>Houston et al. 2005</ref> and of hieroglyphs considered as iconographic units.<ref name=\"Stone and Zender 2011\">Stone and Zender 2011</ref> Meanwhile, the number of monographs devoted to the monumental art of specific courts is growing.<ref>Tate 1992, Looper 2003, Simmons Clancy 2009, O'Neil 2012</ref> A good impression of recent Mexican and North American art historical scholarship can be gathered from the exhibition catalogue 'Courtly Art of the Ancient Maya' (2004).<ref>Miller and Martin 2004</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{main|Maya architecture}}\n\n[[File:Copan T11-2.jpg|thumb|Copan, 'Reviewing Stand' with simian musicians]] \n[[File:Labna-Palace-Vaulted-Passage.jpg|thumb|Labna, Palace, vaulted passage]]\n\nThe layout of the Maya towns and [[Maya city|cities]], and more particularly of the ceremonial centers where the royal families and courtiers resided, is characterized by the rhythm of immense horizontal stucco floors of plazas often located at various levels, connected by broad and often steep stairs, and surmounted by temple pyramids.<ref>Stierlin 1994</ref> Under successive reigns, the main buildings were enlarged by adding new layers of fill and stucco coating. Irrigation channels, reservoirs, and drains made up the hydraulic infrastructure. Outside the ceremonial center (especially in the southern area sometimes resembling an [[acropolis]]) were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines, surrounded by the wards of the commoners. Dam-like causeways ([[sacbe]]ob) spread from the 'ceremonial centers' to other nuclei of habitation. Fitting in with the concept of a '[[theatre state]]', more attention appears to have been given to aesthetics than to solidity of construction. Careful attention, however, was placed on directional orientation.\n\nAmong the various types of structures should be mentioned:\n*Ceremonial platforms (usually less than 4 meters in height).\n*Courtyards and palaces.\n*Other residential buildings, such as a writers' house <ref>Coe and Kerr 1997: 100-101</ref> and a possible council house in Copan.\n*Temples and temple pyramids, the latter often containing burials in their base or fill, with sanctuaries on top. The outstanding example are the many clustered dynastic burial temples of Tikal's [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]].   \n*[[Mesoamerican ball court|Ball courts]].\n \nAmong the structural ensembles are:\n*'[[Triadic pyramid]]s' consisting of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform;\n*'[[E-Group|E-groups]]' consisting of a square platform with a low four-stepped pyramid on the west side and an elongated structure, or, alternatively, three small structures, on the eastern side;\n*'[[Twin pyramid complex]]es', with identical four-stepped pyramids on the east and west sides of a small plaza; a building with nine doorways on the south side; and a small enclosure on the north side housing a sculpted stela with its altar and commemorating the king's performance of a [[k'atun]]-ending ceremony.\n\nIn the palaces and temple rooms, the '[[corbelled vault]]' was often applied. Though not an effective means to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a corbelled vault, to construct an inner sanctuary (e.g., that of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque).\n\nThe northern Maya area (Campeche and Yucat\u00e1n) shows characteristics of its own. Its Classic [[Puuc]], Chenes, and [[Rio Bec]] architecture<ref>Gendrop 1983</ref> is characterized by the geometrical reduction of realistic decoration; the stacking of rain god snouts to build facades; the use of portals shaped like serpent mouths; and, in the Rio Bec area, the use of solid pseudo temple-pyramids. The most important Puuc site is [[Uxmal]]. [[Chichen Itza]], dominating Yucat\u00e1n from the Late Classic to well into the Post-Classic, features Classic buildings in Chenes and Puuc style as well as Post-Classic building types of Mexican derivation, such as the radial four-staircase pyramid, the colonnaded hall, and the circular temple. The latter features were inherited by the succeeding kingdom of [[Mayapan]].\n\n==Stone sculpture==\n{{see also|Maya stelae}}\n[[File:Cancuenpanel3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Cancuen]], panel 3, seated king with two subordinates. Second half 8th century.]]\n[[File:Stela A Copan 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|180px|Copan stela A, Maudslay cast]] \nThe main Preclassic sculptural style from the Maya area is that of [[Izapa]], a large settlement on the Pacific coast where many stelas and (frog-shaped) altars were found showing motifs also present in [[Olmec]] art.<ref>Guernsey 2006</ref> The stelas, mostly without inscriptions, often show mythological and narrative subjects, some of which appear to relate to the Twin myth of the [[Popol Vuh]]. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain if the inhabitants of Izapa were ethnically Mayan. For the Classic Period of the Mayas, the following major classes of stone sculpture may be distinguished.\n\n*'''Stelas'''. These are large, elongated stone slabs usually covered with carvings and inscriptions, and often accompanied by round altars. Typical of the Classical period, most of them depict the rulers of the cities they were located in, often disguised as gods. Although the rulers' faces, particularly during the later Classic Period, are naturalistic in style, they usually do not show individual traits; but there are notable exceptions to this rule (e.g., [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], stela 35). The most famous stelas are from [[Copan]] and nearby [[Quirigua]]. These are outstanding for their intricateness of detail, those of Quirigua also for sheer height (stela E measuring over 7 metres above ground level and 3 below). Both the Copan and [[Tonina]] stelas approach sculptures in the round. From [[Palenque]], otherwise a true Maya capital of the arts, no significant stelae have been preserved.\n*'''[[lintel (architecture)|Lintels]]''', spanning doorways or jambs. Particularly [[Yaxchilan]] is renowned for its long series of lintels in deep relief, some of the most famous of which show meetings with [[Maya religion|ancestors]] or, perhaps, local deities.<ref>Tate 1992</ref>\n*'''Panels and tablets''', set in the walls and piers of buildings and the sides of platforms. Particularly [[Palenque]] is famous for the large tablets adorning the inner sanctuaries of the Cross Group temples, and for refined masterworks such as the 'Palace Tablet', the 'Tablet of the Slaves', and the multi-figure panels of the temple XIX and XXI platforms.<ref>Stuart and Stuart 2008</ref> King [[Pakal]]'s carved sarcophagus lid - without equal in other Maya kingdoms - might also be included here.\n*'''Altars''', rounded or rectangular, sometimes resting on three or four boulder-like legs. They may be wholly or partly figurative (e.g., Copan turtle altar) or have a relief image on top, sometimes consisting of a single ''[[Ajaw|Ahau]]'' day sign (Caracol, Tonina).<ref>Martin and Grube 2000: 89</ref>\n*'''Zoomorphs''', or large boulders sculpted to resemble living creatures and covered with highly complicated relief ornamentation. Zoomorphs seem to be restricted to the kingdom of [[Quirigua]] during the Late Classic period<ref>Looper 2003: 172-178, 186-192</ref> and may have functioned as altars.\n*'''Ball court markers''', or rounded relief carvings placed in the central axis of the floors of ball courts (such as those of Copan, [[Chinkultic]], Tonina), and usually showing royal ball game scenes. \n*'''Monumental stairs''', most famously the giant hieroglyphic stairway of Copan. The hewn stone blocks of hieroglyphic stairways together constitute an extensive text. Stairways can also be decorated with a great variety of scenes ([[La Corona]]), particularly the ball game. Sometimes, the ball game becomes the stairs' chief theme ([[Yaxchilan]]), with a captive depicted inside the ball, or, elsewhere ([[Tonina]]), a full-figure captive stretched out along the step.\n*'''Thrones''', with a broad, square seat, and a back sometimes iconically shaped like the wall of a cave, and worked open to show human figures. Examples from Palenque and Copan have supports showing cosmologic carriers ([[Bacab]]s, [[Chaak]]s).\n*'''Stone sculpture in the round''' is especially known from Copan and Tonin\u00e1. It is represented by statuary, such as a seated Copan scribe as well as captive figures and small stelas from Tonin\u00e1; by certain figurative architectural elements, such as the twenty maize deities from the fa\u00e7ade of Copan Temple 22;<ref>Schwerin 2011</ref> and by giant sculptures such as the symmetrically-positioned jaguars and simian musicians of Cop\u00e1n, that were integral parts of architectural design.\n\n==Wood carving==\n[[File:Mirror-Bearer MET DT1254.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Possible mirror bearer; 6th century; wood & red hematite; height: 35.9 cm (14{{fraction|1|8}} in.); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIt is believed that carvings in wood were once extremely common, but only a few examples have survived. Most 16th-century wood carvings, considered objects of idolatry, were destroyed by the Spanish colonial authorities. The most important Classic examples consist of intricately worked lintels, mostly from the main [[Tikal]] pyramid sanctuaries,<ref>W.R. Coe et al. 1961</ref> with one specimen from nearby [[El Zotz]]. The Tikal wood reliefs, each consisting of several beams, and dating to the 8th century, show a king on his seat with a protector figure looming large behind, in the form of a Teotihuacan-style 'war serpent' (Temple I lintel 2), a jaguar (Temple I lintel 3), or a human impersonator of the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar god of terrestrial fire]] (Temple IV lintel 2). Other Tikal lintels depict an obese king wearing a jaguar dress and standing in front of his seat (Temple III lintel 2); and most famously, a victorious king, dressed as an astral death god, and standing on a palanquin underneath an arching feathered serpent ([[Tikal Temple IV|Temple IV lintel 3]]). A rare utility object is a tiny lidded box from [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] with a hieroglyphic text all around it. Free sculpture in wood, dating back to the 6th century, is represented by a dignified seated man possibly functioning as a mirror bearer.\n\n==Stucco modeling==\n[[Image:PyramideDesMasquesKohunlich.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Stucco mask panels, Early Classic, Kohunlich]]\n[[Image:K'inich Janaab Pakal I v2.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Stucco portrait of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]\nAt least since Late Preclassic times, modeled and painted stucco plaster covered the floors and buildings of the town centers and provided the setting for their stone sculptures. Often, large mask panels with the plastered heads of deities in high relief (particularly those of sun, rain, and earth) are found attached to the sloping retaining walls of temple platforms flanking stairs (e.g., [[Kohunlich]]). Stucco modeling and relief work can also cover the entire building, as shown by Temple 16 of [[Copan]], in its 6th-century form (known as 'Rosalila'). Dedicated to the first king, [[Yax K'uk' Mo']], this early temple has preserved plastered and painted facades. The stuccoed friezes, walls, piers, and roof combs of the Late Preclassic and Classic periods show varying and sometimes symbolically complicated decorative programs.\n \nSeveral solutions for dividing up and ordering the stuccoed surfaces of buildings were applied, serialization being one of them. The Early Classic walls of the 'Temple of the [[Maya jaguar gods#The Jaguar God of Terrestrial Fire and War ('Night Sun')|Night Sun]]' in [[El Zotz]] consist of a series of subtly varied deity mask panels, whereas the frieze of a [[Balamku]] palace, also from the Early Classic, originally had a series of four rulers enthroned above the open ophidian mouths of four different animals (a toad among them) associated with symbolic mountains. Conversely, friezes may be centered on a single ruler again sitting on a symbolic (maize) mountain, such as a frieze from [[Holmul]], with two feathered serpents emanating from below the ruler's seat, and another one from [[Xultun]], on which the ruler carries a large ceremonial bar with emerging jaguar-like figures.<ref>newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php/Saturnoxultun</ref> An Early-Classic temple frieze from Placeres, Quintana Roo, has the large mask panel of a young lord or deity in the middle, with two lateral [[Mam (Maya mythology)|'Grandfather']] deities extending their arms.\n\nOften, a frieze is divided into compartments. Late Preclassic friezes of [[El Mirador]], for example, show the intervening spaces of an undulating serpent's body filled out with aquatic birds, and the sections of an aquatic band with swimming figures.<ref>Doyle and Houston 2012</ref> Similarly, a Classic palace frieze in [[Acanceh]] is divided into panels holding different animal figures<ref>V.E. Miller 1991</ref> reminiscent of [[wayob]], while a wall in [[Tonina]] has lozenge-shaped fields suggesting a scaffold and presenting continuous narrative scenes that relate to human sacrifice.<ref>see Yadeun 1993:108-115</ref>\n\nPlastered temple roof combs are similar to some of the friezes above in that they usually show large representations of rulers, who may again be seated on a symbolic mountain, and also, as on Palenque's Temple of the Sun, set within a cosmological framework. Further examples of Classic stucco modeling include the piers of the Palenque Palace, embellished with a series of lords and ladies in ritual dress, and the 'baroque', Late-Classic [[Chenes]]-style stucco entrance, beset with naturalistic human figures, on the Acropolis (Str. 1) of [[Ek' Balam]].\n\nUnique in Mesoamerica, Classic Period stucco modeling includes realistic portraiture of a quality equalling that of Roman ancestral portraits, with the lofty stucco heads of Palenque rulers and portraits of dignitaries from [[Tonina]] as outstanding examples. Some of these portrait heads were part of life-size stucco figures adorning temple crests.<ref>Martin and Grube 2000: 168</ref> The portrait modeling recalls that of certain Jaina ceramic statuettes.\n\n==Mural painting==\n[[Image:Bonampak painting.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|Bonampak mural, room 1, east wall: Musicians]]\n[[File:SBmural.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|San Bartolo mural: The king as Hunahpu]]\nAlthough, due to the humid climate of [[Central America]], relatively few Mayan paintings have survived to the present day integrally, important remnants have been found in nearly all major court residences. This is especially the case in substructures, hidden under later architectural additions. Mural paintings may show more or less repetitive motifs, such as the subtly varied flower symbols on walls of House E of the Palenque Palace; scenes of daily life, as in one of the buildings surrounding the central square of [[Calakmul]] and in a palace of Chilonche; or ritual scenes involving deities, as in the Post-Classic temple murals of Yucat\u00e1n's and Belize's east coast ([[Tancah]], [[Tulum]], Santa Rita).<ref>Miller 1982; Gann 1900</ref>\n\nThey may also evince a more narrative character, usually with hieroglyphic captions present. The colourful [[Bonampak]] murals, for example, dating from 790 AD, and extending over the walls and vaults of three adjacent rooms, show spectacular scenes of nobility, battle and sacrifice, as well as a group of ritual impersonators in the midst of a file of [[Maya music|musicians]].<ref>M.E. Miller 1986; M.E. Miller and Brittenham 2013</ref> At [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], murals dating from 100 BCE relate to the myths of the [[Maya maize god]] and the hero twin [[Hunahpu]], and depict a double inthronization; antedating the Classic Period by several centuries, the style is already fully developed, with colours being subtle and muted as compared to those of Bonampak or Calakmul.<ref>Saturno et al. 2005; Taube et al. 2010</ref> Outside the Mayan area, in a ward of East-Central Mexican [[Cacaxtla]], murals painted in a predominantly Classic Mayan style, with often stark colors, have been found, such as a savage battle scene extending over 20 meters; two figures of Mayan lords standing on serpents; and an irrigated maize and cacao field visited by [[God L|the Maya merchant deity]].<ref>Lozoff Brittenham and Uriarte 2015</ref>\n\nWall painting also occurs on vault capstones, in tombs (e.g., [[R\u00edo Azul]]), and in caves (e.g., [[Naj Tunich]]),<ref>Stone 1995</ref> usually executed in black on a whitened surface, at times with the additional use of red paint. Yucatec vault capstones often show a depiction of the enthroned [[god K|lightning deity]] (e.g., [[Ek' Balam]]).\n\nA bright turquoise blue colour - '[[Maya Blue]]' - has survived through the centuries due to its unique chemical characteristics; this color is present in [[Bonampak]], [[Cacaxtla]], Jaina, [[El Taj\u00edn]], and even in some Colonial Convents. The use of Maya Blue survived until the 16th century, when the technique was lost.<ref>Reyes-Valerio 1993; Houston et al. 2009</ref>\n\n==Writing and bookmaking==\n{{main|Maya script|Maya codices}}\n[[File:Mexico - Museo de antropologia - Livre maya.JPG|thumb|Madrid Codex]]\nThe Maya writing system consists of about 1000 distinct characters or hieroglyphs ('glyphs'), and like many ancient writing systems is a mixture of syllabic signs and [[logogram]]s. This script was in use from the 3rd century BCE until shortly after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. As of now (2019), a considerable proportion of the characters has a reading, but their meaning and configuration as a text is not always understood. The books were folded and consisted of bark paper or leather leaves with an adhesive stucco layer on which to write; they were protected by jaguar skin covers or, perhaps, wooden boards.<ref>Coe and Kerr 1997</ref> Since every diviner probably needed a book, there must have existed large numbers of them. \n\nToday, three [[Maya codices|Maya books]], all from the Post-Classic period, are still in existence: the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Paris Codex|Paris]], and [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid]] codices. A fourth book, the [[Grolier Codex|Grolier]], is Maya-[[Toltec]] rather than Maya; apart from calendar signs, it has no text. Fragmentary and of very poor workmanship, it shows many anomalies, reason for which its authenticity has long remained in  doubt.<ref>Love 2017</ref> These books are largely of a divinatory and priestly nature, containing almanacs, astrological tables, and ritual programs; the Paris Codex also includes [[Katun (Maya calendar)|katun]]-prophecies. Great attention was paid to a harmonious balance of texts and (partly coloured) illustrations.\n\nBesides the codical glyphs, there existed a cursive script of an often dynamic character, found in wall-paintings and on ceramics, and imitated in stone on panels from Palenque (such as the 'Tablet of the 96 glyphs'). Often, written captions are enclosed in square 'boxes' of various shapes within the representation. Wall paintings may also entirely consist of texts ([[Ek' Balam]], [[Naj Tunich]]), or, more rarely, contain astrological computations ([[Xultun]]); sometimes, written on a white stuccoed surface, and executed with particular care and elegance, these texts are like enlargements of book pages.\n \nHieroglyphs are ubiquitous and were written on every available surface, including the human body. The glyphs themselves are highly detailed, and particularly the [[logogram]]s are deceivingly realistic. As a matter of fact, from an art-historical point of view, they should also be viewed as art motifs, and ''vice versa''.<ref name=\"Stone and Zender 2011\"/> Sculptors at Copan and Quirigua have consequently felt free to convert hieroglyphic elements and calendrical signs into animated, dramatic miniature scenes ('full figure glyphs').\n\n==Ceramics and 'ceramic codex'==\n{{main|Maya ceramics}}\n[[File:Codex vase Collection Henry Law 154.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Codex style cylinder vessel, courtly ritual]]\n[[File:Maya Reicher Mann.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina, nobleman]]\nUnlike utility ceramics found in such large numbers among the debris of archaeological sites, most of the decorated pottery (cylinder vessels, lidded dishes, vases, bowls) once was '[[social currency]]' among the Maya nobility, and, preserved as heirlooms, also accompanied the nobles into their graves.<ref>Reents-Budet 1994: 72ff</ref> The aristocratic tradition of gift-giving feasts<ref>Tozzer 1941: 92</ref> and ceremonial visits, and the emulation that inevitably went with these exchanges, goes a long way towards explaining the high level of artistry reached in Classical times.\n\nMade without a potter's wheel, decorated pottery was delicately painted, carved into relief, incised, or - chiefly during the Early Classic period - made with the Teotihuacan [[fresco]] technique of applying paint to a wet clay surface. The precious objects were manufactured in numerous workshops distributed over the Mayan kingdoms, some of the most famous being associated with the [[Chama (Maya site)|'Chama-style']], the [[Holmul#Holmul-style|'Holmul-style']], the so-called [[Motul de San Jose#Ik style ceramics|'Ik-style']]<ref>Just 2012</ref> and, for carved pottery, the 'Chochola-style.'<ref>Tate 1985</ref>\n  \nVase decoration shows great variation, including palace scenes, courtly ritual, mythology, divinatory glyphs, and even dynastical texts taken from chronicles, and plays a major role in reconstructing Classical Maya life and beliefs. Ceramic scenes and texts painted in black and red on a white underground, the equivalents of pages from the lost folding books, are referred to as being in 'codex style' (e.g., the so-called [[Princeton Vase]]). The hieroglyphical and pictural overlap with the three extant books is (at least up to now) relatively small.\n\nSculptural ceramic art includes the lids of Early Classic bowls mounted by human or animal figures; some of these bowls, burnished black, are among the most distinguished Mayan works of art ever created. \n\nCeramic sculpture also includes [[censer|incense burners]] and burial urns. Best known are the profusely decorated Classic burners from the kingdom of Palenque, which have the modeled face of a deity or of a king attached to an elongated hollow tube. The deity most frequently depicted, the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar deity of terrestrial fire]], also adorns large Classic burial urns from the Guatemalan department of El Quich\u00e9.<ref>McCampbell 2010</ref> The elaborate Post-Classic, mold-made effigy incense burners especially associated with [[Mayapan]] represent standing deities (or priestly deity impersonators) often carrying offerings.<ref>Thompson 1957; Milbrath 2007</ref> \n\nFinally, figurines, often mold-made, and of an amazing liveliness and realism, constitute a minor but highly informative genre. Apart from deities, [[Maya religion#Animal persons|animal persons]], rulers and dwarfs, they show many other characters as well as scenes taken from daily life. Some of these figurines are ocarinas and may have been used in rituals. The most impressive examples stem from [[Jaina Island]].\n\n==Precious stone and other sculpted materials==\n[[File:Palenque - Pakal - Grabbeigabe.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Jade belt assemblage with celt pendants, from the tomb of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]\n[[File:Placa de jade, Nebaj, museu Nacional d'Arqueologia i Etnologia, Guatemala.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jade plaque from Nebaj]]\nIt is remarkable that the Maya, who had no metal tools, created many objects from a very thick and dense material, jade ([[jadeite]]), particularly all sorts of (royal) dress elements, such as [[Maya belt plaques|belt plaques]] - or celts - ear spools, pendants, and also masks. Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king [[Pakal]], covered with irregularly-shaped jade plaques and having eyes made from [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and obsidian; another death mask, belonging to a Palenque queen, consists of malachite plaques. Similarly, certain cylindrical vases from Tikal have an outer layer of square jade discs. Many stone carvings had jade inlays.\n\nAmong other sculpted and engraved materials are flint, shell, and bone, often found in caches and burials. The so-called '[[eccentric flint]]s' are ceremonial objects of uncertain use, in their most elaborate forms of elongated shape with usually various heads extending on one or both sides, sometimes those of the [[God K|lightning deity]], but more often of an anthropomorphic lightning probably representing the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured Maize God]].<ref>Agurcia, Sheets, Taube 2016</ref> Shell was worked into disks and other decorative elements showing human, possibly ancestral heads and deities; [[conch]] trumpets were similarly decorated.<ref>Finamore and Houston 2010: 124-131</ref> Human and animal bones were decorated with incised symbols and scenes. A collection of small and modified, tubular bones from an 8th-century royal burial under [[Tikal Temple I]] contains some of the most subtle engravings known from the Maya, including several scenes with the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured maize god]] in a canoe.<ref>Trik 1963</ref>\n\n==Applied arts and body decoration==\n{{see also|Maya textiles}}\nTextiles from the Classic period, made of cotton, have not survived, but Maya art provides detailed information about their appearance and, to a lesser extent, their social function.<ref>Looper 2000</ref> They include delicate fabrics used as wrappings, curtains and canopies furnishing palaces, and garments. Among the dyeing techniques may have been [[ikat]]. Daily costume depended on social standing. Noblewomen usually wore long dresses, noblemen girdles and breechcloths, leaving legs and upper body more or less bare, unless jackets or mantles were worn. Both men and women could wear turbans. Costumes worn on ceremonial occasions and during the many festivities were highly expressive and exuberant; animal headdresses were common. The most elaborate costume was the formal apparel of the king, as depicted on the royal stelae, with numerous elements of symbolic meaning.<ref>E.g., Dillon and Christensen 2005</ref>\n\nWickerwork, only known from incidental depictions in sculptural and ceramic art,<ref>Reents-Budet 1994: 331</ref> must once have been ubiquitous; the well-known ''pop'' ('mat') motif testifies to its importance.<ref>Robicsek 1975</ref>\n\nBody decorations often consisted of painted patterns on face and body, but could also be of a permanent character marking status and age differences. The latter type included artificial deformation of the skull, filing and incrustation of the teeth, and tattooing of the face.<ref>Houston et al. 2006: 18-25</ref>\n\n==Museum collections==\n[[File:Nationalmuseum f\u00fcr Arch\u00e4ologie und Ethnologie, Guatemala-20.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda y Etnolog\u00eda]], in [[Guatemala City]]]]\nThere are a great many museums across the world with Maya artifacts in their collections.

Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the Classic Period (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Mayan art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities.  Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.\n\n==Mayan art history==\nFollowing the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century publications on Maya art and archaeology by [[John Lloyd Stephens|Stephens]], [[Frederick Catherwood|Catherwood]], [[Alfred Maudslay|Maudslay]], [[Teoberto Maler|Maler]] and [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Charnay|Charnay]], that for the first time made available reliable drawings and photographs of major Classic Maya monuments. The 1913 publication of Herbert Spinden's 'A Study of Maya Art' ( now over a century ago ) laid the foundation for all later developments of Maya art history (including iconography).<ref>Spinden 1975</ref> The book gives an analytical treatment of themes and motifs, particularly the ubiquitous serpent and dragon motifs, and a review of the 'material arts', such as the composition of temple facades, roof combs and mask panels. Spinden's chronological treatment of Maya art was later (1950) refined by the motif analysis of the architect and specialist in archaeological drawing, [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], in her book 'A Study of Classic Maya Sculpture'.<ref>Proskouriakoff 1950</ref> [[George Kubler|Kubler's]] 1969 inventory of Maya iconography, containing a site-by-site treatment of 'commemorative' images and a topical treatment of ritual and mythical images (such as the 'triadic sign'), conclude a period of gradual increase of knowledge that was soon to be overshadowed by new developments.\n\nStarting in the early 1970s, the historiography of the Mayan kingdoms \u2013 first of all Palenque \u2013 came to occupy the forefront. Art-historical interpretation joined the historical approach pioneered by Proskouriakoff as well as the mythological approach initiated by [[Michael D. Coe|M.D. Coe]], with a professor of art, Linda Schele, serving as a driving force. Schele's seminal interpretations of Maya art are found throughout her work, especially in ''The Blood of Kings'', written together with art historian [[Mary Miller (art historian)|M. Miller]].<ref>Schele and Miller 1986</ref> Maya art history was also spurred by the enormous increase in sculptural and ceramic imagery, due to extensive archaeological excavations, as well as to organized looting on an unprecedented scale. On from 1973, M.D. Coe published a series of books offering pictures and interpretations of unknown Maya vases, with the Popol Vuh Twin myth for an explanatory model.<ref>Coe 1973, 1975, 1978, 1982</ref> In 1981, Robicsek and Hales added an inventory and classification of Maya vases painted in codex style,<ref>Robicsek and Hales 1981</ref> thereby revealing even more of a hitherto barely known spiritual world.\n\nAs to subsequent developments, important issues in Schele's iconographic work have been elaborated by [[Karl Taube]].<ref>E.g., Miller and Taube 1993; Taube et al. 2010</ref> New approaches to Maya art include studies of ancient Maya ceramic workshops,<ref>Reents-Budet 1994</ref> the representation of bodily experience and the senses in Maya art,<ref>Houston et al. 2005</ref> and of hieroglyphs considered as iconographic units.<ref name=\"Stone and Zender 2011\">Stone and Zender 2011</ref> Meanwhile, the number of monographs devoted to the monumental art of specific courts is growing.<ref>Tate 1992, Looper 2003, Simmons Clancy 2009, O'Neil 2012</ref> A good impression of recent Mexican and North American art historical scholarship can be gathered from the exhibition catalogue 'Courtly Art of the Ancient Maya' (2004).<ref>Miller and Martin 2004</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{main|Maya architecture}}\n\n[[File:Copan T11-2.jpg|thumb|Copan, 'Reviewing Stand' with simian musicians]] \n[[File:Labna-Palace-Vaulted-Passage.jpg|thumb|Labna, Palace, vaulted passage]]\n\nThe layout of the Maya towns and [[Maya city|cities]], and more particularly of the ceremonial centers where the royal families and courtiers resided, is characterized by the rhythm of immense horizontal stucco floors of plazas often located at various levels, connected by broad and often steep stairs, and surmounted by temple pyramids.<ref>Stierlin 1994</ref> Under successive reigns, the main buildings were enlarged by adding new layers of fill and stucco coating. Irrigation channels, reservoirs, and drains made up the hydraulic infrastructure. Outside the ceremonial center (especially in the southern area sometimes resembling an [[acropolis]]) were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines, surrounded by the wards of the commoners. Dam-like causeways ([[sacbe]]ob) spread from the 'ceremonial centers' to other nuclei of habitation. Fitting in with the concept of a '[[theatre state]]', more attention appears to have been given to aesthetics than to solidity of construction. Careful attention, however, was placed on directional orientation.\n\nAmong the various types of structures should be mentioned:\n*Ceremonial platforms (usually less than 4 meters in height).\n*Courtyards and palaces.\n*Other residential buildings, such as a writers' house <ref>Coe and Kerr 1997: 100-101</ref> and a possible council house in Copan.\n*Temples and temple pyramids, the latter often containing burials in their base or fill, with sanctuaries on top. The outstanding example are the many clustered dynastic burial temples of Tikal's [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]].   \n*[[Mesoamerican ball court|Ball courts]].\n \nAmong the structural ensembles are:\n*'[[Triadic pyramid]]s' consisting of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform;\n*'[[E-Group|E-groups]]' consisting of a square platform with a low four-stepped pyramid on the west side and an elongated structure, or, alternatively, three small structures, on the eastern side;\n*'[[Twin pyramid complex]]es', with identical four-stepped pyramids on the east and west sides of a small plaza; a building with nine doorways on the south side; and a small enclosure on the north side housing a sculpted stela with its altar and commemorating the king's performance of a [[k'atun]]-ending ceremony.\n\nIn the palaces and temple rooms, the '[[corbelled vault]]' was often applied. Though not an effective means to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a corbelled vault, to construct an inner sanctuary (e.g., that of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque).\n\nThe northern Maya area (Campeche and Yucat\u00e1n) shows characteristics of its own. Its Classic [[Puuc]], Chenes, and [[Rio Bec]] architecture<ref>Gendrop 1983</ref> is characterized by the geometrical reduction of realistic decoration; the stacking of rain god snouts to build facades; the use of portals shaped like serpent mouths; and, in the Rio Bec area, the use of solid pseudo temple-pyramids. The most important Puuc site is [[Uxmal]]. [[Chichen Itza]], dominating Yucat\u00e1n from the Late Classic to well into the Post-Classic, features Classic buildings in Chenes and Puuc style as well as Post-Classic building types of Mexican derivation, such as the radial four-staircase pyramid, the colonnaded hall, and the circular temple. The latter features were inherited by the succeeding kingdom of [[Mayapan]].\n\n==Stone sculpture==\n{{see also|Maya stelae}}\n[[File:Cancuenpanel3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Cancuen]], panel 3, seated king with two subordinates. Second half 8th century.]]\n[[File:Stela A Copan 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|180px|Copan stela A, Maudslay cast]] \nThe main Preclassic sculptural style from the Maya area is that of [[Izapa]], a large settlement on the Pacific coast where many stelas and (frog-shaped) altars were found showing motifs also present in [[Olmec]] art.<ref>Guernsey 2006</ref> The stelas, mostly without inscriptions, often show mythological and narrative subjects, some of which appear to relate to the Twin myth of the [[Popol Vuh]]. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain if the inhabitants of Izapa were ethnically Mayan. For the Classic Period of the Mayas, the following major classes of stone sculpture may be distinguished.\n\n*'''Stelas'''. These are large, elongated stone slabs usually covered with carvings and inscriptions, and often accompanied by round altars. Typical of the Classical period, most of them depict the rulers of the cities they were located in, often disguised as gods. Although the rulers' faces, particularly during the later Classic Period, are naturalistic in style, they usually do not show individual traits; but there are notable exceptions to this rule (e.g., [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], stela 35). The most famous stelas are from [[Copan]] and nearby [[Quirigua]]. These are outstanding for their intricateness of detail, those of Quirigua also for sheer height (stela E measuring over 7 metres above ground level and 3 below). Both the Copan and [[Tonina]] stelas approach sculptures in the round. From [[Palenque]], otherwise a true Maya capital of the arts, no significant stelae have been preserved.\n*'''[[lintel (architecture)|Lintels]]''', spanning doorways or jambs. Particularly [[Yaxchilan]] is renowned for its long series of lintels in deep relief, some of the most famous of which show meetings with [[Maya religion|ancestors]] or, perhaps, local deities.<ref>Tate 1992</ref>\n*'''Panels and tablets''', set in the walls and piers of buildings and the sides of platforms. Particularly [[Palenque]] is famous for the large tablets adorning the inner sanctuaries of the Cross Group temples, and for refined masterworks such as the 'Palace Tablet', the 'Tablet of the Slaves', and the multi-figure panels of the temple XIX and XXI platforms.<ref>Stuart and Stuart 2008</ref> King [[Pakal]]'s carved sarcophagus lid - without equal in other Maya kingdoms - might also be included here.\n*'''Altars''', rounded or rectangular, sometimes resting on three or four boulder-like legs. They may be wholly or partly figurative (e.g., Copan turtle altar) or have a relief image on top, sometimes consisting of a single ''[[Ajaw|Ahau]]'' day sign (Caracol, Tonina).<ref>Martin and Grube 2000: 89</ref>\n*'''Zoomorphs''', or large boulders sculpted to resemble living creatures and covered with highly complicated relief ornamentation. Zoomorphs seem to be restricted to the kingdom of [[Quirigua]] during the Late Classic period<ref>Looper 2003: 172-178, 186-192</ref> and may have functioned as altars.\n*'''Ball court markers''', or rounded relief carvings placed in the central axis of the floors of ball courts (such as those of Copan, [[Chinkultic]], Tonina), and usually showing royal ball game scenes. \n*'''Monumental stairs''', most famously the giant hieroglyphic stairway of Copan. The hewn stone blocks of hieroglyphic stairways together constitute an extensive text. Stairways can also be decorated with a great variety of scenes ([[La Corona]]), particularly the ball game. Sometimes, the ball game becomes the stairs' chief theme ([[Yaxchilan]]), with a captive depicted inside the ball, or, elsewhere ([[Tonina]]), a full-figure captive stretched out along the step.\n*'''Thrones''', with a broad, square seat, and a back sometimes iconically shaped like the wall of a cave, and worked open to show human figures. Examples from Palenque and Copan have supports showing cosmologic carriers ([[Bacab]]s, [[Chaak]]s).\n*'''Stone sculpture in the round''' is especially known from Copan and Tonin\u00e1. It is represented by statuary, such as a seated Copan scribe as well as captive figures and small stelas from Tonin\u00e1; by certain figurative architectural elements, such as the twenty maize deities from the fa\u00e7ade of Copan Temple 22;<ref>Schwerin 2011</ref> and by giant sculptures such as the symmetrically-positioned jaguars and simian musicians of Cop\u00e1n, that were integral parts of architectural design.\n\n==Wood carving==\n[[File:Mirror-Bearer MET DT1254.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Possible mirror bearer; 6th century; wood & red hematite; height: 35.9 cm (14{{fraction|1|8}} in.); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIt is believed that carvings in wood were once extremely common, but only a few examples have survived. Most 16th-century wood carvings, considered objects of idolatry, were destroyed by the Spanish colonial authorities. The most important Classic examples consist of intricately worked lintels, mostly from the main [[Tikal]] pyramid sanctuaries,<ref>W.R. Coe et al. 1961</ref> with one specimen from nearby [[El Zotz]]. The Tikal wood reliefs, each consisting of several beams, and dating to the 8th century, show a king on his seat with a protector figure looming large behind, in the form of a Teotihuacan-style 'war serpent' (Temple I lintel 2), a jaguar (Temple I lintel 3), or a human impersonator of the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar god of terrestrial fire]] (Temple IV lintel 2). Other Tikal lintels depict an obese king wearing a jaguar dress and standing in front of his seat (Temple III lintel 2); and most famously, a victorious king, dressed as an astral death god, and standing on a palanquin underneath an arching feathered serpent ([[Tikal Temple IV|Temple IV lintel 3]]). A rare utility object is a tiny lidded box from [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] with a hieroglyphic text all around it. Free sculpture in wood, dating back to the 6th century, is represented by a dignified seated man possibly functioning as a mirror bearer.\n\n==Stucco modeling==\n[[Image:PyramideDesMasquesKohunlich.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Stucco mask panels, Early Classic, Kohunlich]]\n[[Image:K'inich Janaab Pakal I v2.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Stucco portrait of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]\nAt least since Late Preclassic times, modeled and painted stucco plaster covered the floors and buildings of the town centers and provided the setting for their stone sculptures. Often, large mask panels with the plastered heads of deities in high relief (particularly those of sun, rain, and earth) are found attached to the sloping retaining walls of temple platforms flanking stairs (e.g., [[Kohunlich]]). Stucco modeling and relief work can also cover the entire building, as shown by Temple 16 of [[Copan]], in its 6th-century form (known as 'Rosalila'). Dedicated to the first king, [[Yax K'uk' Mo']], this early temple has preserved plastered and painted facades. The stuccoed friezes, walls, piers, and roof combs of the Late Preclassic and Classic periods show varying and sometimes symbolically complicated decorative programs.\n \nSeveral solutions for dividing up and ordering the stuccoed surfaces of buildings were applied, serialization being one of them. The Early Classic walls of the 'Temple of the [[Maya jaguar gods#The Jaguar God of Terrestrial Fire and War ('Night Sun')|Night Sun]]' in [[El Zotz]] consist of a series of subtly varied deity mask panels, whereas the frieze of a [[Balamku]] palace, also from the Early Classic, originally had a series of four rulers enthroned above the open ophidian mouths of four different animals (a toad among them) associated with symbolic mountains. Conversely, friezes may be centered on a single ruler again sitting on a symbolic (maize) mountain, such as a frieze from [[Holmul]], with two feathered serpents emanating from below the ruler's seat, and another one from [[Xultun]], on which the ruler carries a large ceremonial bar with emerging jaguar-like figures.<ref>newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php/Saturnoxultun</ref> An Early-Classic temple frieze from Placeres, Quintana Roo, has the large mask panel of a young lord or deity in the middle, with two lateral [[Mam (Maya mythology)|'Grandfather']] deities extending their arms.\n\nOften, a frieze is divided into compartments. Late Preclassic friezes of [[El Mirador]], for example, show the intervening spaces of an undulating serpent's body filled out with aquatic birds, and the sections of an aquatic band with swimming figures.<ref>Doyle and Houston 2012</ref> Similarly, a Classic palace frieze in [[Acanceh]] is divided into panels holding different animal figures<ref>V.E. Miller 1991</ref> reminiscent of [[wayob]], while a wall in [[Tonina]] has lozenge-shaped fields suggesting a scaffold and presenting continuous narrative scenes that relate to human sacrifice.<ref>see Yadeun 1993:108-115</ref>\n\nPlastered temple roof combs are similar to some of the friezes above in that they usually show large representations of rulers, who may again be seated on a symbolic mountain, and also, as on Palenque's Temple of the Sun, set within a cosmological framework. Further examples of Classic stucco modeling include the piers of the Palenque Palace, embellished with a series of lords and ladies in ritual dress, and the 'baroque', Late-Classic [[Chenes]]-style stucco entrance, beset with naturalistic human figures, on the Acropolis (Str. 1) of [[Ek' Balam]].\n\nUnique in Mesoamerica, Classic Period stucco modeling includes realistic portraiture of a quality equalling that of Roman ancestral portraits, with the lofty stucco heads of Palenque rulers and portraits of dignitaries from [[Tonina]] as outstanding examples. Some of these portrait heads were part of life-size stucco figures adorning temple crests.<ref>Martin and Grube 2000: 168</ref> The portrait modeling recalls that of certain Jaina ceramic statuettes.\n\n==Mural painting==\n[[Image:Bonampak painting.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|Bonampak mural, room 1, east wall: Musicians]]\n[[File:SBmural.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|San Bartolo mural: The king as Hunahpu]]\nAlthough, due to the humid climate of [[Central America]], relatively few Mayan paintings have survived to the present day integrally, important remnants have been found in nearly all major court residences. This is especially the case in substructures, hidden under later architectural additions. Mural paintings may show more or less repetitive motifs, such as the subtly varied flower symbols on walls of House E of the Palenque Palace; scenes of daily life, as in one of the buildings surrounding the central square of [[Calakmul]] and in a palace of Chilonche; or ritual scenes involving deities, as in the Post-Classic temple murals of Yucat\u00e1n's and Belize's east coast ([[Tancah]], [[Tulum]], Santa Rita).<ref>Miller 1982; Gann 1900</ref>\n\nThey may also evince a more narrative character, usually with hieroglyphic captions present. The colourful [[Bonampak]] murals, for example, dating from 790 AD, and extending over the walls and vaults of three adjacent rooms, show spectacular scenes of nobility, battle and sacrifice, as well as a group of ritual impersonators in the midst of a file of [[Maya music|musicians]].<ref>M.E. Miller 1986; M.E. Miller and Brittenham 2013</ref> At [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], murals dating from 100 BCE relate to the myths of the [[Maya maize god]] and the hero twin [[Hunahpu]], and depict a double inthronization; antedating the Classic Period by several centuries, the style is already fully developed, with colours being subtle and muted as compared to those of Bonampak or Calakmul.<ref>Saturno et al. 2005; Taube et al. 2010</ref> Outside the Mayan area, in a ward of East-Central Mexican [[Cacaxtla]], murals painted in a predominantly Classic Mayan style, with often stark colors, have been found, such as a savage battle scene extending over 20 meters; two figures of Mayan lords standing on serpents; and an irrigated maize and cacao field visited by [[God L|the Maya merchant deity]].<ref>Lozoff Brittenham and Uriarte 2015</ref>\n\nWall painting also occurs on vault capstones, in tombs (e.g., [[R\u00edo Azul]]), and in caves (e.g., [[Naj Tunich]]),<ref>Stone 1995</ref> usually executed in black on a whitened surface, at times with the additional use of red paint. Yucatec vault capstones often show a depiction of the enthroned [[god K|lightning deity]] (e.g., [[Ek' Balam]]).\n\nA bright turquoise blue colour - '[[Maya Blue]]' - has survived through the centuries due to its unique chemical characteristics; this color is present in [[Bonampak]], [[Cacaxtla]], Jaina, [[El Taj\u00edn]], and even in some Colonial Convents. The use of Maya Blue survived until the 16th century, when the technique was lost.<ref>Reyes-Valerio 1993; Houston et al. 2009</ref>\n\n==Writing and bookmaking==\n{{main|Maya script|Maya codices}}\n[[File:Mexico - Museo de antropologia - Livre maya.JPG|thumb|Madrid Codex]]\nThe Maya writing system consists of about 1000 distinct characters or hieroglyphs ('glyphs'), and like many ancient writing systems is a mixture of syllabic signs and [[logogram]]s. This script was in use from the 3rd century BCE until shortly after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. As of now (2019), a considerable proportion of the characters has a reading, but their meaning and configuration as a text is not always understood. The books were folded and consisted of bark paper or leather leaves with an adhesive stucco layer on which to write; they were protected by jaguar skin covers or, perhaps, wooden boards.<ref>Coe and Kerr 1997</ref> Since every diviner probably needed a book, there must have existed large numbers of them. \n\nToday, three [[Maya codices|Maya books]], all from the Post-Classic period, are still in existence: the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Paris Codex|Paris]], and [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid]] codices. A fourth book, the [[Grolier Codex|Grolier]], is Maya-[[Toltec]] rather than Maya; apart from calendar signs, it has no text. Fragmentary and of very poor workmanship, it shows many anomalies, reason for which its authenticity has long remained in  doubt.<ref>Love 2017</ref> These books are largely of a divinatory and priestly nature, containing almanacs, astrological tables, and ritual programs; the Paris Codex also includes [[Katun (Maya calendar)|katun]]-prophecies. Great attention was paid to a harmonious balance of texts and (partly coloured) illustrations.\n\nBesides the codical glyphs, there existed a cursive script of an often dynamic character, found in wall-paintings and on ceramics, and imitated in stone on panels from Palenque (such as the 'Tablet of the 96 glyphs'). Often, written captions are enclosed in square 'boxes' of various shapes within the representation. Wall paintings may also entirely consist of texts ([[Ek' Balam]], [[Naj Tunich]]), or, more rarely, contain astrological computations ([[Xultun]]); sometimes, written on a white stuccoed surface, and executed with particular care and elegance, these texts are like enlargements of book pages.\n \nHieroglyphs are ubiquitous and were written on every available surface, including the human body. The glyphs themselves are highly detailed, and particularly the [[logogram]]s are deceivingly realistic. As a matter of fact, from an art-historical point of view, they should also be viewed as art motifs, and ''vice versa''.<ref name=\"Stone and Zender 2011\"/> Sculptors at Copan and Quirigua have consequently felt free to convert hieroglyphic elements and calendrical signs into animated, dramatic miniature scenes ('full figure glyphs').\n\n==Ceramics and 'ceramic codex'==\n{{main|Maya ceramics}}\n[[File:Codex vase Collection Henry Law 154.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Codex style cylinder vessel, courtly ritual]]\n[[File:Maya Reicher Mann.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina, nobleman]]\nUnlike utility ceramics found in such large numbers among the debris of archaeological sites, most of the decorated pottery (cylinder vessels, lidded dishes, vases, bowls) once was '[[social currency]]' among the Maya nobility, and, preserved as heirlooms, also accompanied the nobles into their graves.<ref>Reents-Budet 1994: 72ff</ref> The aristocratic tradition of gift-giving feasts<ref>Tozzer 1941: 92</ref> and ceremonial visits, and the emulation that inevitably went with these exchanges, goes a long way towards explaining the high level of artistry reached in Classical times.\n\nMade without a potter's wheel, decorated pottery was delicately painted, carved into relief, incised, or - chiefly during the Early Classic period - made with the Teotihuacan [[fresco]] technique of applying paint to a wet clay surface. The precious objects were manufactured in numerous workshops distributed over the Mayan kingdoms, some of the most famous being associated with the [[Chama (Maya site)|'Chama-style']], the [[Holmul#Holmul-style|'Holmul-style']], the so-called [[Motul de San Jose#Ik style ceramics|'Ik-style']]<ref>Just 2012</ref> and, for carved pottery, the 'Chochola-style.'<ref>Tate 1985</ref>\n  \nVase decoration shows great variation, including palace scenes, courtly ritual, mythology, divinatory glyphs, and even dynastical texts taken from chronicles, and plays a major role in reconstructing Classical Maya life and beliefs. Ceramic scenes and texts painted in black and red on a white underground, the equivalents of pages from the lost folding books, are referred to as being in 'codex style' (e.g., the so-called [[Princeton Vase]]). The hieroglyphical and pictural overlap with the three extant books is (at least up to now) relatively small.\n\nSculptural ceramic art includes the lids of Early Classic bowls mounted by human or animal figures; some of these bowls, burnished black, are among the most distinguished Mayan works of art ever created. \n\nCeramic sculpture also includes [[censer|incense burners]] and burial urns. Best known are the profusely decorated Classic burners from the kingdom of Palenque, which have the modeled face of a deity or of a king attached to an elongated hollow tube. The deity most frequently depicted, the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar deity of terrestrial fire]], also adorns large Classic burial urns from the Guatemalan department of El Quich\u00e9.<ref>McCampbell 2010</ref> The elaborate Post-Classic, mold-made effigy incense burners especially associated with [[Mayapan]] represent standing deities (or priestly deity impersonators) often carrying offerings.<ref>Thompson 1957; Milbrath 2007</ref> \n\nFinally, figurines, often mold-made, and of an amazing liveliness and realism, constitute a minor but highly informative genre. Apart from deities, [[Maya religion#Animal persons|animal persons]], rulers and dwarfs, they show many other characters as well as scenes taken from daily life. Some of these figurines are ocarinas and may have been used in rituals. The most impressive examples stem from [[Jaina Island]].\n\n==Precious stone and other sculpted materials==\n[[File:Palenque - Pakal - Grabbeigabe.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Jade belt assemblage with celt pendants, from the tomb of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]\n[[File:Placa de jade, Nebaj, museu Nacional d'Arqueologia i Etnologia, Guatemala.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jade plaque from Nebaj]]\nIt is remarkable that the Maya, who had no metal tools, created many objects from a very thick and dense material, jade ([[jadeite]]), particularly all sorts of (royal) dress elements, such as [[Maya belt plaques|belt plaques]] - or celts - ear spools, pendants, and also masks. Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king [[Pakal]], covered with irregularly-shaped jade plaques and having eyes made from [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and obsidian; another death mask, belonging to a Palenque queen, consists of malachite plaques. Similarly, certain cylindrical vases from Tikal have an outer layer of square jade discs. Many stone carvings had jade inlays.\n\nAmong other sculpted and engraved materials are flint, shell, and bone, often found in caches and burials. The so-called '[[eccentric flint]]s' are ceremonial objects of uncertain use, in their most elaborate forms of elongated shape with usually various heads extending on one or both sides, sometimes those of the [[God K|lightning deity]], but more often of an anthropomorphic lightning probably representing the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured Maize God]].<ref>Agurcia, Sheets, Taube 2016</ref> Shell was worked into disks and other decorative elements showing human, possibly ancestral heads and deities; [[conch]] trumpets were similarly decorated.<ref>Finamore and Houston 2010: 124-131</ref> Human and animal bones were decorated with incised symbols and scenes. A collection of small and modified, tubular bones from an 8th-century royal burial under [[Tikal Temple I]] contains some of the most subtle engravings known from the Maya, including several scenes with the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured maize god]] in a canoe.<ref>Trik 1963</ref>\n\n==Applied arts and body decoration==\n{{see also|Maya textiles}}\nTextiles from the Classic period, made of cotton, have not survived, but Maya art provides detailed information about their appearance and, to a lesser extent, their social function.<ref>Looper 2000</ref> They include delicate fabrics used as wrappings, curtains and canopies furnishing palaces, and garments. Among the dyeing techniques may have been [[ikat]]. Daily costume depended on social standing. Noblewomen usually wore long dresses, noblemen girdles and breechcloths, leaving legs and upper body more or less bare, unless jackets or mantles were worn. Both men and women could wear turbans. Costumes worn on ceremonial occasions and during the many festivities were highly expressive and exuberant; animal headdresses were common. The most elaborate costume was the formal apparel of the king, as depicted on the royal stelae, with numerous elements of symbolic meaning.<ref>E.g., Dillon and Christensen 2005</ref>\n\nWickerwork, only known from incidental depictions in sculptural and ceramic art,<ref>Reents-Budet 1994: 331</ref> must once have been ubiquitous; the well-known ''pop'' ('mat') motif testifies to its importance.<ref>Robicsek 1975</ref>\n\nBody decorations often consisted of painted patterns on face and body, but could also be of a permanent character marking status and age differences. The latter type included artificial deformation of the skull, filing and incrustation of the teeth, and tattooing of the face.<ref>Houston et al. 2006: 18-25</ref>\n\n==Museum collections==\n[[File:Nationalmuseum f\u00fcr Arch\u00e4ologie und Ethnologie, Guatemala-20.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda y Etnolog\u00eda]], in [[Guatemala City]]]]\nThere are a great many museums across the world with Maya artifacts in their collections.

From left to right (top to bottom): A Regular Air Force officer number, an Army Air Forces Reserve officer number, a Regular Army (Air Corps) officer number, and a Regular Army enlisted number.]]\n\n'''United States Air Force service numbers''' were created in the spring of 1948, approximately six months after the Air Force's creation as separate branch of the armed forces.<ref>[[Department of the Air Force]], TRF ORDER 1, 26 September 1947</ref>\n\n==Air Force officer service numbers==\nThe first regulation of Air Force service numbers applied to numbers held by Air Force officers. In 1947, thousands of officers had automatically transferred from the Army Air Forces into the Air Force, with over a third of this number inactive members of the Officer Reserve Corps. The first Air Force officer service numbers ranged from 1 to 19,999 and were reserved for Regular Air Force officers who had \"crossed over\" to the United States Air Force.\n\nThe first USAF regular officer service number went to the most senior general officer on active duty when the transition to USAF service numbers began.  1A was Joseph T. McNarney; 2A George C. Kenney, 3A John K. Cannon, 4A Hoyt S. Vandenberg, 5A George E Stratemeyer,  10A Nathan Twining, 26A Curtis Lemay.  \n\nAfter the initial issuance of the first Air Force officer service numbers, the service numbers were increased with the second range extending from 20 000 to 99 999. These numbers were set aside for past, present, and future Regular Air Force officers with this range being used from 1948 until the discontinuation of Air Force service numbers in 1969.\n\nFor a brief time in the 1950s until 1965, [[cadet]]s at the [[United States Air Force Academy]] were assigned a special range of service numbers only for use while attending the Academy. These numbers ranged from 1 to approximately 7000 based on admission date to the Academy. These numbers were followed by the suffix \"K\" and were not part of the regular Air Force service number system.\n\nThe service numbers 100 000 to 1 799 999 were never used by the Air Force office corps to avoid repeating numbers already assigned to Army officers; the only Air Force officers who ever held these numbers were those who had received their commissions under the authority of the Army Air Forces. The next range of Air Force officer service numbers began at 1 800 000 and extended to 1 999 999; these numbers were assigned to former reserve officers of the Army Air Forces who were now members of the Air Force Reserve. The two million number range was never issued by the Air Force, to avoid repeating service numbers of the Army, with the next range beginning at 3 000 000 and extending to 3 999 999. These numbers were intended for all officers considered \"Other Than Regular Air Force\" (OTRAF) and were issued in chronological order by date of commission after 1948. Such numbers were normally preceded with a zero.\n\nIn 1969, when the Air Force discontinued service numbers, the officer cap of 3 999 999 had not yet been reached. Thus, there were never any higher Air Force officer service numbers created. After 1969, the Air Force converted to [[Social Security number]]s for service member identification.\n\n==Air Force enlisted service numbers==\nAir Force enlisted service numbers were designed along Army lines with the very first Air Force personnel issued Army numbers between September 1947 and early 1948. By the spring of 1948, the Air Force has established its permanent enlisted service number system with the design mirroring Army numbers almost exactly. It was also a fundamental principle that no airman would be issued a duplicate service number or a service number already held by someone in the Army.\n\nThe very first Air Force service numbers were seen as \"crossover\" numbers from personnel who had been members of the Army Air Forces; the Air Force also used the Army's 8 000 000 to 8 999 999 service number series for female enlisted personnel. The nine million service numbers were never used by the Air Force with Regular Air Force enlisted personnel beginning with service numbers in the ten million range. This numbers extended from 10 000 000 to 10 999 999 and, like the Army, were used for Regular Air Force personnel who had enlisted from recruiting stations outside the United States.\n\nThe service number range of 11 000 000 to 19 000 000 was used by Regular Air Force in the same manner as the Army, in that these numbers were reserved for Regular Air Force personnel, who had enlisted from inside the United States, with the first two numbers a geographical code and the last six a personal identifier. The geographical codes for the Air Force were the same as the Army and recruiting stations had instructions to avoid repeat service numbers and to ensure that no service number was issued by both the Army and the Air Force.\n\nThe service numbers of 20 000 000 to 29 999 999 were used by the [[Air National Guard]] with the thirty and forty million service numbers never issued by the Air Force. Even so, many veteran Air Force personnel who had served in World War II carried these numbers over with them upon augmentation to the Air Force. Therefore, there were numerous cases of Air Force enlisted members holding 30 and 40 million service numbers.\n\nThe service numbers 50 000 000 to 59 999 999 were used by Air Force draftees between 1948 and 1966. These numbers were issued in the same manner as the Army using the same geographical codes for the first two numbers. As with other service numbers used by both the Army and the Air Force, procedures were in place to avoid repeat or duplicate numbers.\n\nThe last range of Air Force service numbers was the 60 million series extending from 60 000 000 to 69 999 999. These numbers were used from 1966 to 1969. Air Force enlisted service numbers were formally discontinued on July 1, 1969, and replaced with Social Security numbers.\n\n[[File:AirForceSNumbers.JPG|thumb|center|550px|Final distribution of Air Force officer and enlisted service numbers]]\n\n==Air Force prefix and suffix codes==\nUpon the creation of Air Force service numbers, the Air Force had no prefix codes for special situations but did create a series of suffix one letter codes to be used solely be officers. The original suffix letter codes were:\n\n'''A''': Used from 1948 to 1965 by male Regular Air Force officers\n\n'''E''': Used until 1965 by male Regular Air Force warrant officers\n\n'''H''': Used until 1965 by female Regular Air Force warrant officers\n\n'''K''': Used by cadets at the Air Force Academy\n\n'''W''': Used from 1948 to 1965 by female Regular Air Force officers\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Air Force created several prefix codes intended to replace the suffix letters, although both prefixes and suffixes were still being used simultaneously in military service records. The 1950s prefix codes were as follows:\n\n'''AA''': Used by female personnel of the [[Women in the Air Force (WAF)|WAF]]\n\n'''AD''': Used by Aviation Cadets\n\n'''AF''': Used by male enlisted personnel\n\n'''AO''': Used by Air Force reserve officers\n\n'''AR''': Use by Air Force dieticians\n\n'''AW''': Used by Air Force warrant officers\n\nIn 1965, the Air Force standardized the prefix codes and created this final version.\n\n'''FG''': Used by officers, warrant officers and enlisted personnel of the Air National Guard\n\n'''FR''': Used by officers, warrant officers and enlisted personnel of the Regular Air Force\n\n'''FT''': Used by officers and warrant officers who had yet to be assigned an Air Force component\n\n'''FV''': Used by officers, warrant officers and enlisted personnel of the Air Force Reserve\n\nOlder prefix and suffix codes continued to survive until the formal disestablishment of Air Force service numbers in 1969. In addition, the prefix \"FR\" was frequently switched between a prefix and suffix. After the establishment of social security numbers as the primary means of personnel identification, many Regular Air Force personnel would annotate the prefix \"FR\" before their Social Security number; a practice which continues to this day.\n\n== Geographical Codes and Service Number distribution==\nState Geographical Codes were used as the first two numbers of an Air Force enlisted service number to indicate where an airman had either enlisted from or had been drafted. For instance, the service number \"12 345 678\" would have a geographical code of 12 and a personal identification number of 345,678. The Air Force used geographical codes for Regular Air Force personnel and personnel who were issued service numbers in the 50 million range. The Air Force did not actively assign any 30 million draft numbers (these were held only by Air Force personnel who had \"crossed over\" from the Army Air Forces) and the sixty million range was issued without regards to geographical regions. In all, a comparison of the state codes is as follows:\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|align=\"center\"| '''State'''\n|align=\"center\"| '''Regular Air Force Codes'''\n|align=\"center\"| '''Air Force Draft Codes'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Alabama]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Alaska]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 50 2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Arizona]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Arkansas]]\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 54\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[California]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Colorado]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Connecticut]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Delaware]]\n|align=\"center\"| 12\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Florida]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Hawaii]]\n|align=\"center\"| 10 1\n|align=\"center\"| 50 0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Illinois]]\n|align=\"center\"| 16\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Idaho]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Indiana]]\n|align=\"center\"| 15\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Iowa]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Kansas]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Kentucky]]\n|align=\"center\"| 15\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Louisiana]]\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 54\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Maine]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Maryland]]\n|align=\"center\"| 13\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Massachusetts]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Michigan]]\n|align=\"center\"| 16\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Minnesota]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Mississippi]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Missouri]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Montana]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Nebraska]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Nevada]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[New Hampshire]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[New Jersey]]\n|align=\"center\"| 12\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[New Mexico]]\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 54\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|align=\"center\"| 12\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[North Carolina]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[North Dakota]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Ohio]]\n|align=\"center\"| 15\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Oklahoma]]\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 54\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Oregon]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Pennsylvania]]\n|align=\"center\"| 13\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Rhode Island]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[South Carolina]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[South Dakota]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Tennessee]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Texas]]\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 54\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Utah]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Vermont]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Virginia]]\n|align=\"center\"| 13\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[West Virginia]]\n|align=\"center\"| 15\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Wisconsin]]\n|align=\"center\"| 16\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Wyoming]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|}\n\nWithin the Regular Air Force, the range of 11 000 000 to 19 999 999 was reserved for Regular Air Force personnel who had enlisted from within the United States; With the first two numbers a geographical code and the last six a personal identifier. This gave geographical recruiting areas 999,999 service numbers a piece to allocate to new recruits. Air Force regulations directed against repeating service numbers and allocated only a certain block of numbers for certain time periods of enlistments. Instructions were also in place that Air Force service members should not be assigned numbers already held by Regular Army soldiers. This resulted in the first 200,000 personal identifier numbers of each geographical code remaining un-issued, since these numbers had already been exhausted by assignments to Regular Army personnel.\nThe breakdown of Regular Air Force service number assignments, from 1947 to the discontinuation of service numbers in 1969, was as follows:\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|align=\"center\"| '''Geographical Code'''\n|align=\"center\"| '''Allocated Numbers<br/>(1947\u20131948)'''\n|align=\"center\"| '''Allocated Numbers<br/>(1949\u20131960)'''\n|align=\"center\"| '''Allocated Numbers<br/>(1961\u20131969)'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 11 \n|align=\"center\"| 142 501 - 188 000\n|align=\"center\"| 188 001 - 384 000\n|align=\"center\"| 384 000 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 12 \n|align=\"center\"| 242 001 - 321 000\n|align=\"center\"| 321 001 - 614 900\n|align=\"center\"| 614 901 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 13\n|align=\"center\"| 197 501 - 299 700\n|align=\"center\"| 299 701 - 705 500\n|align=\"center\"| 705 501 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 204 501 - 300 770\n|align=\"center\"| 300 771 - 745 000\n|align=\"center\"| 745 001 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 15\n|align=\"center\"| 201 001 - 280 500\n|align=\"center\"| 280 501 - 639 615\n|align=\"center\"| 639 616 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 16\n|align=\"center\"| 201 501 - 307 000\n|align=\"center\"| 307 001 - 683 100\n|align=\"center\"| 683 101 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 183 501 - 254 500\n|align=\"center\"| 254 501 - 592 940\n|align=\"center\"| 592 941 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 247 101 - 546 000\n|align=\"center\"| 546 001 - 607 725\n|align=\"center\"| 607 726 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 235 501 - 420 000\n|align=\"center\"| 420 001 - 597 661\n|align=\"center\"| 597 662 - 999 999\n|-\n|}\n\n==Notable service numbers==\nSignificant United States Air Force service numbers include:<ref>[[National Personnel Records Center]], Military Operations Branch, \"Service number index and registry of retired, deceased, and discharged military personnel\" (2007)</ref>\n* 4A: [[Hoyt Vandenberg]]\n* 26A: [[Curtis Lemay]]\n* FR1206: [[Benjamin O.

In 1947, thousands of officers had automatically transferred from the Army Air Forces into the Air Force, with over a third of this number inactive members of the Officer Reserve Corps. The first Air Force officer service numbers ranged from 1 to 19,999 and were reserved for Regular Air Force officers who had \"crossed over\" to the United States Air Force.\n\nA complication to early service number issuance was that some senior Air Force officers (such as [[Henry H. Arnold]]) choose to simply retain their Army service numbers and did not apply for a new Air Force service number. Thus, the earliest Air Force officer service number was #4 which was assigned to [[Hoyt Vandenberg]]; numbers one through three were apparently never issued.\n\nAfter the initial issuance of the first Air Force officer service numbers, the service numbers were increased with the second range extending from 20 000 to 99 999. These numbers were set aside for past, present, and future Regular Air Force officers with this range being used from 1948 until the discontinuation of Air Force service numbers in 1969.\n\nFor a brief time in the 1950s until 1965, [[cadet]]s at the [[United States Air Force Academy]] were assigned a special range of service numbers only for use while attending the Academy.

Even so, many veteran Air Force personnel who had served in World War II carried these numbers over with them upon augmentation to the Air Force. Therefore, there were numerous cases of Air Force enlisted members holding 30 and 40 million service numbers.\n\nThe service numbers 50 000 000 to 59 999 999 were used by Air Force draftees between 1948 and 1966.

These numbers were used from 1966 to 1969. Air Force enlisted service numbers were formally discontinued on July 1, 1969, and replaced with Social Security numbers.\n\n[[File:AirForceSNumbers.JPG|thumb|center|550px|Final distribution of Air Force officer and enlisted service numbers]]\n\n==Air Force prefix and suffix codes==\nUpon the creation of Air Force service numbers, the Air Force had no prefix codes for special situations but did create a series of suffix one letter codes to be used solely be officers. The original suffix letter codes were:\n\n'''A''': Used from 1948 to 1965 by male Regular Air Force officers\n\n'''E''': Used until 1965 by male Regular Air Force warrant officers\n\n'''H''': Used until 1965 by female Regular Air Force warrant officers\n\n'''K''': Used by cadets at the Air Force Academy\n\n'''W''': Used from 1948 to 1965 by female Regular Air Force officers\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the Air Force created several prefix codes intended to replace the suffix letters, although both prefixes and suffixes were still being used simultaneously in military service records. The 1950s prefix codes were as follows:\n\n'''AA''': Used by female personnel of the [[Women in the Air Force (WAF)|WAF]]\n\n'''AD''': Used by Aviation Cadets\n\n'''AF''': Used by male enlisted personnel\n\n'''AO''': Used by Air Force reserve officers\n\n'''AR''': Use by Air Force dieticians\n\n'''AW''': Used by Air Force warrant officers\n\nIn 1965, the Air Force standardized the prefix codes and created this final version.\n\n'''FG''': Used by officers, warrant officers and enlisted personnel of the Air National Guard\n\n'''FR''': Used by officers, warrant officers and enlisted personnel of the Regular Air Force\n\n'''FT''': Used by officers and warrant officers who had yet to be assigned an Air Force component\n\n'''FV''': Used by officers, warrant officers and enlisted personnel of the Air Force Reserve\n\nOlder prefix and suffix codes continued to survive until the formal disestablishment of Air Force service numbers in 1969. In addition, the prefix \"FR\" was frequently switched between a prefix and suffix. After the establishment of social security numbers as the primary means of personnel identification, many Regular Air Force personnel would annotate the prefix \"FR\" before their Social Security number; a practice which continues to this day.\n\n== Geographical Codes and Service Number distribution==\nState Geographical Codes were used as the first two numbers of an Air Force enlisted service number to indicate where an airman had either enlisted from or had been drafted. For instance, the service number \"12 345 678\" would have a geographical code of 12 and a personal identification number of 345,678. The Air Force used geographical codes for Regular Air Force personnel and personnel who were issued service numbers in the 50 million range. The Air Force did not actively assign any 30 million draft numbers (these were held only by Air Force personnel who had \"crossed over\" from the Army Air Forces) and the sixty million range was issued without regards to geographical regions. In all, a comparison of the state codes is as follows:\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|align=\"center\"| '''State'''\n|align=\"center\"| '''Regular Air Force Codes'''\n|align=\"center\"| '''Air Force Draft Codes'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Alabama]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Alaska]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 50 2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Arizona]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Arkansas]]\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 54\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[California]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Colorado]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Connecticut]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Delaware]]\n|align=\"center\"| 12\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Florida]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Hawaii]]\n|align=\"center\"| 10 1\n|align=\"center\"| 50 0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Illinois]]\n|align=\"center\"| 16\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Idaho]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Indiana]]\n|align=\"center\"| 15\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Iowa]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Kansas]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Kentucky]]\n|align=\"center\"| 15\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Louisiana]]\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 54\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Maine]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Maryland]]\n|align=\"center\"| 13\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Massachusetts]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Michigan]]\n|align=\"center\"| 16\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Minnesota]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Mississippi]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Missouri]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Montana]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Nebraska]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Nevada]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[New Hampshire]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[New Jersey]]\n|align=\"center\"| 12\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[New Mexico]]\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 54\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[New York (state)|New York]]\n|align=\"center\"| 12\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[North Carolina]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[North Dakota]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Ohio]]\n|align=\"center\"| 15\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Oklahoma]]\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 54\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Oregon]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Pennsylvania]]\n|align=\"center\"| 13\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Rhode Island]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[South Carolina]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[South Dakota]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Tennessee]]\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 53\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Texas]]\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 54\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Utah]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Vermont]]\n|align=\"center\"| 11\n|align=\"center\"| 51\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Virginia]]\n|align=\"center\"| 13\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 56\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[West Virginia]]\n|align=\"center\"| 15\n|align=\"center\"| 52\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Wisconsin]]\n|align=\"center\"| 16\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| [[Wyoming]]\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 55\n|-\n|}\n\nWithin the Regular Air Force, the range of 11 000 000 to 19 999 999 was reserved for Regular Air Force personnel who had enlisted from within the United States; With the first two numbers a geographical code and the last six a personal identifier. This gave geographical recruiting areas 999,999 service numbers a piece to allocate to new recruits. Air Force regulations directed against repeating service numbers and allocated only a certain block of numbers for certain time periods of enlistments. Instructions were also in place that Air Force service members should not be assigned numbers already held by Regular Army soldiers. This resulted in the first 200,000 personal identifier numbers of each geographical code remaining un-issued, since these numbers had already been exhausted by assignments to Regular Army personnel.\nThe breakdown of Regular Air Force service number assignments, from 1947 to the discontinuation of service numbers in 1969, was as follows:\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|align=\"center\"| '''Geographical Code'''\n|align=\"center\"| '''Allocated Numbers<br/>(1947\u20131948)'''\n|align=\"center\"| '''Allocated Numbers<br/>(1949\u20131960)'''\n|align=\"center\"| '''Allocated Numbers<br/>(1961\u20131969)'''\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 11 \n|align=\"center\"| 142 501 - 188 000\n|align=\"center\"| 188 001 - 384 000\n|align=\"center\"| 384 000 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 12 \n|align=\"center\"| 242 001 - 321 000\n|align=\"center\"| 321 001 - 614 900\n|align=\"center\"| 614 901 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 13\n|align=\"center\"| 197 501 - 299 700\n|align=\"center\"| 299 701 - 705 500\n|align=\"center\"| 705 501 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 14\n|align=\"center\"| 204 501 - 300 770\n|align=\"center\"| 300 771 - 745 000\n|align=\"center\"| 745 001 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 15\n|align=\"center\"| 201 001 - 280 500\n|align=\"center\"| 280 501 - 639 615\n|align=\"center\"| 639 616 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 16\n|align=\"center\"| 201 501 - 307 000\n|align=\"center\"| 307 001 - 683 100\n|align=\"center\"| 683 101 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 17\n|align=\"center\"| 183 501 - 254 500\n|align=\"center\"| 254 501 - 592 940\n|align=\"center\"| 592 941 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 18\n|align=\"center\"| 247 101 - 546 000\n|align=\"center\"| 546 001 - 607 725\n|align=\"center\"| 607 726 - 999 999\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| 19\n|align=\"center\"| 235 501 - 420 000\n|align=\"center\"| 420 001 - 597 661\n|align=\"center\"| 597 662 - 999 999\n|-\n|}\n\n==Notable service numbers==\nSignificant United States Air Force service numbers include:<ref>[[National Personnel Records Center]], Military Operations Branch, \"Service number index and registry of retired, deceased, and discharged military personnel\" (2007)</ref>\n* 4A: [[Hoyt Vandenberg]]\n* 26A: [[Curtis Lemay]]\n* FR1206: [[Benjamin O.

To fulfill this requirement, the course was initially designed to emphasize the mission essential tasks drawn from lessons learned from previous long-range reconnaissance patrol operations in the jungles of [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name=\"History\"/>  In 2002, the course was renamed the '''Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leader Course''' (RSLC) <ref name=\"History\"/> and was taught by the 4th Ranger Training Battalion prior to unit reorganization at the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning.<ref name=\"RSLC Exec Sum\">[https://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/rtb/content/PDF/Executive%20Brief.pdf Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course, Executive Summary], 4th Ranger Training Battalion, last accessed 28 November 2017</ref>  In 2019, the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|US Army Training and Doctrine Command]] decided to move RSLC back under the control of the 4th Ranger Training Battalion.<ref name=\"Facebook\"/>\n\n==Training==\n[[File:US Army RSLC-1.jpg|thumb|295px|An instructor walks students through a properly sub-surface hide-site during \"Phase one\" of RSLC's first overseas MTT course in [[Lithuania]], circa 2016]]\n\nThe RSLC is designed to provide instruction to students through resident instruction at Fort Benning, Georgia. Located on Camp Cornett at Fort Benning's Harmony Church cantonment area, the RSLC PoI is tailored to train and test the fundamentals of reconnaissance operations for Soldiers and leaders assigned to reconnaissance teams and squads.  Therefore, priority for training is to team leaders and above (pay grades of E-4s and above) assigned oversight of small unit reconnaissance operations without prior reconnaissance training and experience.  In addition to resident course instruction, the RSLC PoI provides opportunities to deliver menu-based training through Mobile Training Teams (MTT) at a requesting unit's home station location.  Menu-based training enables unit commanders to meet specific reconnaissance focused training priorities without sacrificing other training needs in support of a unit's operational mission requirements.  While resident course instruction has priority over menu-based MTT instruction, the RSLC cadre will work to meet every unit's training needs.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase one===\nDuring the first week, students execute a seven-hour land navigation course in which they move under load, cross-country, during daylight and limited visibility, covering approximately 15 kilometers. They receive an introduction to the fundamentals of reconnaissance and surveillance and are taught how to maximize the capabilities of the equipment in the Army\u2019s inventory such as optics, thermals, and cameras. Students learn how to camouflage themselves and equipment, stalking, and selection, occupation, and concealment of surveillance sites. The first week ends with an airborne operation that can accommodate both static line and Military Free-Fall qualified Paratroopers.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase two===\n[[File:US Army RSLC-radio training.jpg|thumb|295px|Students practice configuring their radios prior to communications exam during \"Phase two\" of RSLC]]\n[[File:US Army RSLC-Urban Hideside.jpg|thumb|295px|A student uses an optical [[rangefinder]] to observe an urban environment during \"Phase two\" of RSLC]]\n\nWeek two begins with a two-day communications class that teaches students how to send messages and data across the frequency spectrum, utilizing [[High Frequency]] (HF), [[Very High Frequency]] (VHF), and [[Ultra High Frequency]] (UHF) radios.  This skill enables students to send reports and pictures to their maneuver commander in near real time.  Building on the training from the previous week, students conduct area and zone reconnaissance practical exercises to hone their field craft and improve their reporting formats.  Students are also introduced to insertion and extraction techniques by conducting [[Fast-roping|Fast Rope Insertion/Extraction System]] (FRIES) and [[Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction|Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction System]] (SPIES) training.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase three===\nThe final two weeks are spent with students learning how to plan an operation using the Troop Leading Procedures (TLPs) and incorporating air movement, fires, and evasion and recovery planning.  Following the orders process, students conduct a 48-hour non-graded Situational Training Exercise (STX) where they will execute the mission they just planned under the watchful eye of RSLC instructors, allowing the students to ask questions and receive assistance along the way.  Once this mission is complete and After-Action Reviews (AARs) are conducted, the students go into isolation planning for their graded culminating [[Field training exercise|Field Training Exercise]] (FTX).  Throughout the FTX, students will execute and be graded on all the skills they learned from planning, reconnaissance and surveillance operations, intelligence reporting techniques, communications, fires, evasion and recovery, and small unit tactics to name a few.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\nThe end result is a graduate with the skill to plan and conduct a myriad of reconnaissance and surveillance operations, enhancing the ability of any brigade combat team.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>  Upon successful completion of the RSLC course, U.S. Army graduates are awarded the Six Bravo (6B) additional skill identifier.<ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"RSLC Exec Sum\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerial reconnaissance]]\n* [[Battlefield surveillance brigades in the United States Army]]\n* [[Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron]]\n* [[Reconnaissance vehicle]]\n* [[Reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (United States)]]\n* [[United States Army Armor School#Army Reconnaissance Course|U.S. Army Reconnaissance Course]]\n* [[United States Army Sniper School|U.S. Army Sniper Course]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{TRADOC}}\n\n[[Category:United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=U.S. Army Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course (RSLC)\n|image=US Army RSLC-Equipment Layout.jpg\n|image_size=300px\n|caption=An instructor goes over the equipment packing list for surface and sub-surface surveillance with students\n|dates=1986\u2014present\n|country={{flag|United States of America}}\n|allegiance= \n|branch={{army|United States}}\n|type=[[Military education and training|Military training]]\n|role=Special skills training\n|size= \n|command_structure=[[File:US Army Infantry School DUI.png|10px]] Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade, [[United States Army Infantry School|U.S. Army Infantry School]]\n|garrison=[[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\n|garrison_label= \n|nickname= \n|patron= \n|motto= \"In Orbe Terrum Non Visi\"\n|colors= \n|colors_label= \n|march= \n|mascot= \n|equipment= \n|equipment_label= \n|battles= \n|anniversaries= \n|decorations= \n|battle_honours=\n|identification_symbol=[[File:US Army Airborne and Ranger Training Bde Flash.svg|100px|center]]\n|identification_symbol_label=[[United States military beret flash|Beret flash]] of the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade and its 4th, 5th, and 6th Ranger Training Battalions\n|identification_symbol_2=[[File:Abn Infantry School Abn Elements.png|120px|center]]\n|identification_symbol_2_label=[[Shoulder sleeve insignia]] of the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade\n}}\n\n'''United States Army Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course''' (RSLC) (formerly known as the Long Range Surveillance Leaders Course, or LRSLC<ref name=\"History\">[http://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/rtb/content/PDF/History.pdf Course History, Long Range Surveillance Leaders Course], benning.army.mil, last accessed 28 November 2017</ref>) is a 29-day (four weeks and one day) school designed on mastering reconnaissance fundamentals of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[non-commissioned officer]]s eligible for assignments to those units whose primary mission is to conduct reconnaissance and surveillance, target acquisition, and combat assessment operations.

To fulfill this requirement, the course was initially designed to emphasize the mission essential tasks drawn from lessons learned from previous long-range reconnaissance patrol operations in the jungles of [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name=\"History\"/>  In 2002, the course was renamed the '''Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leader Course''' (RSLC) <ref name=\"History\"/> and was taught by the 4th Ranger Training Battalion prior to unit reorganization at the Maneuver Center of Excellence at Fort Benning.<ref name=\"RSLC Exec Sum\">[https://www.benning.army.mil/infantry/rtb/content/PDF/Executive%20Brief.pdf Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course, Executive Summary], 4th Ranger Training Battalion, last accessed 28 November 2017</ref>  In 2019, the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|US Army Training and Doctrine Command]] decided to move RSLC back under the control of the 4th Ranger Training Battalion.<ref name=\"Facebook\"/>\n\n==Training==\n[[File:US Army RSLC-1.jpg|thumb|295px|An instructor walks students through a properly constructed hide-site during \"Phase one\" of RSLC's first overseas MTT course in [[Lithuania]], circa 2016]]\n\nThe RSLC is designed to provide instruction to students through resident instruction at Fort Benning, Georgia. Located on Camp Cornett at Fort Benning's Harmony Church cantonment area, the RSLC PoI is tailored to train and test the fundamentals of reconnaissance operations for Soldiers and leaders assigned to reconnaissance teams and squads.  Therefore, priority for training is to team leaders and above (pay grades of E-4s and above) assigned oversight of small unit reconnaissance operations without prior reconnaissance training and experience.  In addition to resident course instruction, the RSLC PoI provides opportunities to deliver menu-based training through Mobile Training Teams (MTT) at a requesting unit's home station location.  Menu-based training enables unit commanders to meet specific reconnaissance focused training priorities without sacrificing other training needs in support of a unit's operational mission requirements.  While resident course instruction has priority over menu-based MTT instruction, the RSLC cadre will work to meet every unit's training needs.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase one===\nDuring the first week, students execute a seven-hour land navigation course in which they move under load, cross-country, during daylight and limited visibility, covering approximately 15 kilometers. They receive an introduction to the fundamentals of reconnaissance and surveillance and are taught how to maximize the capabilities of the equipment in the Army\u2019s inventory such as optics, thermals, and cameras. Students learn how to camouflage themselves and equipment, stalking, and selection, occupation, and concealment of surveillance sites. The first week ends with an airborne operation that can accommodate both static line and Military Free-Fall qualified Paratroopers.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase two===\n[[File:US Army RSLC-radio training.jpg|thumb|295px|Students practice configuring their radios prior to communications exam during \"Phase two\" of RSLC]]\n[[File:US Army RSLC-Urban Hideside.jpg|thumb|295px|A student uses an optical [[rangefinder]] to observe an urban environment during \"Phase two\" of RSLC]]\n\nWeek two begins with a two-day communications class that teaches students how to send messages and data across the frequency spectrum, utilizing [[High Frequency]] (HF), [[Very High Frequency]] (VHF), and [[Ultra High Frequency]] (UHF) radios.  This skill enables students to send reports and pictures to their maneuver commander in near real time.  Building on the training from the previous week, students conduct area and zone reconnaissance practical exercises to hone their field craft and improve their reporting formats.  Students are also introduced to insertion and extraction techniques by conducting [[Fast-roping|Fast Rope Insertion/Extraction System]] (FRIES) and [[Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction|Special Patrol Insertion/Extraction System]] (SPIES) training.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\n===Phase three===\nThe final two weeks are spent with students learning how to plan an operation using the Troop Leading Procedures (TLPs) and incorporating air movement, fires, and evasion and recovery planning.  Following the orders process, students conduct a 48-hour non-graded Situational Training Exercise (STX) where they will execute the mission they just planned under the watchful eye of RSLC instructors, allowing the students to ask questions and receive assistance along the way.  Once this mission is complete and After-Action Reviews (AARs) are conducted, the students go into isolation planning for their graded culminating [[Field training exercise|Field Training Exercise]] (FTX).  Throughout the FTX, students will execute and be graded on all the skills they learned from planning, reconnaissance and surveillance operations, intelligence reporting techniques, communications, fires, evasion and recovery, and small unit tactics to name a few.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>\n\nThe end result is a graduate with the skill to plan and conduct a myriad of reconnaissance and surveillance operations, enhancing the ability of any brigade combat team.<ref name=\"Official Site\"/>  Upon successful completion of the RSLC course, U.S. Army graduates are awarded the Six Bravo (6B) additional skill identifier.<ref name=\"History\"/><ref name=\"RSLC Exec Sum\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerial reconnaissance]]\n* [[Battlefield surveillance brigades in the United States Army]]\n* [[Reconnaissance & Surveillance Squadron]]\n* [[Reconnaissance vehicle]]\n* [[Reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition (United States)]]\n* [[United States Army Armor School#Army Reconnaissance Course|U.S. Army Reconnaissance Course]]\n* [[United States Army Sniper School|U.S. Army Sniper Course]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{TRADOC}}\n\n[[Category:United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course]]\n", "name_user": "McChizzle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTraining:Continuing previous", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Reconnaissance_and_Surveillance_Leaders_Course"}

''ZooKeys 570'': 1-703.</ref>\n\n== Diet ==\n''Hogna lenta'' eats mostly small insects, such as crickets, waxworms, and mealworms. If individuals cannot find any of these, they will eat beetles and other smaller insects. When they are newly emerged from an egg sac, they eat small fruit flies, and each other.\nThe species is a ground spider, making burrows in the dirt. They lay web tripwires on top of their burrow. When something walks over the web, the spider feels it. They slowly uncover themselves, stalking their prey, before finally pouncing on them. They have a [[neurotoxin]] that they inject into the insect through their fangs. It paralyzes the insect immediately while the spider drinks the [[hemolymph]] from the insect.\n\n== Natural defenses ==\n''Hogna lenta'' is naturally equipped with a venom powerful enough to paralyze a small insect. This venom should pose no threat to a healthy adult human, only feeling like a bee sting. They generally raise their front legs in the air when threatened, to look bigger. If this does not work, they will lunge right in front of their attacker to startle them. Their last defense, is of course, biting the attacker. Due to their sheer size, most animals would not try to attack them. Their diameter is about the same as a 50-cent coin.\n\n== Habitat ==\nThey primarily live in dense shrubbery and [[forests]]. They make small but intricate burrows, infusing the soil with webs. Despite some people's beliefs, they very rarely stray into people's houses. They will, however, wander into camping tents, seeing all the mosquitos there. They have been spotted in Florida and many other southern states.\n\n== Lifestyle ==\nShortly after mating (maybe 1\u20132 weeks), the female constructs a large white egg sac bigger than its abdomen containing many eggs. They  carry the egg sac on the [[spinneret]]s on their abdomen. Spiderlings grow slowly inside the eggs for 5\u20138 weeks, before finally hatching. When emerged from an egg sac, they are hardly visible, about the size of a small LED light. They stay on the mother's abdomen for about 1\u20134 weeks. When ready, they climb off and run off into the wild. When small, they are extremely agile, making them hard to catch. Many of the young spiders die off within a few days of leaving the mother's back. If they live a few weeks, they molt. This is a process of shedding their old skin. Spiders molt their old skin, as their new skin is malleable. They grow while the new skin is soft, than repeat the process. Young spiders can molt up to 3 times a month.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* Bradley, Richard A. (2012). ''Common Spiders of North America''.
