As Kings of [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]], they are historically the most prominent family of the [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]], along with the [[O'Donnell dynasty|\u00d3 D\u00f3naill]], [[O'Doherty family|\u00d3 Dochartaigh]] and the [[Donnelly (surname)|\u00d3 Donnghaile]] dynasties (the head of the \u00d3 Donnghaile lineage being the hereditary Marshal of the O'Neill forces). The \u00d3 N\u00e9ills hold that their ancestors were [[Kings of Ailech]] during the Early Middle Ages, as descendants of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]].\n\nTwo of their progenitors [[High Kings of Ireland]], [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]] (from whom they take their name) and [[Domnall ua N\u00e9ill]]. From 1185 until 1616, the \u00d3 N\u00e9ills were sovereign [[Kings of T\u00edr E\u00f3gain]], holding territories in the north of Ireland; particularly around modern [[County Tyrone]], [[County Londonderry]] (Derry) and [[County Antrim]]. After their realm was merged with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the land was caught up in the [[Plantation of Ulster]], they were involved in a number of significant events, such as [[Tyrone's Rebellion]], the [[Flight of the Earls]], the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and the [[Irish Confederate Wars]].\n\n==Naming conventions==\n{{Main|Irish personal naming system}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n! width=20%  | Male\n! width=20% | Daughter ''<small>(Long)</small>''\n! width=20% | Daughter ''<small>(Short)</small>''\n! width=20%  | Wife ''<small>(Long)</small>''\n! width=20%  | Wife ''<small>(Short)</small>''\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| \u00d3 N\u00e9ill<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sloinne.ie/surname/ga/o-neill/|publisher=Sloinne|title=\u00d3 N\u00e9ill|date=5 December 2015}}</ref>\n| align=\"center\"| In\u00edon U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\n| align=\"center\"| N\u00ed N\u00e9ill\n| align=\"center\"| Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\n| align=\"center\"| U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\n|-\n|}\n\n==Origins==\nThe \u00d3 N\u00e9ill lineage claims descent from [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]], a 10th-century king of [[Ailech]] as well as [[High King of Ireland]]. Niall descended from the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain branch of the [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]. The first to adopt the patronymic surname was Niall Gl\u00fandub's great-grandson, [[Flaithbertach Ua N\u00e9ill]].\n\nThe lineage does not receive a mention in non-Irish recorded history sources<ref>Annals of Ireland</ref> between the 1080s and 1160s, from which they emerge from a \"very murky background\".<ref name=\"Cosgrove\"/> In 1167, King of Ireland [[Ruaidri Ua Concobhair]] marched north and divided the kingdom of Ailech into two.<ref name=\"Cosgrove\"/> The portion north of [[Slieve Gallion]], was given to [[Niall Mac Lochlainn]] (McLaughlin), with the portion south of Slieve Gallion, given to [[\u00c1ed in Mac\u00e1em T\u00f3inlesc|\u00c1ed Ua N\u00e9ill]].<ref name=\"Cosgrove\"/> After this the two rival dynasties contested for control over T\u00edr Eoghain until the battle of Caimeirge in 1241, where the \u00d3 N\u00e9ills wiped out the Mhic Lochlainn leadership.<ref name=\"Cosgrove\"/>\n\n==O'Neills of Tyrone==\nAfter 1241, the \u00d3 N\u00e9ill lineage dominated and displaced other lineage, using the disruption of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169 to their benefit and were able to consolidate. The [[Bruce campaign in Ireland|Bruce Invasion of Ireland]] devastated the Norman [[Earldom of Ulster]], which held sway over eastern Ulster and most of its north coast all the way to [[Derry]]. Its collapse in 1333 allowed a branch of the \u00d3 N\u00e9ill that had been on good terms with the Normans, Clann Aodh Buidhe, to step into the power vacuum and take control over large parts of eastern Ulster.\n\nThe dominant [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and [[Norman-Irish]] leaders were in tune with their contemporary peers of the [[Middle Ages]] in terms of education, international trade, and diplomacy. The \u00d3 N\u00e9ills had strong family relationships with the [[FitzGerald dynasty]], both the [[Earls of Kildare]] and [[Earls of Desmond]]; the [[Earl of Pembroke]] via de Clare's marriage to the Irish house of Diarmuid, [[King of Leinster]]; and the [[Clan Donald|MacDonnells]], [[Bissett family (Ireland)|Bissetts]], [[Clan Maclean|MacLean]]s, and [[Clan Campbell|Campbell]]s.\n\nIn 1171, King [[Henry II of England]] came to Ireland to remove the authority of the English lords in Ireland. He met the leading Irish kings and received the pledge of fealty from them. During the Middle Ages, the \u00d3 N\u00e9ills were active politically and militarily throughout Ireland, occasionally sending nobility to fight within Ireland and in campaigns in Europe. From 1312 to 1318, their kings were staunch supporters of King [[Robert the Bruce]] and his brother Edward Bruce. They sent troops and supported Edward in his attempt to become King of Ireland in 1315. In 1394 [[Richard II of England]] deemed King Niall Mor \"Le Grand O'Neill\" upon a friendly hosting of the two kings. In the 14th century [[Edward III of England]] called Tyrone \"the Great O'Neill\" and invited him to join a campaign against the Scots, and another O'Neill prince accompanied the English king on a crusade to the [[Holy Land]]. In 1493, [[Henry VII of England]] referred to Henry O'Neill, King of Tyrone, as \"the Chief of the Irish Kings\" and gave him a gift of livery.<ref>{{cite book |title=Medieval Ireland, an Encyclopedia |editor=Sean Duffy}}</ref>\n\nThe O'Neills' independent stature within Ulster began to change with the ascent of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in England in 1509. Soon after he took the English throne, Henry decided to grasp Ireland via a reputed Papal Bull that claimed to grant the lordship of Ireland to English kings. This was spurred by the 1537 Rising of [[Silken Thomas]] Fitzgerald. The O'Neills supported their [[FitzGerald dynasty]] cousins in that rebellion and had to maneuver politically to keep the English from toppling their power in Ulster when the rising failed. Henry began a policy to reduce the kings in Ireland to the same rank and structure as the English nobility. In the policy called [[Surrender and regrant]] Irish monarchs were forced to surrender their titles and independent lands to Henry, and in return he created them Earls of the Kingdom of Ireland and \"granted\" them their own lands back. The last King of Tyrone and first [[Earl of Tyrone#Earls of Tyrone, first Creation (1542)|original earldom]] was one such grant by Henry VIII in 1542 to [[Conn Bacach O'Neill]], on the creation of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. Conn wanted to be named the Earl of Ulster, but Henry refused that royal honor out of spite for Conn's previous warfare against his crown.  The earldom of Tyrone was eventually granted in 1542.<ref>British Museum, Harl. Ms. 5885 (N.L.I. Dublin POS no. 1426) and British Museum, Harl. Ms. 6096 (N.L.I. Dublin POS no. 1427)and Sidney, H., Sir Henry Sidney's Memoir of his government of Ireland 1583, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, First series, Vol. III, 1855, p. 46. Footnote no. 6.\n</ref>  The submission of Conn O'Neill led to a 50-year civil war within Ulster that eventually led to downfall of O'Neill power in 1607 with the departure of the third earl for Rome and exile.\n\n[[Shane O'Neill (Irish chieftain)|Shane O'Neill]], known as {{lang|ga|Se\u00e1n an D\u00edomais}} or Shane the Proud (1530\u20131567), the eldest surviving, legitimate son of Conn Bacach O'Neill, was styled Prince of Tyrone, Prince of Ulster, and Dux Hibernicorum (Prince of Ireland) by his European peers.  He did not share the moderate relationship with the English that his father had cultivated. He was almost always at war with the Lord Lieutenant in Dublin.  An act of the English Parliament in 1562 gave Shane O'Neill the English title of Lord O'Neill until his claim for his father's estate was settled. The writ for Shane to be named the second Earl of Tyrone was written, but held up on Dublin. Shane rebelled and was killed before he could be invested and in 1569, the retrospective attainder of Shane O'Neill banned the use of the title of The O'Neill M\u00f3r.\n\nThe title The O'Neill M\u00f3r was not a [[patrilineal]] hereditary one, but was conferred on the man elected and inaugurated to rule T\u00edr Eoghain. The title did not have to be from a Tyrone sept, as at least two Clannaboy chiefs also served as The O'Neill M\u00f3r. However, there are a few families that may, and some do, claim the rights of O'Neill of Tyrone. These claimants are made up of descendants of the last King and sons of the first Earl (Conn): Shane, Ferdocha (Mathew), and [[Phelim Caoch O'Neill|Phelim Caoch]]. These claimants include O'Neill of Corab, O'Neill of Waterford, [[McShane (name)|McShane]]-Johnson O'Neills of Killetragh, and O'Neill of [[Dundalk]], as well as the primogeniture of the Marqu\u00e9s de Larra\u00edn who still use the titular title of Prince of Tyrone. All descend from one of the last chiefs of the O'Neills of Tyrone.\n\nUpon the death of Shane, his tanist and cousin, [[Turlough Luineach O'Neill]] became the paramount Ulster chief.  Turlough was the son of Conn Bacach's uncle, and was the fourth son of Niall Connallach macArt \u00f3g O'Neill, Tanist of Tyrone (1519\u20131544).  Turlough assumed the position of The O'Neill Mor and held it through a great deal of fighting until 1595 when he died.  During his Chiefship, Turlough initially battled the sons of his predecessor Shane, who were called the MacShanes, but soon after established a peace with the brothers, granting them the eastern third of his lands (Glenconkeyn and parts of Tir Eoghan along the western side of Lough Neagh) in return for their military loyalty. MacShanes Conn and his brother Shane both served as Turlough's tanists at different times.  At the same time, Turlough battled the up-and-coming Baron of Dungannon, Hugh Rua O'Neill who was placed in Ulster as a counterweight to Turlough's power by the English.  Hugh Rua eventually succeeded to the title of Earl of Tyrone and upon Turlough's death, became The O'Neill Mor himself.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of warfare with the English forces in Ireland, [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone]], surrendered in 1603, just days after the death of his enemy Queen Elizabeth.  Hugh stayed in Ulster as the Earl for another five years.  But after numerous threats to his life, he secretly departed Ireland for the French coast in 1607 in what is famously called the [[Flight of the Earls]].  Hugh continued to use his title after he fled to the Continent in the Flight of the Earls, although in the law of the Kingdom of Ireland it was forfeit by act of the Irish Parliament a year later. So did his son [[Shane O'Neill (Irish exile)|Shane O'Neill]], whose Will left his title to his only, if illegitimate, son Hugo Eugenio O'Neill; when he died in 1641 at the head of his regiment in Spain.  Other Spanish exiled descendants of Hugh Rua continued to use the title and command the Ulster Irish Regiment in the Spanish Army through the seventeenth century.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Micheline Kearney Walsh |title=The Last Earls of Tyrone in Spain |journal=Seanchas Ardmhacha: Journal of the Armagh Diocesan Historical Society |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1988 |pages=33\u201358}} The last mention of a Conde de Tyrone is in 1691, and Walsh concludes that he died not long thereafter.</ref>\n\nThe barony of Dungannon was created in 1542 as the title designated for the declared heir of the Earldom.  Ferdocha or [[Matthew O'Neill, 1st Baron Dungannon|Mathew O'Neill]], natural son of Conn Bacach the 1st Earl, was the first to hold the title of [[Baron Dungannon]]. The line that descended from Mathew kept the Baron of Dungannon as one of its junior titles at least through the death of Don Eugenio O'Neill, Conde de Tiron in 1695.  There were other titles laid out in the will of Don Juan (John/Shane/Sean) O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone in 1660. They include: Viscount of Tyrone, Viscount of Montoy, Baron of Strabane, and Lord of the Clannaboy. There is a later account of the O'Neills acquiring the comital title of Clanawley.  Although the title of Baron of Dungannon would traditionally still be preserved with the title of Count/Earl of Tyrone, it is not presently used by anyone in the extended O'Neill family.\n\nAnother of the more famous O'Neills of Tyrone was Eoghan Rua \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, anglicized as [[Owen Roe O'Neill]] (c. 1590\u20131649), a brilliant 17th-century military commander and one of the most famous of the O'Neill family of Ulster. He was the son of Art O'Neill, a younger brother of [[Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone]]. As a young man, he left Ireland in the Flight of the Earls to escape the English conquest of his native Ulster. He grew up in the Spanish Netherlands and spent 40 years serving in the Irish regiment of the Spanish Army, mainly in the [[Eighty Years' War]] against the [[Dutch Republic]] in Flanders, notably at the siege of [[Arras]], where he commanded the Spanish garrison. O'Neill was, like many [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Irish officers in the Spanish service, hostile to the English Protestant invasion of Ireland. He returned to Ireland during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] to command the Catholic Army for during the [[Irish Confederate Wars]]. He was reportedly poisoned by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] supporters and died in 1649.\n\n== Slight-Arte O'Neills ==\n\nThis is another branch of the Tyrone O'Neills which started in the mid 15th century.  The name translates to \"of the sept of Art\". Eoghan M\u00f3r O'Neill (Owen the Great), King of T\u00edr Eoghan (Tyrone) from 1432 to 1456 had four sons who each started independent lines. His eldest, Henry, was King of Tyrone from 1455 to 1489 and was the grandfather of Conn Bacach. Aodh, his second son started the line of the Fews. Art, his third son, was King of Tyrone 1509\u20131514. This branch of the family held its lands in western Tyrone and was typically at a distance from those O'Neills centered on the traditional capitol of [[Dungannon]]. Art was unable to elevate his son to the kingship, but his grandson was Sir [[Turlough Luineach \u00d3 Neill]], The O'Neill Mor 1567\u20131593, the Earl of ClanConnell, and de jure King of Tyrone for a rocky period during the 1570s.  On his deathbed he passed his chiefship to his cousin [[Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone|Hugh M\u00f3r O'Neill]], the Earl of Tyrone.  That family, after Sir Turlough's death, remained hostile to the Earl and often sided with the English when in conflict with the rest of the Tyrone O'Neills.\n\n==O'Neills of Clanaboy==\n[[File:O'Neill of Clanaboy.png|thumb|200px|O'Neill of Clanaboy.]]\nAodh Buidhe, son of Domhnall \u00d3c \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, grandson of [[Aodh M\u00e9ith|Aodh Meith O'Neill]] (Hugh the Fat), and great-grandson of [[\u00c1ed in Mac\u00e1em T\u00f3inlesc]], all kings of Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, was the eponymous ancestor of the \u00d3 N\u00e9ill Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, or Clanaboy O'Neill, line. He had come to an arrangement with the Norman Earls of Ulster which allowed his sons, particularly Briain, to consolidate \u00d3 N\u00e9ill power within The North at the expense of the [[O'Donnell]]s. Aodh Buidhe was married Eleanor de Nangle, a kinswoman to his nominal enemy, [[Walter de Burgh]], the [[Earl of Ulster]] and [[Jocelyn de Angulo]]; Aodh died in 1283. The lineage he established remained senior among the \u00d3 N\u00e9ill's, becoming semi-independent with a distinct territory. Having helped the Anglo-Normans barons in a rebellion against their fellow Norman lord, the Earl of Ulster, the family was granted land outside the North, in Ulster within what is now south [[County Antrim]]. That was the official establishment of the Lordship of Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, or the O'Neills of [[Clandeboye]], though the English retained lordship over the much-reduced Earldom of Ulster.\n\nThe family fought on both sides of the wars that racked Ireland from the 1530s to 1690s, whose end result was a significant loss of territory and influence due to political alliances and an influx of new families flowing in from Scotland and England.\n\nThe issue of Sir Henry \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, who had been \"granted\" the Edendubhcarrig estate and majority of the Cloinne Aodha Buidhe lands by conforming to English ways and converting to Anglicanism, died out in 1855. At this time, the barrister Charles Henry \u00d3 N\u00e9ill of the \u00d3 N\u00e9ills of the Feeva, descendant of the last T\u00e1naiste of Clanaboy, Sir Henry's uncle Con Mac Brian \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, became officially recognized as The \u00d3 N\u00e9ill Clanaboy. \"The descendants of Prince Con MacBryan O'Neill, Tanist of Clanaboy, remained loyal, under every vicissitude, to the traditions of their house, and saved little out of the general wreck of confiscation. They seemed to have preferred fulfilling the solemn pledge of their ancestor, Donald O'Neill, King of Ulster, to 'fight out as long as life should last' rather than adapt themselves to altered circumstances, as the descendants of Shane MacBryan had wisely done,\" according to Burke's Peerage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burke |first=Sir John Bernard |title=A selection of arms authorized by the laws of heraldry |url=https://archive.org/details/aselectionarmsa00burkgoog |date=1860 |publisher=Harrison}}</ref> In fact both Sir Henry and his daughter Rose willed the Shane's Castle estate to the descendants of Prince Con mac Brian. While Charles Henry assumed the title, the Clanaboy \u00d3 N\u00e9ill estate was passed to William Chichester through his grandmother Mary \u00d3 N\u00e9ill \u2013 a move highly disputed. Charles Henry \u00d3 N\u00e9ill had his first and only child, a daughter named Elizabeth Catherine Theresa Mary \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, in 1845, during the Great Hunger, and had no further issue. From the death of Charles Henry \u00d3 N\u00e9ill until Jorge O'Neill assumed the chieftainship the family had no chief.\n\n==O'Neill Descendants in France, Spain, and Portugal==\nIn the beginning of the 18th century [[F\u00e9ilim \u00d3 N\u00e9ill]] (in English Felix O'Neill), senior male in linear descent of the line of Brian Ballach \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, Niall M\u00f3r \u00d3 N\u00e9ill's second eldest son, was dispossessed of all his estate through the confiscation applied via the Penal Laws, which led him to emigrate to France. He was a cavalry officer who took part in many battles with the heroic [[Irish Brigade (French)|Irish Brigade]] of the French Army. He fought with the French against the British, the Austrians, and the Dutch (during the War of the Spanish Succession), in the celebrated Battle of Malplaquet, where he died on 11 September 1709.[1][2]\n\nHis son [[Conn (Constantine) O'Neill]] was an officer who spent his life in exile in France and married to Cecilia O'Hanlon. Their eldest son, [[Jo\u00e3o O'Neill]] (Shane O'Neill), was born in Richhill Village in the parish of Kilmore, Tyrone, and died in Santos o Velho, Lisbon, on 21 January 1788.  He left France with his brothers and established their noble line permanently under in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. He was the titular head of the Clanaboy O'Neill dynasty, whose family have been in Portugal ever since. The current head of the Clanaboy O'Neill dynasty, a descendant of Jo\u00e3o, is Portuguese nobleman [[Hugo Ricciardi O'Neill]], the son of [[Jorge Maria O'Neill]]; the family has been remarkable in the modern history of [[Portugal]].\n\nIn 1896 Jorge O'Neill of Portugal submitted his genealogy to the Somerset Herald in London. Five years later, Sir Henry Farnham Burke, KCVO, CB, FSA, Somerset Herald stated in 1900 that \"the only Pedigree at present on record in either of the Offices of Arms showing a lineal male descent from the House of O'Neill, Monarchs of Ireland, Kings of Ulster, and Princes of Tyrone and Claneboy, is the one registered in the fifty-ninth year of the Reign of Our Sovereign Lady Victoria, in favor of His Excellency Jorge O'Neill of Lisbon\". He then recognized him as the Representative of the House of O'Neill and as the Representative of the Earldom created in 1542 for his kinsman Conn Baccagh O'Neill. All of this was granted under Letters Patent issued by the English College of Heralds. Later, the Ulster and Norroy King of Arms granted him the undifferenced arms as the head of the House of O'Neill. Upon that Letters Patent, Pope Leo XIII, the King of Spain, and the King of Portugal all recognized Jorge O'Neill as the Prince of Clanaboy, Tyrone, Ulster, as the Count of Tyrone, and the Head of the Royal House of O'Neill and all of its septs.<ref>The O'Neills of Ulster, Vol. III, pg. 349-356</ref> It was from this grant that the Chief Herald of Ireland recognized the family as the Princes of Clannaboy in 1945.  The grandson of Jorge and present Prince of Clanaboy, Hugo, has not pressed his senior claim to the entire House of O'Neill out of respect for his O'Neill chief cousins and their own histories.\n\nHugo Ricciardi O'Neill is officially recognized by the offices of arms throughout Europe as titular Prince and Count of Clanaboy. He uses the title and style of '''The O'Neill of Clanaboy'''.  The name Clanaboy (or Clandeboye) is a corruption of the Gaelic family name of 'Cloinne Aodha Buidhe' or 'Family of Fair-Haired Hugh'. The O'Neills of Bellaghy are of this line.  Count O'Nelley of the Austro-Hungarian Army (circa 1750) is of this line and from the MacShanes, as are the O'Neills of the Feeva. The traditional title of the head of this family branch is The O'Neill Buidhe or The O'Neill of Clannabuidhe.  The O'Neill of Clanaboy is the only O'Neill prince recognized as one of the hereditary [[Chiefs of the Name]] of Ireland.  They are a dominant family to this day in Counties Antrim, Louth, and eastern Armagh.\n\n==O'Neills of Shane's Castle==\nThe castle at Edenduffcarrick now called Shane's Castle has long been a key family in the Clannaboy clan of O'Neills.  Shane MacBrien O'Neill changed the name to Shane's Castle in 1722.  After the Plantation of Ulster, some O'Neill families converted to the Church of Ireland and began to intermarry with the new nobility coming from England.  One such union between Mary O'Neill, the daughter of Henry O'Neill the lord of Shane's Castle, and Arthur Chichester.  It is through this marriage that the present day Barons of Shane's Castle trace their lineage to the royal family of O'Neill.  The present day title of Baron O'Neill of Shane's Castle is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.<ref>\"No. 23370\". The London Gazette. 14 April 1868. p. 2220</ref> It was created in 1868 for the musical composer The Reverend William O'Neill. Born William Chichester, he succeeded to the estates of his cousin John Bruce Richard O'Neill, 3rd Viscount O'Neill, in 1855 (on whose death the viscountcy and barony of O'Neill became extinct) and assumed by Royal licence the surname of O'Neill in lieu of Chichester in order to inherit the lands of his cousin, despite not being descended in the male line from an O'Neill,<ref>Holohan, Renagh.

Lord O'Neill was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Antrim.\n[[File:O'Neill Conroy family tree.jpg|thumb|O'Neill Conroy family tree]]\n\nHis eldest son and heir apparent, the Hon. Arthur O'Neill, represented Antrim Mid in the House of Commons as a Conservative from 1910 until 1914, when he was killed in action during the First World War, the first MP to die in the conflict. The second Baron was therefore succeeded by his grandson, Shane O'Neill, 3rd Baron O'Neill (the son of the Hon. Arthur O'Neill). He was killed in action in Italy during the Second World War where he served as a Battalion Commander of the [[North Irish Horse]] regiment. His wife later remarried to the famous spy novelist, [[Ian Fleming]].\n\nAs of 2017 the title is held by his son, the fourth Baron, Sir Raymond O'Neill who succeeded in 1944. He was Lord Lieutenant of Antrim from 1994 to 2008 for which he was knighted in 2014. As a descendant of the first Viscount Chichester he is in remainder to the barony and viscountcy of Chichester and, according to a special patent in the letters patent, the earldom of Donegall, titles held by his kinsman the Marquess of Donegall.  Two other members of the O'Neill family have been elevated to the peerage. [[Hugh O'Neill, 1st Baron Rathcavan]], was the youngest son of the second Baron O'Neill, while [[Terence O'Neill]], Baron O'Neill of the Maine, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, was the youngest brother of the third Baron.\nThe family seat is Shane's Castle, near Randalstown, County Antrim where they are involved in the commercial cattle business.\n\n==O'Neills of the Fews==\n\"[[The Fews]]\" is an area in [[County Armagh]], [[Northern Ireland]], that was a sub-territory under the O'Neills of Tyrone. This O'Neill branch is related to the O'Neill of Tyrone through King Eoghan Mor, circa 1432\u20131436. The king's younger son Aodh (Hugh) pushed in the territory known as the Fews and conquered its various independent lordships.

Despite their non-participation in the war, the O'Neill estates were seized by the Crown.

When [[Shane O'Neill (Irish chieftain)|Shane O'Neill]], Prince of Tyrone and chief of all the O'Neill clans, was killed in 1567, he had an estimated ten male children from his various wives and mistresses.  As a group they were very young.  During Shane's lifetime, he made claim to the legitimate patrimony of these children and thus they were raised in the courts of their various maternal grandfathers and aunts upon his death. These houses included the Gaelic noble families of O'Donnell, Maguire, O'Quinn, MacDonald, and MacLean.  Sixteen years later in 1583 a confederation of the brothers met at the court of their uncle, the Chief of the MacLean clan in the Scottish isles.  They were given an army of more than 2000 Scots to return to Ulster to attempt to retake their father's estate and title.  When they invaded the brothers took the English and the O'Neill chiefs by surprise and created a large sphere of control in eastern Ulster, allied with the MacDonald's of Antrim. In an attempt to characterize them, the English began to refer to the group of brothers as \"the Mac-Shanes\" which in Gaelic meant \"the sons of Shane\". For seven years they battled Sir [[Turlough Luineach O'Neill|Turlough O'Neill]], the recognized O'Neill Mor at the time, and the rising [[Baron Dungannon]] and eventually [[Earl of Tyrone]], Hugh Rua O'Neill. The brothers were dealt a blow in 1590 when the Earl of Tyrone captured and hanged three of the brothers.<ref>Tyrone's Rebellion, by Hyram Morgan, p. 18</ref> The earl succeeded in capturing and imprisoning another three over the remainder of the decade until there were only two possibly three of the brothers and nephews hiding out in the Glenconkeyne forest in eastern Tyrone. Two sons of [[Con MacShane O'Neill]],<ref>\"Conn O'Neill of Kilskerry\", The Clogher Record, vol 6, no. 2, 1967. pp. 388\u2013394.</ref> Hugh and Ever, became chief raiders within the O'Neill clan living there.  That family had saved them as babies when their father had been killed nearby and had since been referred to as the Clan Shanes. In 1593, the Earl of Tyrone had the Clan Shane's chief killed and the family turned to Hugh MacShane as their new leader. Hugh was elected as their chief, and that O'Neill branch has since forth taken on the \"[[MacShane]]\" surname as an honorific for their loyalty to Shane O'Neill and to his battling sons.<ref>Fall of the Irish Chiefs and Clans, by George Hill, p. 167.</ref> [[Hugh McShane O'Neill]] reigned as chief until 1622 and his sons and grandsons served as the chieftains of the family and were active in the wars and politics of Ulster, Ireland, and Spain for the next two centuries.<ref>Royal O'Neill, Desmond O'Neill, 1996. p. 221</ref>\n\nSome of Shane's surviving son's were given sizable land after the flight of the earls that had previously belonged to Hugh O'Neill. Henry was given land in Orior, Con was given the estate of Clabbye,<ref>Jury list of the Attaintment of the estate of the Earl of Tyrone, 1614</ref> and Brian was given land in Clinawly, Fermanagh. Brian's son Edmond was granted control of Lisdawericke, Megin, Cnoghan, Tollohiny Dirrilghta, Knockmcgallcrum & Gortnesillagh. Henry's son Cormocke (Cormac) was given land. This spread the clan throughout the province and lessened their influence.  Brian, son of Hugh, the Chief of the McShane O'Neills led the clan in the 1642 Rising, the [[Irish Confederate Wars]], and fought against [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s Army through the death of his 2nd cousin [[Owen Roe O'Neill]] in 1649 and the victory of Cromwell in 1653.  Brian remained in Spanish exile until 1666.  Two decades later, his son the new Chief, Brian Og (the Younger) led the clan in service of the O'Neill regiments supporting [[King James II]].  After the defeat of the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite]] forces, the family was \"[[attainted]]\" as Irish rebels in 1693, and Brian \"Og\" left with the Army of [[King James II]] and went into exile in France.<ref>King James Army List, 1689\u20131691, p. 648.</ref>  The eventual heir, Owen McHugh O'Neill, completely dropped any association with the O'Neill name, and just took McShane as a surname due the Irish [[Penal Laws]], in an attempt to hold his father's small estate.\n\nAfter the fall of the O'Neill kingship, many MacShanes followed their cousins into military service in Spain and France and even served in the Irish regiments with their family and former enemies, the descendants of Hugh Rua O'Neill, the 2nd Earl.  By the end of the 17th century, the Earl's line failed in exile, and the \"Mac Shane\" line legally inherited the chiefship and title.<ref>Micheline Kearney Walsh (1988). \"The Last Earls of Tyrone in Spain\".

Patrick Woulfe, 1923</ref> or Johnson.  A good example is Major General [[Sir William Johnson]], Bt.  His father had been born a McShane but translated his name, allowing his son to succeed to his uncles properties.  By the early-19th century most of the official documents fail to show any McShane families in their former territory as all of them had converted to the surname Johnson.  However, by the 20th century, many of the Irish branches were returning to the Gaelic name. Today the clan recognizes McShane, Johnson, Johnston, and Shane as elements of the family and are still active and viable in Ulster, America, and Australia. The family leadership today is directly descended from Shane's son Conn, to his son [[Hugh McShane O'Neill]] and is closely involved in the greater O'Neill clan activities and their present chief takes part in the Association of O'Neill Clans and is on the O'Neill family council.\n\nMost recently, DNA tests and research have proven the linkage between the MacShanes and the O'Neills of Tyrone.  In a study begun in 2002, Patrick Guinness funded Trinity College, Dublin to conduct a DNA study on the O'Neil's of Ulster, to include the MacShane family.  The results were published by Ed O'Neill and the late John McLaughlin that showed the McShanes were 100% match of a unique DNA sequence that is specific to the Chiefly line of the Tyrone O'Neills.  It is estimated by Trinity College that the specific gene 'break' with the rest of the O'Neills of Ulster was either Aedh Macaomh Toinleasg O'Neill, King of Cenel Eoghain from 1176 to 1177, or his father, Muircheartach Muighe Line O'Neill.{{fact|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Caribbean O'Neills ==\nMany [[O'Neill (surname)|O'Neills]] moved to the Caribbean, especially from the lines of the [[Count of Tyrone|Counts of Tyrone]] of Hugh MacFerdorcha Aodh M\u00f3r mac Feardorcha \u00d3 N\u00e9ill. Their close connection to the Spanish government after the final fall of the O'Neills in 1690 provided the opportunity for new territory.

Recent findings show that other O'Neill's settled in [[Puerto Rico]] in the 18th century. The earliest record, based on documents from the Spanish royal courts, show that Don Juan O'Neill arrived in Puerto Rico in the 1710s.  Two O'Neill officers served in the Spanish Army forces of Bernardo de Galvez fighting the English in Florida and Alabama during the American Revolution.\n\nTulio and Enrique O'Neill y O'Kelly, of the [[#O'Neills of the Fews|O'Neills of the Fews]], became residents of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]] in the 1770s in the footsteps of a deceased uncle. Tulio's sons, Arturo and Tulio O'Neill y O'Keefe, were granted land in Puerto Rico in 1804. Arturo moved his family there in March 1810 and his descendants continue to reside there today as well as in Spain and the USA.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Mark|title=The O'Neills of the Fews: their origin, descendants and DNA profile: I|journal=The Irish Genealogist|date=2015|volume=14|issue=2|pages=179\u2013189}}</ref>\n\nMost O'Neill families of [[Puerto Rico]] have for many generations resided in the districts of Hato Nuevo, Mamey, and Sonadora of the city of Guaynabo on the northern coast of the island of Puerto Rico. Other O'Neill families have settled in the cities of R\u00edo Piedras and Caguas. Many other O'Neill families that moved from [[Barbados]] settled on the Island of [[Vieques]]. The O'Neills have been mayors of their cities.\n\nThe O'Neills of [[Martinique]] settled in the early 1700s; in the next century, they claimed to be [[Count of Tyrone]] and lineally descended from Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. This claim (which rested on a single-sentence document in their own possession) is currently regarded as unproven.<ref>[[Complete Peerage]], Vol. XII, Part II, Appendix C, supp. p. 13, note (h); [[Peter Berresford Ellis]], ''Erin's Blood Royal: the royal Gaelic dynasties of Ireland'', London, 1999, p. 241</ref> The main stem of this family is now extinct in the male line; collateral descendants may exist.\n\n==Today==\nToday the ancient O'Neills flourish in Ireland, Europe, and the New World.  Clan organizations and meetings are held regularly, and the family organization is recognized by every possible Irish historical governing body.  The O'Neill's are represented, and are the current Presidents of, the [[Standing Council of Irish Chiefs and Chieftains]].  They are members of the Clans of Ireland, and hold status with the Councils of each County in Ulster.  And before the Irish Republic's government stopped recognizing Chiefs, they were one of the original chiefly families recognized in 1945 by the Chief Herald of Ireland.  They still maintain good relations with the government in Dublin and have hosted the President in Ulster twice.  Most recently the Parliament in Dublin reversed the legal attainments against O'Neill chiefs dating back to 1569.\n\nThree of the ancient [[O'Neill (surname)|O'Neill]] [[dynasty|dynasties]] or [[principality|principalities]], are still represented by direct descendants of the once independent kings, the O'Neills of Clannaboy, the Fews, and the McShane O'Neills of Tyrone. The chiefships pass under the elective [[derbfine]] system of [[Early Irish law|Irish Brehon law]], but many incumbents were also granted further titles that are inherited under [[primogeniture]] by various Roman Catholic kingdoms in Europe and by the British crown who today possess and use titles in Ireland, Spain, France, Scotland, Portugal, England, Australia, South Africa and the Americas. Further, O'Neills hold five existing House of Lords Peerages in Ulster, Scotland, and England, and even married into the Swedish Royal family in 2010, represented by Christopher O'Neill and his children, HRH Leonore, Duchess of Gotland, and HRH Prince Nicolas of Sweden, [[Duke of \u00c5ngermanland]].\n\nOverseas branches flourish, such as in South Africa where descendants are referred to as Nel's, mainly due to the influence of the Afrikaner people of the country. The family maintains a loose confederation with its sept princes and chiefs centered in Ireland, meeting annually.  This Chief's group met in 2007 to commemorate and retrace the [[Flight of the Earls]], in 2010 outside Paris to announce a new, global clan organization that has the goal of constructing an O'Neill museum in Ulster as a central repository for all the family artifacts spread across the world. In 2013 they established a historical relationship with the Priory at Benburb, they met in 2015 to promote the O'Neill Summer School from Shane's Castle, in 2016 in Rome to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the death of the 2nd Earl, Hugh O'Neill, and in October 2017 they established a library and museum at the Priory in Benburb, presenting a historical writings collection previously in private hands out of Ireland for centuries.<ref>https://www.servitelibrary.org/libraryandmuseum</ref>\n\n[[Geneticists]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] suggested in 2006 that Niall of the Nine Hostages may have been the most [[Fecundity|fecund]] male in Irish history. Of their Irish sample, the geneticists found that 21 percent of men from north-western Ireland, 8 percent from all of Ireland, a substantial percentage of men from western and central Scotland, and about 2 percent of men from New York bore the same [[Y-chromosome]] [[haplotype]]. The geneticists estimated that about 2&ndash;3 million men bear this haplotype.

The red hand by itself has become a symbol of the O'Neill name, such that when other O'Neill family branches were granted or assumed a heraldic achievement, this red hand was often incorporated into the new coat of arms in some way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.araltas.com/features/oneill/ |title=About the name O'Neill |publisher=Araltas.com |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe red hand is explained by several legends, with a common theme but of a promise of land to the first man to sail or swim across the sea and touch the shores of Ireland.

As Kings of [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]], they are historically the most prominent family of the [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]], along with the [[O'Donnell dynasty|\u00d3 D\u00f3naill]], [[O'Doherty family|\u00d3 Dochartaigh]] and the [[Donnelly (surname)|\u00d3 Donnghaile]] dynasties (the head of the \u00d3 Donnghaile lineage being the hereditary Marshal of the O'Neill forces). The \u00d3 N\u00e9ills hold that their ancestors were [[Kings of Ailech]] during the Early Middle Ages, as descendants of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]].\n\nTwo of their progenitors [[High Kings of Ireland]], [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]] (from whom they take their name) and [[Domnall ua N\u00e9ill]]. From 1185 until 1616, the \u00d3 N\u00e9ills were sovereign [[Kings of T\u00edr E\u00f3gain]], holding territories in the north of Ireland; particularly around modern [[County Tyrone]], [[County Londonderry]] (Derry) and [[County Antrim]]. After their realm was merged with the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the land was caught up in the [[Plantation of Ulster]], they were involved in a number of significant events, such as [[Tyrone's Rebellion]], the [[Flight of the Earls]], the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and the [[Irish Confederate Wars]].\n\n==Naming conventions==\n{{Main|Irish personal naming system}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n! width=20%  | Male\n! width=20% | Daughter ''<small>(Long)</small>''\n! width=20% | Daughter ''<small>(Short)</small>''\n! width=20%  | Wife ''<small>(Long)</small>''\n! width=20%  | Wife ''<small>(Short)</small>''\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| \u00d3 N\u00e9ill<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sloinne.ie/surname/ga/o-neill/|publisher=Sloinne|title=\u00d3 N\u00e9ill|date=5 December 2015}}</ref>\n| align=\"center\"| In\u00edon U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\n| align=\"center\"| N\u00ed N\u00e9ill\n| align=\"center\"| Bean U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\n| align=\"center\"| U\u00ed N\u00e9ill\n|-\n|}\n\n==Origins==\nThe \u00d3 N\u00e9ill lineage claims descent from [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]], a 10th-century king of [[Ailech]] as well as [[High King of Ireland]]. Niall descended from the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain branch of the [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]. The first to adopt the patronymic surname was Niall Gl\u00fandub's great-grandson, [[Flaithbertach Ua N\u00e9ill]].\n\nThe lineage does not receive a mention in non-Irish recorded history sources<ref>Annals of Ireland</ref> between the 1080s and 1160s, from which they emerge from a \"very murky background\".<ref name=\"Cosgrove\"/> In 1167, King of Ireland [[Ruaidri Ua Concobhair]] marched north and divided the kingdom of Ailech into two.<ref name=\"Cosgrove\"/> The portion north of [[Slieve Gallion]], was given to [[Niall Mac Lochlainn]] (McLaughlin), with the portion south of Slieve Gallion, given to [[\u00c1ed in Mac\u00e1em T\u00f3inlesc|\u00c1ed Ua N\u00e9ill]].<ref name=\"Cosgrove\"/> After this the two rival dynasties contested for control over T\u00edr Eoghain until the battle of Caimeirge in 1241, where the \u00d3 N\u00e9ills wiped out the Mhic Lochlainn leadership.<ref name=\"Cosgrove\"/>\n\n==O'Neills of Tyrone==\nAfter 1241, the \u00d3 N\u00e9ill lineage dominated and displaced other lineage, using the disruption of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169 to their benefit and were able to consolidate. The [[Bruce campaign in Ireland|Bruce Invasion of Ireland]] devastated the Norman [[Earldom of Ulster]], which held sway over eastern Ulster and most of its north coast all the way to [[Derry]]. Its collapse in 1333 allowed a branch of the \u00d3 N\u00e9ill that had been on good terms with the Normans, Clann Aodh Buidhe, to step into the power vacuum and take control over large parts of eastern Ulster.\n\nThe dominant [[Gaels|Gaelic]] and [[Norman-Irish]] leaders were in tune with their contemporary peers of the [[Middle Ages]] in terms of education, international trade, and diplomacy. The \u00d3 N\u00e9ills had strong family relationships with the [[FitzGerald dynasty]], both the [[Earls of Kildare]] and [[Earls of Desmond]]; the [[Earl of Pembroke]] via de Clare's marriage to the Irish house of Diarmuid, [[King of Leinster]]; and the [[Clan Donald|MacDonnells]], [[Bissett family (Ireland)|Bissetts]], [[Clan Maclean|MacLean]]s, and [[Clan Campbell|Campbell]]s.\n\nIn 1171, King [[Henry II of England]] came to Ireland to remove the authority of the English lords in Ireland. He met the leading Irish kings and received the pledge of fealty from them. During the Middle Ages, the \u00d3 N\u00e9ills were active politically and militarily throughout Ireland, occasionally sending nobility to fight within Ireland and in campaigns in Europe. From 1312 to 1318, their kings were staunch supporters of King [[Robert the Bruce]] and his brother Edward Bruce. They sent troops and supported Edward in his attempt to become King of Ireland in 1315. In 1394 [[Richard II of England]] deemed King Niall Mor \"Le Grand O'Neill\" upon a friendly hosting of the two kings. In the 14th century [[Edward III of England]] called Tyrone \"the Great O'Neill\" and invited him to join a campaign against the Scots, and another O'Neill prince accompanied the English king on a crusade to the [[Holy Land]]. In 1493, [[Henry VII of England]] referred to Henry O'Neill, King of Tyrone, as \"the Chief of the Irish Kings\" and gave him a gift of livery.<ref>{{cite book |title=Medieval Ireland, an Encyclopedia |editor=Sean Duffy}}</ref>\n\nThe O'Neills' independent stature within Ulster began to change with the ascent of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in England in 1509. Soon after he took the English throne, Henry decided to grasp Ireland via a reputed Papal Bull that claimed to grant the lordship of Ireland to English kings. This was spurred by the 1537 Rising of [[Silken Thomas]] Fitzgerald. The O'Neills supported their [[FitzGerald dynasty]] cousins in that rebellion and had to maneuver politically to keep the English from toppling their power in Ulster when the rising failed. Henry began a policy to reduce the kings in Ireland to the same rank and structure as the English nobility. In the policy called [[Surrender and regrant]] Irish monarchs were forced to surrender their titles and independent lands to Henry, and in return he created them Earls of the Kingdom of Ireland and \"granted\" them their own lands back. The last King of Tyrone and first [[Earl of Tyrone#Earls of Tyrone, first Creation (1542)|original earldom]] was one such grant by Henry VIII in 1542 to [[Conn Bacach O'Neill]], on the creation of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. Conn wanted to be named the Earl of Ulster, but Henry refused that royal honor out of spite for Conn's previous warfare against his crown.  The earldom of Tyrone was eventually granted in 1542.<ref>British Museum, Harl. Ms. 5885 (N.L.I. Dublin POS no. 1426) and British Museum, Harl. Ms. 6096 (N.L.I.

Footnote no. 6.\n</ref>  The submission of Conn O'Neill led to a 50-year civil war within Ulster that eventually led to downfall of O'Neill power in 1607 with the departure of the third earl for Rome and exile.\n\n[[Shane O'Neill (Irish chieftain)|Shane O'Neill]], known as {{lang|ga|Se\u00e1n an D\u00edomais}} or Shane the Proud (1530\u20131567), the eldest surviving, legitimate son of Conn Bacach O'Neill, was styled Prince of Tyrone, Prince of Ulster, and Dux Hibernicorum (Prince of Ireland) by his European peers.  He did not share the moderate relationship with the English that his father had cultivated. He was almost always at war with the Lord Lieutenant in Dublin.  An act of the English Parliament in 1562 gave Shane O'Neill the English title of Lord O'Neill until his claim for his father's estate was settled. The writ for Shane to be named the second Earl of Tyrone was written, but held up on Dublin. Shane rebelled and was killed before he could be invested and in 1569, the retrospective attainder of Shane O'Neill banned the use of the title of The O'Neill M\u00f3r.\n\nThe title The O'Neill M\u00f3r was not a [[patrilineal]] hereditary one, but was conferred on the man elected and inaugurated to rule T\u00edr Eoghain. The title did not have to be from a Tyrone sept, as at least two Clannaboy chiefs also served as The O'Neill M\u00f3r. However, there are a few families that may, and some do, claim the rights of O'Neill of Tyrone. These claimants are made up of descendants of the last King and sons of the first Earl (Conn): Shane, Ferdocha (Mathew), and [[Phelim Caoch O'Neill|Phelim Caoch]]. These claimants include O'Neill of Corab, O'Neill of Waterford, [[McShane (name)|McShane]]-Johnson O'Neills of Killetragh, and O'Neill of [[Dundalk]], as well as the primogeniture of the Marqu\u00e9s de Larra\u00edn who still use the titular title of Prince of Tyrone. All descend from one of the last chiefs of the O'Neills of Tyrone.\n\nUpon the death of Shane, his tanist and cousin, [[Turlough Luineach O'Neill]] became the paramount Ulster chief.  Turlough was the son of Conn Bacach's uncle, and was the fourth son of Niall Connallach macArt \u00f3g O'Neill, Tanist of Tyrone (1519\u20131544).  Turlough assumed the position of The O'Neill Mor and held it through a great deal of fighting until 1595 when he died.  During his Chiefship, Turlough initially battled the sons of his predecessor Shane, who were called the MacShanes, but soon after established a peace with the brothers, granting them the eastern third of his lands (Glenconkeyn and parts of Tir Eoghan along the western side of Lough Neagh) in return for their military loyalty. MacShanes Conn and his brother Shane both served as Turlough's tanists at different times.  At the same time, Turlough battled the up-and-coming Baron of Dungannon, Hugh Rua O'Neill who was placed in Ulster as a counterweight to Turlough's power by the English.  Hugh Rua eventually succeeded to the title of Earl of Tyrone and upon Turlough's death, became The O'Neill Mor himself.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of warfare with the English forces in Ireland, [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone]], surrendered in 1603, just days after the death of his enemy Queen Elizabeth.  Hugh stayed in Ulster as the Earl for another five years.  But after numerous threats to his life, he secretly departed Ireland for the French coast in 1607 in what is famously called the [[Flight of the Earls]].  Hugh continued to use his title after he fled to the Continent in the Flight of the Earls, although in the law of the Kingdom of Ireland it was forfeit by act of the Irish Parliament a year later. So did his son [[Shane O'Neill (Irish exile)|Shane O'Neill]], whose Will left his title to his only, if illegitimate, son Hugo Eugenio O'Neill; when he died in 1641 at the head of his regiment in Spain.  Other Spanish exiled descendants of Hugh Rua continued to use the title and command the Ulster Irish Regiment in the Spanish Army through the seventeenth century.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Micheline Kearney Walsh |title=The Last Earls of Tyrone in Spain |journal=Seanchas Ardmhacha: Journal of the Armagh Diocesan Historical Society |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1988 |pages=33\u201358}} The last mention of a Conde de Tyrone is in 1691, and Walsh concludes that he died not long thereafter.</ref>\n\nThe barony of Dungannon was created in 1542 as the title designated for the declared heir of the Earldom.  Ferdocha or [[Matthew O'Neill, 1st Baron Dungannon|Mathew O'Neill]], natural son of Conn Bacach the 1st Earl, was the first to hold the title of [[Baron Dungannon]]. The line that descended from Mathew kept the Baron of Dungannon as one of its junior titles at least through the death of Don Eugenio O'Neill, Conde de Tiron in 1695.  There were other titles laid out in the will of Don Juan (John/Shane/Sean) O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone in 1660. They include: Viscount of Tyrone, Viscount of Montoy, Baron of Strabane, and Lord of the Clannaboy. There is a later account of the O'Neills acquiring the comital title of Clanawley.  Although the title of Baron of Dungannon would traditionally still be preserved with the title of Count/Earl of Tyrone, it is not presently used by anyone in the extended O'Neill family.\n\nAnother of the more famous O'Neills of Tyrone was Eoghan Rua \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, anglicized as [[Owen Roe O'Neill]] (c. 1590\u20131649), a brilliant 17th-century military commander and one of the most famous of the O'Neill family of Ulster. He was the son of Art O'Neill, a younger brother of [[Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone]]. As a young man, he left Ireland in the Flight of the Earls to escape the English conquest of his native Ulster. He grew up in the Spanish Netherlands and spent 40 years serving in the Irish regiment of the Spanish Army, mainly in the [[Eighty Years' War]] against the [[Dutch Republic]] in Flanders, notably at the siege of [[Arras]], where he commanded the Spanish garrison. O'Neill was, like many [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Irish officers in the Spanish service, hostile to the English Protestant invasion of Ireland. He returned to Ireland during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] to command the Catholic Army for during the [[Irish Confederate Wars]]. He was reportedly poisoned by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] supporters and died in 1649.\n\n== Slight-Arte O'Neills ==\n\nThis is another branch of the Tyrone O'Neills which started in the mid 15th century.  The name translates to \"of the sept of Art\". Eoghan M\u00f3r O'Neill (Owen the Great), King of T\u00edr Eoghan (Tyrone) from 1432 to 1456 had four sons who each started independent lines. His eldest, Henry, was King of Tyrone from 1455 to 1489 and was the grandfather of Conn Bacach. Aodh, his second son started the line of the Fews. Art, his third son, was King of Tyrone 1509\u20131514. This branch of the family held its lands in western Tyrone and was typically at a distance from those O'Neills centered on the traditional capitol of [[Dungannon]]. Art was unable to elevate his son to the kingship, but his grandson was Sir [[Turlough Luineach \u00d3 Neill]], The O'Neill Mor 1567\u20131593, the Earl of ClanConnell, and de jure King of Tyrone for a rocky period during the 1570s.  On his deathbed he passed his chiefship to his cousin [[Hugh O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone|Hugh M\u00f3r O'Neill]], the Earl of Tyrone.  That family, after Sir Turlough's death, remained hostile to the Earl and often sided with the English when in conflict with the rest of the Tyrone O'Neills.\n\n==O'Neills of Clanaboy==\n[[File:O'Neill of Clanaboy.png|thumb|200px|O'Neill of Clanaboy.]]\nAodh Buidhe, son of Domhnall \u00d3c \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, grandson of [[Aodh M\u00e9ith|Aodh Meith O'Neill]] (Hugh the Fat), and great-grandson of [[\u00c1ed in Mac\u00e1em T\u00f3inlesc]], all kings of Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, was the eponymous ancestor of the \u00d3 N\u00e9ill Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, or Clanaboy O'Neill, line. He had come to an arrangement with the Norman Earls of Ulster which allowed his sons, particularly Briain, to consolidate \u00d3 N\u00e9ill power within The North at the expense of the [[O'Donnell]]s. Aodh Buidhe was married Eleanor de Nangle, a kinswoman to his nominal enemy, [[Walter de Burgh]], the [[Earl of Ulster]] and [[Jocelyn de Angulo]]; Aodh died in 1283. The lineage he established remained senior among the \u00d3 N\u00e9ill's, becoming semi-independent with a distinct territory. Having helped the Anglo-Normans barons in a rebellion against their fellow Norman lord, the Earl of Ulster, the family was granted land outside the North, in Ulster within what is now south [[County Antrim]]. That was the official establishment of the Lordship of Cloinne Aodha Buidhe, or the O'Neills of [[Clandeboye]], though the English retained lordship over the much-reduced Earldom of Ulster.\n\nThe family fought on both sides of the wars that racked Ireland from the 1530s to 1690s, whose end result was a significant loss of territory and influence due to political alliances and an influx of new families flowing in from Scotland and England.\n\nThe issue of Sir Henry \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, who had been \"granted\" the Edendubhcarrig estate and majority of the Cloinne Aodha Buidhe lands by conforming to English ways and converting to Anglicanism, died out in 1855. At this time, the barrister Charles Henry \u00d3 N\u00e9ill of the \u00d3 N\u00e9ills of the Feeva, descendant of the last T\u00e1naiste of Clanaboy, Sir Henry's uncle Con Mac Brian \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, became officially recognized as The \u00d3 N\u00e9ill Clanaboy. \"The descendants of Prince Con MacBryan O'Neill, Tanist of Clanaboy, remained loyal, under every vicissitude, to the traditions of their house, and saved little out of the general wreck of confiscation. They seemed to have preferred fulfilling the solemn pledge of their ancestor, Donald O'Neill, King of Ulster, to 'fight out as long as life should last' rather than adapt themselves to altered circumstances, as the descendants of Shane MacBryan had wisely done,\" according to Burke's Peerage.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burke |first=Sir John Bernard |title=A selection of arms authorized by the laws of heraldry |url=https://archive.org/details/aselectionarmsa00burkgoog |date=1860 |publisher=Harrison}}</ref> In fact both Sir Henry and his daughter Rose willed the Shane's Castle estate to the descendants of Prince Con mac Brian. While Charles Henry assumed the title, the Clanaboy \u00d3 N\u00e9ill estate was passed to William Chichester through his grandmother Mary \u00d3 N\u00e9ill \u2013 a move highly disputed. Charles Henry \u00d3 N\u00e9ill had his first and only child, a daughter named Elizabeth Catherine Theresa Mary \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, in 1845, during the Great Hunger, and had no further issue. From the death of Charles Henry \u00d3 N\u00e9ill until Jorge O'Neill assumed the chieftainship the family had no chief.\n\n==O'Neill Descendants in France, Spain, and Portugal==\nIn the beginning of the 18th century [[F\u00e9ilim \u00d3 N\u00e9ill]] (in English Felix O'Neill), senior male in linear descent of the line of Brian Ballach \u00d3 N\u00e9ill, Niall M\u00f3r \u00d3 N\u00e9ill's second eldest son, was dispossessed of all his estate through the confiscation applied via the Penal Laws, which led him to emigrate to France. He was a cavalry officer who took part in many battles with the heroic [[Irish Brigade (French)|Irish Brigade]] of the French Army. He fought with the French against the British, the Austrians, and the Dutch (during the War of the Spanish Succession), in the celebrated Battle of Malplaquet, where he died on 11 September 1709.[1][2]\n\nHis son [[Conn (Constantine) O'Neill]] was an officer who spent his life in exile in France and married to Cecilia O'Hanlon. Their eldest son, [[Jo\u00e3o O'Neill]] (Shane O'Neill), was born in Richhill Village in the parish of Kilmore, Tyrone, and died in Santos o Velho, Lisbon, on 21 January 1788.  He left France with his brothers and established their noble line permanently under in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. He was the titular head of the Clanaboy O'Neill dynasty, whose family have been in Portugal ever since. The current head of the Clanaboy O'Neill dynasty, a descendant of Jo\u00e3o, is Portuguese nobleman [[Hugo Ricciardi O'Neill]], the son of [[Jorge Maria O'Neill]]; the family has been remarkable in the modern history of [[Portugal]].\n\nIn 1896 Jorge O'Neill of Portugal submitted his genealogy to the Somerset Herald in London. Five years later, Sir Henry Farnham Burke, KCVO, CB, FSA, Somerset Herald stated in 1900 that \"the only Pedigree at present on record in either of the Offices of Arms showing a lineal male descent from the House of O'Neill, Monarchs of Ireland, Kings of Ulster, and Princes of Tyrone and Claneboy, is the one registered in the fifty-ninth year of the Reign of Our Sovereign Lady Victoria, in favor of His Excellency Jorge O'Neill of Lisbon\". He then recognized him as the Representative of the House of O'Neill and as the Representative of the Earldom created in 1542 for his kinsman Conn Baccagh O'Neill. All of this was granted under Letters Patent issued by the English College of Heralds. Later, the Ulster and Norroy King of Arms granted him the undifferenced arms as the head of the House of O'Neill. Upon that Letters Patent, Pope Leo XIII, the King of Spain, and the King of Portugal all recognized Jorge O'Neill as the Prince of Clanaboy, Tyrone, Ulster, as the Count of Tyrone, and the Head of the Royal House of O'Neill and all of its septs.<ref>The O'Neills of Ulster, Vol. III, pg. 349-356</ref> It was from this grant that the Chief Herald of Ireland recognized the family as the Princes of Clannaboy in 1945.  The grandson of Jorge and present Prince of Clanaboy, Hugo, has not pressed his senior claim to the entire House of O'Neill out of respect for his O'Neill chief cousins and their own histories.\n\nHugo Ricciardi O'Neill is officially recognized by the offices of arms throughout Europe as titular Prince and Count of Clanaboy. He uses the title and style of '''The O'Neill of Clanaboy'''.  The name Clanaboy (or Clandeboye) is a corruption of the Gaelic family name of 'Cloinne Aodha Buidhe' or 'Family of Fair-Haired Hugh'. The O'Neills of Bellaghy are of this line.  Count O'Nelley of the Austro-Hungarian Army (circa 1750) is of this line and from the MacShanes, as are the O'Neills of the Feeva. The traditional title of the head of this family branch is The O'Neill Buidhe or The O'Neill of Clannabuidhe.  The O'Neill of Clanaboy is the only O'Neill prince recognized as one of the hereditary [[Chiefs of the Name]] of Ireland.  They are a dominant family to this day in Counties Antrim, Louth, and eastern Armagh.\n\n==O'Neills of Shane's Castle==\nThe castle at Edenduffcarrick now called Shane's Castle has long been a key family in the Clannaboy clan of O'Neills.  Shane MacBrien O'Neill changed the name to Shane's Castle in 1722.  After the Plantation of Ulster, some O'Neill families converted to the Church of Ireland and began to intermarry with the new nobility coming from England.  One such union between Mary O'Neill, the daughter of Henry O'Neill the lord of Shane's Castle, and Arthur Chichester.  It is through this marriage that the present day Barons of Shane's Castle trace their lineage to the royal family of O'Neill.  The present day title of Baron O'Neill of Shane's Castle is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.<ref>\"No. 23370\". The London Gazette. 14 April 1868. p. 2220</ref> It was created in 1868 for the musical composer The Reverend William O'Neill. Born William Chichester, he succeeded to the estates of his cousin John Bruce Richard O'Neill, 3rd Viscount O'Neill, in 1855 (on whose death the viscountcy and barony of O'Neill became extinct) and assumed by Royal licence the surname of O'Neill in lieu of Chichester in order to inherit the lands of his cousin, despite not being descended in the male line from an O'Neill,<ref>Holohan, Renagh.

Lord O'Neill was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Antrim.\n[[File:O'Neill Conroy family tree.jpg|thumb|O'Neill Conroy family tree]]\n\nHis eldest son and heir apparent, the Hon. Arthur O'Neill, represented Antrim Mid in the House of Commons as a Conservative from 1910 until 1914, when he was killed in action during the First World War, the first MP to die in the conflict. The second Baron was therefore succeeded by his grandson, Shane O'Neill, 3rd Baron O'Neill (the son of the Hon. Arthur O'Neill). He was killed in action in Italy during the Second World War where he served as a Battalion Commander of the [[North Irish Horse]] regiment. His wife later remarried to the famous spy novelist, [[Ian Fleming]].\n\nAs of 2017 the title is held by his son, the fourth Baron, Sir Raymond O'Neill who succeeded in 1944. He was Lord Lieutenant of Antrim from 1994 to 2008 for which he was knighted in 2014. As a descendant of the first Viscount Chichester he is in remainder to the barony and viscountcy of Chichester and, according to a special patent in the letters patent, the earldom of Donegall, titles held by his kinsman the Marquess of Donegall.  Two other members of the O'Neill family have been elevated to the peerage. [[Hugh O'Neill, 1st Baron Rathcavan]], was the youngest son of the second Baron O'Neill, while [[Terence O'Neill]], Baron O'Neill of the Maine, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, was the youngest brother of the third Baron.\nThe family seat is Shane's Castle, near Randalstown, County Antrim where they are involved in the commercial cattle business.\n\n==O'Neills of the Fews==\n\"[[The Fews]]\" is an area in [[County Armagh]], [[Northern Ireland]], that was a sub-territory under the O'Neills of Tyrone. This O'Neill branch is related to the O'Neill of Tyrone through King Eoghan Mor, circa 1432\u20131436. The king's younger son Aodh (Hugh) pushed in the territory known as the Fews and conquered its various independent lordships. Aodh then established an independent chieftainship under his father and then brother.\n[[File:Sir William Johnson.png|150px|right|thumb|[[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet of New York]].]]\nIn the rebellion of 1642, Sir Henry O'Neill, a member of the Fews O'Neills, sided with the English crown while his sons and brothers played a prominent part in the rising. Despite his choice of sides his lands were confiscated and divided among a number of Cromwellian settlers. The chief beneficiary was Thomas Ball, whose grants totalled more than {{convert|6000|acre|km2}}. Sir Henry O'Neill was banished to [[Connacht]], to land in [[County Mayo]], Ireland. Exiled with him was his son Captain Sean/Shane O'Neill.

He was a major-general in the American Colonial Army and fought the French at Niagara, New York in French-Indian War. For his significant victory he was granted a baronetcy and made [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet of New York]] in 1753.  The present holder of that estate is Sir Colpoys Johnson, 8th Baronet of New York.\n\nWhen the [[Williamite Wars in Ireland|Williamite War]] began in Ireland in 1689, Sir Henry O'Neill's son Turlough was dead and so was Turlough's son Con. The heir to the family's Mayo estate was Con's son Henry, who was a minor and had been sent to France for his education. Despite their non-participation in the war, the O'Neill estates were seized by the Crown. Henry (1676-1745) should subsequently have recovered the confiscated lands; his relatives on the continent feared to send him back to Ireland to stake his claim and the property went by default and was sold in 1702\u20133.<ref>{{cite journal|last=\u00d3 Fiaich|first=Tom\u00e1s|title=The O'Neills of the Fews|journal=Seanchas Ard Mhacha|year=1974|volume=7|issue=2|page=296}}</ref>  Henry had a heroic career in the French army, rising to become a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Regiment of Clare.

Arturo and his brother pleaded for permission to take up their father's right to land in [[Puerto Rico]] and this was granted in 1804. Arturo moved his family there in March 1810 and his descendants continue to reside there today as well as in Spain and the USA. Arturo became a Lieutenant Colonel on 17 August 1828 in [[Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico]] and inherited the title of [[:es:Marquesado del Norte|Marques Del Norte]] from his uncle. He died on 7 September 1832 and is reportedly buried in the Roman Catholic Church of [[Frederiksted]], Saint Croix.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Mark|title=The O'Neills of the Fews: their origin, descendants and DNA profile: I|journal=The Irish Genealogist|date=2015|volume=14|issue=2|pages=185\u2013187}}</ref>\n\nDon Tulio O'Neill y O'Keefe was born on St. Croix in September 1784.

He married Manuela de Castilla Quevedo, the daughter of a Spanish noble family, in 1819. However she died shortly after the birth of their son, Don Juan Antonio Luis O'Neill de Castilla. Tulio was promoted to Field Marshal in charge of the Royal Guard in 1828 and it was he who made the public announcement of the birth of a daughter to the King in 1830, namely the future [[Isabel II of Spain]]. Tulio died in 1855 and the family line was continued through his son who inherited his mother's titles (the Marques de la Granja, the Marques de Caltojar, the Marques de Valdeosera and the Count of Benajiar).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Mark|title=The O'Neills of the Fews: their origin, descendants and DNA profile: I|journal=The Irish Genealogist|date=2015|volume=14|issue=2|pages=188\u2013189}}</ref>  A later descendant of his also took the title of [[:es:Marquesado del Norte|Marques Del Norte]] that had remained unclaimed by their relations in Puerto Rico.

When [[Shane O'Neill (Irish chieftain)|Shane O'Neill]], Prince of Tyrone and chief of all the O'Neill clans, was killed in 1567, he had an estimated ten male children from his various wives and mistresses.  As a group they were very young.  During Shane's lifetime, he made claim to the legitimate patrimony of these children and thus they were raised in the courts of their various maternal grandfathers and aunts upon his death. These houses included the Gaelic noble families of O'Donnell, Maguire, O'Quinn, MacDonald, and MacLean.  Sixteen years later in 1583 a confederation of the brothers met at the court of their uncle, the Chief of the MacLean clan in the Scottish isles.  They were given an army of more than 2000 Scots to return to Ulster to attempt to retake their father's estate and title.  When they invaded the brothers took the English and the O'Neill chiefs by surprise and created a large sphere of control in eastern Ulster, allied with the MacDonald's of Antrim. In an attempt to characterize them, the English began to refer to the group of brothers as \"the Mac-Shanes\" which in Gaelic meant \"the sons of Shane\". For seven years they battled Sir [[Turlough Luineach O'Neill|Turlough O'Neill]], the recognized O'Neill Mor at the time, and the rising [[Baron Dungannon]] and eventually [[Earl of Tyrone]], Hugh Rua O'Neill. The brothers were dealt a blow in 1590 when the Earl of Tyrone captured and hanged three of the brothers.<ref>Tyrone's Rebellion, by Hyram Morgan, p. 18</ref> The earl succeeded in capturing and imprisoning another three over the remainder of the decade until there were only two possibly three of the brothers and nephews hiding out in the Glenconkeyne forest in eastern Tyrone. Two sons of [[Con MacShane O'Neill]],<ref>\"Conn O'Neill of Kilskerry\", The Clogher Record, vol 6, no. 2, 1967. pp. 388\u2013394.</ref> Hugh and Ever, became chief raiders within the O'Neill clan living there.  That family had saved them as babies when their father had been killed nearby and had since been referred to as the Clan Shanes. In 1593, the Earl of Tyrone had the Clan Shane's chief killed and the family turned to Hugh MacShane as their new leader. Hugh was elected as their chief, and that O'Neill branch has since forth taken on the \"[[MacShane]]\" surname as an honorific for their loyalty to Shane O'Neill and to his battling sons.<ref>Fall of the Irish Chiefs and Clans, by George Hill, p. 167.</ref> [[Hugh McShane O'Neill]] reigned as chief until 1622 and his sons and grandsons served as the chieftains of the family and were active in the wars and politics of Ulster, Ireland, and Spain for the next two centuries.<ref>Royal O'Neill, Desmond O'Neill, 1996. p. 221</ref>\n\nSome of Shane's surviving son's were given sizable land after the flight of the earls that had previously belonged to Hugh O'Neill. Henry was given land in Orior, Con was given the estate of Clabbye,<ref>Jury list of the Attaintment of the estate of the Earl of Tyrone, 1614</ref> and Brian was given land in Clinawly, Fermanagh. Brian's son Edmond was granted control of Lisdawericke, Megin, Cnoghan, Tollohiny Dirrilghta, Knockmcgallcrum & Gortnesillagh. Henry's son Cormocke (Cormac) was given land. This spread the clan throughout the province and lessened their influence.  Brian, son of Hugh, the Chief of the McShane O'Neills led the clan in the 1642 Rising, the [[Irish Confederate Wars]], and fought against [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s Army through the death of his 2nd cousin [[Owen Roe O'Neill]] in 1649 and the victory of Cromwell in 1653.  Brian remained in Spanish exile until 1666.  Two decades later, his son the new Chief, Brian Og (the Younger) led the clan in service of the O'Neill regiments supporting [[King James II]].  After the defeat of the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite]] forces, the family was \"[[attainted]]\" as Irish rebels in 1693, and Brian \"Og\" left with the Army of [[King James II]] and went into exile in France.<ref>King James Army List, 1689\u20131691, p. 648.</ref>  The eventual heir, Owen McHugh O'Neill, completely dropped any association with the O'Neill name, and just took McShane as a surname due the Irish [[Penal Laws]], in an attempt to hold his father's small estate.\n\nAfter the fall of the O'Neill kingship, many MacShanes followed their cousins into military service in Spain and France and even served in the Irish regiments with their family and former enemies, the descendants of Hugh Rua O'Neill, the 2nd Earl.  By the end of the 17th century, the Earl's line failed in exile, and the \"Mac Shane\" line legally inherited the chiefship and title.<ref>Micheline Kearney Walsh (1988). \"The Last Earls of Tyrone in Spain\".

Patrick Woulfe, 1923</ref> or Johnson.  A good example is Major General [[Sir William Johnson]], Bt.  His father had been born a McShane but translated his name, allowing his son to succeed to his uncles properties.  By the early-19th century most of the official documents fail to show any McShane families in their former territory as all of them had converted to the surname Johnson.  However, by the 20th century, many of the Irish branches were returning to the Gaelic name. Today the clan recognizes McShane, Johnson, Johnston, and Shane as elements of the family and are still active and viable in Ulster, America, and Australia. The family leadership today is directly descended from Shane's son Conn, to his son [[Hugh McShane O'Neill]] and is closely involved in the greater O'Neill clan activities and their present chief takes part in the Association of O'Neill Clans and is on the O'Neill family council.\n\nMost recently, DNA tests and research have proven the linkage between the MacShanes and the O'Neills of Tyrone.  In a study begun in 2002, Patrick Guinness funded Trinity College, Dublin to conduct a DNA study on the O'Neil's of Ulster, to include the MacShane family.  The results were published by Ed O'Neill and the late John McLaughlin that showed the McShanes were 100% match of a unique DNA sequence that is specific to the Chiefly line of the Tyrone O'Neills.  It is estimated by Trinity College that the specific gene 'break' with the rest of the O'Neills of Ulster was either Aedh Macaomh Toinleasg O'Neill, King of Cenel Eoghain from 1176 to 1177, or his father, Muircheartach Muighe Line O'Neill.{{fact|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Caribbean O'Neills ==\nMany [[O'Neill (surname)|O'Neills]] moved to the Caribbean, especially from the lines of the [[Count of Tyrone|Counts of Tyrone]] of Hugh MacFerdorcha Aodh M\u00f3r mac Feardorcha \u00d3 N\u00e9ill. Their close connection to the Spanish government after the final fall of the O'Neills in 1690 provided the opportunity for new territory. Family documents {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} that the O'Neill's had elements land on the Islands and were associated with the families of Rocco, Eammon, Constatino or Conn [[Eoghan]], Edmundo, and Gill \u2013 all men who served in the [[Ultonia regiment|Ultonia]] and Hibernia regiments for the [[Monarchy of Spain|Crown of Spain]]. Recent findings show that other O'Neill's settled in [[Puerto Rico]] in the 18th century. The earliest record, based on documents from the Spanish royal courts, show that Don Juan O'Neill arrived in Puerto Rico in the 1710s.  Two O'Neill officers served in the Spanish Army forces of Bernardo de Galvez fighting the English in Florida and Alabama during the American Revolution.\n\nTulio and Enrique O'Neill y O'Kelly, of the [[#O'Neills of the Fews|O'Neills of the Fews]], became residents of [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]] in the 1770s in the footsteps of a deceased uncle. Tulio's sons, Arturo and Tulio O'Neill y O'Keefe, were granted land in Puerto Rico in 1804. Arturo moved his family there in March 1810 and his descendants continue to reside there today as well as in Spain and the USA.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Mark|title=The O'Neills of the Fews: their origin, descendants and DNA profile: I|journal=The Irish Genealogist|date=2015|volume=14|issue=2|pages=179\u2013189}}</ref>\n\nMost O'Neill families of [[Puerto Rico]] have for many generations resided in the districts of Hato Nuevo, Mamey, and Sonadora of the city of Guaynabo on the northern coast of the island of Puerto Rico. Other O'Neill families have settled in the cities of R\u00edo Piedras and Caguas. Many other O'Neill families that moved from [[Barbados]] settled on the Island of [[Vieques]]. The O'Neills have been mayors of their cities.\n\nThe O'Neills of [[Martinique]] settled in the early 1700s; in the next century, they claimed to be [[Count of Tyrone]] and lineally descended from Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. This claim (which rested on a single-sentence document in their own possession) is currently regarded as unproven.<ref>[[Complete Peerage]], Vol. XII, Part II, Appendix C, supp. p. 13, note (h); [[Peter Berresford Ellis]], ''Erin's Blood Royal: the royal Gaelic dynasties of Ireland'', London, 1999, p. 241</ref> The main stem of this family is now extinct in the male line; collateral descendants may exist.\n\n==Today==\nToday the ancient O'Neills flourish in Ireland, Europe, and the New World.  Clan organizations and meetings are held regularly, and the family organization is recognized by every possible Irish historical governing body.  The O'Neill's are represented, and are the current Presidents of, the [[Standing Council of Irish Chiefs and Chieftains]].  They are members of the Clans of Ireland, and hold status with the Councils of each County in Ulster.  And before the Irish Republic's government stopped recognizing Chiefs, they were one of the original chiefly families recognized in 1945 by the Chief Herald of Ireland.  They still maintain good relations with the government in Dublin and have hosted the President in Ulster twice.  Most recently the Parliament in Dublin reversed the legal attainments against O'Neill chiefs dating back to 1569.\n\nThree of the ancient [[O'Neill (surname)|O'Neill]] [[dynasty|dynasties]] or [[principality|principalities]], are still represented by direct descendants of the once independent kings, the O'Neills of Clannaboy, the Fews, and the McShane O'Neills of Tyrone. The chiefships pass under the elective [[derbfine]] system of [[Early Irish law|Irish Brehon law]], but many incumbents were also granted further titles that are inherited under [[primogeniture]] by various Roman Catholic kingdoms in Europe and by the British crown who today possess and use titles in Ireland, Spain, France, Scotland, Portugal, England, Australia, South Africa and the Americas. Further, O'Neills hold five existing House of Lords Peerages in Ulster, Scotland, and England, and even married into the Swedish Royal family in 2010, represented by Christopher O'Neill and his children, HRH Leonore, Duchess of Gotland, and HRH Prince Nicolas of Sweden, [[Duke of \u00c5ngermanland]].\n\nOverseas branches flourish, such as in South Africa where descendants are referred to as Nel's, mainly due to the influence of the Afrikaner people of the country. The family maintains a loose confederation with its sept princes and chiefs centered in Ireland, meeting annually.  This Chief's group met in 2007 to commemorate and retrace the [[Flight of the Earls]], in 2010 outside Paris to announce a new, global clan organization that has the goal of constructing an O'Neill museum in Ulster as a central repository for all the family artifacts spread across the world. In 2013 they established a historical relationship with the Priory at Benburb, they met in 2015 to promote the O'Neill Summer School from Shane's Castle, in 2016 in Rome to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the death of the 2nd Earl, Hugh O'Neill, and in October 2017 they established a library and museum at the Priory in Benburb, presenting a historical writings collection previously in private hands out of Ireland for centuries.<ref>https://www.servitelibrary.org/libraryandmuseum</ref>\n\n[[Geneticists]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] suggested in 2006 that Niall of the Nine Hostages may have been the most [[Fecundity|fecund]] male in Irish history. Of their Irish sample, the geneticists found that 21 percent of men from north-western Ireland, 8 percent from all of Ireland, a substantial percentage of men from western and central Scotland, and about 2 percent of men from New York bore the same [[Y-chromosome]] [[haplotype]]. The geneticists estimated that about 2&ndash;3 million men bear this haplotype. Moore et al. concluded that these men descend from \"a single early-medieval progenitor\" and proposed that this could be Niall.<ref>{{Citation|last=Wade |first=Nicholas |date=18 January 2006 |title=If Irish Claim Nobility, Science May Approve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/18/science/18irish.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |postscript= }}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Moore |first1=LT |last2=McEvoy |first2=B |last3=Cape |first3=E |last4=Simms |first4=K |last5=Bradley1 |first5=DG |year=2006 |title=A Y-Chromosome Signature of Hegemony in Gaelic Ireland |pmc=1380239 |volume= 78|journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |pages=334&ndash;338 |postscript= |pmid=16358217 |doi=10.1086/500055}} Accessed via [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]].</ref> According to the PBS documentary series ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Colin Quinn]], [[Bill Maher]], and the show's host, [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]] all display STR markers consistent with the Irish Modal Haplotype.<ref>Finding your Roots PBS January 12, 2016</ref>\n\n==Coats of arms==\nIt is a common misconception that there is one [[coat of arms]] associated to everyone of a common surname, when, in fact, a coat of arms is property passed through direct lineage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Faq.htm |title=College of Arms FAQ |publisher=College-of-arms.gov.uk |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref>  This means that there are numerous families of O'Neill under various spellings that are related, but because they are not the direct descendants of an O'Neill that owned an armorial device do not have rights or claims to any arms themselves.\n\nThe coat of arms of the O'Neills of Ulster, the branch that held the title of High Kings of Ireland, were white with a red left hand (latterly, the [[Red Hand of Ulster]]), and it is because of this prominence that the red hand (though a right hand is used today, rather than the left used by the high kings) has also become a symbol of Ireland, Ulster, Tyrone and other places associated with the family of O'Neills. The red hand by itself has become a symbol of the O'Neill name, such that when other O'Neill family branches were granted or assumed a heraldic achievement, this red hand was often incorporated into the new coat of arms in some way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.araltas.com/features/oneill/ |title=About the name O'Neill |publisher=Araltas.com |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe red hand is explained by several legends, with a common theme but of a promise of land to the first man to sail or swim across the sea and touch the shores of Ireland. Many contenders arrive, including a man named O'Neill, who begins to fall behind the others. O'Neill cuts off his left hand and throws it onto the beach before the other challengers can reach the shore, becoming the first to touch land and win all of Ireland as his prize. These legends seem to originate (or to have been written down) in the 17th century, centuries after the red hand device was first used by O'Neill families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O70-UNill.html |title=U\u00ed N\u00e9ill |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref>\n==Anradh\u00e1n kindred of Scotland/Scottish and Irish Clans related to U\u00ed Neill Dynasty==\n\nSeveral Scottish families may descend from an O'Neill dynast named Anradh\u00e1n.

Some archaeologists describe this range of time as the \"Incipient Jeulmun period\" and suggest that the Gosan-ni pottery dates to 10,000 BP.<ref name=\"Choe and Bale 2002\"/><ref>Im, Hyo-jae 1995. The New Archaeological Data Concerned with the Cultural Relationship between Korea and Japan in the Neolithic Age. ''Korea Journal'' 35 (3):31-40.</ref> Samples of the pottery were radiocarbon dated, and although one result is consistent with the argument that pottery emerged at very early date (i.e. 10,180\u00b165 BP [AA-38105]), other dates are somewhat later.<ref>Kuzmin, Yaroslav V. 2006. Chronology of the Earliest Pottery in East Asia: Progress and Pitfalls. ''Antiquity'' 80:362\u2013371.</ref> If the earlier dating holds true, Yunggimun pottery from Gosan-ni would be, along with central and southern China, the [[Japanese Archipelago]], and the [[Russian Far East]], among a group of the oldest known [[pottery]] in world [[prehistory]]. Kuzmin suggests that more [[absolute dating]] is needed to gain a better perspective on this notion.<ref>Kuzmin 2006:368</ref>\n\n==Early Jeulmun==\nThe Early Jeulmun period (c. 6000-3500 BC) is characterized by deep-sea fishing, hunting, and small semi-permanent settlements with [[pit-house]]s. Examples of Early Jeulmun settlements include Seopohang, [[Amsa-dong]], and Osan-ri.<ref>Im, Hyo-jae 2000. ''Hanguk Sinseokgi Munhwa'' [Neolithic Culture in Korea]. Jibmundang, Seoul.</ref> Radiocarbon evidence from coastal shellmidden sites such as [[Ulsan]] Sejuk-ri, [[Dongsam-dong Shell Midden|Dongsam-dong]], and Ga-do Island indicates that shellfish were exploited, but many archaeologists maintain that shellmiddens (or [[shellmound]] sites) did not appear until the latter Early Jeulmun.<ref name=\"Lee 2001\"/>\n\n==Middle Jeulmun==\nChoe and Bale estimate that at least 14 Middle Jeulmun period (c. 3500-2000 BC) sites have yielded evidence of cultivation in the form of carbonized plant remains and agricultural stone tools.<ref>Choe and Bale 2002:110</ref> For example, Crawford and Lee, using [[Mass spectrometry|AMS]] dating techniques, directly dated a domesticated [[foxtail millet]] (''Setaria italica'' ssp. ''italica'') seed from the Dongsam-dong Shellmidden site to the Middle Jeulmun.<ref>Crawford and Lee 2003:89</ref> Another example of Middle Jeulmun cultivation is found at Jitam-ri (Chitam-ni) in [[North Korea]]. A pit-house at Jitam-ri yielded several hundred grams of some carbonized cultigen that North Korean archaeologists state is [[millet]].<ref>To, Yu-ho and Ki-dok Hwang 1961.''Chitam-ni Wonshi Yuchok Palgul Pogo'' [Excavation Report of the Chitam-ni Prehistoric Site]. Kwahakwon Ch'ulpan'sa, Pyeongyang.</ref><ref>see also Im 2000:149</ref> However, not all archaeologists accept the grains as [[domesticated]] millet because it was gathered out of context in an unsystematic way, only black-and-white photos of the find exist, and the original description is in [[Korean language|Korean]] only.\n\nCultivation was likely a supplement to a subsistence regime that continued to heavily emphasize deep-sea fishing, shellfish gathering, and hunting. \"Classic Jeulmun\" or ''Bitsalmunui'' pottery ([[Hangul]]: \ube57\uc0b4\ubb34\ub2ac\ud1a0\uae30) in which comb-patterning, cord-wrapping, and other decorations extend across the entire outer surface of the vessel, appeared at the end of the Early Jeulmun and is found in West-central and South-coastal Korea in the Middle Jeulmun.\n\n==Late Jeulmun==\nThe [[subsistence pattern]] of the Late Jeulmun period (c. 2000-1500 BC) is associated with a de-emphasis on exploitation of shellfish, and the settlement pattern registered the appearance of interior settlements such as Sangchon-ri (see [[Daepyeong]]) and Imbul-ri. Lee suggests that environmental stress on shellfish populations and the movement of people into the interior prompted groups to become more reliant on cultivated plants in their diets.<ref>Lee 2001:323; 2006</ref> The subsistence system of the interior settlements was probably not unlike that of the incipient Early [[Mumun pottery period]] (c. 1500-1250 BC), when small-scale [[shifting cultivation]] (\"slash-and-burn\") was practiced in addition to a variety of other subsistence strategies. The Late Jeulmun is roughly contemporaneous with [[Lower Xiajiadian culture]] in [[Liaoning]], [[China]]. Archaeologists have suggested that [[Bangudae Petroglyphs|Bangudae]] and Cheonjeon-ri, a substantial group of petroglyph panels in Ulsan, may date to this sub-period, but this is the subject of some debate.\n\nKim Jangsuk suggests that the hunter-gatherer-cultivators of the Late Jeulmun were gradually displaced from their \"resource patches\" by a new group with superior slash-and-burn cultivation technology and who migrated south with ''Mumun'' or undecorated (Hangeul:  \ubb34\ubb38\ud1a0\uae30; Hanja: \u7121\u6587\u571f\u5668) pottery. Kim explains that the pattern of land use practiced by the Mumun pottery users, the dividing up of land into sets of slash-and-burn fields, eventually encroached on and cut off parts of hunting grounds used by Jeulmun pottery users.<ref>Kim, Jangsuk 2003.

Kuzmin suggests that more [[absolute dating]] is needed to gain a better perspective on this notion.<ref>Kuzmin 2006:368</ref>\n\n==Early Jeulmun==\nThe Early Jeulmun period (c. 6000-3500 BC) is characterized by deep-sea fishing, hunting, and small semi-permanent settlements with [[pit-house]]s. Examples of Early Jeulmun settlements include Seopohang, [[Amsa-dong]], and Osan-ri.<ref>Im, Hyo-jae 2000. ''Hanguk Sinseokgi Munhwa'' [Neolithic Culture in Korea]. Jibmundang, Seoul.</ref> Radiocarbon evidence from coastal shellmidden sites such as [[Ulsan]] Sejuk-ri, [[Dongsam-dong Shell Midden|Dongsam-dong]], and Ga-do Island indicates that shellfish were exploited, but many archaeologists maintain that shellmiddens (or [[shellmound]] sites) did not appear until the latter Early Jeulmun.<ref name=\"Lee 2001\"/>\n\n==Middle Jeulmun==\nChoe and Bale estimate that at least 14 Middle Jeulmun period (c. 3500-2000 BC) sites have yielded evidence of cultivation in the form of carbonized plant remains and agricultural stone tools.<ref>Choe and Bale 2002:110</ref> For example, Crawford and Lee, using [[Mass spectrometry|AMS]] dating techniques, directly dated a domesticated [[foxtail millet]] (''Setaria italica'' ssp. ''italica'') seed from the Dongsam-dong Shellmidden site to the Middle Jeulmun.<ref>Crawford and Lee 2003:89</ref> Another example of Middle Jeulmun cultivation is found at Jitam-ri (Chitam-ni) in [[North Korea]]. A pit-house at Jitam-ri yielded several hundred grams of some carbonized cultigen that North Korean archaeologists state is [[millet]].<ref>To, Yu-ho and Ki-dok Hwang 1961.''Chitam-ni Wonshi Yuchok Palgul Pogo'' [Excavation Report of the Chitam-ni Prehistoric Site]. Kwahakwon Ch'ulpan'sa, Pyeongyang.</ref><ref>see also Im 2000:149</ref> However, not all archaeologists accept the grains as [[domesticated]] millet because it was gathered out of context in an unsystematic way, only black-and-white photos of the find exist, and the original description is in [[Korean language|Korean]] only.\n\nCultivation was likely a supplement to a subsistence regime that continued to heavily emphasize deep-sea fishing, shellfish gathering, and hunting. \"Classic Jeulmun\" or ''Bitsalmunui'' pottery ([[Hangul]]: \ube57\uc0b4\ubb34\ub2ac\ud1a0\uae30) in which comb-patterning, cord-wrapping, and other decorations extend across the entire outer surface of the vessel, appeared at the end of the Early Jeulmun and is found in West-central and South-coastal Korea in the Middle Jeulmun.\n\n==Late Jeulmun==\nThe [[subsistence pattern]] of the Late Jeulmun period (c. 2000-1500 BC) is associated with a de-emphasis on exploitation of shellfish, and the settlement pattern registered the appearance of interior settlements such as Sangchon-ri (see [[Daepyeong]]) and Imbul-ri. Lee suggests that environmental stress on shellfish populations and the movement of people into the interior prompted groups to become more reliant on cultivated plants in their diets.<ref>Lee 2001:323; 2006</ref> The subsistence system of the interior settlements was probably not unlike that of the incipient Early [[Mumun pottery period]] (c. 1500-1250 BC), when small-scale [[shifting cultivation]] (\"slash-and-burn\") was practiced in addition to a variety of other subsistence strategies. The Late Jeulmun is roughly contemporaneous with [[Lower Xiajiadian culture]] in [[Liaoning]], [[China]]. Archaeologists have suggested that [[Bangudae Petroglyphs|Bangudae]] and Cheonjeon-ri, a substantial group of petroglyph panels in Ulsan, may date to this sub-period, but this is the subject of some debate.\n\nKim Jangsuk suggests that the hunter-gatherer-cultivators of the Late Jeulmun were gradually displaced from their \"resource patches\" by a new group with superior slash-and-burn cultivation technology and who migrated south with ''Mumun'' or undecorated (Hangeul:  \ubb34\ubb38\ud1a0\uae30; Hanja: \u7121\u6587\u571f\u5668) pottery. Kim explains that the pattern of land use practiced by the Mumun pottery users, the dividing up of land into sets of slash-and-burn fields, eventually encroached on and cut off parts of hunting grounds used by Jeulmun pottery users.<ref>Kim, Jangsuk 2003.

It was created by [[Robert Arthur Jr.]], who believed involving a famous person such as movie director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] would attract attention. [[Random House]], which is owned by [[Bertelsmann]], is the U.S. publisher and still has some of the rights to the books. Other rights are possessed by the heirs of Robert Arthur, Jr. and the German publisher [[Kosmos (publisher)|Kosmos]]. The characters known as the \"Three Investigators\" are three boys named Jupiter Jones, Peter Crenshaw and Bob Andrews.\n\nMost of the [[Mystery fiction|mysteries]] involved investigation of baffling phenomena (e.g., an ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy]] that apparently whispered and a human skull that seemed to talk).\n\n==Original editions==\n{{main|The American series of The Three Investigators}}\n\nThe original series was published from 1964 to 1987 and comprised 43 finished books, one unfinished story (''The Mystery of the Ghost Train'') and four ''Find Your Fate'' books. Between 1989 and 1990 [[Random House]] published the Three Investigators Crimebusters series.\n\nBooks number 1 to 9 and 11 were written by the creator, [[Robert Arthur Jr.|Robert Arthur]], who also specified ideas for a few of the other stories. Arthur had been an [[editing|editor]] for several [[book]] [[Anthology|collections]] attributed to Alfred Hitchcock. The other [[author]]s were [[Michael Collins (American author)|William Arden]] ([[Michael Collins (American author)|Dennis Lynds]]), [[Nick West (author)|Nick West]] (Kin Platt), [[Mary Virginia Carey]] and [[Marc Brandel]] (born Marcus Beresford). All of the authors wrote their own [[Foreword|introductions]] and [[epilogue]]s, which were dictated purportedly by Hitchcock and later in the series a fictional writer, Hector Sebastian, who supposedly recorded the adventures of the Three Investigators from their words. The illustrators in the series began with [[Harry Kane (illustrator)|Harry Kane]] and Ed Vebell and include Jack Hearne, Herb Mott, Stephen Marchesi, Robert Adragna and William A. (\"Bill\") Dodge.\n\nFor the original series, the specific ages of the investigators were never revealed, but contextual information indicates that they were likely 13 or 14 years old. They were not old enough to drive a car legally, but were said to be just a few years younger than their nemesis Skinny Norris, who had a driver's license from a state where the required age for a license was younger. On one occasion it was mentioned that Pete was part of the high-school [[wrestling]] team. In the later Crimebusters series, it was stated once that the Three Investigators team was initiated when the boys were 13.\n\nThe investigators were typically introduced to a [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] by a [[wikt:client|client]] or by finding something unusual accidentally in the [[scrapyard]] of Jupiter's Uncle Titus Jones and Aunt Mathilda, who had a salvage business. The boys encountered baffling, sometimes misleading clues and danger before finally solving the mystery. The series had one major theme: however strange, mystical, or even [[supernatural]] a particular phenomenon may seem at first, it is capable of being traced to human agency with the determined application of [[reason]] and [[logic]]. This theme was compromised on four occasions by Carey: in ''[[The Mystery of Monster Mountain]]'', the boys encounter [[Bigfoot]]; in ''[[The Invisible Dog]]'', she canonizes [[astral projection]] and dangles the possibility of a \"phantom priest\"; in ''[[The Mystery of the Scar-Faced Beggar]]'', a woman has genuine prophetic dreams; and in the final book of the original run, ''[[The Mystery of the Cranky Collector]]'', a young woman's ghost returns to haunt her former employer's mansion.\n\nMost mysteries were solved by Jupiter Jones, a supreme logician who implicitly used the [[Occam's Razor]] principle: that the simplest and most rational explanation should be preferred to an explanation which requires additional assumptions. The boys were able to solve their mysteries with relatively few resources: they generally had little more than a telephone, bicycles, access to a library and\u2014with reference to the Hollywood setting of the series\u2014a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce (which Jupiter wins the use of in the first book).\n\nIn the first book, ''[[The Secret of Terror Castle]]'', Jupiter bluffs his way into the office of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and makes a deal with him that if the Investigators can find him a haunted house to use as a location for his next movie, Hitchcock will introduce the story of their adventures.  Hitchcock agrees, not expecting them to succeed; but at the end of the book is impressed with the boys' investigation and not only introduces the book, but also refers several other future clients to them in subsequent novels.  The last chapter of each book was usually an epilogue in which the investigators sat with Alfred Hitchcock (and later, \"Hector Sebastian\"), reviewing the mystery and revealing the [[deductive reasoning|deductions]] through the clues discussed earlier in the book.\n\nIn 1989, [[Random House]] revamped the series, naming it ''The 3 Investigators\u2014Crimebusters Series''. The investigators were now 17 years old, could drive cars and were much more independent. The stories continued to include an abundance of detecting, but with the addition of more [[Action (fiction)|action]]. The series was well-received, but was halted during 1990, when legal disagreements between Random House and the heirs of the Arthur estate could not be resolved. By 2005, the disagreements were still not settled.\n\nThe fourth book, \"[[The Mystery of the Green Ghost]]\" was copyrighted by Random House, Inc. in 1965, first printing in September, 1971.\n\nAt least eleven novels were published in the ''CrimeBusters'' series, which was initiated by one of the series' authors, William Arden, [[pseudonym]] of Dennis Lynds, who wrote the Dan Fortune mystery series for adults by the pseudonym [[Michael Collins (American author)|Michael Collins]]. The other authors were: [[H. William Stine]] and wife [[Megan Stine]], [[G.H. Stone]] ([[Gayle Lynds]]), [[William MacCay]], [[Marc Brandel]] and [[Peter Lerangis]]. Random House has reprinted several of the original books as two [[paperback]] reprint series, partly to assure their legal rights.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1990, [[Random House]] published a total of 56 books. After the discontinuation of the series in 1990, a German author team began writing new books under the commission of the [[Franckh-Kosmos Verlags-GmbH & Co.|Franckh Kosmos]] publishing house in 1993. In 2011, three previously unpublished novels by the US authors Peter Lerangis, Megan and H. William Stine and G. H. Stone were published in Germany.\n\n==Series background==\n===Characters===\n\nThe Three Investigators are a junior detective team that initially came together because of a mental exercise club. They live in Rocky Beach, a fictional coastal town between [[Los Angeles]] and [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. In some of their cases, the boys are supported by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], the chauffeur Worthington, and the police inspectors Reynolds and Cotta.\n\u201cWe Investigate Anything\u201d is The Three Investigators' trademark slogan on their business card. Most often, Jupiter is the one to hand over the card in a fitting moment to see the clients\u2019 reactions to the three question marks. Often, that reaction is a joke, with the clients asking whether the question marks mean the investigators doubt their own abilities. Jupiter usually retorts something like: \u201cThat's our symbol. [...] The question marks stand for mysteries unsolved, riddles unanswered, puzzles of any kind. So we use it as our trademark. We investigate any kind of mystery.\u201d<ref>The Mystery of the Talking Skull (1969, by Robert Arthur)</ref>\n\nTo prove themselves, The Three Investigators usually have a lot of persuading to do in the beginning, as the clients often mistrust their abilities because the investigators are so young.\n\nIn their first cases, The Three Investigators also provide, apart from their business card, a letter of recommendation from the Police Department of Rocky Beach signed by Chief Inspector Samuel Reynolds. It says: \"The holder of this badge is a junior volunteer assistant to the Police Department of Rocky Beach. The authority advocates any support from third parties.\"\n\n====The Three Investigators====\n'''Jupiter \"Jupe\" Jones''', First Investigator\u2014A former [[child actor]] named \"Baby Fatso\", although he hates it when people mention this.  Jupiter is intelligent and stocky, and has a remarkable [[memory]] and deductive skills. Jupiter's parents (professional [[ballroom dancer]]s) died in a car crash when he was four years old. Although \u201cAn Ear for Danger\u201d mentions the car accident as their cause of death, in the episode \u201c...&nbsp;das leere Grab\u201d (German only), they are said to have disappeared following a plane crash. He now lives with his uncle, Titus Jones and Aunt Mathilda, who manage a scrapyard.\n\nJupiter's past acting ability benefits him frequently in mysteries because he can act older than he is, perform imitations of people when necessary and act less intelligent to extract information from potential suspects.\n\nJupiter is a prolific reader and inventor and frequently invents a device that simplifies solving a mystery. Jupiter has a knack for usually thinking about clues correctly to solve an otherwise unsolvable mystery. He also likes to play pranks on the other two investigators.  Because of his intellectual side, Jupe is adept at using big words and frequently uses them to his advantage, particularly to seem older, annoy Pete, and startle adults.  Jupe hates to dismiss an unsolved mystery, which frequently means that he drags Bob and Pete along for the ride.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://3investigators.homestead.com/files/t3ihome.htm|title=T3I Readers' Site|website=3investigators.homestead.com|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref>\n\n'''Peter \"Pete\" Crenshaw''', Second Investigator\u2014Pete is an athletic youth who dislikes dangerous situations, but is nonetheless reliable as the \"action member\" of the team. Pete loves and cares for animals, and is fond of uttering the exclamation \"Gleeps!\". His father works as a film technician for [[special effects]] in [[Hollywood]]\n\nPete is a frequent companion of Jupiter on stake-outs and other field trips, particularly in the earlier mysteries, when Bob is unavailable.  While he may not have the intellectual ability of Jupiter, Pete is nonetheless considered as an equal in the stories and is able to point out Jupiter's own shortcomings (usually in a comical fashion). He is also capable of making deductions and sometimes serves as the clue-bearer instead of Bob. He has an excellent sense of direction, as in ''The Mystery of the Stuttering Parrot''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n'''Robert \"Bob\" Andrews''', Records and Research\u2014Bob is studious and meticulous, and wears glasses. Depending on the case, Bob's father is a [[Sports journalism|sportswriter]], [[business journalist]], or [[Political journalism|political journalist]], and occasionally helps The Three Investigators in some of their cases.\n\nEarly in the series, Bob is hampered physically by a leg brace he wore, due to multiple fractures inflicted when he rolled down a hill. This handicap relegated him to a more studious and less physical involvement. Bob works part-time in the local [[library]], suiting his role as data collector. Bob also serves as the clue-bearer for many of the adventures, because of his research at the library.  Bob's leg brace is removed between the end of ''Whispering Mummy'' and the beginning of ''Green Ghost''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Headquarters===\n\nThe office of the Three Investigators is a house trailer, hidden among the piles of scrap at the edge of Uncle Titus' scrapyard. The house trailer has multiple secret exits, a small lab, a [[darkroom]], and an office with a phone, typewriter, and [[reference works]]. Many other utensils, such as a [[tape recorder]] or a [[periscope]], were built by Jupiter who used spare parts found in the scrapyard.\n\n==Copyright dispute==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Initial position===\n\nThe series was invented by the American writer Robert Arthur in the US in 1964. Arthur sold the international exploitation rights to the publishing house [[Random House]]. However, the copyright remained with him. The contract included the rights to publish books, films, comics and mechanical [[sound reproduction]]. Since there was no significant audio book market at that time, it is legally not clearly determinable and therefore doubtful whether this \"mechanical sound reproduction\" describes the medium of audio books or radio plays as they exist now. The [[Kosmos (publisher)|Franckh-Kosmos]] publisher of Random House acquired the German-speaking exploitation rights in 1968. The label [[Europa (record label)|EUROPA]] received the rights to the audio version of the series as part of the sublicense partners of the Kosmos Verlag.\n\nAfter Robert Arthur's death in 1969, the copyrights were given to the [[University of Michigan]]. In his [[testimony]], Arthur declared that \"all rights, legal titles and stakes, [he] owned by the time of [his] death, concerning all published books, short stories, plays or unpublished manuscripts, including all issued copyright claims, just as all rights for license fees and subsidiary rights, as it is specified in his contracts with publishers\" were to be given to the University of Michigan. This is said to mainly be for fiscal reasons because legacies given to education establishments avoid inheritance taxes.\n\nSince then Random House had been paying [[Royalty payment|royalties]] to the university, but they stopped doing so as of 1992, because it was not clear whether the University of Michigan still had a legal entitlement. The [[American copyright law]] said that literature, which received a copyright before 1977, had a safeguard clause, which made sure that all licenses automatically returned to the author or his heirs after 28 years. As a result of that, Random House and Arthur's heirs, his children Elizabeth Ann Arthur and Robert Andrew Arthur, signed a contract for the rights of use of the volumes of Arthur and the further usage of the characters, under the condition that the 10 books were to be brought back onto the American market.\n\nAfter the series was discontinued in the US in 1991, Kosmos Verlag sought the rights to continue the series in Germany with German authors, and in 1994 signed a corresponding contract with Random House without the consent of Arthur's heirs.\n\nIn 2002, Random House returned the rights of the ten volumes to Robert Arthur's heirs after the publisher failed to comply with the agreed republications of the works. In 1999, however, Kosmos-Verlag had already registered the word mark {{ill|\"Die Drei ???\"|de|Die drei %3F%3F%3F|vertical-align=sup}} throughout Germany and by 2003 throughout Europe as well as a European trademark for audio carriers and printed products.\n\nNegotiations between Kosmos Verlag and the heirs on a new usage rights agreement failed because Kosmos relied on its trademark registration and ongoing agreements with Random House. Furthermore, Kosmos doubted that Arthur's heirs were the right holders since according to Arthur's will, all rights were to be transferred to the University of Michigan. At the end of 2004, Random House and Kosmos signed an extensive agreement to transfer all rights to the other American novels not written by Arthur to Kosmos Verlag.\n\n===Lawsuit===\n\nDue to the unclear legal situation, EUROPA decided at the beginning of 2005 not to publish any further episodes based on the book templates of Kosmos Verlag and discontinued the license payments to Kosmos. At that time the books \u201cSpur ins Nichts\u201d and \u201c...und der Geisterzug\u201d (both German only) had already been recorded as an radio play.\n\nIn 2006, the parent company of the European label [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (formerly Sony BMG) finally gained all the German rights on Arthur's creations and the use of the original characters and showplaces independently from Kosmos publishing house of Robert Arthur's successors. The contract contained the right to order new books in German, as well as the right to evaluate the sound storage medium. Moreover, all were transferred: from \"[...] interests [of Arthur's children] in all German audio recordings, bound books, pocketbooks, theatrical performances and electronic film recordings of theatrical performances to all existing derived products in Sony BMG\". EUROPA developed a new audio book named \"{{ill|DiE DR3i|de|DiE DR3i|vertical-align=sup}}\" based on it. Indeed, EUROPA avoided the use of the name \"Die Drei ???\" and also the name created by Kosmos because of the protection of the brand. Instead of that only characters and names which were based on Arthur's ideas were used (characters\u2019 original names).\n\nThe Kosmos publishing house continued its series of books under well-known titles and with famous character's names. The society filed a lawsuit against the Kosmos publishing house because Sony BMG itself saw its exploitation rights violated. A provisional disposal was obtained against the sale of two novels \u201cSpuk im Netz\u201d and \u201cDer Fluch des Drachen\u201d (both German only).\n\nBecause of this, the two books had to be taken off the market retroactively. This verdict was overturned by the [[Oberlandesgericht|Higher Regional Court]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on May 13, 2007. The judges were unable to identify Robert Arthur's children as the rightful owners of the copyright law. They found that the University of Michigan rightfully inherited the works of Robert Arthur and his characters, meaning that his heirs could not have transferred the rights to Sony BMG. A due date was set for the complainant of Sony BMG to submit the new chain-of-title as well as the new contracts as they were available to her. Eventually, Kosmos and Sony BMG announced they would negotiate again to come to an extrajudicial agreement, causing the delivery of Episode 7 of \"DiE DR3i\" to be delayed. The final release date of Episodes 7 and 8 was 30 November 2007.\n\n===Outcome===\n\nOn February 13, 2008, Sony BMG announced that they had come to an agreement with Kosmos, predating a joint press release on the following day. The rights to the books as well as the brand name, which were the foundation for the audio dramas remained with Kosmos as well as all other publishing products, including calendars, non-fiction literature, mobile and computer games, science kits and board games.\n\nThe rights to use audio material with the inclusion of the entire catalog as well as stage shows, plays and the commercialization of merchandise remain with the record label Europa.\n\nSince 4 April 2008, new German editions under the name \u201cDie Drei ???\u201d have been published, based on the books published by Kosmos. The rights to continue the hugely successful audio plays \u201c{{ill|Die Drei ??? Kids|de|Die drei %3F%3F%3F Kids|vertical-align=sup}}\u201d was transferred to Europa as well. The already published audio play episodes were sold by the previous license holder USM until late 2008. Furthermore, a withdrawal of the series \"DiE DR3i\" from sale until 1 January 2009 was agreed upon.\n\nSince 1999, the spin-off series \u201cDie Drei ??? Kids\u201d, issued by publisher Kosmos, has been supposed to target a much younger audience. The contents of the stories were thus tailored to be more suitable for children and to be less complex. Besides, with an age of only ten years, the young detectives are considerably younger than in the current episodes of the original series.\n\n==International and foreign-language editions==\n\n===Bangladesh===\n{{main|Tin Goyenda}}\n\nThe Three Investigators has also been published in Bangladesh by [[Sheba Prokashoni]] as ''[[Tin Goyenda]]'' (translated by Rakib Hasan) since the 1980s and appealed to many young Bangladeshi readers until 2000s. In the Bengali editions, Jupiter Jones is known as Kishor Pasha (a Bangladeshi American). The other two are named as Musa Aman (African American) and Robin Milford (Irish American). Other characters include Gina and her pet dog Rafian, the chauffeur Hanson, Bavarian brothers Boris and Rover, and movie director Davis Christopher (in place of Alfred Hitchcock). The character \"Skinny Norris\" appears as \"Shutki Terry\" and the famous French thief appears as \"Shopa\". The character Victor Simon in the Bangladeshi edition appears in the place of \"Hector Sebastian\". The stories are generally set in Rocky Beach, California, although the investigators travel to exotic places like Africa and Bangladesh on occasions. The stories that had Gina and her pet dog Rafian, those were actually a Bangla adaptation from ''[[The Famous Five (novel series)|The Famous Five]]'' by [[Enid Blyton]]. The name Gina is a short form of 'Georgina' which was the same name used in ''The Famous Five''. She also owns a pet dog in ''The Famous Five'' series, named Timmy. Nearly 125 books have been published by now.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Denmark===\nIn Denmark, 13 books were published from 1966\u201370 by ''Hasselbalch'' under the title \"''Alfred Hitchcock og De tre Detektiver''\" <ref>[http://danskforfatterleksikon.dk/1850tit/0128/sknr128997.htm] retrieved Oct 23rd, 2018</ref>\n\n===France===\nIn France, the original nine books were published during the 1970s by the ''Biblioth\u00e8que Verte'' collection of books for young readers under the title \"''Les Trois Jeunes D\u00e9tectives''\" (\"The Three young detectives\").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the series continued. As a whole, 37 volumes (including four of the Crimebusters series) has been published.\n\n===Germany===\n{{main|German editions of the Three Investigators}}\n\nThe Three Investigators books have always been very popular in [[Germany]]. They are known there as ''Die drei ???'' (''Die drei Fragezeichen'', meaning \"The Three Question Marks\"). Jupiter Jones was renamed as \"Justus Jonas\", a German adaption of his original name, while Pete Crenshaw is named \"Peter Shaw\". Bob Andrews retained his original name. The chauffeur's name is Morton.\n\nIn 1964 the [[Random House]] publishing company and the [[Kosmos (publisher)|Kosmos]] publishing company started to publish the translated 43 original books. In 1979 the German publisher Europa started a radio drama based on those original 43 books. In 1993 Kosmos started to publish new written books by German authors which were and still are continued as radio dramas in Germany. All in all, this would result in a canon of over 200 books (6 books per year, 3 during spring and 3 during autumn) and 201 radio dramas published as of December 2018. Because of a litigation between Europa and Kosmos which disallowed the use of the names Europa used, they published a 9 episode radio drama named \"DiE Dr3i\" between 2006 and 2007. \"DiE Dr3i\" were mostly identical to \"Die Drei ???\" and they also used the same German voice-actors, but they had to change the names of the characters to the original English names. \"DiE Dr3i\" were stopped when the litigation ended and \"Die drei ???\" started again.\n\nTaped radio dramas (''H\u00f6rspiele'') of the novels have been especially popular in Germany with most of them having been certified Gold or Platinum by the German Federal Association of Music Industry. In total, the radio dramas have sold more than 45 million copies and the books about 16 million copies in Germany (2013).<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/die-drei-rekordumsatz-mit-den-kindlichen-krimihelden-a-936500.html '' Umsatzbringer \"Die drei Fragezeichen\" : Da sieht Lady Gaga alt aus''].

Moreover, in Germany there are different revised editions of ''The Mystery of the Scar-faced Beggar'': one using Alfred Hitchcock as their patron, one using Alfred Hitchcock and Hector Sebastian, and another one using only Hector Sebastian (in Germany renamed as \"Albert Hitfield\").\n\nNew [[English-language]] Three Investigators titles were released during 2005 for the first time since 1990. The German 'American-English' series included the release of ''Poisoned E-Mail'' and ''The Curse of the Cell Phone''. As of May 2008, a total of seven German stories had been translated and published in this format, and an eighth title was planned for publication during October 2008.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 2006, following the example of \u201cDie drei ???\u201d/\"The Three Investigators\", a detective series specifically for girls titled \u201c{{ill|Die Drei !!!|de|Die drei !!!|vertical-align=sup}}\u201d was launched by publisher Franckh-Kosmos.

Ranga is Pete, Ganga is Jupe and Shirazi is Bob. These were published by Khel Khiladi Prakashan, [[West Patel Nagar]], Delhi during the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Indonesia===\nThe Three Investigators books have been published in Indonesia under the name of ''Trio Detektif''.

The cover author for the Three Investigators books was always Alfred Hitchcock, whereas the inner copyright notice correctly reported the real author (although saying \"Text by ...\"). No other publications of the novels are known.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n=== Latin ===\nThe German demand for the adventures of The Three Investigators produced another offshoot in 2011. Ulrich Krau\u00dfe translated ''The Curse of the Dragon'' into [[Latin]] with three German Latin teachers working as proofreaders.

The name of their Mercedes Benz driver is Allahdad. They live in Karimabad. Umber is tall and lanky as opposed to Jupiter's character, who is stocky. Naseem, like Pete, is the most athletic of all.

It was created by [[Robert Arthur Jr.]], who believed involving a famous person such as movie director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] would attract attention. [[Random House]], which is owned by [[Bertelsmann]], is the U.S. publisher and still has some of the rights to the books. Other rights are possessed by the heirs of Robert Arthur, Jr. and the German publisher [[Kosmos (publisher)|Kosmos]]. The characters known as the \"Three Investigators\" are three boys named Jupiter Jones, Peter Crenshaw and Bob Andrews.\n\nMost of the [[Mystery fiction|mysteries]] involved investigation of baffling phenomena (e.g., an ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy]] that apparently whispered and a human skull that seemed to talk).\n\n==Original editions==\n{{main|The American series of The Three Investigators}}\n\nThe original series was published from 1964 to 1987 and comprised 43 finished books, one unfinished story (''The Mystery of the Ghost Train'') and four ''Find Your Fate'' books. Between 1989 and 1990 [[Random House]] published the Three Investigators Crimebusters series.\n\nBooks number 1 to 9 and 11 were written by the creator, [[Robert Arthur Jr.|Robert Arthur]], who also specified ideas for a few of the other stories. Arthur had been an [[editing|editor]] for several [[book]] [[Anthology|collections]] attributed to Alfred Hitchcock. The other [[author]]s were [[Michael Collins (American author)|William Arden]] ([[Michael Collins (American author)|Dennis Lynds]]), [[Nick West (author)|Nick West]] (Kin Platt), [[Mary Virginia Carey]] and [[Marc Brandel]] (born Marcus Beresford). All of the authors wrote their own [[Foreword|introductions]] and [[epilogue]]s, which were dictated purportedly by Hitchcock and later in the series a fictional writer, Hector Sebastian, who supposedly recorded the adventures of the Three Investigators from their words. The illustrators in the series began with [[Harry Kane (illustrator)|Harry Kane]] and Ed Vebell and include Jack Hearne, Herb Mott, Stephen Marchesi, Robert Adragna and William A. (\"Bill\") Dodge.\n\nFor the original series, the specific ages of the investigators were never revealed, but contextual information indicates that they were likely 13 or 14 years old. They were not old enough to drive a car legally, but were said to be just a few years younger than their nemesis Skinny Norris, who had a driver's license from a state where the required age for a license was younger. On one occasion it was mentioned that Pete was part of the high-school [[wrestling]] team. In the later Crimebusters series, it was stated once that the Three Investigators team was initiated when the boys were 13.\n\nThe investigators were typically introduced to a [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] by a [[wikt:client|client]] or by finding something unusual accidentally in the [[scrapyard]] of Jupiter's Uncle Titus Jones and Aunt Mathilda, who had a salvage business. The boys encountered baffling, sometimes misleading clues and danger before finally solving the mystery. The series had one major theme: however strange, mystical, or even [[supernatural]] a particular phenomenon may seem at first, it is capable of being traced to human agency with the determined application of [[reason]] and [[logic]]. This theme was compromised on four occasions by Carey: in ''[[The Mystery of Monster Mountain]]'', the boys encounter [[Bigfoot]]; in ''[[The Invisible Dog]]'', she canonizes [[astral projection]] and dangles the possibility of a \"phantom priest\"; in ''[[The Mystery of the Scar-Faced Beggar]]'', a woman has genuine prophetic dreams; and in the final book of the original run, ''[[The Mystery of the Cranky Collector]]'', a young woman's ghost returns to haunt her former employer's mansion.\n\nMost mysteries were solved by Jupiter Jones, a supreme logician who implicitly used the [[Occam's Razor]] principle: that the simplest and most rational explanation should be preferred to an explanation which requires additional assumptions. The boys were able to solve their mysteries with relatively few resources: they generally had little more than a telephone, bicycles, access to a library and\u2014with reference to the Hollywood setting of the series\u2014a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce (which Jupiter wins the use of in the first book).\n\nIn the first book, ''[[The Secret of Terror Castle]]'', Jupiter bluffs his way into the office of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and makes a deal with him that if the Investigators can find him a haunted house to use as a location for his next movie, Hitchcock will introduce the story of their adventures.  Hitchcock agrees, not expecting them to succeed; but at the end of the book is impressed with the boys' investigation and not only introduces the book, but also refers several other future clients to them in subsequent novels.  The last chapter of each book was usually an epilogue in which the investigators sat with Alfred Hitchcock (and later, \"Hector Sebastian\"), reviewing the mystery and revealing the [[deductive reasoning|deductions]] through the clues discussed earlier in the book.\n\nIn 1989, [[Random House]] revamped the series, naming it ''The 3 Investigators\u2014Crimebusters Series''. The investigators were now 17 years old, could drive cars and were much more independent. The stories continued to include an abundance of detecting, but with the addition of more [[Action (fiction)|action]]. The series was well-received, but was halted during 1990, when legal disagreements between Random House and the heirs of the Arthur estate could not be resolved. By 2005, the disagreements were still not settled.\n\nAt least eleven novels were published in the ''CrimeBusters'' series, which was initiated by one of the series' authors, William Arden, [[pseudonym]] of Dennis Lynds, who wrote the Dan Fortune mystery series for adults by the pseudonym [[Michael Collins (American author)|Michael Collins]]. The other authors were: [[H. William Stine]] and wife [[Megan Stine]], [[G.H. Stone]] ([[Gayle Lynds]]), [[William MacCay]], [[Marc Brandel]] and [[Peter Lerangis]].\n\nRandom House has reprinted several of the original books as two [[paperback]] reprint series, partly to assure their legal rights.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1990, [[Random House]] published a total of 56 books. After the discontinuation of the series in 1990, a German author team began writing new books under the commission of the [[Franckh-Kosmos Verlags-GmbH & Co.|Franckh Kosmos]] publishing house in 1993. In 2011, three previously unpublished novels by the US authors Peter Lerangis, Megan and H. William Stine and G. H. Stone were published in Germany.\n\n==Series background==\n===Characters===\n\nThe Three Investigators are a junior detective team that initially came together because of a mental exercise club. They live in Rocky Beach, a fictional coastal town between [[Los Angeles]] and [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]]. In some of their cases, the boys are supported by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], the chauffeur Worthington, and the police inspectors Reynolds and Cotta.\n\u201cWe Investigate Anything\u201d is The Three Investigators' trademark slogan on their business card. Most often, Jupiter is the one to hand over the card in a fitting moment to see the clients\u2019 reactions to the three question marks. Often, that reaction is a joke, with the clients asking whether the question marks mean the investigators doubt their own abilities. Jupiter usually retorts something like: \u201cThat's our symbol. [...] The question marks stand for mysteries unsolved, riddles unanswered, puzzles of any kind. So we use it as our trademark. We investigate any kind of mystery.\u201d<ref>The Mystery of the Talking Skull (1969, by Robert Arthur)</ref>\n\nTo prove themselves, The Three Investigators usually have a lot of persuading to do in the beginning, as the clients often mistrust their abilities because the investigators are so young.\n\nIn their first cases, The Three Investigators also provide, apart from their business card, a letter of recommendation from the Police Department of Rocky Beach signed by Chief Inspector Samuel Reynolds. It says: \"The holder of this badge is a junior volunteer assistant to the Police Department of Rocky Beach. The authority advocates any support from third parties.\"\n\n====The Three Investigators====\n'''Jupiter \"Jupe\" Jones''', First Investigator\u2014A former [[child actor]] named \"Baby Fatso\", although he hates it when people mention this.  Jupiter is intelligent and stocky, and has a remarkable [[memory]] and deductive skills. Jupiter's parents (professional [[ballroom dancer]]s) died in a car crash when he was four years old. Although \u201cAn Ear for Danger\u201d mentions the car accident as their cause of death, in the episode \u201c...&nbsp;das leere Grab\u201d (German only), they are said to have disappeared following a plane crash. He now lives with his uncle, Titus Jones and Aunt Mathilda, who manage a scrapyard.\n\nJupiter's past acting ability benefits him frequently in mysteries because he can act older than he is, perform imitations of people when necessary and act less intelligent to extract information from potential suspects.\n\nJupiter is a prolific reader and inventor and frequently invents a device that simplifies solving a mystery. Jupiter has a knack for usually thinking about clues correctly to solve an otherwise unsolvable mystery. He also likes to play pranks on the other two investigators.  Because of his intellectual side, Jupe is adept at using big words and frequently uses them to his advantage, particularly to seem older, annoy Pete, and startle adults.  Jupe hates to dismiss an unsolved mystery, which frequently means that he drags Bob and Pete along for the ride.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://3investigators.homestead.com/files/t3ihome.htm|title=T3I Readers' Site|website=3investigators.homestead.com|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref>\n\n'''Peter \"Pete\" Crenshaw''', Second Investigator\u2014Pete is an athletic youth who dislikes dangerous situations, but is nonetheless reliable as the \"action member\" of the team. Pete loves and cares for animals, and is fond of uttering the exclamation \"Gleeps!\". His father works as a film technician for [[special effects]] in [[Hollywood]]\n\nPete is a frequent companion of Jupiter on stake-outs and other field trips, particularly in the earlier mysteries, when Bob is unavailable.  While he may not have the intellectual ability of Jupiter, Pete is nonetheless considered as an equal in the stories and is able to point out Jupiter's own shortcomings (usually in a comical fashion). He is also capable of making deductions and sometimes serves as the clue-bearer instead of Bob. He has an excellent sense of direction, as in ''The Mystery of the Stuttering Parrot''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n'''Robert \"Bob\" Andrews''', Records and Research\u2014Bob is studious and meticulous, and wears glasses. Depending on the case, Bob's father is a [[Sports journalism|sportswriter]], [[business journalist]], or [[Political journalism|political journalist]], and occasionally helps The Three Investigators in some of their cases.\n\nEarly in the series, Bob is hampered physically by a leg brace he wore, due to multiple fractures inflicted when he rolled down a hill. This handicap relegated him to a more studious and less physical involvement. Bob works part-time in the local [[library]], suiting his role as data collector. Bob also serves as the clue-bearer for many of the adventures, because of his research at the library.  Bob's leg brace is removed between the end of ''Whispering Mummy'' and the beginning of ''Green Ghost''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Headquarters===\n\nThe office of the Three Investigators is a house trailer, hidden among the piles of scrap at the edge of Uncle Titus' scrapyard. The house trailer has multiple secret exits, a small lab, a [[darkroom]], and an office with a phone, typewriter, and [[reference works]]. Many other utensils, such as a [[tape recorder]] or a [[periscope]], were built by Jupiter who used spare parts found in the scrapyard.\n\n==Copyright dispute==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===Initial position===\n\nThe series was invented by the American writer Robert Arthur in the US in 1964. Arthur sold the international exploitation rights to the publishing house [[Random House]]. However, the copyright remained with him. The contract included the rights to publish books, films, comics and mechanical [[sound reproduction]]. Since there was no significant audio book market at that time, it is legally not clearly determinable and therefore doubtful whether this \"mechanical sound reproduction\" describes the medium of audio books or radio plays as they exist now. The [[Kosmos (publisher)|Franckh-Kosmos]] publisher of Random House acquired the German-speaking exploitation rights in 1968. The label [[Europa (record label)|EUROPA]] received the rights to the audio version of the series as part of the sublicense partners of the Kosmos Verlag.\n\nAfter Robert Arthur's death in 1969, the copyrights were given to the [[University of Michigan]]. In his [[testimony]], Arthur declared that \"all rights, legal titles and stakes, [he] owned by the time of [his] death, concerning all published books, short stories, plays or unpublished manuscripts, including all issued copyright claims, just as all rights for license fees and subsidiary rights, as it is specified in his contracts with publishers\" were to be given to the University of Michigan. This is said to mainly be for fiscal reasons because legacies given to education establishments avoid inheritance taxes.\n\nSince then Random House had been paying [[Royalty payment|royalties]] to the university, but they stopped doing so as of 1992, because it was not clear whether the University of Michigan still had a legal entitlement. The [[American copyright law]] said that literature, which received a copyright before 1977, had a safeguard clause, which made sure that all licenses automatically returned to the author or his heirs after 28 years. As a result of that, Random House and Arthur's heirs, his children Elizabeth Ann Arthur and Robert Andrew Arthur, signed a contract for the rights of use of the volumes of Arthur and the further usage of the characters, under the condition that the 10 books were to be brought back onto the American market.\n\nAfter the series was discontinued in the US in 1991, Kosmos Verlag sought the rights to continue the series in Germany with German authors, and in 1994 signed a corresponding contract with Random House without the consent of Arthur's heirs.\n\nIn 2002, Random House returned the rights of the ten volumes to Robert Arthur's heirs after the publisher failed to comply with the agreed republications of the works. In 1999, however, Kosmos-Verlag had already registered the word mark {{ill|\"Die Drei ???\"|de|Die drei %3F%3F%3F|vertical-align=sup}} throughout Germany and by 2003 throughout Europe as well as a European trademark for audio carriers and printed products.\n\nNegotiations between Kosmos Verlag and the heirs on a new usage rights agreement failed because Kosmos relied on its trademark registration and ongoing agreements with Random House. Furthermore, Kosmos doubted that Arthur's heirs were the right holders since according to Arthur's will, all rights were to be transferred to the University of Michigan. At the end of 2004, Random House and Kosmos signed an extensive agreement to transfer all rights to the other American novels not written by Arthur to Kosmos Verlag.\n\n===Lawsuit===\n\nDue to the unclear legal situation, EUROPA decided at the beginning of 2005 not to publish any further episodes based on the book templates of Kosmos Verlag and discontinued the license payments to Kosmos. At that time the books \u201cSpur ins Nichts\u201d and \u201c...und der Geisterzug\u201d (both German only) had already been recorded as an radio play.\n\nIn 2006, the parent company of the European label [[Sony Music Entertainment]] (formerly Sony BMG) finally gained all the German rights on Arthur's creations and the use of the original characters and showplaces independently from Kosmos publishing house of Robert Arthur's successors. The contract contained the right to order new books in German, as well as the right to evaluate the sound storage medium. Moreover, all were transferred: from \"[...] interests [of Arthur's children] in all German audio recordings, bound books, pocketbooks, theatrical performances and electronic film recordings of theatrical performances to all existing derived products in Sony BMG\". EUROPA developed a new audio book named \"{{ill|DiE DR3i|de|DiE DR3i|vertical-align=sup}}\" based on it. Indeed, EUROPA avoided the use of the name \"Die Drei ???\" and also the name created by Kosmos because of the protection of the brand. Instead of that only characters and names which were based on Arthur's ideas were used (characters\u2019 original names).\n\nThe Kosmos publishing house continued its series of books under well-known titles and with famous character's names. The society filed a lawsuit against the Kosmos publishing house because Sony BMG itself saw its exploitation rights violated. A provisional disposal was obtained against the sale of two novels \u201cSpuk im Netz\u201d and \u201cDer Fluch des Drachen\u201d (both German only).\n\nBecause of this, the two books had to be taken off the market retroactively. This verdict was overturned by the [[Oberlandesgericht|Higher Regional Court]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on May 13, 2007. The judges were unable to identify Robert Arthur's children as the rightful owners of the copyright law. They found that the University of Michigan rightfully inherited the works of Robert Arthur and his characters, meaning that his heirs could not have transferred the rights to Sony BMG. A due date was set for the complainant of Sony BMG to submit the new chain-of-title as well as the new contracts as they were available to her. Eventually, Kosmos and Sony BMG announced they would negotiate again to come to an extrajudicial agreement, causing the delivery of Episode 7 of \"DiE DR3i\" to be delayed. The final release date of Episodes 7 and 8 was 30 November 2007.\n\n===Outcome===\n\nOn February 13, 2008, Sony BMG announced that they had come to an agreement with Kosmos, predating a joint press release on the following day. The rights to the books as well as the brand name, which were the foundation for the audio dramas remained with Kosmos as well as all other publishing products, including calendars, non-fiction literature, mobile and computer games, science kits and board games.\n\nThe rights to use audio material with the inclusion of the entire catalog as well as stage shows, plays and the commercialization of merchandise remain with the record label Europa.\n\nSince 4 April 2008, new German editions under the name \u201cDie Drei ???\u201d have been published, based on the books published by Kosmos. The rights to continue the hugely successful audio plays \u201c{{ill|Die Drei ??? Kids|de|Die drei %3F%3F%3F Kids|vertical-align=sup}}\u201d was transferred to Europa as well. The already published audio play episodes were sold by the previous license holder USM until late 2008. Furthermore, a withdrawal of the series \"DiE DR3i\" from sale until 1 January 2009 was agreed upon.\n\nSince 1999, the spin-off series \u201cDie Drei ??? Kids\u201d, issued by publisher Kosmos, has been supposed to target a much younger audience. The contents of the stories were thus tailored to be more suitable for children and to be less complex. Besides, with an age of only ten years, the young detectives are considerably younger than in the current episodes of the original series.\n\n==International and foreign-language editions==\n\n===Bangladesh===\n{{main|Tin Goyenda}}\n\nThe Three Investigators has also been published in Bangladesh by [[Sheba Prokashoni]] as ''[[Tin Goyenda]]'' (translated by Rakib Hasan) since the 1980s and appealed to many young Bangladeshi readers until 2000s. In the Bengali editions, Jupiter Jones is known as Kishor Pasha (a Bangladeshi American). The other two are named as Musa Aman (African American) and Robin Milford (Irish American). Other characters include Gina and her pet dog Rafian, the chauffeur Hanson, Bavarian brothers Boris and Rover, and movie director Davis Christopher (in place of Alfred Hitchcock). The character \"Skinny Norris\" appears as \"Shutki Terry\" and the famous French thief appears as \"Shopa\". The character Victor Simon in the Bangladeshi edition appears in the place of \"Hector Sebastian\". The stories are generally set in Rocky Beach, California, although the investigators travel to exotic places like Africa and Bangladesh on occasions. The stories that had Gina and her pet dog Rafian, those were actually a Bangla adaptation from ''[[The Famous Five (novel series)|The Famous Five]]'' by [[Enid Blyton]]. The name Gina is a short form of 'Georgina' which was the same name used in ''The Famous Five''. She also owns a pet dog in ''The Famous Five'' series, named Timmy. Nearly 125 books have been published by now.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Denmark===\nIn Denmark, 13 books were published from 1966\u201370 by ''Hasselbalch'' under the title \"''Alfred Hitchcock og De tre Detektiver''\" <ref>[http://danskforfatterleksikon.dk/1850tit/0128/sknr128997.htm] retrieved Oct 23rd, 2018</ref>\n\n===France===\nIn France, the original nine books were published during the 1970s by the ''Biblioth\u00e8que Verte'' collection of books for young readers under the title \"''Les Trois Jeunes D\u00e9tectives''\" (\"The Three young detectives\").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the series continued. As a whole, 37 volumes (including four of the Crimebusters series) has been published.\n\n===Germany===\n{{main|German editions of the Three Investigators}}\n\nThe Three Investigators books have always been very popular in [[Germany]]. They are known there as ''Die drei ???'' (''Die drei Fragezeichen'', meaning \"The Three Question Marks\"). Jupiter Jones was renamed as \"Justus Jonas\", a German adaption of his original name, while Pete Crenshaw is named \"Peter Shaw\". Bob Andrews retained his original name. The chauffeur's name is Morton.\n\nIn 1964 the [[Random House]] publishing company and the [[Kosmos (publisher)|Kosmos]] publishing company started to publish the translated 43 original books. In 1979 the German publisher Europa started a radio drama based on those original 43 books. In 1993 Kosmos started to publish new written books by German authors which were and still are continued as radio dramas in Germany. All in all, this would result in a canon of over 200 books (6 books per year, 3 during spring and 3 during autumn) and 201 radio dramas published as of December 2018. Because of a litigation between Europa and Kosmos which disallowed the use of the names Europa used, they published a 9 episode radio drama named \"DiE Dr3i\" between 2006 and 2007. \"DiE Dr3i\" were mostly identical to \"Die Drei ???\" and they also used the same German voice-actors, but they had to change the names of the characters to the original English names. \"DiE Dr3i\" were stopped when the litigation ended and \"Die drei ???\" started again.\n\nTaped radio dramas (''H\u00f6rspiele'') of the novels have been especially popular in Germany with most of them having been certified Gold or Platinum by the German Federal Association of Music Industry. In total, the radio dramas have sold more than 45 million copies and the books about 16 million copies in Germany (2013).<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/literatur/die-drei-rekordumsatz-mit-den-kindlichen-krimihelden-a-936500.html '' Umsatzbringer \"Die drei Fragezeichen\" : Da sieht Lady Gaga alt aus''].

They broke their own [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] when performing ''Phonophobia \u2013 Symphony of Fear'' in front of 20,000 people at Berlin [[Waldb\u00fchne]] during 2014.<ref>[http://www.morgenpost.de/kultur/berlin-kultur/article131067126/Die-Drei-stellen-in-Berliner-Waldbuehne-Weltrekord-auf.html ''Die \"Drei ???\" stellen in Berliner Waldb\u00fchne Weltrekord auf'']. Berliner Morgenpost, August 10, 2014</ref>\n\nIn the booklet of the German audio play ''The Mystery of the Invisible Dog'', the episode upon which it was based is credited erroneously to Nick West. Moreover, in Germany there are different revised editions of ''The Mystery of the Scar-faced Beggar'': one using Alfred Hitchcock as their patron, one using Alfred Hitchcock and Hector Sebastian, and another one using only Hector Sebastian (in Germany renamed as \"Albert Hitfield\").\n\nNew [[English-language]] Three Investigators titles were released during 2005 for the first time since 1990. The German 'American-English' series included the release of ''Poisoned E-Mail'' and ''The Curse of the Cell Phone''. As of May 2008, a total of seven German stories had been translated and published in this format, and an eighth title was planned for publication during October 2008.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 2006, following the example of \u201cDie drei ???\u201d/\"The Three Investigators\", a detective series specifically for girls titled \u201c{{ill|Die Drei !!!|de|Die drei !!!|vertical-align=sup}}\u201d was launched by publisher Franckh-Kosmos. In a similar way as the original, the book series contains stories about a teenage detective trio, only this time consisting of three girls; the stories take place in a big German city.\n\nThe band {{ill|Jupiter Jones (band)|lt=Jupiter Jones|de|Jupiter Jones|vertical-align=sup}}, formed in 2002, named themselves after the original name of the first detective Jupiter Jones (Justus Jonas in German). The rock band {{ill|Karpatenhund|de|Karpatenhund|vertical-align=sup}} (\"Carpathian Dog\") from [[Cologne]] named themselves after a title of one episode (\"Mystery of the Invisible Dog\"). On the album \u201cBordsteinkantengeschichten\u201d by the band {{ill|Muff Potter|de|Muff Potter|vertical-align=sup}}, a long scream from the episode \u201cDer seltsame  Wecker\u201d (\"Mystery of the Screaming Clock\") can be heard. The intro and outro of the album \u201cAlles auf Schwarz\u201d by the rock band {{ill|Montreal (band)|de|Montreal (Band)|vertical-align=sup}} from [[Hamburg]] are narrated by [[Oliver Rohrbeck]] in the role of Justus Jonas, but without mentioning Justus\u2019 name.\n\n===India===\nThe Three Investigators books have been published in India, in addition to the original American versions, by the name of \"Bal Secret Agent 555 Ranga, Ganga & Shirazi\". Ranga is Pete, Ganga is Jupe and Shirazi is Bob. These were published by Khel Khiladi Prakashan, [[West Patel Nagar]], Delhi during the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Indonesia===\nThe Three Investigators books have been published in Indonesia under the name of ''Trio Detektif''. These were published by [[Gramedia Pustaka Utama]] (the biggest book publisher in Indonesia), Jakarta from the 1980s to 1990.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Italy===\nIn Italy, the Three Investigators novels have been published in paperback form by Mondadori, during the 1970s and 1980s, within their ''Il giallo dei ragazzi'' series, which included the [[Hardy Boys]], [[Nancy Drew]] and other juvenile sleuths' adventures. The cover author for the Three Investigators books was always Alfred Hitchcock, whereas the inner copyright notice correctly reported the real author (although saying \"Text by ...\"). No other publications of the novels are known.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n=== Latin ===\nThe German demand for the adventures of The Three Investigators produced another offshoot in 2011. Ulrich Krau\u00dfe translated ''The Curse of the Dragon'' into [[Latin]] with three German Latin teachers working as proofreaders. Krau\u00dfe's translation, titled ''De Tribus Investigatoribus et Fato Draconis'', was popular in Germany among students of Latin.<ref>Ulrich Krau\u00dfe: Die drei ??? \u2013 De Tribus Investigatoribus et Fato Draconis, Editio Latina, 9,95 Euro, 182 S., {{ISBN|978-3-9813892-0-3}}.</ref><ref>[http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/nachrichten/kultur/msfe/art2551,1144082 Ruhrnachrichten, Jan 3rd, 2011 (German)] retrieved Jan 15th, 2013</ref>\n\n===Lithuania===\nThe Three Investigators books have been published in Lithuania and were popular among teenagers.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Pakistan===\nThe Three Investigators have been published in Pakistan, in [[Urdu]], as ''Teen nanhay suraghrasaan'' since the 1978 by the [[Ferozsons]] publications. They have also been published in the monthly ''Taleem-o Tarbiat'' magazine for children. The names of the characters are \"Umber\" (Jupiter Jones), \"Naseem\" (Pete) and \"Aaqib\" (Bob). The name of their Mercedes Benz driver is Allahdad. They live in Karimabad. Umber is tall and lanky as opposed to Jupiter's character, who is stocky. Naseem, like Pete, is the most athletic of all. The translators are Saleem Ahmed Siddiqui and Maqbool Jahangir. They have done a good job adapting the stories to match Pakistani culture and geography.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Poland===\nSixty-one original stories (including ''Crimebusters'') have been published in [[Poland]] (by Siedmiorog), where they were recently still very popular.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Portugal===\nIn [[Portugal]], the Three Investigators novels started to be published in hard cover edition by ''Cl\u00e1ssica Editora'', within ''Os melhores livros juvenis'' series, which included other juvenile adventures by authors such as [[Erich K\u00e4stner]], [[Enid Blyton]] and [[E.W. Hildick]].\n\nThe first book published was ''[[The Secret of Terror Castle]]'' in the 1970s (second edition in 1978).\nThe cover author for the Three Investigators books was always Alfred Hitchcock. In the first editions the inner copyright notice correctly reported the real author (although saying \"written in cooperation with...\").\n\n===Slovakia===\nThe books have also been very popular among children and teenagers in [[Slovakia]] under the name of 'Traja p\u00e1tra\u010di' where the books were published by Mlad\u00e9 Let\u00e1. {{ill|86 books|sk|Traja_p\u00e1tra\u010di|vertical-align=sup}} have been translated from original, Crimebuster and German series, but not in order of original release.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Southeast Asia===\nIn the French, Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian and Italian version of the series, the books were at one time published with Alfred Hitchcock listed as their author. The same error was made in some German paperback editions published at the beginning of the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nSimilarly, all British Armada paperback editions of the title ''The Mystery of the Moaning Cave'' are credited erroneously to Robert Arthur. Moreover, the British series reversed the order of #42 and #43, meaning that the Armada original series ends with ''Wreckers' Rock''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Spain===\nIn Spain, ''The Mystery of the Moaning Cave'', ''The Mystery of the Laughing Shadow'', ''The Secret of the Crooked Cat'', ''The Mystery of the Coughing Dragon'', ''The Mystery of Monster Mountain'' as well as ''The Mystery of the Headless Horse'' are erroneously credited to Robert Arthur. The new Latin-American edition has the name of ''Los tres detectives'' instead of ''Los Tres Investigadores'', which was used in Spain for earlier editions. Catalan translations were also published.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 2007, a Three Investigators movie, ''The Three Investigators and the Secret of Skeleton Island'', was released in [[Germany]], starring [[Chancellor Miller]] as Jupiter, [[Nick Price (actor)|Nick Price]] as Pete, and [[Cameron Monaghan]] as Bob. It was followed in 2009 by ''The Three Investigators and the Secret of Terror Castle''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156519/ \"The Secret of Terror Castle at the Internet Movie Database\"], IMDb.com</ref>  Although adopting the same titles as two of the novels, and some of the characters, the stories in the films are significantly different to those in the books on which they are based.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Bj\u00f6rn Akstinat]], ''Das ABC der drei Fragezeichen'' (ABC of The Three Investigators), Baden-Baden: Humboldt-Verlag, 2008.\n* Armin Paul Frank, ''Das englische und amerikanische H\u00f6rspiel''.
