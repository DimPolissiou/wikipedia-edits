Chalcedonians such as the [[Eastern Orthodox]] have often labelled Dioscorus (and all Oriental Orthodox) as monophysites and therefore heretics, <ref>http://orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/copts_orth.aspx</ref> most likely due to their effort{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} to rehabilitate Eutyches (which failed). However, this is strongly refuted by the [[Oriental Orthodox]] who prefer to be labelled [[Miaphysites]]. The liturgical prayers of [[Basil of Caesarea]] used by the [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches to this day affirm their miaphysitism and objection to both [[Arianism]] and Monophysitism.<ref>https://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_basil.pdf</ref><ref>https://ukmidcopts.org/coptic/universal/</ref> \n\nIn 1973, the [[Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] Popes signed a common declaration on Christology. This was the first modern era official recognition by a Chalcedonian church that Oriental Orthodox Churches are not Monophysites.<ref>http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/anc-orient-ch-docs/rc_pc_christuni_doc_19730510_copti_en.html</ref>\n\nTherefore Western Catholics{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} avoid referring to Non-Chalcedonians as Monophysites. For example the definition in The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity, p. 1016 reads: \"Though the term 'Monophysite' occurs in dogmatic discussions of Miaphysitism from the 7th century onwards, it is technically inaccurate, being a heresiological label properly confined to the view in which the union of divine and human in Christ is seen to result either in the emergence of a distinct 'third' nature or the absorption of one nature into the other (usually the human into the divine) as in the profession of Eutyches (d. c. 554), whose emphasis on the singularity of Christ's incarnate nature appears to have led him to deny that Christ's body was consubstantial to human flesh.\"\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox came to a Christological agreement with the Oriental Orthodox in this same area in September 1990 <ref>https://www.trinityorthodox.ca/sites/default/files/Agreed%20Statements-Orthodox-Oriental%20Orthodox%20Dialogue-1989-1990.pdf</ref>.\n\nThe Anglican Communion similarly signed a statement in October 2014 affirming the Oriental Orthodox rejection of monophysitism and the adoption of the Christological [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysis]] formula of [[Cyril of Alexandria]] <ref>http://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/103502/anglican-oriental-orthodox-agreed-statement-on-christology-cairo-2014.pdf</ref>.\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Christian theology}}\n{{Heresies condemned by the Catholic Church}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]\n[[Category:Christianity in the Byzantine Empire]]\n[[Category:Christianity in the Middle East]]\n[[Category:Christology]]\n[[Category:Heresy in Christianity]]\n[[Category:Schisms in Christianity]]\n\n{{Christianity-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n{{Christology}}\n'''Monophysitism''' ({{IPAc-en|m|\u0259|\u02c8|n|\u0252|f|\u026a|s|a\u026a|\u02cc|t|\u026a|z|\u0259m}} or {{IPAc-en|m|\u0259|\u02c8|n|\u0252|f|\u026a|s|\u026a|\u02cc|t|\u026a|z|\u0259m}}; {{lang-el|\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2}}; [[Koine Greek phonology|Late Koine Greek]], {{IPA-el|monofysitiz\u02c8mos|pron}} from \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ''monos'', \"single\" and \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ''physis'', \"nature\") is the [[Christology|Christological]] position that Jesus Christ has a '' single'' \"nature\", rather than being both divine and human.

Chalcedonians such as the [[Eastern Orthodox]] have often labelled Dioscorus (and all Oriental Orthodox) as monophysites and therefore heretics, <ref>http://orthodoxinfo.com/ecumenism/copts_orth.aspx</ref> most likely due to their effort{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} to rehabilitate Eutyches (which failed). However, this is strongly refuted by the [[Oriental Orthodox]] who prefer to be labelled [[Miaphysites]]. The liturgical prayers of [[Basil of Caesarea]] used by the [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches to this day affirm their miaphysitism and objection to both [[Arianism]] and Monophysitism.<ref>https://www.copticchurch.net/topics/liturgy/liturgy_of_st_basil.pdf</ref><ref>https://ukmidcopts.org/coptic/universal/</ref> \n\nIn 1973, the [[Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic]] Popes signed a common declaration on Christology. This was the first modern era official recognition by a Chalcedonian church that Oriental Orthodox Churches are not Monophysites.<ref>http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/anc-orient-ch-docs/rc_pc_christuni_doc_19730510_copti_en.html</ref>\n\nTherefore Western Catholics{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} avoid referring to Non-Chalcedonians as Monophysites. For example the definition in The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity, p. 1016 reads: \"Though the term 'Monophysite' occurs in dogmatic discussions of Miaphysitism from the 7th century onwards, it is technically inaccurate, being a heresiological label properly confined to the view in which the union of divine and human in Christ is seen to result either in the emergence of a distinct 'third' nature or the absorption of one nature into the other (usually the human into the divine) as in the profession of Eutyches (d. c. 554), whose emphasis on the singularity of Christ's incarnate nature appears to have led him to deny that Christ's body was consubstantial to human flesh.\"\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox came to a Christological agreement with the Oriental Orthodox in this same area in September 1990 <ref>https://www.trinityorthodox.ca/sites/default/files/Agreed%20Statements-Orthodox-Oriental%20Orthodox%20Dialogue-1989-1990.pdf</ref>.\n\nThe Anglican Communion similarly signed a statement in October 2014 affirming the Oriental Orthodox rejection of monophysitism and the adoption of the Christological [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysis]] formula of [[Cyril of Alexandria]] <ref>http://www.anglicancommunion.org/media/103502/anglican-oriental-orthodox-agreed-statement-on-christology-cairo-2014.pdf</ref>.\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Christian theology}}\n{{Heresies condemned by the Catholic Church}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]\n[[Category:Christianity in the Byzantine Empire]]\n[[Category:Christianity in the Middle East]]\n[[Category:Christology]]\n[[Category:Heresy in Christianity]]\n[[Category:Schisms in Christianity]]\n\n{{Christianity-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Joe9y", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEutyches and Monophysitism", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophysitism"}

The hospital was renamed Western State Hospital in 1894.\n\nIn its early days, the facility was a resort-style asylum. It had terraced gardens where patients could plant flowers and take walks, roof walks to provide mountain views, and many architectural details to create an atmosphere that would aid in the healing process.  However, by the mid 19th Century, this utopian model of care had vanished, replaced by overcrowding in the facility and the warehousing of patients.

It is {{convert|17|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of the region capital [[Plze\u0148]] on the confluence of the River Klabava and the Holoubkov Brook ({{lang-cs|Holoubkovsk\u00fd potok}}). Alternatively, the Holoubkovsk\u00fd potok is referred to as the Boreck\u00fd potok and the section of the Klabava River down to the confluence as the Padr\u0165sk\u00fd potok. There is another smaller brook (Rakovsk\u00fd potok or Rakov\u00e1\u010dek) in the western part of the town.\n\nThe town is in the lowland, {{convert|362|m|abbr=out}} above sea level, bordered by hilly woodlands, especially the [[Brdy]] mountains to the east and the [[Rade\u010d massif]].\n\nRokycany is also the seat of the Municipality with Extended Competence and Municipality with Commissioned Local Authority.\n\n==History==\nThe place was inhabited since the [[Stone Age]]. [[Celt]]ic and early [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlements were discovered. Rokycany was first mentioned in 1110. At that time the village owned by the [[Bishop of Prague]], and major Bohemian and German noblemen met here for diplomatic talks with Emperor Henry V. In 1295 a stockade fortifications in Rokycany are mentioned (probably defending the district around the main church). Major changes occurred in the 14th century when the village grew into a town, and a new western part of the settlement with rectangular grid was added. In the 14th century, the main church rebuilt in Gothic style and by 1399 system of town fortification is mentioned. Rokycany took an active role in Hussite movement. Master [[John of Rokycan]] (1397\u20141471), [[Archbishop]] of [[Prague]], active during [[Hussite Wars]] was born here. In 1406 Rokycany obtained [[city rights]]. In the 16th century Rokycany was given rights as ''free King's city'' in 1584 making it self-administered entity. The prosperity came to an abrupt end with the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Rokycany was repeatedly afflicted by various armies, most notably by the Swedish army led by Banner who completely burned the town. By the end of the war Rokycany's population decreased to 774. Another period of prosperity started in the 18th century. Town was partially destroyed by fire in 1757 (52 houses damaged) and completely destroyed by another fire in 1784 (260 houses damaged). After the fire, the townhall and main church had to be rebuilt, as well as most of the private houses. Thanks to favorable economic conditions of the residents the post-1784 renewal proceeded rather quickly. In the 19th century craft and industry became main source of Rokycany's economy. The traditional iron-ore mining and processing industry was strengthened and linked with coal mining industry in nearby [[Miro\u0161ov (Rokycany District)]] basin. In 1862 Rokycany was connected via railway with [[Prague]] and [[Plze\u0148]]. Industrial development continued for most of the 20th century. Population grew (from 4,187 in 1869 to more than 16,000 in the late 1980s) and the town expanded with new neighborhoods, some of them inspired by concepts of [[Garden city movement]] (Ra\u0161\u00ednov neighborhood in the southern outskirts). On May 7, 1945 Rokycany was liberated by the [[American army]] which halted its eastward advance here, meeting with the allied Soviet troops in the eastern part of the town (creating so-called Demarcation line). In the post-World War II era, the development of the town was carried out in line with the ruling [[communist regime]]. The new massive construction activity focused on uniform tenement houses, from 1960s built with concrete panels (so-called \"[[panel\u00e1k]]\"). The local industry was further expanded and the life of the town was strongly influenced by strong  army garrison (located in two barracks built in 1899 and 1933 respectively). In 1960 neighboring village Borek was merged with Rokycany, in 1980 another three rural communities ([[Kamenn\u00fd \u00dajezd (Rokycany District)]], [[Litohlavy]], [[Svojkovice (Rokycany District)]]) joined Rokycany (however all 3 have separated in the 1990s)[http://encyklopedierokycan.sweb.cz/rokycanyhomepage.htm]\n\n==Geography==\nRokycany is divided into four districts: \"St\u0159ed\" (Center), \"Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto\" (New Town), \"Plze\u0148sk\u00e9 p\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed\" (Plze\u0148 Suburb) and \"[[Borek (Rokycany Municipal District)|Borek]]\".\n\n'''St\u0159ed''' encompasses the historical core of the town with two main squares, main church of Panna Marie Sn\u011b\u017en\u00e1 and town-hall. Since 1992 the historical core of Rokycany has been declared protected zone in order to protect the architecture. The border of this  district largely follows the path of former town's fortification. The medieval walls are still standing in several short sections. On the southern side the walls have been replaced by a representative avenue (Jir\u00e1skova ulice) with several major public buildings such as \"sokolovna\" ([[Sokol]] organization headquarters) from 1903, new railway-station from 1931, gymn\u00e1zium (grammar-school) from 1905 or municipal bank from 1933.\n\n'''Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto''' is by far most populous district surrounding the historical core from north, east and south. It evolved from traditional ''Pra\u017esk\u00e9 p\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed suburb'' which was located on both banks of the Klabava river along the road to Prague (Pra\u017esk\u00e1 ulice) and Nerudovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed square. After World War II most of the old suburb was demolished and replaced by several housing projects. With the population growth the built-up area of Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto expanded in all directions. There are thus several distinct modern neighborhoods. ''Pr\u00e1chovna'' is located in the southeastern section of Rokycany on  the banks of the Klabava River. Several industrial estates and colony of cheap tenement houses for local workers from early 20th century form most of Pr\u00e1chovna. ''P\u00e1clovna'' is situated along the road to Prague on Rokycany's eastern outskirts. It mainly consists of private houses, the Demarcation line memorial is located here (commemorating the meeting of American and Russian troops that occurred here in 1945), ''Oseck\u00fd vrch'' lies in the north along the road to the village of Osek. In 1957 large hospital was built here. There are large parks covering the surrounding slopes (Husovy sady and Kalv\u00e1rie) and large complex of town swimming-pool and football stadium. ''Ji\u017en\u00ed p\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed'' covers territory south of the Prague-Plze\u0148 railway. It consists of several industrial zones and populous housing projects from the 1950s and 1970s. The military barracks built in 1933 have been converted into a residential and industrial zone recently.\n\n'''Plze\u0148sk\u00e9 p\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed''' forms western part of Rokycany. It started in medieval era as a small cluster of rural houses adjoining Rokycany's historical core. In early 17th century Protestant church Nejsv\u011bt\u011bj\u0161\u00ed Trojice was built here, soon after taken by Catholics. In 19th century Plze\u0148sk\u00e9 p\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed quickly grew along the road to Plze\u0148 (Plze\u0148sk\u00e1 ulice), mainly industrial development was later accompanied by residential houses. In 1920s massive housing project started on Rokycany's southern outskirts. The new neighbourhood was later called ''Ra\u0161\u00ednov'' ([[Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn]] was finance minister of Czechoslovakia, assassinated in 1923). In consists solely of private houses in [[art-deco]] style. In 1930's another neighborhood was inaugurated in the western periphery, called ''Za Rakov\u00e1\u010dkem''. It also features almost exclusively private residential houses.\n\n[[Borek (Rokycany Municipal District)|Borek]] used to be an independent village located ca.2&nbsp;km east of Rokycany. In 1960 Borek came under the jurisdiction of Rokycany. The Boreck\u00fd rybn\u00edk lake is most notorious landmark of this district. In the 20th century the built-up area of Borek expanded amalgamating the village with Rokycany.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Rokycany-church Panna Marie Snezna.jpg|Main church in Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-main square.jpg|Main square in Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-town hall and main square.jpg|Town hall and main square in Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-Borek-chapel.jpg|Chapel in Borek, Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-railway station.jpg|Railway station from 1931, Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-communist era buildings.jpg|1970's style houses in Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-barracks.jpg|1930s army barracks in Rokycany\n</gallery>\n\n== Demography ==\n{{Historical populations\n|1811|2226\n|1848|3292\n|1869|4187\n|1880|4927\n|1890|5010\n|1900|5501\n|1910|6492\n|1921|6728\n|1930|7741\n|1939|9865\n|1950|8789\n|1961|11934\n|1970|12585\n|1980|15041\n|1991|15188\n|2001|14369\n|2007|14302\n|2008|14705\n|2019|14192\n|source = [http://encyklopedierokycan.sweb.cz/rokycanyhomepage.htm unofficial pages of Rokycany by David Borek]\n}}\nIn 19th century Rokycany's population quickly expanded pushing the number of inhabitants towards 5,000 in 1880. In the wake of [[Long Depression]] (economic slowdown of the 1870s which affected the economy of Austria-Hungary) the growth stopped. In late 1890s however population began to expand again, only to halt during World War I. In post-1918 era Rokycany grew rapidly. In the late 1930s this growth was further spurred by influx of ethnic Czech refugees from [[Sudetenland]]. In 1939 Rokycany's population touched 10,000 mark briefly. After World War II many citizens of Rokycany left the town for border regions from where the ethnic Germans were expelled. From the 1950s a new wave of massive growth started, pushing the town's population past 10,000 in the mid 1950s and past 15,000 in the 1980s. Demographic maximum was reached in 1989 with more than 16,000 inhabitants. Since that time the population dropped to ca. 14,000 as a result of economic a social transition and also of separation of 3 villages from the community of Rokycany.\n\nEthnically, Rokycany has been a predominately Czech settlement since [[Middle Ages]]. The German minority accounted for no more than couple of dozens individuals. In 1938 the town's population was boosted by influx of ethnic Czechs fleeing the border regions of Czechoslovakia which had been ceded to [[Nazi Germany]]. After 1945 most ethnic Germans [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|were expelled]]. The ethnic mix of Rokycany was in the post-World War II era enriched by Romas (Gypsies) and Slovaks.\n\n==Events==\nRokycany hosts [[Fluff Fest]], a [[vegan]] [[hardcore punk]] festival which draws several thousand visitors from across Europe every July. It is held at the Rokycany airfield, having moved there in 2006 from its original location in Plze\u0148. The festival has been described as a yearly \"strain\" on the town, which is otherwise unaccustomed to large numbers of foreign visitors and extreme music adherents, and brings a business boom especially in sales of vegetarian and vegan food.<ref name=\"fluff\">{{cite web|url=http://rokycansky.denik.cz/z-regionu/v-rokycanech-zacina-fluff-fest-20170720.html|title=Fluff fest, to je n\u00e1por

({{IPA-cs|\u02c8rok\u026atsan\u026a}}; {{lang-de|Rokitzan}}) is a town in the [[Plze\u0148 Region]] of the [[Czech Republic]]. It is {{convert|17|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of the region capital [[Plze\u0148]] on the confluence of the River Klabava and the Holoubkov Brook ({{lang-cs|Holoubkovsk\u00fd potok}}). Alternatively, the Holoubkovsk\u00fd potok is referred to as the Boreck\u00fd potok and the section of the Klabava River down to the confluence as the Padr\u0165sk\u00fd potok. There is another smaller brook (Rakovsk\u00fd potok or Rakov\u00e1\u010dek) in the western part of the town.\n\nThe town is in the lowland, {{convert|362|m|abbr=out}} above sea level, bordered by hilly woodlands, especially the [[Brdy]] mountains to the east and the [[Rade\u010d massif]].\n\nRokycany is also the seat of the Municipality with Extended Competence and Municipality with Commissioned Local Authority.\n\n==History==\nThe place was inhabited since the [[Stone Age]]. [[Celt]]ic and early [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlements were discovered. Rokycany was first mentioned in 1110. At that time the village owned by the [[Bishop of Prague]], and major Bohemian and German noblemen met here for diplomatic talks with Emperor Henry V. In 1295 a stockade fortifications in Rokycany are mentioned (probably defending the district around the main church). Major changes occurred in the 14th century when the village grew into a town, and a new western part of the settlement with rectangular grid was added. In the 14th century, the main church rebuilt in Gothic style and by 1399 system of town fortification is mentioned. Rokycany took an active role in Hussite movement. Master [[John of Rokycan]] (1397\u20141471), [[Archbishop]] of [[Prague]], active during [[Hussite Wars]] was born here. In 1406 Rokycany obtained [[city rights]]. In the 16th century Rokycany was given rights as ''free King's city'' in 1584 making it self-administered entity. The prosperity came to an abrupt end with the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Rokycany was repeatedly afflicted by various armies, most notably by the Swedish army led by Banner who completely burned the town. By the end of the war Rokycany's population decreased to 774. Another period of prosperity started in the 18th century. Town was partially destroyed by fire in 1757 (52 houses damaged) and completely destroyed by another fire in 1784 (260 houses damaged). After the fire, the townhall and main church had to be rebuilt, as well as most of the private houses. Thanks to favorable economic conditions of the residents the post-1784 renewal proceeded rather quickly. In the 19th century craft and industry became main source of Rokycany's economy. The traditional iron-ore mining and processing industry was strengthened and linked with coal mining industry in nearby [[Miro\u0161ov (Rokycany District)]] basin. In 1862 Rokycany was connected via railway with [[Prague]] and [[Plze\u0148]]. Industrial development continued for most of the 20th century. Population grew (from 4,187 in 1869 to more than 16,000 in the late 1980s) and the town expanded with new neighborhoods, some of them inspired by concepts of [[Garden city movement]] (Ra\u0161\u00ednov neighborhood in the southern outskirts). On May 7, 1945 Rokycany was liberated by the [[American army]] which halted its eastward advance here, meeting with the allied Soviet troops in the eastern part of the town (creating so-called Demarcation line). In the post-World War II era, the development of the town was carried out in line with the ruling [[communist regime]]. The new massive construction activity focused on uniform tenement houses, from 1960s built with concrete panels (so-called \"[[panel\u00e1k]]\"). The local industry was further expanded and the life of the town was strongly influenced by strong  army garrison (located in two barracks built in 1899 and 1933 respectively). In 1960 neighboring village Borek was merged with Rokycany, in 1980 another three rural communities ([[Kamenn\u00fd \u00dajezd (Rokycany District)]], [[Litohlavy]], [[Svojkovice (Rokycany District)]]) joined Rokycany (however all 3 have separated in the 1990s)[http://encyklopedierokycan.sweb.cz/rokycanyhomepage.htm]\n\n==Geography==\nRokycany is divided into four districts: \"St\u0159ed\" (Center), \"Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto\" (New Town), \"Plze\u0148sk\u00e9 p\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed\" (Plze\u0148 Suburb) and \"[[Borek (Rokycany Municipal District)|Borek]]\".\n\n'''St\u0159ed''' encompasses the historical core of the town with two main squares, main church of Panna Marie Sn\u011b\u017en\u00e1 and town-hall. Since 1992 the historical core of Rokycany has been declared protected zone in order to protect the architecture. The border of this  district largely follows the path of former town's fortification. The medieval walls are still standing in several short sections. On the southern side the walls have been replaced by a representative avenue (Jir\u00e1skova ulice) with several major public buildings such as \"sokolovna\" ([[Sokol]] organization headquarters) from 1903, new railway-station from 1931, gymn\u00e1zium (grammar-school) from 1905 or municipal bank from 1933.\n\n'''Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto''' is by far most populous district surrounding the historical core from north, east and south. It evolved from traditional ''Pra\u017esk\u00e9 p\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed suburb'' which was located on both banks of the Klabava river along the road to Prague (Pra\u017esk\u00e1 ulice) and Nerudovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed square. After World War II most of the old suburb was demolished and replaced by several housing projects. With the population growth the built-up area of Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto expanded in all directions. There are thus several distinct modern neighborhoods. ''Pr\u00e1chovna'' is located in the southeastern section of Rokycany on  the banks of the Klabava River. Several industrial estates and colony of cheap tenement houses for local workers from early 20th century form most of Pr\u00e1chovna. ''P\u00e1clovna'' is situated along the road to Prague on Rokycany's eastern outskirts. It mainly consists of private houses, the Demarcation line memorial is located here (commemorating the meeting of American and Russian troops that occurred here in 1945), ''Oseck\u00fd vrch'' lies in the north along the road to the village of Osek. In 1957 large hospital was built here. There are large parks covering the surrounding slopes (Husovy sady and Kalv\u00e1rie) and large complex of town swimming-pool and football stadium. ''Ji\u017en\u00ed p\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed'' covers territory south of the Prague-Plze\u0148 railway. It consists of several industrial zones and populous housing projects from the 1950s and 1970s. The military barracks built in 1933 have been converted into a residential and industrial zone recently.\n\n'''Plze\u0148sk\u00e9 p\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed''' forms western part of Rokycany. It started in medieval era as a small cluster of rural houses adjoining Rokycany's historical core. In early 17th century Protestant church Nejsv\u011bt\u011bj\u0161\u00ed Trojice was built here, soon after taken by Catholics. In 19th century Plze\u0148sk\u00e9 p\u0159edm\u011bst\u00ed quickly grew along the road to Plze\u0148 (Plze\u0148sk\u00e1 ulice), mainly industrial development was later accompanied by residential houses. In 1920s massive housing project started on Rokycany's southern outskirts. The new neighbourhood was later called ''Ra\u0161\u00ednov'' ([[Alois Ra\u0161\u00edn]] was finance minister of Czechoslovakia, assassinated in 1923). In consists solely of private houses in [[art-deco]] style. In 1930's another neighborhood was inaugurated in the western periphery, called ''Za Rakov\u00e1\u010dkem''. It also features almost exclusively private residential houses.\n\n[[Borek (Rokycany Municipal District)|Borek]] used to be an independent village located ca.2&nbsp;km east of Rokycany. In 1960 Borek came under the jurisdiction of Rokycany. The Boreck\u00fd rybn\u00edk lake is most notorious landmark of this district. In the 20th century the built-up area of Borek expanded amalgamating the village with Rokycany.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Rokycany-church Panna Marie Snezna.jpg|Main church in Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-main square.jpg|Main square in Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-town hall and main square.jpg|Town hall and main square in Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-Borek-chapel.jpg|Chapel in Borek, Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-railway station.jpg|Railway station from 1931, Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-communist era buildings.jpg|1970's style houses in Rokycany\nImage:Rokycany-barracks.jpg|1930s army barracks in Rokycany\n</gallery>\n\n== Demography ==\n{{Historical populations\n|1811|2226\n|1848|3292\n|1869|4187\n|1880|4927\n|1890|5010\n|1900|5501\n|1910|6492\n|1921|6728\n|1930|7741\n|1939|9865\n|1950|8789\n|1961|11934\n|1970|12585\n|1980|15041\n|1991|15188\n|2001|14369\n|2007|14302\n|2008|14705\n|2019|14192\n|source = [http://encyklopedierokycan.sweb.cz/rokycanyhomepage.htm unofficial pages of Rokycany by David Borek]\n}}\nIn 19th century Rokycany's population quickly expanded pushing the number of inhabitants towards 5,000 in 1880. In the wake of [[Long Depression]] (economic slowdown of the 1870s which affected the economy of Austria-Hungary) the growth stopped. In late 1890s however population began to expand again, only to halt during World War I. In post-1918 era Rokycany grew rapidly. In the late 1930s this growth was further spurred by influx of ethnic Czech refugees from [[Sudetenland]]. In 1939 Rokycany's population touched 10,000 mark briefly. After World War II many citizens of Rokycany left the town for border regions from where the ethnic Germans were expelled. From the 1950s a new wave of massive growth started, pushing the town's population past 10,000 in the mid 1950s and past 15,000 in the 1980s. Demographic maximum was reached in 1989 with more than 16,000 inhabitants. Since that time the population dropped to ca. 14,000 as a result of economic a social transition and also of separation of 3 villages from the community of Rokycany.\n\nEthnically, Rokycany has been a predominately Czech settlement since [[Middle Ages]]. The German minority accounted for no more than couple of dozens individuals. In 1938 the town's population was boosted by influx of ethnic Czechs fleeing the border regions of Czechoslovakia which had been ceded to [[Nazi Germany]]. After 1945 most ethnic Germans [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|were expelled]]. The ethnic mix of Rokycany was in the post-World War II era enriched by Romas (Gypsies) and Slovaks.\n\n==Events==\nRokycany hosts [[Fluff Fest]], a [[vegan]] [[hardcore punk]] festival which draws several thousand visitors from across Europe every July. It is held at the Rokycany airfield, having moved there in 2006 from its original location in Plze\u0148.

As the star evolves away from the main sequence, subsequent nuclear burning produces an iron-rich core. When all nuclear fuel in the core has been exhausted, the core must be supported by degeneracy pressure alone. Further deposits of mass from shell burning cause the core to exceed the [[Chandrasekhar limit]]. Electron-degeneracy pressure is overcome and the core collapses further, sending temperatures soaring to over {{val|5|e=9|u=K}}. At these temperatures, [[photodisintegration]] (the breaking up of iron nuclei into [[alpha particle]]s by high-energy gamma rays) occurs. As the temperature climbs even higher, electrons and protons combine to form neutrons via [[electron capture]], releasing a flood of [[neutrino]]s. When densities reach nuclear density of {{val|4|e=17|u=kg/m<sup>3</sup>}}, a combination of [[strong force]] repulsion and neutron degeneracy pressure halts the contraction. <ref>{{cite journal |first=I. |last=Bombaci |date=1996 |title=The Maximum Mass of a Neutron Star |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=305 | pages=871\u2013877 |bibcode=1996A&A...305..871B}}</ref> The infalling outer envelope of the star is halted and flung outwards by a flux of neutrinos produced in the creation of the neutrons, becoming a supernova.

But, because it has only a tiny fraction of its parent's radius (and therefore its [[moment of inertia]] is sharply reduced), a neutron star is formed with very high rotation speed, and then over a very long period it slows. Neutron stars are known that have rotation periods from about 1.4&nbsp;ms to 30&nbsp;s. The neutron star's density also gives it very high [[surface gravity]], with typical values ranging from 10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (more than 10<sup>11</sup> times that of [[Earth]]).<ref name=\"Haensel\" /> One measure of such immense gravity is the fact that neutron stars have an [[escape velocity]] ranging from [[Orders of magnitude (speed)#8|100,000 km/s]] to [[Orders of magnitude (speed)#8|150,000 km/s]], that is, from a third to half the [[speed of light]].

The majority of known neutron stars (about 2000, as of 2010) have been discovered as pulsars, emitting regular radio pulses.\n\nIn 1971, [[Riccardo Giacconi]], Herbert Gursky, Ed Kellogg, R.

As the star evolves away from the main sequence, subsequent nuclear burning produces an iron-rich core. When all nuclear fuel in the core has been exhausted, the core must be supported by degeneracy pressure alone. Further deposits of mass from shell burning cause the core to exceed the [[Chandrasekhar limit]]. Electron-degeneracy pressure is overcome and the core collapses further, sending temperatures soaring to over {{val|5|e=9|u=K}}. At these temperatures, [[photodisintegration]] (the breaking up of iron nuclei into [[alpha particle]]s by high-energy gamma rays) occurs. As the temperature climbs even higher, electrons and protons combine to form neutrons via [[electron capture]], releasing a flood of [[neutrino]]s. When densities reach nuclear density of {{val|4|e=17|u=kg/m<sup>3</sup>}}, a combination of [[strong force]] repulsion and neutron degeneracy pressure halts the contraction. <ref>{{cite journal |first=I. |last=Bombaci |date=1996 |title=The Maximum Mass of a Neutron Star |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=305 | pages=871\u2013877 |bibcode=1996A&A...305..871B}}</ref> The infalling outer envelope of the star is halted and flung outwards by a flux of neutrinos produced in the creation of the neutrons, becoming a supernova.

Neutron stars are known that have rotation periods from about 1.4&nbsp;ms to 30&nbsp;s. The neutron star's density also gives it very high [[surface gravity]], with typical values ranging from 10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (more than 10<sup>11</sup> times that of [[Earth]]).<ref name=\"Haensel\" /> One measure of such immense gravity is the fact that neutron stars have an [[escape velocity]] ranging from [[Orders of magnitude (speed)#8|100,000 km/s]] to [[Orders of magnitude (speed)#8|150,000 km/s]], that is, from a third to half the [[speed of light]].

It is statistically probable based on known populations that there is at least one neutron star within 10 parsecs of the Sun, significantly closer than the current nearest known neutron star.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Binary neutron star systems==\n{{anchor|Binary neutron stars}}<!-- used by incoming redirects -->\n[[File:15-137-CircinusX1-XRayLightRings-NeutronStar-Chandra-20150624.jpg|thumb|[[Circinus X-1]]: X-ray light rings from a binary neutron star (24 June 2015; [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]])]]\n\nAbout 5% of all known neutron stars are members of a [[binary system (astronomy)|binary system]].

These can be original, [[circumbinary planet|circumbinary]], captured, or the result of a second round of planet formation. Pulsars can also strip the atmosphere off from a star, leaving a planetary-mass remnant, which may be understood as a [[chthonian planet]] or a stellar object depending on interpretation. For pulsars, such [[pulsar planet]]s can be detected with the [[pulsar timing method]], which allows for high precision and detection of much smaller planets than with other methods. Two systems have been definitively confirmed. The first exoplanets ever to be detected were the three planets Draugr, Poltergeist and Phobetor around [[PSR B1257+12]], discovered in 1992\u20131994. Of these, [[PSR B1257+12 A|Draugr]] is the smallest exoplanet ever detected, at a mass of twice that of the Moon. Another system is [[PSR B1620\u221226]], where a [[circumbinary planet]] orbits a neutron star-white dwarf binary system. Also, there are several unconfirmed candidates. Pulsar planets receive little visible light, but massive amounts of ionizing radiation and high-energy stellar wind, which makes them rather hostile environments.\n\n==History of discoveries==\n[[Image:IsolatedNeutronStar.jpg|thumb|left|The first direct observation of a neutron star in visible light.

Neutron stars were thought to be too faint to be detectable and little work was done on them until November 1967, when [[Franco Pacini]] pointed out that if the neutron stars were spinning and had large magnetic fields, then electromagnetic waves would be emitted. Unbeknown to him, radio astronomer [[Antony Hewish]] and his research assistant [[Jocelyn Bell]] at Cambridge were shortly to detect radio pulses from stars that are now believed to be highly magnetized, rapidly spinning neutron stars, known as pulsars.\n\nIn 1965, [[Antony Hewish]] and [[Samuel Okoye]] discovered \"an unusual source of high radio brightness temperature in the [[Crab Nebula]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Nature |volume=207 |issue=4992 |pages=59\u201360 |title=Evidence of an unusual source of high radio brightness temperature in the Crab Nebula |last=Hewish |first=A. |last2=Okoye |first2=S.

He was arrested for subversive activities by the French colonial authorities in 1919 and died in prison a few weeks later. Gi\u00e1p had two sisters and one brother, and soon after his father's incarceration, one of his sisters was also arrested. Although she was not held for long, the privations of prison life made her ill and she too died a few weeks after being released.<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 19.</ref>\n\nGi\u00e1p was taught at home by his father before going to the village school. His precocious intelligence meant that he was soon transferred to the district school and in 1924, at the age of thirteen, he left home to attend the Qu\u1ed1c H\u1ecdc (also known in English as the \"National Academy\"), a French-run ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' in [[Hu\u1ebf]].<ref name=\"RFI\"/> This school had been founded by a Catholic official named Ngo Dinh Kha, and his son, [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] also attended it.

In 1943 Cung adopted the name [[Ho Chi Minh]].<ref>Macdonald 1993, pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nAt age 14, Gi\u00e1p became a messenger for the [[Haiphong]] Power Company. He was expelled from the school after two years for taking part in protests, and went home to his village for a while. While there, he joined the ''[[T\u00e2n Vi\u1ec7t Revolutionary Party]]'', an underground group founded in 1924, which introduced him to [[communism]].<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 20.</ref> He returned to Hue and continued his political activities.

Currey<ref>Currey 2005, pp. 28\u201331.</ref> to have also spent some time in the prestigious Hanoi [[Lyc\u00e9e Albert Sarraut]], where the local elite was educated to serve the colonial regime. He was said to have been in the same class as [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]], a future Prime Minister, who has also denied having studied at Albert Sarraut, and [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], the last [[Emperor of Annam]].

She too had learned nationalism from her father and had joined the revolutionary activities which Gi\u00e1p was involved with. In June 1938 (or, according to some sources{{specify|date=December 2018}}, April 1939) they were married and in May 1939 they had a daughter, Hong Anh (Red Queen of Flowers).<ref name=Willbanks229/><ref>{{cite book|first=Phillip B.|last=Davidson|title=Vietnam at War: The History|location=Novato|publisher=Presidio Press|year=1988|page=[https://archive.org/details/vietnamatwarhist00davi/page/7 7]|isbn=0-89141-306-5|url=https://archive.org/details/vietnamatwarhist00davi/page/7}}</ref> Gi\u00e1p's busy political activities took a toll on his postgraduate studies, and he failed to pass the examinations for the Certificate of Administrative Law. Unable therefore to practice as a lawyer, he took a job as a history teacher at the Th\u0103ng Long School in Hanoi.<ref>Currey 2005, p. 32.</ref>\n\nAs well as teaching in school, Gi\u00e1p was busy producing and writing articles for ''Ti\u1ebfng D\u00e2n'' (Voice of the People) founded by [[Hu\u1ef3nh Th\u00fac Kh\u00e1ng]] and many other revolutionary newspapers, while actively participating in various revolutionary movements. All the while, Gi\u00e1p was a dedicated reader of military history and philosophy, revering [[Sun Tzu]].<ref>For details of Sun Tzu's influence on Gi\u00e1p see: Forbes, Andrew & Henley, David (2012), ''The Illustrated Art of War: Sun Tzu'', Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books, ASIN B00B91XX8U.</ref> He also made a particular study of [[Napoleon]]'s generalship, and greatly admired [[T. E. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'', learning from it practical examples of how to apply minimum military force to maximum effect.<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 23.</ref> During the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] years in France, he founded ''H\u1ed3n Tr\u1ebb t\u1eadp m\u1edbi'' (Soul of Youth),<ref name=Willbanks229>Willbanks 2013, p. 229.</ref> an underground socialist newspaper. He also founded the French-language paper ''[[Le Travail Movement|Le Travail]]'' (on which [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n \u0110\u1ed3ng]] also worked).\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], the French authorities outlawed the Indochinese Communist Party. Its leaders decided that Gi\u00e1p should leave Vietnam and go into exile in China. On 3 May 1940 he said farewell to his wife, left Hanoi and crossed the border into China. Gi\u00e1p's wife went to her family home in Vinh, where she was arrested, sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, and incarcerated in the [[Hoa Lo Central Prison]] in Hanoi.<ref>Macdonald 1993, pp. 22\u201323.</ref> In China, Gi\u00e1p joined up with [[H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]], then an adviser to the [[People's Liberation Army]]. Gi\u00e1p adopted the alias Duong Huai-nan, learned to speak and write Chinese, and studied the strategy and tactics of the Chinese Communist Party.<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 27.</ref>\n\nIn September 1940, [[Vichy France]] agreed to the [[Japanese occupation of Vietnam]], to 'protect' Indochina. In May 1941 the Eighth Congress of the Indochinese Communist Party decided to form the [[Viet Minh]]; Gi\u00e1p was made responsible for establishing an intelligence network and organising political bases in the far north of the country. To begin propaganda work among the population, a news-sheet called ''Vi\u1ec7t Nam \u0110\u1ed9c L\u1eadp'' was produced. Gi\u00e1p wrote many articles for it, and was repeatedly criticised by Ho Chi Minh for the excessive verbosity of his writing style.<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 28.</ref>\n\n=== Military career ===\nIn 1942, Gi\u00e1p and about forty men moved back into Vietnam and established themselves in remote caves near the village of [[V\u00f5 Nhai District|Vu Nhai]]. This and similar small groups in the mountains were the basis of the [[Viet Minh]], the armed wing of the Vietnam Independence League. The local [[N\u00f9ng people|Nung hill people]] spoke little Vietnamese, so Gi\u00e1p and his colleagues had to learn local dialects and draw pictures to communicate.

The formation of the Vietnam Liberation army was proclaimed, with Gi\u00e1p as its commander. Ho Chi Minh directed him to establish Armed Propaganda Brigades and the first one, consisting of thirty one men and three women, was formed in December 1944. Named the [[Tran Hung Dao]] Platoon after the great Vietnamese hero, it was armed with two revolvers, seventeen rifles, one light machine gun, and fourteen breech-loading flintlocks dating from the Russo-Japanese War.<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 32.</ref>\n\nHo Chi Minh decided that for propaganda purposes, the Armed Propaganda Unit had to win a military victory within a month of being established, so on 25 December 1944 Gi\u00e1p led successful attacks against French outposts at Khai Phat and Na Ngan. Two French lieutenants were killed and the Vietnamese soldiers in the outposts surrendered. The Viet Minh attackers suffered no casualties. A few weeks later, Gi\u00e1p was wounded in the leg when his group attacked another outpost at Dong Mu.<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 33.</ref>\n\nThrough the first half of 1945, Gi\u00e1p's military position strengthened as the political position of the French and Japanese weakened. On 9 March the Japanese removed the titular French regime and placed the emperor [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]] at the head of a puppet state, the [[Empire of Vietnam]].\n\nBy April the Vietminh had nearly five thousand members, and was able to attack Japanese posts with confidence. Between May and August 1945, the United States, keen to support anti-Japanese forces in mainland Asia, actively supplied and trained Gi\u00e1p and the Viet Minh. Major [[Archimedes Patti]], in charge of the so-called 'Deer Team' unit, taught the Viet Minh to use flamethrowers, grenade launchers and machine guns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-bf3262-interview-with-archimedes-l-a-patti-1981|title=WGBH Open Vault \u2013 Interview with Archimedes L.

Up to then, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had allowed nationalist and other newspapers to publish, but when they began attacking and vilifying Gi\u00e1p he cracked down on them and closed them all. He also deployed Viet Minh forces against non-communist nationalist troops in the suburbs of Hanoi, and had their leaders arrested, imprisoned, or killed. During this period he also began a relationship with a famous and beautiful dancer, Thuong Huyen, and was seen in public with her at nightclubs. This conduct caused serious concern in the upper ranks of the Party as it was contrary to the very strict and abstemious moral code by which all members were expected to abide.

They offered to help set up a national government and promised that they would eventually grant Vietnam its independence.

Gi\u00e1p ordered his men to dig a trench system that encircled the French. From the outer trench, other trenches and tunnels were gradually dug inward towards the center. The Viet Minh were now able to move in close to the French troops defending Dien Bien Phu.\n\nWhen Navarre realized that he was trapped, he appealed for help. The United States was approached and some advisers suggested the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s against the Viet Minh, but this was never seriously considered. Another suggestion was that conventional air raids would be enough to scatter Gi\u00e1p's troops. U.S. President [[Dwight D.

This involved collectivisation of agriculture and central management of all economic production.<ref>Macdonald 1993, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> This process did not go smoothly and it led to food shortages and revolts. At the 10th Plenum of the Communist Party, 27\u201329 October 1956, Gi\u00e1p stood in front of the assembled delegates and said:\n\n{{quote|Cadres, in carrying out their antifeudal task, created contradictions in the tasks of land reform and the Revolution, in some areas treating them as if they were separate activities.

In South Vietnam there were still several thousand guerillas, known as [[Viet Cong]], fighting against the government in Saigon.

President [[Richard Nixon]], like President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] before him, was convinced that a U.S. withdrawal was necessary, but four years would pass before the last American troops departed.\n\nIn October 1972, the negotiators came close to agreeing to a formula to end the conflict. The proposal was that the remaining U.S. troops would withdraw from South Vietnam in exchange for a cease-fire and the return of American prisoners held by H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i. It was also agreed that the governments in North and South Vietnam would remain in power, and reunification would be \"carried out step by step through peaceful means\". Although the North's ''Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 Offensive'' during the spring of 1972 was beaten back with high casualties, the proposal did not require them to leave the South. PAVN would thus be able to maintain a foothold in South Vietnam from which to launch future offensives.\n\nIn an effort to put pressure on both North and South Vietnam during the negotiations, President Nixon ordered a series of air raids on Hanoi and [[Haiphong]], codenamed [[Operation Linebacker II]]. The operation ended on 27 January 1973, after 12 days with heavy casualties and destruction. Both the U.S. and North Vietnam then agreed to sign the [[Paris Peace Accords]] that had been proposed in October. South Vietnam objected, but had little choice but to accept it. Clearly, the advantage had been given to Hanoi.\n\nThe last U.S. combat troops left in March 1973. Despite the treaty, there was no end in fighting. South Vietnamese attempts to regain communist controlled territory inspired their opponents to change strategy. Communist leaders met in Hanoi in March for a series of meetings to plan for a massive offensive against the South. In June 1973, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]], which prohibited any further U.S. military involvement, and the PAVN [[Ho Chi Minh trail|supply routes]] could operate normally without any fear of U.S. bombing.\n\n===== Fall of Saigon =====\n{{main|1975 Spring Offensive|Fall of Saigon}}\nThe standard view of this period is that after [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s death in September 1969, Gi\u00e1p lost a power struggle in 1972 shortly after the failed [[Easter Offensive]] where he was blamed by the Politburo for the offensive's failure. Gi\u00e1p was recalled to Hanoi where he was replaced as field commander of the PAVN and from then on watched subsequent events from the sidelines, with the glory of victory in 1975 going to the chief of the general staff, General [[V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng]].

Its leaders decided that Gi\u00e1p should leave Vietnam and go into exile in China. On 3 May 1940 he said farewell to his wife, left Hanoi and crossed the border into China. Gi\u00e1p's wife went to her family home in Vinh, where she was arrested, sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, and incarcerated in the [[Hoa Lo Central Prison]] in Hanoi.<ref>Macdonald 1993, pp. 22\u201323.</ref> In China, Gi\u00e1p joined up with [[H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]], then an adviser to the [[People's Liberation Army]].

In May 1941 the Eighth Congress of the Indochinese Communist Party decided to form the [[Viet Minh]]; Gi\u00e1p was made responsible for establishing an intelligence network and organising political bases in the far north of the country. To begin propaganda work among the population, a news-sheet called ''Vi\u1ec7t Nam \u0110\u1ed9c L\u1eadp'' was produced. Gi\u00e1p wrote many articles for it, and was repeatedly criticised by Ho Chi Minh for the excessive verbosity of his writing style.<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 28.</ref>\n\n=== Military career ===\nIn 1942, Gi\u00e1p and about forty men moved back into Vietnam and established themselves in remote caves near the village of [[V\u00f5 Nhai District|Vu Nhai]]. This and similar small groups in the mountains were the basis of the [[Viet Minh]], the armed wing of the Vietnam Independence League. The local [[N\u00f9ng people|Nung hill people]] spoke little Vietnamese, so Gi\u00e1p and his colleagues had to learn local dialects and draw pictures to communicate.

By the end of 1943 several hundred men and women had joined the Viet Minh.<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 31.</ref> It was in the summer of 1943 that Gi\u00e1p was told that his wife had been beaten to death by guards in the central prison in Hanoi.\nHer sister was guillotined and Gi\u00e1p's daughter died in prison of unknown causes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9bk8ecUVoMkC&pg=PT101&lpg=PT101&dq=giap+wife+beaten&source=bl&ots=TK5uEb3PI9&sig=s3ev9ZXD1QJSmrZ8OuTXB5pI_wM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwittObKqYHZAhUBGpQKHfyKAOoQ6AEwBXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=giap+wife+beaten&f=false|title=10,000 Days of Thunder: A History of the Vietnam War|first=Philip|last=Caputo|date=15 November 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1944 the first Revolutionary Party Military Conference was held and it was agreed that the time was now right to take the military struggle forward into a new phase. The formation of the Vietnam Liberation army was proclaimed, with Gi\u00e1p as its commander. Ho Chi Minh directed him to establish Armed Propaganda Brigades and the first one, consisting of thirty one men and three women, was formed in December 1944. Named the [[Tran Hung Dao]] Platoon after the great Vietnamese hero, it was armed with two revolvers, seventeen rifles, one light machine gun, and fourteen breech-loading flintlocks dating from the Russo-Japanese War.<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 32.</ref>\n\nHo Chi Minh decided that for propaganda purposes, the Armed Propaganda Unit had to win a military victory within a month of being established, so on 25 December 1944 Gi\u00e1p led successful attacks against French outposts at Khai Phat and Na Ngan. Two French lieutenants were killed and the Vietnamese soldiers in the outposts surrendered. The Viet Minh attackers suffered no casualties. A few weeks later, Gi\u00e1p was wounded in the leg when his group attacked another outpost at Dong Mu.<ref>Macdonald 1993, p. 33.</ref>\n\nThrough the first half of 1945, Gi\u00e1p's military position strengthened as the political position of the French and Japanese weakened. On 9 March the Japanese removed the titular French regime and placed the emperor [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]] at the head of a puppet state, the [[Empire of Vietnam]].\n\nBy April the Vietminh had nearly five thousand members, and was able to attack Japanese posts with confidence. Between May and August 1945, the United States, keen to support anti-Japanese forces in mainland Asia, actively supplied and trained Gi\u00e1p and the Viet Minh. Major [[Archimedes Patti]], in charge of the so-called 'Deer Team' unit, taught the Viet Minh to use flamethrowers, grenade launchers and machine guns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-bf3262-interview-with-archimedes-l-a-patti-1981|title=WGBH Open Vault \u2013 Interview with Archimedes L.

Truman]], Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and Premier [[Joseph Stalin]] had already decided the future of postwar Vietnam at a summit meeting at [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]].

Ho Chi Minh and V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p pursued lengthy negotiations with the French, seeking to avoid an all-out war to cement their independence. Gi\u00e1p led the Vietnamese delegation at the Dalat conference in April 1946, which yielded nothing,<ref>Jennings, Eric T. (2011). ''Imperial Heights: Dalat and the Making and Undoing of French Indochina''. [[University of California Press]]. pp. 233\u2013234.</ref> and, returning to Hanoi, he was made Minister of Defense.

Up to then, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had allowed nationalist and other newspapers to publish, but when they began attacking and vilifying Gi\u00e1p he cracked down on them and closed them all. He also deployed Viet Minh forces against non-communist nationalist troops in the suburbs of Hanoi, and had their leaders arrested, imprisoned, or killed. During this period he also began a relationship with a famous and beautiful dancer, Thuong Huyen, and was seen in public with her at nightclubs. This conduct caused serious concern in the upper ranks of the Party as it was contrary to the very strict and abstemious moral code by which all members were expected to abide. Wanting to protect him, Ho Chi Minh arranged for him to meet a graduate from a well-known family, Ba Hanh.\n\nThey married in August 1946, and went on to have four children.<ref>Macdonald 1993, pp. 73\u201374.</ref> [[B\u00f9i Di\u1ec5m]], a former student of Giap and the former South Vietnamese Ambassador to the United States, states during this period Giap and the Viet Minh had purged thousands of anti-colonial nationalists.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/26/us/washington-talk-bui-diem-a-voice-from-vietnam-hoping-to-be-heard.html|title=Washington Talk: Bui Diem; A voice from Vietnam hoping to be heard|last=Gamarekian|first=Barbara|access-date=19 June 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== First Indochina War ====\n{{main|North Vietnam|First Indochina War|Battle of Dien Bien Phu}}\nThe tense standoff between the Vietnamese government and the French occupiers escalated dramatically on 23 October when the French commander [[Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu|Argenlieu]] ordered the cruiser ''[[French cruiser Suffren|Suffren]]'' to bombard [[Haiphong]] in response to repeated skirmishes with Vietnamese forces as they tried to bring arms and contraband into the port.

Gi\u00e1p ordered his men to dig a trench system that encircled the French. From the outer trench, other trenches and tunnels were gradually dug inward towards the center. The Viet Minh were now able to move in close to the French troops defending Dien Bien Phu.\n\nWhen Navarre realized that he was trapped, he appealed for help. The United States was approached and some advisers suggested the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s against the Viet Minh, but this was never seriously considered. Another suggestion was that conventional air raids would be enough to scatter Gi\u00e1p's troops. U.S. President [[Dwight D.

This involved collectivisation of agriculture and central management of all economic production.<ref>Macdonald 1993, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> This process did not go smoothly and it led to food shortages and revolts. At the 10th Plenum of the Communist Party, 27\u201329 October 1956, Gi\u00e1p stood in front of the assembled delegates and said:\n\n{{quote|Cadres, in carrying out their antifeudal task, created contradictions in the tasks of land reform and the Revolution, in some areas treating them as if they were separate activities.

In South Vietnam there were still several thousand guerillas, known as [[Viet Cong]], fighting against the government in Saigon.

The best evidence indicates that he disliked the plan, and when it became obvious that [[L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n]] and [[V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng]] were going to conduct it anyway, he left Vietnam for medical treatment in Hungary, and did not return until after the offensive had begun.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Merle |last=Pribbenow |title=General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p and the Mysterious Evolution of the Plan for the 1968 T\u1ebft Offensive |journal=[[Journal of Vietnamese Studies]] |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=1\u201333 |doi=10.1525/vs.2008.3.2.1 }}</ref> Although this attempt to spark a general uprising against the southern government failed disastrously, it was a significant political victory through convincing American politicians and the public that their commitment to [[South Vietnam]] could not be open-ended.

WGBH Media Library & Archives. Retrieved 9 November 2010.</ref>\n\nPeace talks between representatives from the United States, South Vietnam, [[North Vietnam]], and the [[Viet Cong|NLF]] began in Paris in January 1969. President [[Richard Nixon]], like President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] before him, was convinced that a U.S. withdrawal was necessary, but four years would pass before the last American troops departed.\n\nIn October 1972, the negotiators came close to agreeing to a formula to end the conflict. The proposal was that the remaining U.S. troops would withdraw from South Vietnam in exchange for a cease-fire and the return of American prisoners held by H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i. It was also agreed that the governments in North and South Vietnam would remain in power, and reunification would be \"carried out step by step through peaceful means\". Although the North's ''Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 Offensive'' during the spring of 1972 was beaten back with high casualties, the proposal did not require them to leave the South. PAVN would thus be able to maintain a foothold in South Vietnam from which to launch future offensives.\n\nIn an effort to put pressure on both North and South Vietnam during the negotiations, President Nixon ordered a series of air raids on Hanoi and [[Haiphong]], codenamed [[Operation Linebacker II]]. The operation ended on 27 January 1973, after 12 days with heavy casualties and destruction. Both the U.S. and North Vietnam then agreed to sign the [[Paris Peace Accords]] that had been proposed in October. South Vietnam objected, but had little choice but to accept it. Clearly, the advantage had been given to Hanoi.\n\nThe last U.S. combat troops left in March 1973. Despite the treaty, there was no end in fighting. South Vietnamese attempts to regain communist controlled territory inspired their opponents to change strategy. Communist leaders met in Hanoi in March for a series of meetings to plan for a massive offensive against the South. In June 1973, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]], which prohibited any further U.S. military involvement, and the PAVN [[Ho Chi Minh trail|supply routes]] could operate normally without any fear of U.S. bombing.\n\n===== Fall of Saigon =====\n{{main|1975 Spring Offensive|Fall of Saigon}}\nThe standard view of this period is that after [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s death in September 1969, Gi\u00e1p lost a power struggle in 1972 shortly after the failed [[Easter Offensive]] where he was blamed by the Politburo for the offensive's failure. Gi\u00e1p was recalled to Hanoi where he was replaced as field commander of the PAVN and from then on watched subsequent events from the sidelines, with the glory of victory in 1975 going to the chief of the general staff, General [[V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng]].

In the new government, Gi\u00e1p maintained his position as Minister of National Defense and he was made Deputy Prime Minister in July 1976. In December 1978 he oversaw the successful [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia]] which drove the [[Khmer Rouge]] from power and ended the [[Cambodian genocide]]. In retaliation, Cambodia's ally China responded by [[Sino-Vietnamese War|invading the Cao Bang province]] of Vietnam in January 1979 and once again Gi\u00e1p was in overall responsibility for the response, which drove the Chinese out after a few months.<ref>Macdonald 1993, pp. 337\u2013338.</ref> He finally retired from his post at the Defense Ministry in 1981 and retired from the Politburo in 1982.

According to Frisby, \"Giap understood that protracted warfare would cost many lives but that did not always translate into winning or losing the war. In the final analysis, Giap won the war despite losing many battles, and as long as the army survived to fight another day, the idea of Vietnam lived in the hearts of the people who would support it, and that is the essence of 'revolutionary war'.\"<ref>Gabriel Dom\u00ednguez, [http://www.dw.de/vo-nguyen-giap-a-master-of-revolutionary-war/a-17141733 \"Vo Nguyen Giap \u2013 'A master of revolutionary war'\"], Deutsche Welle, 7 October 2013. {{in lang|de}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Gi\u00e1p became a prominent critic of [[bauxite mining in Vietnam]] following government plans to open large areas of the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] to the practice.

This coincided with the establishment of Hainan as a separate administrative region. In September 1988,the authority's name was officially changed to the \"Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority\". On 25 December 2006, Woody Island 'census-town's' first-ever \"Residents' and Fishermen's Congress\" was held. Three representatives at the township and village levels were selected to represent the census-town's Neighborhood Committee of the North and South Villages. The Neighborhood Committee began work on Woody Island the following day with an office at the Border Guards of the Paracels' Police Station. These were the first ever actual subdivisions created within the county-level authority.<ref name=\"Beijing Review\"/>\n<!--\nBefore the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea]]'s (UNCLOS III) addendums to the Law of the Sea, the Central government had always maintained a claim to nearly 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup> (1.35 million sq. mi.) in maritime area of the South China Sea {{fact|date=August 2012}}, which equated to roughly one-third of China's total land area. The Central government claimed this as part of China's sovereign [[territorial waters]], commonly known as \"China's blue territories\". It was delineated on maps by the 9 or 10 dashed lines. Although many Chinese maps published after UNCLOS III still retain these dashed lines, they have no legal value and are used solely as a reference line to denote that \"all features (islands, reefs, banks, shoals, cays, sands) located within the dashed lines are sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China\". UNCLOS III, which has been ratified by China, went into force on the 16 November 1994. New [[Baseline (sea)|baselines]] of the [[Mainland China|mainland]] and the Paracels were released on the 15 May 1996. The addendum for the EEZ's extension via [[Continental shelf#Economic significance|Continental Shelves (in the legal sense)]] was also handed to the [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] (CLCS). Coupled with officially published laws of the past, China's new [[internal waters]] and [[territorial waters]], namely, China's \"blue territories\", could thus be calculated to an area of approximately {{convert|31000|km2|abbr=on}}.\n-->\n\nThe prospect of the establishment of a \"city\" on Woody Island was first publicized on 19 November 2007 in a report by [[Mingpao]], a Hong Kong-based newspaper, through a telephone interview with a Mr. Zhang of the Propaganda Department of [[Wenchang]], Hainan.

The rest of the Paracels, the Zhongsha Islands and the Spratlys were only accessible to military personnel. The situation was improved in 1977 with the construction of a freighter given approval by then Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Having a tonnage of 2160 tonnes and a maximum load of 200 passengers, the \"Qiongsha 1\" (literally \"Hainan-South China Sea Islands 1\") freighter carried supplies and people between Woody Island and Hainan Island. In 1997, \"Qiongsha 1\" was destroyed in a typhoon while en route to [[Zhanjiang]], [[Guangdong]] Province for routine maintenance and upkeep. A smaller \"Qiongsha 2\" freighter of 1410 tonnes and a maximum load of 100 passengers was commissioned that same year. It operated for 10 years, and was decommissioned in January 2007.\n\nSince 2008, the \"lifeboat\" of the islands is the \"Qiongsha 3\" freighter (Tonnage: 2500 tonnes; Load: 200 passengers; Payload: 750 tonnes in cargo; Length: 84 metres; Width: 13.8 metres). This is essentially the only means of transportation to and from the islands for non-military personnel (mostly fishermen and researchers). Its maiden voyage was on 10 February 2007, and it has been sailing regularly between [[Wenchang]]'s Qinglan Port on southeastern Hainan Island and Woody Island in the Paracels roughly every 20 days. A normal trip takes 13 to 15 hours, navigating between dangerous reefs and banks, through a distance of {{convert|186|nmi|km}}. -->\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China}}\n* [[Administrative divisions of

This coincided with the establishment of Hainan as a separate administrative region. In September 1988,the authority's name was officially changed to the \"Hainan Province Paracels, Spratlys, and Zhongsha Islands Authority\". On 25 December 2006, Woody Island 'census-town's' first-ever \"Residents' and Fishermen's Congress\" was held. Three representatives at the township and village levels were selected to represent the census-town's Neighborhood Committee of the North and South Villages. The Neighborhood Committee began work on Woody Island the following day with an office at the Border Guards of the Paracels' Police Station. These were the first ever actual subdivisions created within the county-level authority.<ref name=\"Beijing Review\"/>\n<!--\nBefore the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea]]'s (UNCLOS III) addendums to the Law of the Sea, the Central government had always maintained a claim to nearly 3.5 million km<sup>2</sup> (1.35 million sq. mi.) in maritime area of the South China Sea {{fact|date=August 2012}}, which equated to roughly one-third of China's total land area. The Central government claimed this as part of China's sovereign [[territorial waters]], commonly known as \"China's blue territories\". It was delineated on maps by the 9 or 10 dashed lines. Although many Chinese maps published after UNCLOS III still retain these dashed lines, they have no legal value and are used solely as a reference line to denote that \"all features (islands, reefs, banks, shoals, cays, sands) located within the dashed lines are sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China\". UNCLOS III, which has been ratified by China, went into force on the 16 November 1994. New [[Baseline (sea)|baselines]] of the [[Mainland China|mainland]] and the Paracels were released on the 15 May 1996. The addendum for the EEZ's extension via [[Continental shelf#Economic significance|Continental Shelves (in the legal sense)]] was also handed to the [[Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf]] (CLCS). Coupled with officially published laws of the past, China's new [[internal waters]] and [[territorial waters]], namely, China's \"blue territories\", could thus be calculated to an area of approximately {{convert|31000|km2|abbr=on}}.\n-->\n\nThe prospect of the establishment of a \"city\" on Woody Island was first publicized on 19 November 2007 in a report by [[Mingpao]], a Hong Kong-based newspaper, through a telephone interview with a Mr. Zhang of the Propaganda Department of [[Wenchang]], Hainan. This report claimed that a [[county-level city]] was to be established by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|PRC State Council]] in November 2007 to administer three disputed [[archipelago]]s in the South China Sea:<ref name=\"Stratfor\">{{cite news |url=http://www.stratfor.com/products/premium/read_article.php?id=299411&selected=Analyses |title=Vietnam, China: The Dispute over Significant Waterways |work=Free Intelligence Reports |publisher=[[Stratfor]] |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=8 December 2007}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref> the Paracel Islands, Macclesfield Bank (Zhongsha Islands) and the Spratly Islands.

The rest of the Paracels, the Zhongsha Islands and the Spratlys were only accessible to military personnel. The situation was improved in 1977 with the construction of a freighter given approval by then Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Having a tonnage of 2160 tonnes and a maximum load of 200 passengers, the \"Qiongsha 1\" (literally \"Hainan-South China Sea Islands 1\") freighter carried supplies and people between Woody Island and Hainan Island. In 1997, \"Qiongsha 1\" was destroyed in a typhoon while en route to [[Zhanjiang]], [[Guangdong]] Province for routine maintenance and upkeep. A smaller \"Qiongsha 2\" freighter of 1410 tonnes and a maximum load of 100 passengers was commissioned that same year. It operated for 10 years, and was decommissioned in January 2007.\n\nSince 2008, the \"lifeboat\" of the islands is the \"Qiongsha 3\" freighter (Tonnage: 2500 tonnes; Load: 200 passengers; Payload: 750 tonnes in cargo; Length: 84 metres; Width: 13.8 metres).

You should say something about all these women that are saying [they're] turning gay.'\" Rose stated that she is more neutral on the topic, and believes people are being complimentary when making such comments rather than trying to be derogatory or diminish the coming out process. She compared today's society to how society was in the past, saying that people would probably watch someone onscreen that they were attracted to, but not be able to joke about it \"because that would be so frowned upon.\" She said that people should not nitpick who can or cannot identify as genderqueer, gender-neutral, bisexual or trans, or tell them how to live their lives, adding that people should let others say what they want to about their sexuality, and that this is a message the LGBT community should be supporting.<ref name=\"Rees\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s 2019 LGBTQ special issue, Rose again discussed her gender identity, and the backlash to her casting as the title character of the television series ''Batwoman''.<ref name=\"Gomez\"/> She stated that the opportunity to audition for ''Orange Is the New Black'' came about because the show wanted to have a gender-neutral character, but that she has also received criticism because of her genderfluid identity, adding, \"When I got cast as a lesbian in ''Batwoman'', I didn't know that being a gender-fluid woman meant that I couldn't be a lesbian because I'm not a woman \u2014 not considered lesbian enough.\" She said that while her initial response was dismissive, she later considered if there was a way to remedy the situation so that others would not be offended by her identity, stating, \"That's when I sort of said, 'I'm a woman that identifies as a woman. I'm not trans. But if being gender-fluid means that I can't identify as a woman at any point, then I guess I can't be that.\" She pondered making up a term that does not offend people and would indicate that she is \"fluid in [her] gender, but also a lesbian.\"<ref name=\"Gomez\">{{cite web |author=Gomez, Patrick |title=Gender-fluid Ruby Rose Opens up About the backlash She's Received for Identifying As a Lesbian|url=https://ew.com/celebrity/2019/06/05/batwoman-ruby-rose-lesbian-backlash-interview/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=Entertainment Weekly Inc |date=2019-06-19 |accessdate=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

You should say something about all these women that are saying [they're] turning gay.'\" Rose stated that she is more neutral on the topic, and believes people are being complimentary when making such comments rather than trying to be derogatory or diminish the coming out process. She compared today's society to how society was in the past, saying that people would probably watch someone onscreen that they were attracted to, but not be able to joke about it \"because that would be so frowned upon.\" She said that people should not nitpick who can or cannot identify as genderqueer, gender-neutral, bisexual or trans, or tell them how to live their lives, adding that people should let others say what they want to about their sexuality, and that this is a message the LGBT community should be supporting.<ref name=\"Rees\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s 2019 LGBTQ special issue, Rose again discussed her gender identity, and the backlash to her casting as the title character of the television series ''Batwoman''.<ref name=\"Gomez\"/> She stated that the opportunity to audition for ''Orange Is the New Black'' came about because the show wanted to have a gender-neutral character, but that she has also received criticism because of her genderfluid identity, adding, \"When I got cast as a lesbian in ''Batwoman'', I didn't know that being a gender-fluid woman meant that I couldn't be a lesbian because I'm not a woman \u2014 not considered lesbian enough.\" She said that while her initial response was dismissive, she later considered if there was a way to remedy the situation so that others would not be offended by her identity, stating, \"That's when I sort of said, 'I'm a woman that identifies as a woman. I'm not trans. But if being gender-fluid means that I can't identify as a woman at any point, then I guess I can't be that.\" She pondered making up a term that does not offend people and would indicate that she is \"fluid in [her] gender, but also a lesbian.\"<ref name=\"Gomez\">{{cite web |author=Gomez, Patrick |title=Gender-fluid Ruby Rose Opens up About the backlash She's Received for Identifying As a Lesbian|url=https://ew.com/celebrity/2019/06/05/batwoman-ruby-rose-lesbian-backlash-interview/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=Entertainment Weekly Inc |date=2019-06-19 |accessdate=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
