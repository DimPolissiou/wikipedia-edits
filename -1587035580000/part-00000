Up\u0101li was born a low-caste barber. He met the Buddha when still a child, and later, when the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes received [[pabbajja|ordination]], he did so as well. He was ordained before the princes, putting humility before caste. Having been ordained, Up\u0101li learnt both Buddhist doctrine ({{lang-pi|Dhamma|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes}}) and ''vinaya''. His [[Upadhyay#In_Buddhism|preceptor]] was Kappitaka. Up\u0101li became known for his mastery and strictness of ''vinaya'' and was consulted often about ''vinaya'' matters. A notable case he decided was that of the monk Ajjuka, who was accused of partisanship in a conflict about real estate. During the First Council, Up\u0101li received the important role of reciting the ''vinaya'', for which he is mostly known.\n\nScholars have analyzed Up\u0101li's role and that of other disciples in the early texts, and it has been suggested that his role in the texts was emphasized during a period of compiling that stressed monastic discipline, during which [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}) and Up\u0101li became the most important disciples. Later, Up\u0101li and his pupils became known as ''vinayadharas'' ([[P\u0101li]]; 'custodians of the vinaya'), who preserved the monastic discipline after the Buddha's ''[[parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]'' ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}; passing into final Nirvana). This lineage became an important part of the identity of [[Ceylon]]ese and Burmese Buddhism. In China, the 7th-century Vinaya school referred to Up\u0101li as their patriarch, and it was believed that one of their founders was a reincarnation of him. The technical conversations about ''vinaya'' between the Buddha and Up\u0101li were recorded in the P\u0101li and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] traditions and have been suggested as an important subject of study for modern-day ethics in [[American Buddhism]].\n\n== Accounts ==\nUp\u0101li's personality is not depicted extensively in the texts, as the texts mostly emphasize his stereotypical qualities as an expert in monastic discipline, especially so in the [[P\u0101li]] texts.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=67, 231}}\n\n=== Early life ===\nAccording to the texts, Up\u0101li was therefore a barber, a despised profession in ancient India.{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1899 |p=102}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=357}} He was from an [[Vaishya|artisan caste]] family in service to the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes in [[Kapilavatthu]] ({{lang-sa|\u015aakya; Kapilavastu}}) and, according to the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'', to the Buddha. Up\u0101li's mother had once introduced Up\u0101li to the Buddha.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'', [[Dharmaguptaka]] and Chinese texts relate that as a child, Up\u0101li shaved the hair of the Buddha. Unlike adults, he had no fear of approaching the Buddha. Once, as he was guided by the Buddha during the shaving, he attained [[jhana|advanced states of meditation]]. Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Bareau]] argues that this story is ancient, because it precedes the tradition of art depictions of the Buddha with curly hair, and the glorification of Up\u0101li as an adult.{{sfn |Bareau |1962 |p=262}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the P\u0101li [[Cullavagga]] and the texts of discipline of the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] order, when the princes left home to become monks, Up\u0101li followed them. Since the princes handed Up\u0101li all their possessions, including jewelry, he figured that returning to Kapilavatthu with these possessions might cause him to be accused of having killed the princes for theft. Up\u0101li therefore decided to become ordained with them. They were ordained by the Buddha at the [[Malla (India)|Anupiy\u0101 grove]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. For the texts of traditions apart from P\u0101li, see {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |p=97}}.}} Several variations on the story of Up\u0101li's ordination exist, but all of them emphasize that his status in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes}}; monastic community) was independent of his caste origin. In the P\u0101li version, the princes, including [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}), voluntarily allowed Up\u0101li to ordain before them in order to give him seniority in order of ordination and abandon their own attachment to caste and social status.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}[[File:Kapilavastu.jpg|thumb|Remains at [[Tilaurakot]], one of the two sites that may have been Kapilavatthu |alt=Ruins of walled buildings]] In the Tibetan M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, co-disciple [[Sariputra|S\u0101riputta]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101riputra}}) persuaded Up\u0101li to become ordained when he hesitated because of being low caste, but in the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', it was Up\u0101li's own initiative.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'' continues that after all the monks had been ordained, the Buddha requested that the former princes bow for their former barber, which led to consternation among the witnessing king [[Bimbisara|Bimbis\u0101ra]] and advisers, who also bowed for Up\u0101li following their example.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}} It became widely known that the Sakyans had their barber ordained before them to humble their pride,{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=116}} as the Buddha related a ''[[Jataka|J\u0101taka]]'' tale that the king and advisers had bowed for Up\u0101li in a previous life, too.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=10}}\n\nIndologist [[T.W. Rhys Davids]] noted that Up\u0101li was the \"striking proof of the reality of the effect produced by Gautama's disregard of the supposed importance of caste\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1903 |p=69}} Historian {{ill|H.W. Schumann|de}} also raises Up\u0101li as an example of the general rule that \"in no case did ... humble origins prevent a monk from becoming prominent in the [[sangha|Order]]\".{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=166}} Religion scholar Jeffrey Samuels points out, though, that the majority of Buddhist monks and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]], as drawn from several analyses of Buddhist texts, were from higher castes, with a minority of six percent like Up\u0101li being exception to the rule.{{sfn |Samuels |2007 |p=123}} Historian Sangh Sen Singh argues that Up\u0101li could have been the leader of the ''sa\u1e45gha'' after the Buddha's ''[[parinibb\u0101na]]'' instead of [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa). But the fact that he was from a low caste effectively prevented this, as many of the Buddhist devotees at the time might have objected to his leadership position.{{sfn |Singh |1973 |pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n=== Monastic life ===\nUp\u0101li had a dwelling place in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101li]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015b\u0101li}}), called V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma.<!--Calikarama-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma}}{{sfn |Geiger |1912 |p=35}} He once asked the Buddha for leave to withdraw in the forest and lead a life in solitude. The Buddha refused, however, and told him that such a life was not for everyone.<!--Upali Sutta--> P\u0101li scholar [[Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|Gunapala Malalasekera]] argued that the Buddha wanted Up\u0101li to learn both meditation and Buddhist doctrine, and a life in the forest would have provided him with only the former. The texts state that the Buddha himself taught the ''[[vinaya]]'' (monastic discipline) to Up\u0101li.<!--Upali-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; Up\u0101li Sutta (3)}} Up\u0101li later attained the state of an [[arhat|enlightened disciple]].{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the [[Upadhyay#In Buddhism|preceptor]] who completed the process of Up\u0101li's [[upasampada|acceptance]] in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' was a monk called Kappitaka.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=58}}{{refn |group=note |Philosopher Michael Freedman argues that the office of preceptor may have only been developed after the Buddha's ''parinibb\u0101na'', although he admits the texts contradict each other with regard to Up\u0101li's acceptance.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=57 n.60, 97\u201398}}}} There is one story told about Up\u0101li and his preceptor. Kappitaka was in the habit of living in cemeteries. In one cemetery near Ves\u0101li he had a [[monastic cell]]. One day, a couple of nuns built a small monument there in honor of their teacher, also a nun, and made much noise in the process. Disturbed by the nuns, Kappitaka destroyed the monument, which greatly angered the nuns. Later, in an attempt to kill Kappitaka, they destroyed his cell in return. But Kappitaka was warned by Up\u0101li in advance and he had already fled elsewhere.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kappitaka Thera}} The next day, Up\u0101li was verbally abused by the nuns for having informed his teacher.{{sfn |Dhammadinna |2016 |pp=45\u201346}}\n\n=== Role in monastic discipline ===\n[[File:Upali (Ubari), from the series \u201cTwo Bodhisattva and Ten Great Disciples of Sakyamuni\u201d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Up\u0101li, woodblock print by [[Munakata Shik\u014d]], originally from 1939|left|alt=Monk in black robes looking at the sky with hands held up]]\n\nIn the literature of every Buddhist school, Up\u0101li is depicted as an expert in ''vinaya'' and the ''[[p\u0101\u1e6dimokkha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratimok\u1e63a|italic=yes}}; monastic code),{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} for which the Buddha declared him [[\u015ar\u0101vaka#Foremost disciples|foremost]] among those who remember the vinaya ({{lang-pi|Vinaya-p\u0101mokkha|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Vinayapramukkha|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=878}}{{sfn |Robinson |Johnson |1997 |p=45}} He was therefore dubbed the 'repository of the discipline' ({{lang-pi|Vinaye agganikkhitto|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} In some schools, he is also seen as an expert in the [[Bodhisattva Precepts|precepts]] of a ''[[bodhisattva|bodhisatta]]'' ({{lang-sa|bodhisattva|italic=yes}}; Buddha-to-be).{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} 5th-century ommentator [[Buddhaghosa]] stated that Up\u0101li drew up instructions and explanatory notes for monks dealing with disciplinary matters.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nUp\u0101li was also known for his strictness in practicing the discipline.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=365}} Monks considered it a privilege to study the ''vinaya'' under him.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=4}} At times, monks who felt repentance and wanted to improve themselves, sought his advice.<!--Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera--> In other cases, Up\u0101li was consulted in making decisions considering alleged offenses of monastic discipline. For example, one newly ordained nun was found pregnant, and was judged by the monk [[Devadatta]] as unfit to be a nun. However, the Buddha had Up\u0101li do a second investigation, during which Up\u0101li called upon the help of the laywoman [[Visakha|Visakh\u0101]] and several other laypeople. Eventually, Up\u0101li concluded the nun had conceived the child by her husband before her ordination as a nun, and therefore was innocent. The Buddha later praised Up\u0101li for his careful consideration of this matter.<!--Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa; Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera}}\n\nOther notable cases about which Up\u0101li decided are that of the monks Bharukaccha and Ajjuka. Bharukaccha consulted Up\u0101li whether dreaming about having sex with a woman amounted to an offense that required disrobing, and Up\u0101li judged it did not.<!--Bharukaccha--> As for the monk Ajjuka, he had decided about a dispute about real estate.<!--Ajjuka-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka; Bharukaccha}}.

He asked Ajjuka to invite for an audience the person who had the most faith of the two{{em dash}}Ajjuka invited the nephew. Angry about the decision, the son accused Ajjuka of partisanship and went to see the monk [[\u0100nanda]]. \u0100nanda disagreed with Ajjuka's decision, judging the son the more rightful heir, and causing the son to feel justified in accusing Ajjuka of not being a \"true monk\". When Up\u0101li got involved, however, he judged in favor of Ajjuka. He pointed out to \u0100nanda that the act of inviting a layperson did not break monastic discipline.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}. {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |pp=30\u201332}} mentions faith, the son seeing \u0100nanda, and the accusation of false monkhood.}} Eventually, \u0100nanda agreed with Up\u0101li, and Up\u0101li was able to settle the issue.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=32}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka}} Here, too, the Buddha praised Up\u0101li for his handling of the case.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1961}} Law scholar [[Andrew Huxley (law scholar)|Andrew Huxley]] noted that Up\u0101li's judgment of this case allowed monks to engage on an ethical level with the world, whereas \u0100nanda's judgment did not.{{sfn |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}\n\n=== First Council and death ===\n[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 013 First Council at Rajagaha (9241729223).jpg|The First Council.

This tradition has been used by some modern scholars to calculate the [[parinirvana|passing away]] of the Buddha,<!--6--> but has now been debunked as historically unlikely.<!--7--> Still, data pertaining to the ''vinayadharas'' is used to support theories regarding the dating of the Buddha's life and death,<!--6--> such as the one proposed by Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]].<!--8-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Prebish |2008 |pp=6\u20138}}. {{harvtxt |Geiger |1912 |p=xlvii}} mentions the term ''para\u1e43par\u0101''.}}\n[[File:Daoxuan (Nara National Museum).jpg|thumb|The Chinese Vinaya school founded by Tao-hs\u00fcan saw themselves as the continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage ([[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|ICP]], [[Nara National Museum]]) |upright=.7]]\nNot only in ancient India did certain lineages identify with Up\u0101li. In 7th-century China, the Vinaya or Nan-shan School was founded by the monks Ku-hsin and [[Tao-hs\u00fcan]], seen as a continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage. The school emphasized restoring and propagating the ''vinaya'' and became popular in the Pa Hwa Hills of [[Nanking]]. It developed a standard for teaching the ''vinaya''. The monks would wear black and emphasized protecting oneself against error. It was believed at the time that Ku-hsin was a reincarnation of Up\u0101li.{{refn |For Ku-hsin, the Pa Hwa Hills, the standard and the reincarnation, see {{harvtxt |Hsiang-Kuang |1956 |p=207}}.

Much of this is found in the ''[[Pariv\u0101ra]]'', a late ''vinaya'' text.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} Bareau has suggested the conversation between the Buddha and Up\u0101li about schisms was the origin of the traditions about this subject in the ''Vinayapi\u1e6daka''.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=169}} In the ''vinaya'' texts of the Sarvastiv\u0101da tradition, the ''Uttragrantha''{{sfn

P\u0101li at all.{{sfn |Norman |1983 |p=29}} With regard to these lists of questions, it is unknown which of these questions are from Up\u0101li, and which were attributed to him because of his

Up\u0101li was born a low-caste barber. He met the Buddha when still a child, and later, when the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes received [[pabbajja|ordination]], he did so as well. He was, in fact, ordained before the princes, putting humility before caste. Having been ordained, Up\u0101li learnt both Buddhist doctrine ({{lang-pi|Dhamma|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes}}) and ''vinaya''. His [[Upadhyay#In_Buddhism|preceptor]] was Kappitaka. Up\u0101li became known for his mastery and strictness of ''vinaya'', and was consulted often about ''vinaya'' matters. A notable case he decided about was that of the monk Ajjuka, who was accused of partisanship in a conflict about real estate. During the First Council, Up\u0101li received the important role of reciting the ''vinaya'', for which he is mostly known.\n\nScholars have analyzed Up\u0101li's role and that of other disciples in the early texts, and it has been suggested that his role in the texts was emphasized during a period of compiling that stressed monastic discipline, during which [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}) and Up\u0101li became the most important disciples. Later, Up\u0101li and his pupils became known as ''vinayadharas'' ([[P\u0101li]]; 'custodians of the vinaya'), who preserved the monastic discipline after the Buddha's ''[[parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]'' ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}; passing into final Nirvana). This lineage became an important part of the identity of [[Ceylon|Ceylonese]] and Burmese Buddhism. In China, the 7th-century Vinaya school referred to Up\u0101li as their patriarch, and it was believed that one of their founders was a reincarnation of him. The technical conversations about ''vinaya'' between the Buddha and Up\u0101li were recorded in the P\u0101li and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] traditions, and have been suggested as an important subject of study for modern-day ethics in [[American Buddhism]].\n\n== Accounts ==\nUp\u0101li's personality is not depicted extensively in the texts, as the texts mostly emphasize his stereotypical qualities as an expert in monastic discipline, especially so in the [[P\u0101li]] texts.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=67, 231}}\n\n=== Early life ===\nAccording to the texts, Up\u0101li was therefore a barber, a despised profession in ancient India.{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1899 |p=102}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=357}} He was from an [[Vaishya|artisan caste]] family in service to the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes in [[Kapilavatthu]] ({{lang-sa|\u015aakya; Kapilavastu}}) and, according to the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'', to the Buddha. Up\u0101li's mother had once introduced Up\u0101li to the Buddha.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'', [[Dharmaguptaka]] and Chinese texts relate that as a child, Up\u0101li shaved the hair of the Buddha. Unlike adults, he had no fear of approaching the Buddha. Once, as he was guided by the Buddha during the shaving, he attained [[jhana|advanced states of meditation]]. Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Bareau]] argues that this story is ancient, because it precedes the tradition of art depictions of the Buddha with curly hair, and the glorification of Up\u0101li as an adult.{{sfn |Bareau |1962 |p=262}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the P\u0101li [[Cullavagga]] and the texts of discipline of the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] order, when the princes left home to become monks, Up\u0101li followed them. Since the princes handed Up\u0101li all their possessions, including jewelry, he figured that returning to Kapilavatthu with these possessions might cause him to be accused of having killed the princes for theft. Up\u0101li therefore decided to become ordained with them. They were ordained by the Buddha at the [[Malla (India)|Anupiy\u0101 grove]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. For the texts of traditions apart from P\u0101li, see {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |p=97}}.}} Several variations on the story of Up\u0101li's ordination exist, but all of them emphasize that his status in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes}}; monastic community) was independent of his caste origin. In the P\u0101li version, the princes, including [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}), voluntarily allowed Up\u0101li to ordain before them in order to give him seniority in order of ordination and abandon their own attachment to caste and social status.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}[[File:Kapilavastu.jpg|thumb|Remains at [[Tilaurakot]], one of the two sites that may have been Kapilavatthu |alt=Ruins of walled buildings]] In the Tibetan M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, co-disciple [[Sariputra|S\u0101riputta]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101riputra}}) persuaded Up\u0101li to become ordained when he hesitated because of being low caste, but in the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', it was Up\u0101li's own initiative.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'' continues that after all the monks had been ordained, the Buddha requested that the former princes bow for their former barber, which led to consternation among the witnessing king [[Bimbisara|Bimbis\u0101ra]] and advisers, who also bowed for Up\u0101li following their example.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}} It became widely known that the Sakyans had their barber ordained before them to humble their pride,{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=116}} as the Buddha related a ''[[Jataka|J\u0101taka]]'' tale that the king and advisers had bowed for Up\u0101li in a previous life, too.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=10}}\n\nIndologist [[T.W.

She lives and works in [[Kuopio]], Finland.\n\n== Education ==\nH\u00e4nninen has studied at Lahti Institute of Design in Finland in 1994-1998 and Hochscule f\u00fcr Kunst und Gestaltung in Z\u00fcrich in 1997\u20131998. She became Master of Arts (Photography) from University of Art and Design (UIAH) in [[Helsinki]] in 2002. She is part of [[The Helsinki School]].<ref>http://www.nannahanninen.com Nanna H\u00e4nninen's Official Webpage, September 2009</ref>\n\n== Style and work ==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2013}}\nH\u00e4nninen's works has been shown in several solo and group exhibitions. Many of her works are placed of national and international public collections as well as private ones. H\u00e4nninen has made two commissioned public artworks. Walks from Dusk till Dawn to Centralposthus Bl\u00e5mannen (The National Property Board of Sweden) in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] (2008) and Jungle and Powerplant of Kuopio: version in Red to Kuopio employment agency in Kuopio, State Art Collections, Finland (2009). She has published also two artist monographs: Fear and Security (Forlaget Bjerggaard, 2003) and Recordings (Kojodi press, 2007).\nMental and social structures as well as experiencing the culture are the basic themes of H\u00e4nninen's work. Her interest in photography is the tension between rational and irrational subjects and ideas or reality and fiction, which is given by photography itself. Even if some images and themes seem unreal or chosen randomly the photograph makes to keep relationships with the reality.\n\n== Series ==\n\n===Fear and security===\nFear and Security tells about the fear of losing control. When photographing more objects, instead of order, she started to see the idea of chaos in things. That became a series of pictures called Fear and Security. H\u00e4nninen says that \"There is a great paradox because by setting up security measures you cause insecurity of something\". In these images H\u00e4nninen has been trying to catch the idea of the society, which is filing, sorting and systemizing things to be more secure and organized. \"Her work titles- Fear and Security, Keep Under Control, Information Failure- reinforce the idea that these stage-set-like, micro-theatrical scenes are visualized thought, visual aphorisms, emblematic abstractions. In a model-like manner they represent thoughts about the world, about tensions, opposition, overload, sources of error.\" <ref>Introduction to Exhibition Order & Chaos, An Essay \"The Imaging of Thought and Experience In the Work of Nanna H\u00e4nninen\" by Urs Stahel, [[Fotomuseum Winterthur]], 2003.</ref>\n\nPsychological and mental mechanisms of the society as well as the [[9/11]] incident in [[New York City]] are the starting point of the series. The theme is still very current. Aesthetically these works are very simple and silent, even [[Minimalism|minimalistic]].\n\n===The New Landscapes===\nIn the series New Landscapes the photographs are taken from famous metropolises, buildings, factories, cemeteries, airports, towers - mostly strategically important places involving a mixture of lights in the scenery and a long exposure so that they become almost like short movies. These urban landscapes are basically drawings of body movements that can be seen on photographic material as rhythmical light lines where subject and the scenery melt into a single image. Pictorial motifs are divided into different surfaces; the [[abstraction]] and pictorial surface, into the human presence (breathing, heartbeat, laughter, talking, walking during the exposure time) and into the photography as media which in this case is moving closer a painting. The subject is still strongly presented, whereas the object - the scenery- is estranged and thus becomes easier to deal with. The works are often named geographically: [[Basel]], New York's [[Brooklyn Bridge]], [[the airport of Ponta Delgata]], [[the port of Helsinki]], [[the A5 autobahn]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe New Landscapes follows H\u00e4nninen's sociological interest towards individual who is sensing, understanding and placing herself in the outside world. The figurative language; minimalism and the reduction of information is more a visual method, which have references to symbolic or linguistic meanings (emptiness, infinity) but also it can be seen as an art historical references to modernist painting. As a result of all these pictures become concentrated narrations of recognition and moment as well as large colour abstractions that have profound significance of the surrounding reality. \"Nanna H\u00e4nninen documents with seismographic precision, the interplay between the movements of the real world before her eyes and her own world, her movements, her breathing and laughter, her hesitation. What we find here are highly abstract photographs with semi-translucent, intangible backgrounds and sketchy undulating movements, with lines contracting, expanding and entangling, with fields and clusters of color.\" <ref>Nanna H\u00e4nninen, recordings: An Essay \"Experiences Enhance Thoughts\" by Urs Stahel. Kodoji Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-3-03747-000-8}}</ref> The photographs have been re-worked by computer.\n\n===Asymmetric Exposure===\nAsymmetric Exposures is H\u00e4nninen's series about her admiration of the skyscraper's as well as understanding of the fragility of those and common peace agreements in the society. The incident in New York on 9/11 is still influencing her work and this that can be seen in all her works through 2000-2009 either with direct research of it or by denial. Nanna H\u00e4nninen is not only documenting the world as it is but also transforming the truth. \"Nanna H\u00e4nninen incorporates her own emotions and ideas about the Twin Towers attack in her interpretation of this milestone in modern history. The skyscraper thus becomes an image of the fragility of our civilisation and its fundamental lack of stability.\" <ref>Exhibition Catalogue: Nanna H\u00e4nninen, Asymmetriske optagelser, Text by Peter Michael Hornung, Galleri Bo Bjerggaard, 2008.</ref> She is stretching out the way of seeing and viewing things while having joy of playing with the exposure, time and light itself- the basic fundaments of photography. Nanna H\u00e4nninen also sees a reference to patterns and [[ornament (architecture)|ornaments]] used in [[islamic art]] where \"figurative\" pictures are not allowed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\nAsymmetric Exposures brought H\u00e4nninen also to geometrical forms like the Platonic solids and especially the fifth- dodecahedron, which she saw through her newest photographs and as result of this she then for the first time made three-dimensional objects containing photographs in the form of dodecahedron.\n\n===Plants / objects // paint===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2013}}\nPlants/Objects//Paint is the most recent series about artificiality, alienation and reality. The new group of works unifies photography and painting, questioning authenticity and imitation of life through this process. Plants are photographed in color, transformed into black and white images, then painted over in their original colors and once more photographed. Nanna's approach is very conceptual and abstract. 'I am not a painter but a photographer. Though in the first place I am a visual artist.', she says. She adds color artificially to the pictures, covering or emphasizing parts that are most important. The color, which was the original and true element, is recreated. Abstract elements such as life and reality often intertwine and overlap similar because of the endless change of time. It is the alienation of the nature itself and its circulation that affects her work.\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n===Solo (selected)===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2013}}\n* 2011 Plants/Objects//Paint, Gallerie ftc. fiedler taubert contemporary, Berlin (DE)\n* 2010 Volta Art Fair, One-Woman Show, camera obscura de arte, New York (USA)\n* 2009 Solo Exhibition, camera obscura galleria de arte, Madrid (ES)\n* 2009 Asymmetric Exposures, Galleri Bo Bjerggaard (DK)\n* 2008 New Landscapes, South Jutlands Museum of Art, Tonder (DK)\n* 2007 New Landscapes, fiedler contemporary, Cologne (DE)\n* 2006 Bildmuseet (with P.

Her interest in photography is the tension between rational and irrational subjects and ideas or reality and fiction, which is given by photography itself. Even if some images and themes seem unreal or chosen randomly the photograph makes to keep relationships with the reality.\n\n== Series ==\n\n===Fear and security===\nFear and Security tells about the fear of losing control. When photographing more objects, instead of order, she started to see the idea of chaos in things. That became a series of pictures called Fear and Security. H\u00e4nninen says that \"There is a great paradox because by setting up security measures you cause insecurity of something\". In these images H\u00e4nninen has been trying to catch the idea of the society, which is filing, sorting and systemizing things to be more secure and organized. \"Her work titles- Fear and Security, Keep Under Control, Information Failure- reinforce the idea that these stage-set-like, micro-theatrical scenes are visualized thought, visual aphorisms, emblematic abstractions. In a model-like manner they represent thoughts about the world, about tensions, opposition, overload, sources of error.\" <ref>Introduction to Exhibition Order & Chaos, An Essay \"The Imaging of Thought and Experience In the Work of Nanna H\u00e4nninen\" by Urs Stahel, [[Fotomuseum Winterthur]], 2003.</ref>\n\nPsychological and mental mechanisms of the society as well as the [[9/11]] incident in [[New York City]] are the starting point of the series. The theme is still very current. Aesthetically these works are very simple and silent, even [[Minimalism|minimalistic]].\n\n===The New Landscapes===\nIn the series New Landscapes the photographs are taken from famous metropolises, buildings, factories, cemeteries, airports, towers - mostly strategically important places involving a mixture of lights in the scenery and a long exposure so that they become almost like short movies. These urban landscapes are basically drawings of body movements that can be seen on photographic material as rhythmical light lines where subject and the scenery melt into a single image. Pictorial motifs are divided into different surfaces; the [[abstraction]] and pictorial surface, into the human presence (breathing, heartbeat, laughter, talking, walking during the exposure time) and into the photography as media which in this case is moving closer a painting. The subject is still strongly presented, whereas the object - the scenery- is estranged and thus becomes easier to deal with. The works are often named geographically: [[Basel]], New York's [[Brooklyn Bridge]], [[the airport of Ponta Delgata]], [[the port of Helsinki]], [[the A5 autobahn]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe New Landscapes follows H\u00e4nninen's sociological interest towards individual who is sensing, understanding and placing herself in the outside world. The figurative language; minimalism and the reduction of information is more a visual method, which have references to symbolic or linguistic meanings (emptiness, infinity) but also it can be seen as an art historical references to modernist painting. As a result of all these pictures become concentrated narrations of recognition and moment as well as large colour abstractions that have profound significance of the surrounding reality. \"Nanna H\u00e4nninen documents with seismographic precision, the interplay between the movements of the real world before her eyes and her own world, her movements, her breathing and laughter, her hesitation. What we find here are highly abstract photographs with semi-translucent, intangible backgrounds and sketchy undulating movements, with lines contracting, expanding and entangling, with fields and clusters of color.\" <ref>Nanna H\u00e4nninen, recordings: An Essay \"Experiences Enhance Thoughts\" by Urs Stahel. Kodoji Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-3-03747-000-8}}</ref> The photographs have been re-worked by computer.\n\n===Asymmetric Exposure===\nAsymmetric Exposures is H\u00e4nninen's series about her admiration of the skyscraper's as well as understanding of the fragility of those and common peace agreements in the society. The incident in New York on 9/11 is still influencing her work and this that can be seen in all her works through 2000-2009 either with direct research of it or by denial. Nanna H\u00e4nninen is not only documenting the world as it is but also transforming the truth. \"Nanna H\u00e4nninen incorporates her own emotions and ideas about the Twin Towers attack in her interpretation of this milestone in modern history. The skyscraper thus becomes an image of the fragility of our civilisation and its fundamental lack of stability.\" <ref>Exhibition Catalogue: Nanna H\u00e4nninen, Asymmetriske optagelser, Text by Peter Michael Hornung, Galleri Bo Bjerggaard, 2008.</ref> She is stretching out the way of seeing and viewing things while having joy of playing with the exposure, time and light itself- the basic fundaments of photography. Nanna H\u00e4nninen also sees a reference to patterns and [[ornament (architecture)|ornaments]] used in [[islamic art]] where \"figurative\" pictures are not allowed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\nAsymmetric Exposures brought H\u00e4nninen also to geometrical forms like the Platonic solids and especially the fifth- dodecahedron, which she saw through her newest photographs and as result of this she then for the first time made three-dimensional objects containing photographs in the form of dodecahedron.\n\n===Plants / objects // paint===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2013}}\nPlants/Objects//Paint is the most recent series about artificiality, alienation and reality. The new group of works unifies photography and painting, questioning authenticity and imitation of life through this process. Plants are photographed in color, transformed into black and white images, then painted over in their original colors and once more photographed. Nanna's approach is very conceptual and abstract. 'I am not a painter but a photographer. Though in the first place I am a visual artist.', she says. She adds color artificially to the pictures, covering or emphasizing parts that are most important. The color, which was the original and true element, is recreated. Abstract elements such as life and reality often intertwine and overlap similar because of the endless change of time. It is the alienation of the nature itself and its circulation that affects her work.\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n===Solo (selected)===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2013}}\n* 2011 Plants/Objects//Paint, Gallerie ftc. fiedler taubert contemporary, Berlin (DE)\n* 2010 Volta Art Fair, One-Woman Show, camera obscura de arte, New York (USA)\n* 2009 Solo Exhibition, camera obscura galleria de arte, Madrid (ES)\n* 2009 Asymmetric Exposures, Galleri Bo Bjerggaard (DK)\n* 2008 New Landscapes, South Jutlands Museum of Art, Tonder (DK)\n* 2007 New Landscapes, fiedler contemporary, Cologne (DE)\n* 2006 Bildmuseet (with P.

This massive [[granite]] structure is prominently located on a hilltop,  and was raised to commemorate the [[Voortrekkers]] who left the [[Cape Colony]] between 1835 and 1854.\n\nOn 8 July 2011 the Voortrekker Monument, designed by the architect [[Gerard Moerdijk]], was declared a [[National heritage sites (South Africa)|National Heritage Site]] by the [[South African Heritage Resource Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Press release: Voortrekker Monument Declared a National Heritage on 16 desember 1998 Site|url=http://www.sahra.org.za/voortrekkermonument.pdf|publisher=[[South African Heritage Resource Agency]]|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Voortrekker Monument May 2006, IMG 3008.jpg|thumb|left|Wounded voortrekker at Vegkop, detail of the historical frieze]]\n\nThe idea to build a monument in honour of God was first discussed on 16 December 1888, when [[President (government title)|President]] [[Paul Kruger]] of the [[South African Republic]] attended the [[Day of the Vow|Day of the Covenant]] celebrations at [[Danskraal]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]]. However, the movement to actually build such a monument only started in 1931 when the ''Sentrale Volksmonumentekomitee'' (SVK) (Central People's Monuments Committee) was formed to bring this idea to fruition.\n\nConstruction started on 13 July 1937 with a sod turning ceremony performed by chairman of the SVK, Advocate [[Ernest George Jansen]], on what later became known as Monument Hill. On 16 December 1938 the cornerstone was laid by three descendants of some of the Voortrekker leaders: Mrs. J.C. Muller (granddaughter of [[Andries Pretorius]]), Mrs. K.F. Ackerman (great-granddaughter of [[Andries Hendrik Potgieter|Hendrik Potgieter]]) and Mrs. J.C. Preller (great-granddaughter of [[Piet Retief]]).\n\nThe Monument was inaugurated on 16 December 1949 by the then-prime minister [[Daniel Malan|D. F. Malan]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The total construction cost of the Monument was about [[British pound|\u00a3]] 360,000, most of which was contributed by the South African government. The construction contract being awarded to Raubex, after its incorporation.\n\nA large [[amphitheatre]], which seats approximately 20,000 people, was erected to the north-east of the Monument in 1949.\n\n==Main features==\n\nThe Voortrekker Monument is 40 metres high, with a base of 40 metres by 40 metres.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The building shares architectural resemblance with European monuments such the [[Les Invalides|D\u00f4me des Invalides]] in France and the [[V\u00f6lkerschlachtdenkmal]] in [[Germany]] but also contains African influences.<ref name=Walkowitz>{{cite book|last=Walkowitz|first=edited by Daniel J.|title=Contested histories in public space : memory, race, and nation|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, [NC]|isbn=0-8223-4236-7|author2=Knauer, Lisa Maya |page=159|chapter=A Cultural Conundrum?}}</ref>  The two main points of interest inside the building are the Historical Frieze and the Cenotaph.\n\n[[File:Inside the Voortrekker Monument.JPG|thumb|right|175px|South window and frieze]]\n\n===Historical Frieze===\nThe main entrance of the building leads into the domed Hall of Heroes. This massive space, flanked by four huge arched windows made from yellow Belgian glass, contains the unique [[marble]] Historical [[Frieze]] which is an intrinsic part of the design of the monument.

The set of panels illustrates key historical scenes starting from the first voortrekkers of 1835, up to the signing of the [[Sand River Convention]] in 1852. In the centre of the floor of the Hall of Heroes is a large circular opening through which the Cenotaph in the Cenotaph Hall can be viewed.\n\n[[File:Voortrekker Cenotaph.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The Cenotaph]]\n\n===Cenotaph===\nThe [[Cenotaph]], situated in the centre of the Cenotaph Hall, is the central focus of the monument. In addition to being viewable from the Hall of Heroes it can also be seen from the dome at the top of the building, from where much of the interior of the monument can be viewed. Through an opening in this dome a ray of sunlight shines at twelve o'clock on 16 December annually, falling onto the centre of the Cenotaph, striking the words 'Ons vir Jou, Suid-Afrika' ([[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] for 'We're for you, South Africa'), a line from '[[Die Stem van Suid-Afrika]]'. The ray of light is said to symbolise God's blessing on the lives and endeavours of the Voortrekkers. 16 December 1838 was the date of the [[Battle of Blood River]], commemorated in South Africa before 1994 as the [[Day of the Vow]].\n\nThe Cenotaph Hall is decorated with the flags of the different [[Boer Republics|Voortrekker Republics]] and contains wall tapestries depicting the Voortrekkers as well as several display cases with artefacts from the Great Trek. Against the northern wall of the hall is a niche with a [[lantern]] in which a flame has been kept burning ever since 1938. It was in that year that the [[Symbolic Ox Wagon Trek]], which started in [[Cape Town]] and ended at Monument Hill where the Monument's foundation stone was laid, took place.\n[[File:Voortrekker Monument Laager.JPG|thumb|right|175px|The wagon laager wall features 64 wagons]]\n\n===Other features===\nVisitors to the monument enter through a black [[wrought iron]] gate with an ''[[assegai]]'' (spear) motif.\n\nAfter passing through the gate one finds oneself inside a big [[laager]] consisting of 64 [[ox-wagon]]s made out of decorative granite. The same number of wagons were used at the [[Battle of Blood River]] to form the laager.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n[[File:Voortrekker Vrou Statue.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Voortrekker woman and children by [[Anton van Wouw]]]]\n[[File:Voortrekker Statue.JPG|thumb|right|175px|Statue of [[Piet Retief]]]]\nAt the foot of the Monument stands [[Anton van Wouw]]'s bronze sculpture of a Voortrekker woman and her two children, paying homage to the strength and courage of the Voortrekker women. On both sides of this sculpture black [[wildebeest]] are chiselled into the walls of the Monument.

However, the movement to actually build such a monument only started in 1931 when the ''Sentrale Volksmonumentekomitee'' (SVK) (Central People's Monuments Committee) was formed to bring this idea to fruition.\n\nConstruction started on 13 July 1937 with a sod turning ceremony performed by chairman of the SVK, Advocate [[Ernest George Jansen]], on what later became known as Monument Hill. On 16 December 1938 the cornerstone was laid by three descendants of some of the Voortrekker leaders: Mrs. J.C. Muller (granddaughter of [[Andries Pretorius]]), Mrs. K.F. Ackerman (great-granddaughter of [[Andries Hendrik Potgieter|Hendrik Potgieter]]) and Mrs. J.C. Preller (great-granddaughter of [[Piet Retief]]).\n\nThe Monument was inaugurated on 16 December 1949 by the then-prime minister [[Daniel Malan|D. F. Malan]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The total construction cost of the Monument was about [[British pound|\u00a3]] 360,000, most of which was contributed by the South African government.

The set of panels illustrates key historical scenes starting from the first voortrekkers of 1835, up to the signing of the [[Sand River Convention]] in 1852. In the centre of the floor of the Hall of Heroes is a large circular opening through which the Cenotaph in the Cenotaph Hall can be viewed.\n\n[[File:Voortrekker Cenotaph.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The Cenotaph]]\n\n===Cenotaph===\nThe [[Cenotaph]], situated in the centre of the Cenotaph Hall, is the central focus of the monument. In addition to being viewable from the Hall of Heroes it can also be seen from the dome at the top of the building, from where much of the interior of the monument can be viewed. Through an opening in this dome a ray of sunlight shines at twelve o'clock on 16 December annually, falling onto the centre of the Cenotaph, striking the words 'Ons vir Jou, Suid-Afrika' ([[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] for 'We're for you, South Africa'), a line from '[[Die Stem van Suid-Afrika]]'. The ray of light is said to symbolise God's blessing on the lives and endeavours of the Voortrekkers. 16 December 1838 was the date of the [[Battle of Blood River]], commemorated in South Africa before 1994 as the [[Day of the Vow]].\n\nThe Cenotaph Hall is decorated with the flags of the different [[Boer Republics|Voortrekker Republics]] and contains wall tapestries depicting the Voortrekkers as well as several display cases with artefacts from the Great Trek. Against the northern wall of the hall is a niche with a [[lantern]] in which a flame has been kept burning ever since 1938. It was in that year that the [[Symbolic Ox Wagon Trek]], which started in [[Cape Town]] and ended at Monument Hill where the Monument's foundation stone was laid, took place.\n[[File:Voortrekker Monument Laager.JPG|thumb|right|175px|The wagon laager wall features 64 wagons]]\n\n===Other features===\nVisitors to the monument enter through a black [[wrought iron]] gate with an ''[[assegai]]'' (spear) motif.\n\nAfter passing through the gate one finds oneself inside a big [[laager]] consisting of 64 [[ox-wagon]]s made out of decorative granite.

On 16 December, the appearance of an illuminating [[sun]] disc on the wording of the [[Cenotaph]] stone, transform their meaning as per the [[Philosophers Stone]] of the alchemists.\n\nInstead of man below making an earthly vow, the sun shifts the focus upwards to the trinitarian god of the Trekkers, as it is God who communicates through Moerdijk's sun architecture, making Himself a heavenly vow with the words: WE - as in GOD - FOR THEE SOUTH-AFRICA.\n\nThus God in the trinitarian tradition of the Trekkers, speaks a vow within the sun disc illuminating the words on the Cenotaph.\n\nThe Trekker belief that God was for [[South Africa]] originates from the 9\u201316 December 1838 vow of Trekker leader [[Andries Pretorius]] at Blood river, who at around the same time made military and political alliances with Christian [[Zulus]] like prince [[Mpande]].\n\n===Egyptian origin===\nMoerdijk was an outspoken supporter of ancient Egyptian architecture.<ref>Journal Title: Southern African Humanities Volume 13, Publication Date: 2001, Pages: 139  - 154, Authors:  Sabine Marschall, {{ISSN|1681-5564}}</ref>\n\nMoerdijk referred to Africa's greatness as imparted by ancient Egyptian constructions at the inauguration of the Voortrekker Monument.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBefore his Voortrekker Monument proposal was accepted, Moerdijk and [[Anton van Wouw]] had been working in alliance for many years on their \"dream castle\" project:<ref>SECOND GERARD MOERDYK-GEDENKLESING 2005, [http://reference.sabinet.co.za/document/EJC30675 'N EGTE LUGKASTEEL: MOERDIJK, VAN WOUW EN DIE VOORTREKKERMONUMENT], prof. Alex Duffey of the University of Pretoria</ref> a modern African-Egyptian Voortrekker Temple in South-Africa. Van Wouw and Frans Soff had earlier employed the Egyptian [[obelisk]], a petrified ray of the African [[Aten]], as central motif for the [[National Women's Monument]] in [[Bloemfontein]], [[South Africa]], itself likewise inaugurated on the [[Day of the Vow]], 16 December 1913.\n\nWhilst finalising the design of the Voortrekker Monument in 1936,<ref name=\"vermeulen\"/>{{rp|105}} Moerdijk went on a research trip to [[Egypt]]. There he visited the [[Karnak]] Temple Complex at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]],<ref name=\"vermeulen\"/>{{rp|106}} where an African [[Renaissance]] had flourished under [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]], [[Nefertiti]]'s husband.\n\nThe open air temples of [[Akhenaten]] to the [[Aten]] incorporated the Heliopolitan tradition of employing sun rays in architecture, as well as realistic wall reliefs or friezes.\n\nMoerdijk also visited the [[Cairo Museum]], where a copy of the [[Great Hymn to the Aten]] is on display, some verses of which remind of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 104.\n\nMoerdijk's wife Sylva related that he was intimately acquainted with ancient Egyptian architecture,<ref name=\"vermeulen\"/>{{rp|106}} and was strongly influenced architecturally by his visit to Egypt.<ref name=\"vermeulen\"/>{{rp|105}}\n\n===Architectural purpose===\n[[File:Luikstraal, Voortrekkermonument, Pretoria, Suid-Afrika.jpg|left|thumb|Looking upwards at mid noon on 16 December reveals a dot within a circle, the ancient African-Egyptian hieroglyph for the monotheistic creator god [[Aten]]]]\n[[File:Geloftedag-1-.JPG|thumb|Looking downwards from the dome]]\n\nThe architect, [[Gerard Moerdijk]], stated that the purpose of a building had to be clearly visible.<ref name=\"vermeulen\"/>{{rp|133}} The aspect of the sun at mid-noon in Africa, was during Nefertiti's time known as [[Aten]]. In Egyptian [[hieroglyph]]ics, Aten was written as a sun dot enclosed by a circle.\n\nThe Aten-hieroglyph is depicted in the Voortrekker Monument when the sun shines through an aperture in the top dome.\n\nLikewise, looking downwards from the top dome walkway, the round floor opening is seen to encircle the sun disc illumination.\n\nMoerdijk's message as implied by the wall frieze: by [[Emigration|exodus]] out of the British [[Cape Colony]], God created a new civilization inland.\n\nIn order to give thanks to this new creation of civilization, Moerdijk, recalling [[Abraham]] of old, outwardly designed the Voortrekker Monument as an [[altar]].<ref name=\"vermeulen\"/>{{rp|130}}\n\n==Monument complex==\nIn the years following its construction, the monument complex was expanded several times and now includes:\n* An indigenous garden that surrounds the monument.[[File:SADF Wall of Remembrance at Voortrekker Monument.jpg|thumb|right|The Wall of Remembrance dedicated to those who lost their lives while serving in the [[South African Defence Force]].]]\n* [[Fort Schanskop]], a nearby [[fort]] built in 1897 by the government of the [[South African Republic]] after the [[Jameson Raid]] and now a museum.\n* The Schanskop open-air amphitheatre with seating for 357 people that was officially opened on 30 January 2001.\n* A garden of remembrance.\n* A nature reserve was declared on 3.41&nbsp;km\u00b2 around the Monument in 1992.
