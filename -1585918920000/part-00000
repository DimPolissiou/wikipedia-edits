Initially, on 7 August 1921, it was established as the Turkmen Oblast of the [[Turkestan ASSR]] before being made, on 13 May 1925, a separate republic of the USSR as the Turkmen SSR.\n\nSince then the borders of the Turkmenia were unchanged. On 22 August 1990, Turkmenia declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws. On 13 June 2000, it became merge as the '''[[Republic of Turkmenistan]]'''.\n\nGeographically, Turkmenia was bordered between [[Iran]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] to the south, [[Caspian Sea]] to the west, [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] to the north and [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]] to the east.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|History of Turkmenistan}}\n\n===Annexation to Russia===\n[[Russian Empire|Russian]] attempts to encroach upon Turkmen territory began in earnest in the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1869 the [[Russian Empire]] established a foothold in present-day Turkmenistan with the foundation of the [[Caspian Sea]] port of Krasnovodsk (now [[T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy, Turkmenistan|T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy]]). From there and other points, they marched on and subdued the [[Khiva Khanate]] in 1873. Because Turkmen tribes, most notably the Yomud, were in the military service of the Khivan khan, Russian forces undertook punitive raids against [[Khorazm]], in the process slaughtering hundreds of Turkmen and destroying their settlements. In 1881 the Russians under General [[Mikhail Skobelev]] besieged and captured [[Geok Tepe]], one of the last Turkmen strongholds, northwest of [[Ashgabat]]. With the Turkmen defeat (which is now marked by the Turkmen as a [[Public holidays in Turkmenistan|national day of mourning]] and a symbol of national pride), the annexation of what is present-day Turkmenistan met with only weak resistance. Later the same year, the Russians signed an agreement with the Persians and established what essentially remains the current border between Turkmenistan and Iran. In 1897 a similar agreement was signed between the Russians and Afghans.<ref name=Incorporationintorussia>Curtis (1996). \"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+tm0015) Turkmenistan: Incorporation into Russia]\".</ref>\n\nFollowing annexation to Russia, the area was administered as the [[Transcaspian Region]] by corrupt and malfeasant military officers and officials appointed by the [[Russian Turkestan|Turkestan]] Governor-Generalship in [[Tashkent]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. In the 1880s, a railroad was built from Krasnovodsk to [[Ashgabat]] and later extended to Tashkent. Urban areas began to develop along the railway. Although the Transcaspian Region essentially was a colony of Russia, it remained a backwater, except for Russian concerns with British colonialist intentions in the region and with possible uprisings by the Turkmen.<ref name=Incorporationintorussia/>\n\n===Creation of an SSR===\nBecause the Turkmen generally were indifferent to the [[October Revolution|advent of Soviet rule in 1917]], little revolutionary activity occurred in the region in the years that followed. However, the years immediately preceding the revolution had been marked by sporadic Turkmen uprisings against Russian rule, most prominently the anti-tsarist revolt of 1916 that swept through the whole of Turkestan. Their armed resistance to Soviet rule was part of the larger [[Basmachi Revolt]] throughout Central Asia from the 1920s into the early 1930s, which included most of the future USSR dependencies. Although Soviet sources describe this struggle as a minor chapter in the republic's history, it is clear that opposition was fierce and resulted in the death of large numbers of Turkmen.<ref name=SSR>Curtis (1996). \"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+tm0016) Turkmenistan: Soviet Turkmenistan]\".</ref>\n\nIn October 1924, when Central Asia was divided into distinct political entities, the [[Transcaspian Region]] and [[Turkmen Oblast]] of the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Turkestan ASSR) became the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkmen SSR), a full-fledged constituent republic of the Soviet Union. During the forced collectivization and other extreme socioeconomic changes of the first decades of Soviet rule, pastoral nomadism ceased to be an economic alternative in Turkmenistan, and by the late 1930s, the majority of Turkmen had become sedentary. Efforts by the Soviet state to undermine the traditional Turkmen way of life resulted in significant changes in familial and political relationships, religious and cultural observances, and intellectual developments. Significant numbers of Russians and other Slavs, as well as groups from various nationalities mainly from the Caucasus, migrated to urban areas. Modest industrial capabilities were developed, and limited exploitation of Turkmenistan's natural resources was initiated.<ref name=SSR/>\n\nUnder Soviet rule, all religious beliefs were attacked by the communist authorities as superstition and \"vestiges of the past\". Most religious schooling and religious observance were banned, and the vast majority of mosques were closed. An official Muslim Board of Central Asia with a headquarters in Tashkent was established during [[World War II]] to supervise the Islamic faith in Central Asia. For the most part, the Muslim Board functioned as an instrument of propaganda whose activities did little to enhance the Muslim cause. Atheist indoctrination stifled religious development and contributed to the isolation of the Turkmen from the international Muslim community. Some religious customs, such as Muslim burial and male [[circumcision]], continued to be practiced throughout the Soviet period, but most religious belief, knowledge, and customs were preserved only in rural areas in \"folk form\" as a kind of unofficial Islam not sanctioned by the state-run Spiritual Directorate.<ref>Curtis (1996). \"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+tm0030) Turkmenistan: History and Structure]\".</ref>\n\n===Pre-independence===\nBeginning in the 1930s, Moscow kept the republic under firm control. The nationalities policy of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) fostered the development of a Turkmen political elite and promoted [[Russification]]. Slavs, both in Moscow and Turkmenia, closely supervised the national cadre of government officials and bureaucrats; generally, the Turkmen leadership staunchly supported Soviet policies. Moscow initiated nearly all political activity in the republic, and, except for a corruption scandal in the mid-1980s that ousted longtime First Secretary [[Muhammetnazar Gapurow]], Turkmenistan remained a quiet Soviet republic. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] did not have a significant impact on Turkmenistan, as many people there were self-dependent, and settlers of the territory and the Soviet Union's ministers rarely intertwined. The republic found itself rather unprepared for the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence that followed in 1991.<ref name=indep>Curtis (1996). \"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+tm0017) Turkmenistan: Sovereignty and Independence]\".</ref>\n\nWhen other constituent republics of the Soviet Union advanced claims to sovereignty in 1988 and 1989, Turkmenia's leadership also began to criticize Moscow's economic and political policies as exploitative and detrimental to the well-being and pride of the Turkmen. By a unanimous vote of its Supreme Soviet, Turkmenistan declared its sovereignty in August 1990. After the August 1991 coup attempt against the Gorbachev regime in Moscow, Turkmenia's communist leader [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] called for a popular referendum on independence. The official result of the referendum was 94 percent in favor of independence. The republic's Supreme Soviet had little choice other than to declare Turkmenistan's independence from the Soviet Union and the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkmenistan]] on October 27, 1991.<ref name=indep/> Turkmenistan gained independence from the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of the Soviet Union}}\n{{see also|Politics of Turkmenistan}}\nAs with the other Soviet republics, Turkmenistan had followed the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideology governed by the republic's sole party, [[Communist Party of Turkmenistan]], a republican branch of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe politics of Turkmenistan took place in the framework of a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist]] [[republic]]. The [[List of Chairmen of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Supreme Soviet]] was a [[unicameral]] [[legislature]] of the republic headed by a Chairman, with its superiority

Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika''), also commonly known as '''Turkmenistan''' or '''Turkmenia''', was one of the [[republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republics]] of the [[Soviet Union]] located in [[Soviet Central Asia|Central Asia]] existed as a republic from 1925 to 1991. Initially, on 7 August 1921, it was established as the Turkmen Oblast of the [[Turkestan ASSR]] before being made, on 13 May 1925, a separate republic of the USSR as the Turkmen SSR.\n\nSince then the borders of the Turkmenia were unchanged. On 22 August 1990, Turkmenia declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws. On 27 October 1991, it became independent as the '''[[Republic of Turkmenistan]]'''.\n\nGeographically, Turkmenia was bordered between [[Iran]], [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] to the south, [[Caspian Sea]] to the west, [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] to the north and [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]] to the east.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|History of Turkmenistan}}\n\n===Annexation to Russia===\n[[Russian Empire|Russian]] attempts to encroach upon Turkmen territory began in earnest in the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1869 the [[Russian Empire]] established a foothold in present-day Turkmenistan with the foundation of the [[Caspian Sea]] port of Krasnovodsk (now [[T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy, Turkmenistan|T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy]]). From there and other points, they marched on and subdued the [[Khiva Khanate]] in 1873. Because Turkmen tribes, most notably the Yomud, were in the military service of the Khivan khan, Russian forces undertook punitive raids against [[Khorazm]], in the process slaughtering hundreds of Turkmen and destroying their settlements. In 1881 the Russians under General [[Mikhail Skobelev]] besieged and captured [[Geok Tepe]], one of the last Turkmen strongholds, northwest of [[Ashgabat]]. With the Turkmen defeat (which is now marked by the Turkmen as a [[Public holidays in Turkmenistan|national day of mourning]] and a symbol of national pride), the annexation of what is present-day Turkmenistan met with only weak resistance. Later the same year, the Russians signed an agreement with the Persians and established what essentially remains the current border between Turkmenistan and Iran. In 1897 a similar agreement was signed between the Russians and Afghans.<ref name=Incorporationintorussia>Curtis (1996). \"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+tm0015) Turkmenistan: Incorporation into Russia]\".</ref>\n\nFollowing annexation to Russia, the area was administered as the [[Transcaspian Region]] by corrupt and malfeasant military officers and officials appointed by the [[Russian Turkestan|Turkestan]] Governor-Generalship in [[Tashkent]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}. In the 1880s, a railroad was built from Krasnovodsk to [[Ashgabat]] and later extended to Tashkent. Urban areas began to develop along the railway. Although the Transcaspian Region essentially was a colony of Russia, it remained a backwater, except for Russian concerns with British colonialist intentions in the region and with possible uprisings by the Turkmen.<ref name=Incorporationintorussia/>\n\n===Creation of an SSR===\nBecause the Turkmen generally were indifferent to the [[October Revolution|advent of Soviet rule in 1917]], little revolutionary activity occurred in the region in the years that followed. However, the years immediately preceding the revolution had been marked by sporadic Turkmen uprisings against Russian rule, most prominently the anti-tsarist revolt of 1916 that swept through the whole of Turkestan. Their armed resistance to Soviet rule was part of the larger [[Basmachi Revolt]] throughout Central Asia from the 1920s into the early 1930s, which included most of the future USSR dependencies. Although Soviet sources describe this struggle as a minor chapter in the republic's history, it is clear that opposition was fierce and resulted in the death of large numbers of Turkmen.<ref name=SSR>Curtis (1996). \"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+tm0016) Turkmenistan: Soviet Turkmenistan]\".</ref>\n\nIn October 1924, when Central Asia was divided into distinct political entities, the [[Transcaspian Region]] and [[Turkmen Oblast]] of the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Turkestan ASSR) became the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic (Turkmen SSR), a full-fledged constituent republic of the Soviet Union. During the forced collectivization and other extreme socioeconomic changes of the first decades of Soviet rule, pastoral nomadism ceased to be an economic alternative in Turkmenistan, and by the late 1930s, the majority of Turkmen had become sedentary. Efforts by the Soviet state to undermine the traditional Turkmen way of life resulted in significant changes in familial and political relationships, religious and cultural observances, and intellectual developments. Significant numbers of Russians and other Slavs, as well as groups from various nationalities mainly from the Caucasus, migrated to urban areas. Modest industrial capabilities were developed, and limited exploitation of Turkmenistan's natural resources was initiated.<ref name=SSR/>\n\nUnder Soviet rule, all religious beliefs were attacked by the communist authorities as superstition and \"vestiges of the past\". Most religious schooling and religious observance were banned, and the vast majority of mosques were closed. An official Muslim Board of Central Asia with a headquarters in Tashkent was established during [[World War II]] to supervise the Islamic faith in Central Asia. For the most part, the Muslim Board functioned as an instrument of propaganda whose activities did little to enhance the Muslim cause. Atheist indoctrination stifled religious development and contributed to the isolation of the Turkmen from the international Muslim community. Some religious customs, such as Muslim burial and male [[circumcision]], continued to be practiced throughout the Soviet period, but most religious belief, knowledge, and customs were preserved only in rural areas in \"folk form\" as a kind of unofficial Islam not sanctioned by the state-run Spiritual Directorate.<ref>Curtis (1996). \"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+tm0030) Turkmenistan: History and Structure]\".</ref>\n\n===Pre-independence===\nBeginning in the 1930s, Moscow kept the republic under firm control. The nationalities policy of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) fostered the development of a Turkmen political elite and promoted [[Russification]]. Slavs, both in Moscow and Turkmenia, closely supervised the national cadre of government officials and bureaucrats; generally, the Turkmen leadership staunchly supported Soviet policies. Moscow initiated nearly all political activity in the republic, and, except for a corruption scandal in the mid-1980s that ousted longtime First Secretary [[Muhammetnazar Gapurow]], Turkmenistan remained a quiet Soviet republic. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] did not have a significant impact on Turkmenistan, as many people there were self-dependent, and settlers of the territory and the Soviet Union's ministers rarely intertwined. The republic found itself rather unprepared for the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence that followed in 1991.<ref name=indep>Curtis (1996). \"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+tm0017) Turkmenistan: Sovereignty and Independence]\".</ref>\n\nWhen other constituent republics of the Soviet Union advanced claims to sovereignty in 1988 and 1989, Turkmenia's leadership also began to criticize Moscow's economic and political policies as exploitative and detrimental to the well-being and pride of the Turkmen. By a unanimous vote of its Supreme Soviet, Turkmenistan declared its sovereignty in August 1990. After the August 1991 coup attempt against the Gorbachev regime in Moscow, Turkmenia's communist leader [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] called for a popular referendum on independence. The official result of the referendum was 94 percent in favor of independence. The republic's Supreme Soviet had little choice other than to declare Turkmenistan's independence from the Soviet Union and the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkmenistan]] on October 27, 1991.<ref name=indep/> Turkmenistan gained independence from the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of the Soviet Union}}\n{{see also|Politics of Turkmenistan}}\nAs with the other Soviet republics, Turkmenistan had followed the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideology governed by the republic's sole party, [[Communist Party of Turkmenistan]], a republican branch of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe politics of Turkmenistan took place in the framework of a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[socialist state|socialist]] [[republic]]. The [[List of Chairmen of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Supreme Soviet]] was a [[unicameral]] [[legislature]] of the republic headed by a Chairman, with its superiority to both the executive and judicial branches and its members meet in [[Ashgabat|Ashkhabad]].\n\n===Political leadership===\n\n===First Secretaries of the Communist Party of Turkmenistan===\n*[[Ivan Mezhlauk]] (19 November 1924 \u2013 1926) <small>(acting until 20 February 1925)</small>\n*[[Shaymardan Ibragimov]] (June 1926 \u2013 1927)\n*[[Nikolay Paskutsky]] (1927 \u2013 1928)\n*[[Grigory Aronshtam]] (11 May 1928 \u2013 August 1930)\n*[[Yakov Popok]] (August 1930 \u2013 15 April 1937)\n*[[Anna Mukhamedov]] (April \u2013 October 1937)\n*[[Yakov Chubin]] (October 1937 \u2013 November 1939)\n*[[Mikhail Fonin]] (November 1939 \u2013 March 1947)\n*[[Shadzha Batyrov]] (March 1947 \u2013 July 1951)\n*[[Sukhan Babayev]] (July 1951 \u2013 14 December 1958)\n*[[Dzhuma Durdy Karayev]] (14 December 1958 \u2013 4 May 1960)\n*[[Balysh Ovezov]] (13 June 1960 \u2013 24 December 1969)\n*[[Muhammetnazar Gapurow]] (24 December 1969 \u2013 21 December 1985)\n*[[Saparmurat Niyazov]] (21 December 1985 \u2013 16 December 1991)\n\n===Chairmen of the Council of People's Commissars===\n*[[Kaikhaziz Atabayev]] (20 February 1925 \u2013 8 July 1937)\n*[[Aitbay Khudaybergenov]] (October 1937 \u2013 17 October 1945)\n*[[Sukhan Babayev]] (17 October 1945 \u2013 15 March 1946)\n\n===Chairmen of the Council of Ministers===\n*[[Sukhan Babayev]] (15 March 1946 \u2013 14 July 1951)\n*[[Balysh Ovezov]] (14 July 1951 \u2013 14 January 1958) (1st time)\n*[[Dzhuma Durdy Karayev]] (14 January 1958 \u2013 20 January 1959)\n*[[Balysh Ovezov]] (20 January 1959 \u2013 13 June 1960) (2nd time)\n*[[Abdy Annaliyev]] (13 June 1960 \u2013 26 March 1963)\n*[[Muhammetnazar Gapurow]] (26 March 1963 \u2013 25 December 1969)\n*[[Oraz Orazmuhammedow]] (25 December 1969 \u2013 17 December 1975)\n*[[Bally Yazkuliyev]] (17 December 1975 \u2013 15 December 1978)\n*[[Chary Karriyev]] (15 December 1978 \u2013 26 March 1985)\n*[[Saparmurat Niyazov]] (26 March 1985 \u2013 4 January 1986)\n*[[Annamurat Hojamyradow]] (4 January 1986 \u2013 17 November 1989)  \n*[[Han Ahmedow]] (5 December 1989 \u2013 27 October 1991)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Communist Party of the Turkmen SSR]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Loc}}\n* {{cite book |last=Curtis |first=Glenn E. |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/tmtoc.html |title=Turkmenistan: A Country Study |series=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington |year=1996 |oclc=45380435}}\n* {{Citation|last=Edgar|first=Adrienne Lynn|title=Tribal Nation: The Making of Soviet Turkmenistan|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|year=2004}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://archive.org/details/TurkmeniaManMastersTheDesert ''Turkmenia: Man Masters the Desert''] by [[Balysh Ovezov]].\n\n{{Republics of the Soviet Union}}\n{{Turkmenistan topics}}\n\n{{coord|37|58|N|58|20|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Former socialist republics]]\n[[Category:Republics of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Communism in Turkmenistan]]\n[[Category:Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic| ]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1921]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1925]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1991]]\n[[Category:1925 disestablishments in the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:1991 disestablishments in the Soviet Union]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:1fa1:86aa:a829:4506:6c02:7f40:3385", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmen_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"}

Based on [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|1999 novel of the same name]], the motion picture features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Claire Danes]], [[Charlie Cox]], [[Sienna Miller]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Jason Flemyng]], [[Rupert Everett]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], and [[Robert De Niro]], with narration by [[Ian McKellen]].\n\nThe movie follows Tristan, a young man from the fictional town of Wall in the [[United Kingdom]]. Wall is a town on the border of the magical fantasy kingdom of Stormhold. Tristan enters the magical world to collect a fallen star to give to his crush Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. He collects the star who, to his surprise, is a woman named Yvaine. [[Witches]] and the Princes of Stormhold are also hunting for Yvaine. Meanwhile, Tristan tries to get her back to Wall with him before Victoria's birthday, the deadline of her offer.\n\nThe film was released to positive reviews and grossed $137 million on a $70\u201388.5 million budget.<ref name=\"numbers\" /> In 2008, it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]].<ref name=\"hugo\" /> ''Stardust'' was released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[HD DVD]] on December 18, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\nThe English village of Wall lies near a stone wall that borders the magical kingdom of Stormhold. A guard prevents anyone from crossing. Dunstan Thorne crosses over the wall and into the Wall Market. He meets an enslaved princess named Una, who offers him a glass [[snowdrop]] in exchange for a kiss. Nine months later, the Wall Guard delivers a baby to Dunstan, saying the baby's name is Tristan.\n\nEighteen years later, the dying King of Stormhold throws a ruby into the sky, decreeing that his successor will be the first of his [[fratricidal]] sons to recover it. The gem hits a star, they fall together, and the remaining sons, Primus and Septimus, independently search for the now clear gem.\n\nIn Wall, Tristan sees the star fall and vows to retrieve it for the object of his infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. Tristan learns that his mother is from beyond the wall, and receives a Babylon candle that she left for him, which can take the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, personified as a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He chains her to bring her to Victoria.\n\nThree ancient witch sisters in Stormhold resolve to eat the fallen star's heart to recover their youth and replenish their powers. Their leader, [[Lamia]], eats the remnants of an earlier star's heart, and sets off to find Yvaine. She conjures up a wayside inn as a trap.\n\nYvaine becomes tired, so Tristan chains her to a tree and promises to bring food. In his absence, a [[unicorn]] releases her, but unwittingly takes her to Lamia's inn. Tristan discovers Yvaine gone, but the stars whisper that she is in danger, telling him to get on a passing coach, which happens to be Primus'. At the inn, they interrupt Lamia's attempt to kill Yvaine. Lamia kills Primus, but Tristan and Yvaine use the Babylon candle to escape into the clouds, where they are captured by [[Air pirate|pirates]] in a flying ship. The leader, Captain Shakespeare, befriends Tristan and Yvaine, teaching Tristan how to [[fencing|fence]] and Yvaine how to dance.\n\nSeptimus discovers that as the last surviving son, he needs only find the stone to claim the throne. He learns it is in the possession of the fallen star and realizes that the heart of a star grants [[immortality]].\n\nAfter leaving Captain Shakespeare's ship, Tristan and Yvaine confess their love for one another and spend the night together at an inn. Come morning, Tristan leaves Yvaine sleeping and goes to Wall with a lock of her hair, to tell Victoria he will not marry her, having fallen in love with Yvaine. When the lock turns to stardust, he realizes Yvaine will die if she crosses the wall, and rushes back to save her.\n\nYvaine finds Tristan gone, and starts walking towards the wall, thinking he has abandoned her for Victoria. Tristan's mother Una notices Yvaine walking to her doom, so she takes the [[Vardo (gypsy wagon)|caravan]] of her enslaver, a witch named Ditchwater Sal, to stop her. Lamia kills Sal, and captures Una and Yvaine, taking them to the witches' castle. Septimus and Tristan both pursue Lamia, agreeing to work together for the time being. Barging into the castle, Septimus recognises the princess as his long lost sister and Una informs Tristan that she is his mother.\n\nSeptimus and Tristan kill two of the witches, but Lamia uses a [[voodoo doll]] to kill Septimus. Lamia is about to finish Tristan off, when she appears to break down over the loss of her sisters. Lamia frees Yvaine, but her feigned defeat was a ruse, and she tries to kill them both. As Tristan and Yvaine embrace, their love allows her to shine once again, vaporising Lamia.\n\nTristan retrieves the jewel that Yvaine was wearing. As the jewel turns red, Una explains that, as her son, Tristan is the last male heir of Stormhold. He becomes king with Yvaine as his queen while Dunstan and Una are reunited. After eighty years of ruling Stormhold, they use a Babylon candle to ascend to the sky, where they live together as stars.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Yvaine, the Fallen Star\n* [[Charlie Cox]] as Tristan Thorn\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Lamia\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Prince Septimus\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Captain Shakespeare of the ''Caspartine''\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Prince Primus\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Prince Secundus\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Ferdiland \"Ferdy\" the [[Fence (criminal)|Fence]]\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Victoria Forester\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as the dying King of Stormhold\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as the Narrator\n* [[Kate Magowan]] as Princess Una\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Mormo, Lamia's sister\n* [[Sarah Alexander]] as Empusa,  Lamia's other sister\n* [[Mark Heap]] as Prince Tertius\n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as the ghost of Prince Quartus\n* [[Adam Buxton]] as the ghost of Prince Quintus\n* [[David Walliams]] as the ghost of Prince Sextus\n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as Dunstan Thorn\n** [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as a young Dunstan Thorn\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as Humphrey, Victoria's boyfriend\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as the Wall Guard\n* [[Melanie Hill]] as Ditchwater Sal\n* [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as Billy, the Goat converted into human form\n* [[Jake Curran]] as Bernard\n** [[Olivia Grant (actress born 1983)|Olivia Grant]] as Bernard's female form\n* [[George Innes]] as the Soothsayer\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as the Skinny Pirate\n* [[Eliot Sumner|Eliot (Coco) Sumner]] as Ingrid, Yvaine's sister\n* [[Mark Burns (actor)|Mark Burns]] as the New Bishop\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''[[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|Stardust]]'' is an [[Fantasy literature|illustrated fantasy story]] created by [[Neil Gaiman]], with art by [[Charles Vess]].

directed by [[Matthew Vaughn]] and co-written by Vaughn and [[Jane Goldman]]. Based on [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|1999 novel of the same name]], the film features an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Claire Danes]], [[Charlie Cox]], [[Sienna Miller]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Jason Flemyng]], [[Rupert Everett]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], and [[Robert De Niro]], with narration by [[Ian McKellen]].\n\nThe film follows Tristan, a young man from the fictional town of Wall in the [[United Kingdom]]. Wall is a town on the border of the magical fantasy kingdom of Stormhold. Tristan enters the magical world to collect a fallen star to give to his crush Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. He collects the star who, to his surprise, is a woman named Yvaine. [[Witches]] and the Princes of Stormhold are also hunting for Yvaine. Meanwhile, Tristan tries to get her back to Wall with him before Victoria's birthday, the deadline of her offer.\n\nThe film was released to positive reviews and grossed $137 million on a $70\u201388.5 million budget.<ref name=\"numbers\" /> In 2008, it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form]].<ref name=\"hugo\" /> ''Stardust'' was released on [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[HD DVD]] on December 18, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\nThe English village of Wall lies near a stone wall that borders the magical kingdom of Stormhold. A guard prevents anyone from crossing. Dunstan Thorne crosses over the wall and into the Wall Market. He meets an enslaved princess named Una, who offers him a glass [[snowdrop]] in exchange for a kiss. Nine months later, the Wall Guard delivers a baby to Dunstan, saying the baby's name is Tristan.\n\nEighteen years later, the dying King of Stormhold throws a ruby into the sky, decreeing that his successor will be the first of his [[fratricidal]] sons to recover it. The gem hits a star, they fall together, and the remaining sons, Primus and Septimus, independently search for the now clear gem.\n\nIn Wall, Tristan sees the star fall and vows to retrieve it for the object of his infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. Tristan learns that his mother is from beyond the wall, and receives a Babylon candle that she left for him, which can take the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, personified as a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He chains her to bring her to Victoria.\n\nThree ancient witch sisters in Stormhold resolve to eat the fallen star's heart to recover their youth and replenish their powers. Their leader, [[Lamia]], eats the remnants of an earlier star's heart, and sets off to find Yvaine. She conjures up a wayside inn as a trap.\n\nYvaine becomes tired, so Tristan chains her to a tree and promises to bring food. In his absence, a [[unicorn]] releases her, but unwittingly takes her to Lamia's inn. Tristan discovers Yvaine gone, but the stars whisper that she is in danger, telling him to get on a passing coach, which happens to be Primus'. At the inn, they interrupt Lamia's attempt to kill Yvaine. Lamia kills Primus, but Tristan and Yvaine use the Babylon candle to escape into the clouds, where they are captured by [[Air pirate|pirates]] in a flying ship. The leader, Captain Shakespeare, befriends Tristan and Yvaine, teaching Tristan how to [[fencing|fence]] and Yvaine how to dance.\n\nSeptimus discovers that as the last surviving son, he needs only find the stone to claim the throne. He learns it is in the possession of the fallen star and realizes that the heart of a star grants [[immortality]].\n\nAfter leaving Captain Shakespeare's ship, Tristan and Yvaine confess their love for one another and spend the night together at an inn. Come morning, Tristan leaves Yvaine sleeping and goes to Wall with a lock of her hair, to tell Victoria he will not marry her, having fallen in love with Yvaine. When the lock turns to stardust, he realizes Yvaine will die if she crosses the wall, and rushes back to save her.\n\nYvaine finds Tristan gone, and starts walking towards the wall, thinking he has abandoned her for Victoria. Tristan's mother Una notices Yvaine walking to her doom, so she takes the [[Vardo (gypsy wagon)|caravan]] of her enslaver, a witch named Ditchwater Sal, to stop her. Lamia kills Sal, and captures Una and Yvaine, taking them to the witches' castle. Septimus and Tristan both pursue Lamia, agreeing to work together for the time being. Barging into the castle, Septimus recognises the princess as his long lost sister and Una informs Tristan that she is his mother.\n\nSeptimus and Tristan kill two of the witches, but Lamia uses a [[voodoo doll]] to kill Septimus. Lamia is about to finish Tristan off, when she appears to break down over the loss of her sisters. Lamia frees Yvaine, but her feigned defeat was a ruse, and she tries to kill them both. As Tristan and Yvaine embrace, their love allows her to shine once again, vaporising Lamia.\n\nTristan retrieves the jewel that Yvaine was wearing. As the jewel turns red, Una explains that, as her son, Tristan is the last male heir of Stormhold. He becomes king with Yvaine as his queen while Dunstan and Una are reunited. After eighty years of ruling Stormhold, they use a Babylon candle to ascend to the sky, where they live together as stars.\n<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material; total word count should not exceed 700. -->\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Claire Danes]] as Yvaine, the Fallen Star\n* [[Charlie Cox]] as Tristan Thorn\n* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as Lamia\n* [[Mark Strong]] as Prince Septimus\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Captain Shakespeare of the ''Caspartine''\n* [[Jason Flemyng]] as Prince Primus\n* [[Rupert Everett]] as Prince Secundus\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Ferdiland \"Ferdy\" the [[Fence (criminal)|Fence]]\n* [[Sienna Miller]] as Victoria Forester\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as the dying King of Stormhold\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as the Narrator\n* [[Kate Magowan]] as Princess Una\n* [[Joanna Scanlan]] as Mormo, Lamia's sister\n* [[Sarah Alexander]] as Empusa,  Lamia's other sister\n* [[Mark Heap]] as Prince Tertius\n* [[Julian Rhind-Tutt]] as the ghost of Prince Quartus\n* [[Adam Buxton]] as the ghost of Prince Quintus\n* [[David Walliams]] as the ghost of Prince Sextus\n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as Dunstan Thorn\n** [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] as a young Dunstan Thorn\n* [[Henry Cavill]] as Humphrey, Victoria's boyfriend\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as the Wall Guard\n* [[Melanie Hill]] as Ditchwater Sal\n* [[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]] as Billy, the Goat converted into human form\n* [[Jake Curran]] as Bernard\n** [[Olivia Grant (actress born 1983)|Olivia Grant]] as Bernard's female form\n* [[George Innes]] as the Soothsayer\n* [[Dexter Fletcher]] as the Skinny Pirate\n* [[Eliot Sumner|Eliot (Coco) Sumner]] as Ingrid, Yvaine's sister\n* [[Mark Burns (actor)|Mark Burns]] as the New Bishop\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''[[Stardust (Gaiman novel)|Stardust]]'' is an [[Fantasy literature|illustrated fantasy story]] created by [[Neil Gaiman]], with art by [[Charles Vess]].

The episode aired on March 2, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]], in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\nThe episode centers on [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) being forced to use his fast-talking \"Saul Goodman\" legal personality to arrange for the release of Domingo Molina (Max Arciniega) from prison at the request of [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]), while [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]) is pulled off her ''[[pro bono]]'' public defense work to deal with a stubborn client for the Mesa Verde bank. The episode features the guest appearance of ''Breaking Bad'' star [[Dean Norris]] reprising his role as DEA agent [[Hank Schrader]], along with [[Steven Michael Quezada]] as Hank's partner Steven Gomez. Showrunner [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] brought the character of Hank back to help drive the transformation of Jimmy into Saul.\n\nThe episode was well-received by critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nNacho takes a nervous Jimmy to Lalo, who knows of Jimmy's reputation from his cousin Tuco.{{efn|As shown in episode \"[[Mijo]]\"}} Lalo wants Jimmy to get Domingo out of jail by giving the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] information on Gus's [[dead drop]]s. Jimmy quotes Lalo what Jimmy believes is an exorbitant fee, and is surprised when Lalo readily pays in advance and in cash. He tells Kim he had a good day financially, but does not disclose any details.\n\nMike gets drunk at the bar he once visited with Werner,{{efn|As shown in episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\"}} and demands that the bartender take down a postcard of the [[Sydney Opera House]], which reminds him of Werner because he knows Werner's father worked on it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/jimmy-tangles-with-some-familiar-adversaries-and-bette-1842010779 |title=Jimmy tangles with some familiar adversaries, and Better Call Saul's big bosses pull the strings |first=Donna |last=Bowman |date=March 2, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[The A.V. Club]] }}</ref> On his way home, a gang of thugs attempt to rob Mike but he breaks the leader's arm and calmly walks off.\n\nNacho's father Manuel visits him at home and reveals that someone has offered to buy his upholstery shop for much more than its worth. Manuel accuses Nacho of arranging the deal to help Manuel steer clear of the drug business.  He refuses to accept and says he will not flee.  He goes on to tell Nacho that if Nacho is in trouble, then Nacho should decide for himself whether to flee or turn himself in to police.\n\nJimmy meets with Domingo in jail and explains Lalo's plan. When DEA agents [[Hank Schrader]] and Steve Gomez arrive to interview Domingo, Jimmy steps in as Domingo's lawyer Saul Goodman, arranging for Domingo to be released and protected as a [[confidential informant]] for Hank in exchange for Gus's dead drop locations. Jimmy reports the results of the interaction to Lalo, who is pleased, while Nacho warns Jimmy that once he begins working for drug dealers like the Salamancas, there is no turning back: \"Once you're in, you're in.\" That night, Nacho reports Domingo's release to Gus and explains Lalo's plan for the dead drops. An unhappy Gus decides to maintain the dead drops, because doing otherwise would reveal to Lalo that someone is providing inside information about the Salamancas. Gus is visibly frustrated and angry because leaving the dead drops to be found by police will cost him at least a half million dollars.\n\nKim has a full day of ''pro bono'' cases, but Rich demands she take care of pressing Mesa Verde business. A [[Tucumcari]] homeowner, Everett Acker, is refusing to leave property leased from the bank so that the bank can begin construction of a new [[call center]]. When Acker refuses a compromise and insults Kim, she argues with him and says he has no choice. Paige and the bank representatives are happy with her hard line approach, but Kim is troubled. On her way home, she turns around and returns to Tucumcari. She approaches Acker sympathetically, tries to convince him to move, and offers to help him herself. Acker rejects her offer, and tells her she will say whatever is necessary to get what she wants. Kim vents her frustrations by throwing beer bottles from her balcony with Jimmy.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Dean_Norris_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dean Norris]] reprises his ''Breaking Bad'' role of [[Hank Schrader]].]]\nThis episode features the appearance of [[Dean Norris]] reprising his starring role on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' as DEA agent [[Hank Schrader]], along with [[Steven Michael Quezada]] reprising Hank's partner Steven Gomez; Norris is the first of the leading cast credited through the entirety of ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s run to appear on ''Better Call Saul''.{{efn|While [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]] and [[Jonathan Banks]] were all main cast in ''Breaking Bad'', they were not credited as such until the third season.}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/03/02/dean-norris-breaking-bad-dea-agent-better-call-saul/4895744002/ |title=Exclusive: Dean Norris on revisiting his 'Breaking Bad' character on 'Better Call Saul' |first=Bill |last=Keveney |date=March 2, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[USA Today]] }}</ref> When ''Better Call Saul'' was first in development, Norris had been unavailable due to starring in ''[[Under the Dome (TV series)|Under the Dome]]'' but expressed interest in returning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/07/03/dean-norris-says-appearance-on-better-call-saul-unlikely-cbs-exec-les-moonves-wont-let-me-do-it/ |title=Dean Norris says appearance on Better Call Saul unlikely: CBS, exec Les Moonves 'won't let me do it' |work=[[The National Post]] |date=July 3, 2014 |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |author=Dekel, Jonathan |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140707075719/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/07/03/dean-norris-says-appearance-on-better-call-saul-unlikely-cbs-exec-les-moonves-wont-let-me-do-it/ |archivedate=July 7, 2014}}</ref> Norris said that he and showrunner [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had spoken many times before of bringing Hank back for ''Better Call Saul'', though Norris said to Gould, \"Just don't let it be a gratuitous return, just to say he's in it.\"<ref name=\"ew norris\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/breaking-bad-dean-norris-on-hank-return-better-call-saul/ |title=Breaking Bad vet Dean Norris breaks down Hank's return on Better Call Saul |first1=Dan |last1=Snierson |date=March 3, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref> Norris said that Gould wanted to have Hank come back to have some part in the transformation of Jimmy McGill into Saul Goodman so that Hank's appearance was not gratuitous.<ref name=\"ew norris\"/> Gould himself spoke of the need to have \"some very smart law enforcement people who are worthy opponents\" for Jimmy that would push him into using the Saul Goodman persona even deeper without necessarily recognizing the full consequences of those actions, and thus where it made sense to bring in Norris to play Hank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/better-call-saul-showrunner-breaks-down-why-breaking-bad-prequel-needed-hank-schrader/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Showrunner Breaks Down Why \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 Prequel Needed Hank Schrader |first=Tim |last=Baysinger |date=March 2, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[The Wrap]] }}</ref> Norris found it easy to fall back into character, particularly as the version of Hank prior to his [[PTSD]] from killing Tuco in \"[[Grilled (Breaking Bad)|Grilled]]\", as well as acting alongside Quezada, who he has remained friends with since their ''Breaking Bad'' days.<ref name=\"ew norris\"/>\n\nThe show opens and closes on scenes involving a mass of ants swarming over an ice cream cone that Jimmy dropped when he was picked up by Nacho. The shots were made with about two thousand live [[red harvester ant]]s, collected from and returned to the wild by animal trainer Jules Sylvester.

The episode aired on March 2, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]], in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\nThe episode centers on [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) being forced to use his fast-talking \"Saul Goodman\" legal personality to arrange for the release of Domingo Molina (Max Arciniega) from prison at the request of [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]), while [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]) is pulled off her ''[[pro bono]]'' public defense work to deal with a stubborn client for the Mesa Verde bank. The episode features the guest appearance of ''Breaking Bad'' star [[Dean Norris]] reprising his role as DEA agent [[Hank Schrader]], along with [[Steven Michael Quezada]] as Hank's partner Steven Gomez. Showrunner [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] brought the character of Hank back to help drive the transformation of Jimmy into Saul.\n\nThe episode was well-received by critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nNacho takes a nervous Jimmy to Lalo, who knows of Jimmy's reputation from his cousin Tuco.{{efn|As shown in episode \"[[Mijo]]\"}} Lalo wants Jimmy to get Domingo out of jail by giving the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] information on Gus's [[dead drop]]s. Jimmy quotes Lalo what Jimmy believes is an exorbitant fee, and is surprised when Lalo readily pays in advance and in cash. He tells Kim he had a good day financially, but does not disclose any details.\n\nMike gets drunk at the bar he once visited with Werner,{{efn|As shown in episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\"}} and demands that the bartender take down a postcard of the [[Sydney Opera House]], which reminds him of Werner because he knows Werner's father worked on it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/jimmy-tangles-with-some-familiar-adversaries-and-bette-1842010779 |title=Jimmy tangles with some familiar adversaries, and Better Call Saul's big bosses pull the strings |first=Donna |last=Bowman |date=March 2, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[The A.V. Club]] }}</ref> On his way home, a gang of thugs attempt to rob Mike but he breaks the leader's arm and calmly walks off.\n\nNacho's father Manuel visits him at home and reveals that someone has offered to buy his upholstery shop for much more than its worth. Manuel accuses Nacho of arranging the deal to help Manuel steer clear of the drug business.  He refuses to accept and says he will not flee.  He goes on to tell Nacho that if Nacho is in trouble, then Nacho should decide for himself whether to flee or turn himself in to police.\n\nJimmy meets with Domingo in jail and explains Lalo's plan. When DEA agents [[Hank Schrader]] and Steve Gomez arrive to interview Domingo, Jimmy steps in as Domingo's lawyer Saul Goodman, arranging for Domingo to be released and protected as a personal [[Confidential informant]] for Hank in exchange for Gus's dead drop locations. Jimmy reports the results of the interaction to Lalo, who is pleased, while Nacho warns Jimmy that once he begins working for drug dealers like the Salamancas, there is no turning back: \"Once you're in, you're in.\" That night, Nacho reports Domingo's release to Gus and explains Lalo's plan for the dead drops. An unhappy Gus decides to maintain the dead drops, because doing otherwise would reveal to Lalo that someone is providing inside information about the Salamancas. Gus is visibly frustrated and angry because leaving the dead drops to be found by police will cost him at least a half million dollars.\n\nKim has a full day of ''pro bono'' cases, but Rich demands she take care of pressing Mesa Verde business. A [[Tucumcari]] homeowner, Everett Acker, is refusing to leave property leased from the bank so that the bank can begin construction of a new [[call center]]. When Acker refuses a compromise and insults Kim, she argues with him and says he has no choice. Paige and the bank representatives are happy with her hard line approach, but Kim is troubled. On her way home, she turns around and returns to Tucumcari.  She approaches Acker sympathetically, tries to convince him to move, and offers to help him herself. Acker rejects her offer, and tells her she will say whatever is necessary to get what she wants. Kim vents her frustrations by throwing beer bottles from her balcony with Jimmy.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Dean_Norris_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dean Norris]] reprises his ''Breaking Bad'' role of [[Hank Schrader]].]]\nThis episode features the appearance of [[Dean Norris]] reprising his starring role on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' as DEA agent [[Hank Schrader]], along with [[Steven Michael Quezada]] reprising Hank's partner Steven Gomez; Norris is the first of the leading cast credited through the entirety of ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s run to appear on ''Better Call Saul''.{{efn|While [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]] and [[Jonathan Banks]] were all main cast in ''Breaking Bad'', they were not credited as such until the third season.}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/03/02/dean-norris-breaking-bad-dea-agent-better-call-saul/4895744002/ |title=Exclusive: Dean Norris on revisiting his 'Breaking Bad' character on 'Better Call Saul' |first=Bill |last=Keveney |date=March 2, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[USA Today]] }}</ref> When ''Better Call Saul'' was first in development, Norris had been unavailable due to starring in ''[[Under the Dome (TV series)|Under the Dome]]'' but expressed interest in returning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/07/03/dean-norris-says-appearance-on-better-call-saul-unlikely-cbs-exec-les-moonves-wont-let-me-do-it/ |title=Dean Norris says appearance on Better Call Saul unlikely: CBS, exec Les Moonves 'won't let me do it' |work=[[The National Post]] |date=July 3, 2014 |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |author=Dekel, Jonathan |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140707075719/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/07/03/dean-norris-says-appearance-on-better-call-saul-unlikely-cbs-exec-les-moonves-wont-let-me-do-it/ |archivedate=July 7, 2014}}</ref> Norris said that he and showrunner [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had spoken many times before of bringing Hank back for ''Better Call Saul'', though Norris said to Gould, \"Just don't let it be a gratuitous return, just to say he's in it.\"<ref name=\"ew norris\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/breaking-bad-dean-norris-on-hank-return-better-call-saul/ |title=Breaking Bad vet Dean Norris breaks down Hank's return on Better Call Saul |first1=Dan |last1=Snierson |date=March 3, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref> Norris said that Gould wanted to have Hank come back to have some part in the transformation of Jimmy McGill into Saul Goodman so that Hank's appearance was not gratuitous.<ref name=\"ew norris\"/> Gould himself spoke of the need to have \"some very smart law enforcement people who are worthy opponents\" for Jimmy that would push him into using the Saul Goodman persona even deeper without necessarily recognizing the full consequences of those actions, and thus where it made sense to bring in Norris to play Hank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/better-call-saul-showrunner-breaks-down-why-breaking-bad-prequel-needed-hank-schrader/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Showrunner Breaks Down Why \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 Prequel Needed Hank Schrader |first=Tim |last=Baysinger |date=March 2, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[The Wrap]] }}</ref> Norris found it easy to fall back into character, particularly as the version of Hank prior to his [[PTSD]] from killing Tuco in \"[[Grilled (Breaking Bad)|Grilled]]\", as well as acting alongside Quezada, who he has remained friends with since their ''Breaking Bad'' days.<ref name=\"ew norris\"/>\n\nThe show opens and closes on scenes involving a mass of ants swarming over an ice cream cone that Jimmy dropped when he was picked up by Nacho.

Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories. However, it was the advent of the [[Second World War]] that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit.

Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev.

During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories. However, it was the advent of the [[Second World War]] that enabled Pudney to find his subject - the effect that war has on the lives of ordinary people - and with it, his audience.<ref name=times>''The Times'' obituary, 11 November 1977, p 17</ref> In 1940 he was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]] as an intelligence officer and as a member of the [[Air Ministry]]'s Creative Writers Unit. It was while he was serving as squadron intelligence officer at [[RAF St Eval]] in Cornwall that Pudney wrote one of the best-known poems of the war.<ref name=dnb/> ''For Johnny'' evoked popular fellow-feeling in the London of 1941. Written during an air raid, it was published first in the ''News Chronicle'', and featured significantly in the film ''[[The Way to the Stars]]'':\n\n<poem>\nDo not despair\nFor Johnny-head-in-air;\nHe sleeps as sound\nAs Johnny underground.\n\nFetch out no shroud\nFor Johnny-in-the-cloud;\nAnd keep your tears\nFor him in after years.\n\nBetter by far\nFor Johnny-the-bright-star,\nTo keep your head,\nAnd see his children fed.\n</poem>\n\n==Later Career==\nIn the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|UK General Election of July 1945]], Pudney stood as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate for [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks]], polling 14,947 votes, or 36 per cent.<ref>''The International Who's Who'' (Europa Publications Limited, 1963) p. 857</ref><ref>[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm UK General Election results July 1945] at keele.ac.uk, accessed 10 January 2009</ref>\n\nAfter the war he continued to write and worked as an editor and in publishing. He was with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950, and as a director and literary adviser at the publishing houses Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic. Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert,<ref>[http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ John Pudney (1909 - 1977) - The War Poets Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130417054114/http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/ww2/pudney/ |date=17 April 2013 }}</ref> the daughter of [[A.

In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967. That process became a subject for his writing. In 1976 he developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain.

A version of ''Fate/stay night'' rated for ages 15 and up titled ''Fate/stay night R\u00e9alta Nua'' ([[Irish language|Irish]] for \"new stars\"), which features the Japanese [[Seiy\u016b|voice actors]] from the anime series, was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] and later for download on Windows as a trilogy covering the three main story lines. ''R\u00e9alta Nua'' was also ported to the [[PlayStation Vita]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The plot focuses on a young mage named [[Shirou Emiya]] who becomes a warrior in a battle between \"Servants\" known as the Holy Grail War. Through each route, Shirou bonds with a heroine and confronts different mages who participate in the war.\n\nA manga series adaptation by Datto Nishiwaki was serialized in [[Kadokawa Shoten]]'s ''[[Sh\u014dnen Ace]]'' magazine between the February 2006 and December 2012 issues. In 2007, the manga was licensed for an English-language release in North America by [[Tokyopop]]. A 24-episode anime series created by [[Studio Deen]] aired in Japan between January and June 2006. [[Sentai Filmworks]] has licensed the television series and re-released the series on [[DVD]] and for the first time on [[Blu-ray Disc]]. A film adaptation by Studio Deen was released in Japanese theaters on January 23, 2010. A second anime television series, ''[[Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works]]'', was produced by [[Ufotable]] and aired between October 2014 and June 2015, following the game's second route as opposed to the first. A second manga adaptation began in 2015 focusing solely on the third route. [[Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel|A film trilogy]] will adapt the Heaven's Feel route of the visual novel, with the first film, titled ''[[Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel I. presage flower|presage flower]]'', released in 2017, the second film, titled ''[[Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel II. lost butterfly|lost butterfly]]'', released in 2019, with the final film, titled ''spring song'' scheduled to be released on March 28, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-01-11/last-fate-stay-night-heaven-feel-anime-film-title-spring-2020-date-revealed/.141868|title=Last Fate/stay night Heaven's Feel Anime Film's Title, Spring 2020 Date Revealed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=January 11, 2019|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Fate/stay night'' spawned the ''Fate'' [[media franchise]], consisting of a number of adaptations and spin-offs in various different media. On October 28, 2005, Type-Moon released a sequel to ''Fate/stay night'', titled ''[[Fate/hollow ataraxia]]''. Its plot is set half a year after the events of ''Fate/stay night''. A [[light novel]] series titled ''[[Fate/Zero]]'', set as a prequel to ''Fate/stay night'', was published from 2006 to 2007, with an anime adaptation by Ufotable airing between October 2011 and June 2012. A spin-off [[magical girl]] manga series, ''[[Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya]]'', began serialization in 2012 and has received multiple anime television series. Three [[fighting game]]s have been released: ''[[Fate/unlimited codes]]'' for [[Arcade game|arcades]] and [[PlayStation 2]], ''[[Fate/tiger colosseum]]'' and its sequel ''Fate/tiger colosseum Upper'' for [[PlayStation Potable|PSP]]. A PSP [[Role-playing game|RPG]] titled ''[[Fate/Extra]]'' was released on July 22, 2010, and a sequel and companion game, ''Fate/Extra CCC'', was released on March 28, 2013. An online RPG titled ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'' was released on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] on July 29, 2015, followed by an August 12 release on [[iOS]]; an anime film adaptation by [[Lay-duce]] was released on December 31, 2016 with sequel adaptations by [[CloverWorks]] and [[Production I.G.]] in production.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Fate/stay night''{{'}}s gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears, representing either dialogue between the characters, narration, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Often, players will come to a \"decision point\" where they are given the chance to choose from options displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. The time between these decision points is variable and during these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction. There are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all three plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction. When interacting with the heroines with the routes, an \"affection meter\" is created which is raised by giving them an answer that pleases them. Depending on the affection the player has achieved, a \"True Ending\" can be unlocked.<ref name=\"gama\"/>\n\nThere are multiple ways in which the player can lose the game, including Shirou's death or a decision that causes the heroine to be murdered. Should this happen, the player is taken to an area called the {{nihongo|Tiger Dojo|\u30bf\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc\u9053\u5834|Taig\u0101 D\u014dj\u014d}} where Taiga Fujimura and Illyasviel von Einzbern give the player hints about what they should do to survive in the next attempt to complete the game.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fate/side material|page=65|publisher=Type Moon}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Fate/stay night characters}}\nThe story revolves around [[Shirou Emiya]], a hardworking and honest teenager who unwillingly enters a to-the-death tournament called the Fifth Holy Grail War, where combatants fight with magic and Heroes throughout history for a chance to have their wishes granted. Orphaned and the sole survivor of a massive fire in Fuyuki City as a child, Shirou was taken in by a retired mage named Kiritsugu Emiya, who would die years later. His responsibility to those who died and his salvation through his father formed a strong desire for justice and peace in him. Thus, he earnestly trains his body and minuscule ability with magic to someday greatly help others, even if at his stage people often abuse his generosity. One evening, after seeing two devastatingly powerful beings trading blows at his school with swords and spears, he is attacked, as witnesses to the Holy Grail War are generally supposed to be eliminated. Chased to his home by the spear-wielding warrior Lancer, and barely able to avoid his attacks, Shirou is about to be killed when he is saved by [[Saber (Fate/stay night)|Saber]]. Saber, the personification of a renowned figure in history ([[King Arthur|Arturia Pendragon]] in her case) was created to aid participants in the War. In her supposedly accidental summoning and the appearance of the marks on Shirou's hand, his entry as a Master into the Holy Grail War is formalized.<ref name=\"daythree\">{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night|year=2004|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|level=Fate: Day 3}}</ref>\n\n===Fate===\nThe first of the three heroines, Saber is an agile and powerful warrior who retains her identity, hence her substitute name after her role as a member of the Saber class. She also serves as the route's servant protagonist. She was the victor of the Fourth Holy Grail War with another Master and claims to be the strongest out of all Servants in the Saber Class. However, Shirou is against Saber's constant aim for conflicts with other servants and instead seeks to ally with Rin. Shirou decides to drop his pacifism when he discovers that his former friend, Shinji Matou, is a Master, with the Servant Rider, aiming to kill all the students from their school to increase Rider's powers. Following Shinji and Rider's defeat, Shirou learns that Saber cannot fight at her full strength without an exchange of mana energy of her master. During a confrontation with the Master Illya and her Servant Berserker, Shirou passes Saber his Mana and later assists her to defeat the enemy by projecting one of Arturia's swords in combat. As Shirou seeks to aid to keep Saber in their world, he learns from the priest Kirei Kotomine that the Holy Grail is cursed. It is revealed that Shirou's late guardian, Kiritsugu, once used Saber to destroy the Grail, but it instead caused the fire where Shirou lost his family. Shirou rejects the idea of accepting his wish of the Holy Grail as he decides to accept his past and not forget Saber. Moved by Shirou, Saber also rejects the Holy Grail, believing she should not change Britain's history. As Kotomine aims to use Illya's body to recreate the Holy Grail, Shirou and Saber confront him and his servant Gilgamesh.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night|year=2004|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|level=Fate: Day 15}}</ref> Following Shirou's and Saber's victories, Shirou orders Saber to destroy the Grail. This causes Saber to go back to her last moments before her death.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night|year=2004|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|level=Fate: True End [{{nihongo|Continuation of the Dream|\u5922\u306e\u7d9a\u304d|Yume No Tsuzuki}}]}}</ref> In the ''R\u00e9alta Nua'' version of the game, a new ending can be unlocked where Shirou becomes a heroic spirit in order to meet Saber in the afterlife of heroes, Avalon.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night|year=2007|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|level=Fate: Last Episode}}</ref>\n\n===Unlimited Blade Works===\nThe second of the three heroines is [[Rin Tohsaka]], a model student and idol of Shirou's school who is secretly a mage and Master of [[Archer (Fate/stay night)|Archer]] in the Holy Grail War. Her servant Archer serves as the servant protagonist of the route. She descends from a long, distinguished line of mages, and though she lacks a formal magic education, she is extremely powerful and gifted in her own right. Rin is dubbed \"The Ice Queen\" by classmates for her cold, unreachable, persona at school; however, this is simply a front to hide her true status as a mage. Her presence in the story is established shortly after Shirou is killed by Lancer at school, whereupon seeing him she revives him to his connection with [[Sakura Matou]], whom Rin is closely acquainted with. As such, the two decide to become allies in the war, unaware of Archer's true identity as an adult Shirou from one of the series' numerous alternate universes. During the story, Shirou loses control of Saber but instead aims to fight with his magical strength to stop the war. Archer betrays Rin and reveals his despondency and bitterness over his past choices to Shirou. He subsequently challenges Shirou to a fight, hoping to destroy his story of being a hero. However, Shirou accepts his future regardless of the regrets and misery, deciding to stick to Kiritsugu's ideals. Gilgamesh tries to kill Archer and Shirou, with the former seemingly sacrificing himself to protect the latter. To follow Archer's hopes, Rin passes Shirou her mana to fight Gilgamesh to replicate Archer's powers. As Shirou nearly kills Gilgamesh, Archer uses his last strength to deliver the final attack at their enemy while assisting Saber to destroy the Holy Grail.<ref name=\"dimension\">{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night|year=2004|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|level=Unlimited Blade Works: Day 16}}</ref> In the True Ending, Shirou and Rin move to London to study magic, as well as start a romantic relationship.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night R\u00e9alta Nua|year=2007|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|level=Unlimited Blade Works: True End [Brilliant Years]}}</ref>\n\n===Heaven's Feel===\nThe third and final heroine is [[Sakura Matou]], a first-year high school student and long-time friend of Shirou's, who often visits his home to help him with his daily chores. A quiet, soft-spoken girl, Sakura can be surprisingly stubborn at times and holds a deep, unparalleled affection for Shirou. She is revealed to be Rin's long-lost sister, who was raised by the Matou family and has since suffered their abuse while in training as a magus. Sakura is also discovered as the true master of [[Rider (Fate/stay night)|Rider]], who she reasserts control of from Shinji, making Rider the servant protagonist of the route. In the route, Saber and Berserker are consumed by the shadows of Angra Manyu, and in the ensuing battle with True Assassin and the corrupted servants, a mortally wounded Archer transplants his left arm to save a dying Shirou.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night|year=2004|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|level=Heaven's Feel: Day 10}}</ref> Zouken, Sakura's grandfather, places a shard of the lesser grail from the 4th Holy Grail War in her body, infecting Sakura with Angra Manyu.

Shirou talks to Sakura and helps her regain her humanity, freeing her from her contract with Angra Mainyu. He then faces Kotomine in a final battle to later destroy the Grail. In the True Ending, following Kotomine's death in combat, Illya sacrifices herself to destroy the Grail and transplants Shirou's soul using forbidden magic. Rider later returns to the cave to grab and bring Shirou's soul home, and Rin places it within a puppet body.

Initially, Nasu only wrote what would become the game's ''Fate'' storyline,<ref name=\"typemoon-interview\"/> but the game went on to have three storylines, the ''Fate'' storyline being one of them. In his early drafts, ''Fate''{{'}}s heroine Saber was a man, and the protagonist was a girl with glasses.<ref>{{cite book|author=Type-Moon|title=Character Material|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|year=2006|language=Japanese}}</ref> This early draft was embodied in the short [[original video animation]] (OVA) ''Fate/Prototype'', which was released with the final volume of the ''[[Carnival Phantasm]]'' OVA series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-12-29/carnival-phantasm-3rd-season-includes-fate/prototype|title=''Carnival Phantasm''{{'}}s 3rd Season Includes ''Fate/Prototype''|website=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 29, 2011|accessdate=March 6, 2012}}</ref> Nasu set aside the project and went on to found [[Type-Moon]] with artist [[Takashi Takeuchi]]. After the success of their first [[visual novel]] ''[[Tsukihime]]'' in 2000, Type-Moon transitioned from a [[d\u014djin soft]] organization to a commercial organization. Nasu and Takeuchi decided to turn the old Fate story into a [[visual novel]] as Type-Moon's first commercial product.

A version of ''Fate/stay night'' rated for ages 15 and up titled ''Fate/stay night R\u00e9alta Nua'' ([[Irish language|Irish]] for \"new stars\"), which features the Japanese [[Seiy\u016b|voice actors]] from the anime series, was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] and later for download on Windows as a trilogy covering the three main story lines. ''R\u00e9alta Nua'' was also ported to the [[PlayStation Vita]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The plot focuses on a young mage named [[Shirou Emiya]] who becomes a warrior in a battle between \"Servants\" known as the Holy Grail War. Through each route, Shirou bonds with a heroine and confronts different mages who participate in the war.\n\nA manga series adaptation by Datto Nishiwaki was serialized in [[Kadokawa Shoten]]'s ''[[Sh\u014dnen Ace]]'' magazine between the February 2006 and December 2012 issues. In 2007, the manga was licensed for an English-language release in North America by [[Tokyopop]]. A 24-episode anime series created by [[Studio Deen]] aired in Japan between January and June 2006. [[Sentai Filmworks]] has licensed the television series and re-released the series on [[DVD]] and for the first time on [[Blu-ray Disc]]. A film adaptation by Studio Deen was released in Japanese theaters on January 23, 2010. A second anime television series, ''[[Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works]]'', was produced by [[Ufotable]] and aired between October 2014 and June 2015, following the game's second route as opposed to the first. A second manga adaptation began in 2015 focusing solely on the third route. [[Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel|A film trilogy]] will adapt the Heaven's Feel route of the visual novel, with the first film, titled ''[[Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel I. presage flower|presage flower]]'', released in 2017, the second film, titled ''[[Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel II. lost butterfly|lost butterfly]]'', released in 2019, with the final film, titled ''spring song'' scheduled to be released on March 28, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-01-11/last-fate-stay-night-heaven-feel-anime-film-title-spring-2020-date-revealed/.141868|title=Last Fate/stay night Heaven's Feel Anime Film's Title, Spring 2020 Date Revealed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=January 11, 2019|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Fate/stay night'' spawned the ''Fate'' [[media franchise]], consisting of a number of adaptations and spin-offs in various different media. On October 28, 2005, Type-Moon released a sequel to ''Fate/stay night'', titled ''[[Fate/hollow ataraxia]]''. Its plot is set half a year after the events of ''Fate/stay night''. A [[light novel]] series titled ''[[Fate/Zero]]'', set as a prequel to ''Fate/stay night'', was published from 2006 to 2007, with an anime adaptation by Ufotable airing between October 2011 and June 2012. A spin-off [[magical girl]] manga series, ''[[Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya]]'', began serialization in 2012 and has received multiple anime television series. Three [[fighting game]]s have been released: ''[[Fate/unlimited codes]]'' for [[Arcade game|arcades]] and [[PlayStation 2]], ''[[Fate/tiger colosseum]]'' and its sequel ''Fate/tiger colosseum Upper'' for [[PlayStation Potable|PSP]]. A PSP [[Role-playing game|RPG]] titled ''[[Fate/Extra]]'' was released on July 22, 2010, and a sequel and companion game, ''Fate/Extra CCC'', was released on March 28, 2013. An online RPG titled ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'' was released on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] on July 29, 2015, followed by an August 12 release on [[iOS]]; an anime film adaptation by [[Lay-duce]] was released on December 31, 2016 with sequel adaptations by [[CloverWorks]] and [[Production I.G.]] in production.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Fate/stay night''{{'}}s gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears, representing either dialogue between the characters, narration, or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Often, players will come to a \"decision point\" where they are given the chance to choose from options displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. The time between these decision points is variable and during these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction. There are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. To view all three plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices during the decision points to progress the plot in an alternate direction. When interacting with the heroines with the routes, an \"affection meter\" is created which is raised by giving them an answer that pleases them. Depending on the affection the player has achieved, a \"True Ending\" can be unlocked.<ref name=\"gama\"/>\n\nThere are multiple ways in which the player can lose the game, including Shirou's death or a decision that causes the heroine to be murdered. Should this happen, the player is taken to an area called the {{nihongo|Tiger Dojo|\u30bf\u30a4\u30ac\u30fc\u9053\u5834|Taig\u0101 D\u014dj\u014d}} where Taiga Fujimura and Illyasviel von Einzbern give the player hints about what they should do to survive in the next attempt to complete the game.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fate/side material|page=65|publisher=Type Moon}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Fate/stay night characters}}\nThe story revolves around [[Shirou Emiya]], a hardworking and honest teenager who unwillingly enters a to-the-death tournament called the Fifth Holy Grail War, where combatants fight with magic and Heroes throughout history for a chance to have their wishes granted. Orphaned and the sole survivor of a massive fire in Fuyuki City as a child, Shirou was taken in by a retired mage named Kiritsugu Emiya, who would die years later. His responsibility to those who died and his salvation through his father formed a strong desire for justice and peace in him. Thus, he earnestly trains his body and minuscule ability with magic to someday greatly help others, even if at his stage people often abuse his generosity. One evening, after seeing two devastatingly powerful beings trading blows at his school with swords and spears, he is attacked, as witnesses to the Holy Grail War are generally supposed to be eliminated. Chased to his home by the spear-wielding warrior Lancer, and barely able to avoid his attacks, Shirou is about to be killed when he is saved by [[Saber (Fate/stay night)|Saber]]. Saber, the personification of a renowned figure in history ([[King Arthur|Arturia Pendragon]] in her case) was created to aid participants in the War. In her supposedly accidental summoning and the appearance of the marks on Shirou's hand, his entry as a Master into the Holy Grail War is formalized.<ref name=\"daythree\">{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night|year=2004|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|level=Fate: Day 3}}</ref>\n\n===Fate===\nThe first of the three heroines, Saber is an agile and powerful warrior who retains her identity, hence her substitute name after her role as a member of the Saber class. She also serves as the route's servant protagonist. She was the victor of the Fourth Holy Grail War with another Master and claims to be the strongest out of all Servants in the Saber Class. However, Shirou is against Saber's constant aim for conflicts with other servants and instead seeks to ally with Rin. Shirou decides to drop his pacifism when he discovers that his former friend, Shinji Matou, is a Master, with the Servant Rider, aiming to kill all the students from their school to increase Rider's powers. Following Shinji and Rider's defeat, Shirou learns that Saber cannot fight at her full strength without an exchange of mana energy of her master. During a confrontation with the Master Illya and her Servant Berserker, Shirou passes Saber his Mana and later assists her to defeat the enemy by projecting one of Arturia's swords in combat. As Shirou seeks to aid to keep Saber in their world, he learns from the priest Kirei Kotomine that the Holy Grail is cursed. It is revealed that Shirou's late guardian, Kiritsugu, once used Saber to destroy the Grail, but it instead caused the fire where Shirou lost his family. Shirou rejects the idea of accepting his wish of the Holy Grail as he decides to accept his past and not forget Saber. Moved by Shirou, Saber also rejects the Holy Grail, believing she should not change Britain's history. As Kotomine aims to use Illya's body to recreate the Holy Grail, Shirou and Saber confront him and his servant Gilgamesh.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night|year=2004|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|level=Fate: Day 15}}</ref> Following Shirou's and Saber's victories, Shirou orders Saber to destroy the Grail.

Her servant Archer serves as the servant protagonist of the route. She descends from a long, distinguished line of mages, and though she lacks a formal magic education, she is extremely powerful and gifted in her own right. Rin is dubbed \"The Ice Queen\" by classmates for her cold, unreachable, persona at school; however, this is simply a front to hide her true status as a mage. Her presence in the story is established shortly after Shirou is killed by Lancer at school, whereupon seeing him she revives him to his connection with [[Sakura Matou]], whom Rin is closely acquainted with. As such, the two decide to become allies in the war, unaware of Archer's true identity as an adult Shirou from one of the series' numerous alternate universes. During the story, Shirou loses control of Saber but instead aims to fight with his magical strength to stop the war. Archer betrays Rin and reveals his despondency and bitterness over his past choices to Shirou. He subsequently challenges Shirou to a fight, hoping to destroy his story of being a hero. However, Shirou accepts his future regardless of the regrets and misery, deciding to stick to Kiritsugu's ideals. Gilgamesh tries to kill Archer and Shirou, with the former seemingly sacrificing himself to protect the latter. To follow Archer's hopes, Rin passes Shirou her mana to fight Gilgamesh to replicate Archer's powers. As Shirou nearly kills Gilgamesh, Archer uses his last strength to deliver the final attack at their enemy while assisting Saber to destroy the Holy Grail.<ref name=\"dimension\">{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night|year=2004|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|level=Unlimited Blade Works: Day 16}}</ref> In the True Ending, Shirou and Rin move to London to study magic, as well as start a romantic relationship.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night R\u00e9alta Nua|year=2007|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|level=Unlimited Blade Works: True End [Brilliant Years]}}</ref>\n\n===Heaven's Feel===\nThe third and final heroine is [[Sakura Matou]], a first-year high school student and long-time friend of Shirou's, who often visits his home to help him with his daily chores. A quiet, soft-spoken girl, Sakura can be surprisingly stubborn at times and holds a deep, unparalleled affection for Shirou. She is revealed to be Rin's long-lost sister, who was raised by the Matou family and has since suffered their abuse while in training as a magus. Sakura is also discovered as the true master of [[Rider (Fate/stay night)|Rider]], who she reasserts control of from Shinji, making Rider the servant protagonist of the route. In the route, Saber and Berserker are consumed by the shadows of Angra Manyu, and in the ensuing battle with True Assassin and the corrupted servants, a mortally wounded Archer transplants his left arm to save a dying Shirou.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night|year=2004|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|level=Heaven's Feel: Day 10}}</ref> Zouken, Sakura's grandfather, places a shard of the lesser grail from the 4th Holy Grail War in her body, infecting Sakura with Angra Manyu.

Shirou talks to Sakura and helps her regain her humanity, freeing her from her contract with Angra Mainyu. He then faces Kotomine in a final battle to later destroy the Grail. In the True Ending, following Kotomine's death in combat, Illya sacrifices herself to destroy the Grail and transplants Shirou's soul using forbidden magic. Rider later returns to the cave to grab and bring Shirou's soul home, and Rin places it within a puppet body. Shirou, Sakura and Rider then live out a peaceful life together while Rin moves to London to study magic.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Fate/stay night Fate/stay night R\u00e9alta Nua|year=2007|developer=[[Type-Moon]]|publisher=[[Type-Moon]]|level=Heaven's Feel: True End {{nihongo|[Return to the Spring]|\u6625\u306b\u5e30\u308b|Haru Ni Kaeru}}}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Akashi Bridge.JPG|thumb|Akashi Bridge became the prototype of one of the locations of the city of Fuyuki.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fate/stay night Visual Story|year=2007|page=23}}</ref>]]\n[[Kinoko Nasu]] first began writing ''Fate/stay night'' in college and had not intended it to be a game. Initially, Nasu only wrote what would become the game's ''Fate'' storyline,<ref name=\"typemoon-interview\"/> but the game went on to have three storylines, the ''Fate'' storyline being one of them.

After the success of their first [[visual novel]] ''[[Tsukihime]]'' in 2000, Type-Moon transitioned from a [[d\u014djin soft]] organization to a commercial organization. Nasu and Takeuchi decided to turn the old Fate story into a [[visual novel]] as Type-Moon's first commercial product.

[[United States Capitol]] in the background.]]\nIn the United States, [[evangelicalism]] is an umbrella group of [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] Christians who believe in the necessity of being [[born again]], emphasize the importance of [[evangelism]], and affirm traditional Protestant teachings on the [[Biblical authority|authority]] and the [[historicity of the Bible]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} Nearly a quarter of the US population, evangelicals are diverse and drawn from a variety of denominational backgrounds, including [[Baptist]], [[Mennonite]], [[Methodist]], [[Holiness Movement|Holiness]], [[Pentecostal]], [[Reformed]] and [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] churches.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=2}}{{Sfn|Vickers|2013|p=27}}\n\nEvangelicalism has played an important role in shaping American religion and culture. The [[First Great Awakening]] of the 18th century marked the rise of evangelical religion in colonial America. As the [[Christian revival|revival]] spread throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]], evangelicalism united Americans around a common faith.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} The [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century led to what historian [[Martin Marty]] called the \"Evangelical Empire\", a period in which evangelicals dominated US cultural institutions, including schools and universities. Evangelicals in the [[northern United States]] were strong advocates of reform. They were involved in the [[temperance movement]] and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] in addition to working towards [[History of education in the United States|education]] and [[History of United States prison systems|criminal justice reform]]. In the [[southern United States]], evangelicals split from their northern counterparts on the issue of slavery, establishing new denominations that did not call for abolition of slavery.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=4-5}} (For example, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] was founded over the issue of slaveholders serving as foreign missionaries.)\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the old evangelical consensus that had united American Protestantism no longer existed. Protestant churches became divided over new intellectual and theological ideas, such as [[Darwinian evolution]] and [[historical criticism]] of the [[Protestant Bible|Bible]]. Those who embraced these liberal ideas became known as [[Christian Modernism|modernists]], while those who rejected them became known as [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. Fundamentalists defended the doctrine of [[biblical inerrancy]] and adopted a [[dispensationalist]] theological system for interpreting the Bible.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=5}} As a result of the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]] of the 1920s and 1930s, fundamentalists lost control of the [[Mainline Protestant]] churches and [[Ecclesiastical separatism|separated]] themselves from non-fundamentalist churches and cultural institutions.{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=3\u20134}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], a new generation of conservative Protestants rejected the separatist stance of fundamentalism and began calling themselves evangelicals. Popular evangelist [[Billy Graham]] was at the forefront of reviving use of the term. During this time period, a number of evangelical institutions were established, including the [[National Association of Evangelicals]], ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine and a number of educational institutions, such as [[Fuller Theological Seminary]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=5\u20136}} As a reaction to the [[1960s counterculture]], many evangelicals became politically active and involved in the [[Christian right]], which became an important [[voting bloc]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Observers such as [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]] have noted that since 2005 the influence of the Christian right among evangelicals has been in decline.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=8\u201310}} Though less visible, some evangelicals identify as [[Evangelical left|Progressive evangelicals]].\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:National Association of Evangelicals logo.jpg|thumb|[[National Association of Evangelicals]], a part of [[World Evangelical Alliance]], works to foster cooperation between evangelical churches in the United States]]\n\n[[Evangelicalism]] is a worldwide, diverse movement that is not always easy to define. Even in the United States, evangelicals can be found in a variety of denominations and traditions. In addition, evangelicalism is often conflated in the news media with \"conservative Protestantism\" or the [[Christian right]], even though not every conservative Protestant identifies as evangelical nor are all evangelicals political conservatives.{{Sfn|Woodberry|Smith|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nEvangelicals are often defined in contrast to [[Mainline Protestants]]. According to sociologist Brian Steensland and colleagues, \"Evangelical denominations have typically sought more separation from the broader culture, emphasized missionary activity and individual conversion, and taught strict adherence to particular religious doctrines.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|Park|Regnerus|Robinson|2000|p=249}} Mainline Protestants are described as having \"an accommodating stance toward modernity, a proactive view on issues of social and economic justice, and pluralism in their tolerance of varied individual beliefs.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|Park|Regnerus|Robinson|2000|p=248}}\n\nOne popular definition was proposed by historian [[David Bebbington]]. According to Bebbington, evangelicalism has four major hallmarks. These are conversionism, or the doctrine that one's life must be changed; biblicism, a special emphasis on the teachings of the [[Bible]]; activism, the expression of [[the gospel]] through effort; and crucicentrism, which is an emphasis on the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. This definition, however, has been criticized for being so broad as to include all Christians.<ref name=Defining>{{Citation|title=Defining Evangelicalism|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|contribution=Defining the Term in Contemporary Context|place=Wheaton College|publisher=Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals|access-date=June 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614171830/http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}.</ref> \n\nHistorian [[George Marsden]] writes that during the 1950s and 1960s the simplest definition of an evangelical was \"anyone who likes [[Billy Graham]]\". During that period, most people who self-identified with the evangelical movement were affiliated with organizations with some connection to Graham.{{Sfn|Marsden|1991|p=6}} It can also be defined narrowly as a movement centered around organizations such as the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] and [[Youth for Christ]].<ref name=Defining/>\n\nScholars have found it useful to distinguish between the different types of evangelicals. One scheme by sociologist [[James Davison Hunter]] identifies four major types: the [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] tradition, the [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] tradition, the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] tradition, and the Confessional tradition ([[evangelical Anglicans]], [[pietistic]] Lutherans and those evangelicals within the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] churches).{{Sfn|Dorrien|1998|p=2}}{{Sfn|Ellingsen|1991|p=234}}\n\nEthicist [[Max Lynn Stackhouse|Max Stackhouse]] and historians Donald W. Dayton and Timothy P. Weber divide evangelicalism into three main historical groupings. The first, called \"Puritan\" or classical evangelicalism, seeks to preserve the doctrinal heritage of the 16th century [[Protestant reformation|Protestant Reformation]], especially the Reformed tradition. Classical evangelicals emphasize absolute [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|divine sovereignty]], [[Forensic Justification|forensic justification]], and \"literalistic\" [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]]. The second, pietistic evangelicalism, originates from the 18th-century [[pietist]] movements in Europe and the [[Great Awakening]]s in America. Pietistic evangelicals embrace [[revivalism]] and a more experiential faith, emphasizing [[Born again|conversion]], [[Christian perfection|sanctification]], [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and [[Faith healing|healing]]. The third, [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] evangelicalism, results from the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist]] split of the early 20th century. Fundamentalists always emphasize certain \"fundamental\" beliefs against modernist criticism and sometimes utilize an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]], [[Premillennialism|premillennialist]] interpretation of the Bible. These three categories are more fluid than Hunter's, so an individual could identify with only one or all three.{{Sfn|Dorrien|1998|pp=2\u20133}}\n\n[[John C. Green]], a senior fellow at the [[Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]], used polling data to separate evangelicals into three broad camps, which he labels as ''traditionalist'', ''centrist'' and ''modernist'':<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{Cite news| title=Evangelicals Debate the Meaning of 'Evangelical' | last=Luo | first=Michael |date=April 16, 2006 | work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/weekinreview/16luo.html?_r=1&adxnnlx=1145227368-p%20hJwvCXS0qceSTw%20jLi8w&pagewanted=all}}</ref>\n\n# Traditionalist evangelicals, characterized by high affinity for certain Protestant beliefs, (especially [[penal substitution]]ary atonement, [[Sola fide|justification by faith]], the [[Sola scriptura|authority of scripture]], the [[priesthood of all believers]], etc.) which, when fused with the highly political milieu of Western culture (especially American culture), has resulted in the political disposition that has been labeled the Christian right, with figures like [[Jerry Falwell]] and the television evangelist [[Pat Robertson]] as its most visible spokesmen.\n# Centrist evangelicals, described as socially conservative, mostly avoiding politics, who still support much of traditional Christian theology.\n# Modernist evangelicals, a small minority in the movement, have lower levels of church-attendance and \"have much more diversity in their beliefs\".<ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nHistorian [[Molly Worthen]] writes that \"History\u2014rather than theology or politics\u2014is the most useful tool for pinning down today\u2019s evangelicals.\"{{Sfn|Worthen|2014|p=4}} She finds that evangelicals share common origins in the religious revivals and moral crusades of the 18th and 19th centuries. She writes that \"Evangelical catchphrases like 'Bible-believing' and '[[born again]]' are modern translations of the [[Protestant Reformers|Reformers]]' slogan ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and Pietists' emphasis on internal spiritual transformation.\"{{Sfn|Worthen|2014|p=4}}\n\n==History==\n===18th century===\n[[File:Jonathan Edwards.jpg|thumb|upright|Jonathan Edwards was the most influential evangelical theologian in America during the 18th century{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=44}}]]\n\nThe roots of American evangelicalism lie in the merger of three older [[Protestant]] traditions: New England [[Puritanism]], Continental [[Pietism]] and Scotch-Irish [[Presbyterianism]].{{Sfn | Balmer| 2002 |pp=vii\u2013viii}} Within their [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational churches]], Puritans promoted experimental or experiential religion, arguing that saving [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] required an inward transformation.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=31}} This led Puritans to demand evidence of a [[Puritans#Conversion|conversion experience]] (in the form of a [[conversion narrative]]) before a convert was admitted to full church membership.{{Sfn|Youngs|1998|pp=40\u201341}} In the 1670s and 1680s, Puritan clergy began to promote religious [[Christian revival|revival]] in response to a perceived decline in religiosity.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Chapter 1, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 148\u2013152}} The Ulster Scots who immigrated to the American colonies in the 1700s brought with them their own revival tradition, specifically the practice of [[communion season]]s.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|p=31}} Pietism was a movement within the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed churches]] in Europe that emphasized a \"religion of the heart\": the ideal that faith was not simply acceptance of [[proposition]]al truth but was an emotional \"commitment of one's whole being to God\" in which one's life became dedicated to [[Self-denial|self-sacrificial]] ministry.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|pp=24\u201325}} Pietists promoted the formation of [[cell groups]] for [[Bible study (Christianity)|Bible study]], prayer and accountability.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=34}}\n\nThese three traditions were brought together with the [[First Great Awakening]], a series of revivals occurring in both Britain and its American Colonies during the 1730s and 1740s.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=27}} The Awakening began within the Congregational churches of New England. In 1734, [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]' preaching on [[justification by faith]] instigated a revival in Northampton, Massachusetts. Earlier Puritan revivals had been brief, local affairs, but the Northampton revival was part of a larger wave of revival that affected the Presbyterian and [[Dutch Reformed]] churches in the Middle Colonies as well.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=14\u201318}} There the Reformed minister [[Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen|Theodore Frelinghuysen]] and Presbyterian minister [[Gilbert Tennent]] led revivals.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=44}}\n\nThe English evangelist [[George Whitefield]] was responsible for spreading the revivals through all the colonies. An [[Anglican]] priest, Whitefield had studied at Oxford University prior to ordination and there befriended [[John Wesley]] and his brother [[Charles Wesley|Charles]], the founders of a pietistic movement within the [[Church of England]] called [[Methodism]]. Whitefield's dramatic preaching style and ability to simplify doctrine made him a popular preacher in England, and in 1739 he arrived in America preaching up and down the Atlantic coastline. Thousands flocked to open-air meetings to hear him preach, and he became a celebrity throughout the colonies.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}}\n\nThe Great Awakening hit its peak by 1740,{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=44, 48}} but it shaped a new form of Protestantism that emphasized, according to historian [[Thomas S.

Radical evangelicals ordained uneducated ministers (sometimes nonwhite men) and sometimes allowed nonwhites and women to serve as [[Deacon|deacons]] and [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]. They also supported laypeople's right to dissent from their pastors and form new churches.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 79\u201382}}\n\nThe Awakening split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches over support for the revival between [[Old and New Light]]s (see also the [[Old Side\u2013New Side Controversy]]). Ultimately, the evangelical New Lights became the larger faction among both Congregationalists and Presbyterians. The [[New England theology]], based on Jonathan Edwards' work, would become the dominant theological outlook within the Congregational churches.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=59}}{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}} In New England, radical New Lights broke away from the established churches and formed [[Separate Baptist]] congregations. In the 1740s and 1750s, New Side Presbyterians and Separate Baptists began moving to the Southern colonies and establishing churches.There they challenged the Anglican religious establishment, which was identified with the [[Planter class|planter elite]]. In contrast, evangelicals tended to be neither very rich nor very poor but hardworking farmers and tradesmen who disapproved of the worldliness of the planter class. In the 1760s, the first Methodist missionaries came to America and focused their ministry in the South as well. By 1776, evangelicals outnumbered Anglicans in the South.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nDuring and after the [[American Revolution]], the Anglican Church (now known as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]) experienced much disruption and lost its special legal status and privileges. The four largest denominations were now the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists. In the 1770s and 1780s, the Baptists and Methodists had experienced dramatic growth. In 1770, there were only 150 Baptist and 20 Methodist churches, but in 1790 there were 858 Baptist and 712 Methodist churches. These two evangelical denominations were still most successful in the southern states and along the [[American frontier|western frontier]]. They also appealed to African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]; on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], for example, over a third of Methodists were black. In the 1790s, evangelical influence on smaller groups such as [[Quakers]], Lutherans, and the Dutch and [[German Reformed Church|German Reformed]] was still limited. Because of cultural and language barriers, the Dutch and German churches were not a major part of the evangelical revivals.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Camp meeting.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a camp meeting]]\n{{See|Benevolent Empire}}\n\nIn the 19th century, evangelicalism expanded as a result of the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1790s\u20131840s).{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=47}} The revivals influenced all the major Protestant denominations and turned most Protestants into evangelicals.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=25}} There were three major centers of revival. In New England, a major revival began among the Congregationalists by the 1820s, led by [[Edwardsian]] preachers such as [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], [[Lyman Beecher]], [[Nathaniel William Taylor|Nathaniel Taylor]] and [[Asahel Nettleton]]. In western New York\u2014the so-called \"[[burned-over district]]\"\u2014the revival was mainly led by Congregationalists and Presbyterians, but there was also some Baptist and Methodist involvement. The third major region of revival was the [[Cumberland River]] Valley in Tennessee and Kentucky.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=66\u201371}}\n\nUnlike the East Coast, where revivals tended to be quieter and more solemn, western revivals tended to be more emotional and dramatic.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|pp=62-63}} Kentucky was the location of the [[Revival of 1800]] led by Presbyterian minister [[James McGready]]. It was here that the traditional Scottish communion season began to evolve into the American [[camp meeting]].{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=58}} A year later, the [[Cane Ridge Revival]] led by [[Barton Stone]] lasted a week and drew crowds of 20,000 people from the thinly populated frontier. At Cane Ridge, many converts experienced religious ecstasy and \"bodily agitations\".{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26}} Some worshipers caught [[holy laughter]], barked like dogs, experienced convulsions, fell into trances, danced, shouted or were [[slain in the Spirit]]. Similar things had occurred in other revivals, but they were more intense at Cane Ridge. This revival was the origin of the [[Stone-Campbell Movement]], from which the [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Disciples of Christ]] denominations originate.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=72}}{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26}}\n\nDuring the Second Great Awakening, the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] was the most successful at gaining converts. It enthusiastically adopted camp meetings as a regular part of church life and devoted resources to evangelizing the western frontier. Itinerant ministers known as [[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]] traveled hundreds of miles each year to preach and serve scattered congregations. The Methodists took a democratic and egalitarian approach to ministry, allowing poor and uneducated young men to become circuit riders. The Baptists also expanded rapidly. Like the Methodists, Baptists also sent out itinerant ministers, often with little education.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26\u201327}}\n\n[[File:Finney.png|thumb|upright|Charles Grandison Finney, the most prominent revivalist of the Second Great Awakening]]\n\nThe theology behind the First Great Awakening was largely [[Calvinist]].{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=66}} Calvinists taught [[Predestination in Calvinism|predestination]] and that God only gives [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] to a small group of the [[Unconditional election|elect]] and condemns everyone else to [[hell]]. The Calvinist doctrine of [[irresistible grace]] denied to humans [[Free will in theology|free will]] or any role in their own salvation.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=31}} The Second Great Awakening was heavily influenced by [[Arminianism]], a theology that allows for free will and gives humans a greater role in their own conversion.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=66}} The Methodists had been Arminian from the beginning of their movement and taught that all people could choose salvation. They also taught that Christians could lose their salvation by [[backsliding]] or returning to sin.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=31}}   \n\nThe most influential evangelical of the Second Great Awakening was [[Charles Grandison Finney]]. Though ordained by the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]], Finney deviated from traditional Calvinism. Finney taught that neither revivals nor conversion occurred without human effort. While divine grace is necessary to persuade people of the truth of Christianity, God does not force salvation upon people. Unlike Edwards, who described revival as a \"surprising work of God\", Finney taught that \"revival is not a miracle\" but \"the result of the right use of the appropriate means.\"{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=67\u201368}} Finney emphasized several methods to promote revival that have become known as the \"new measures\" (even though they were not new but had already been in use among the Methodists): mass advertising, protracted revival meetings, allowing women to speak and [[testify]] in revival meetings, and the [[mourner's bench]] where potential converts sat to pray for conversion.{{Sfn|Balmer|2002|p=491}}\n\nEvangelical views on [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] (the doctrine of the end times) have changed over time. The Puritans were [[premillennialists]], which means they believed that [[Second Coming|Christ would return]] before the [[Millennialism|Millennium]] (a thousand years of godly rule on earth). The First Great Awakening, however, convinced many evangelicals that the millennial kingdom was already being established before Christ returned, a belief known as [[postmillennialism]]. During the Second Great Awakening, postmillennialism (with its expectation that society would become progressively more Christianized) became the dominant view since it complemented the Arminian emphasis on self-determination and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment's]] positive view of human potential. This postmillennial optimism inspired a number of 19th-century reform movements, including [[Temperance movement|temperance]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], prison and educational reform. It also led to an increase in [[Christian mission|missionary]] work, and many of the major missionary societies were founded around this time (see [[Timeline of Christian missions]]).{{Sfn|Balmer|1999|p=47\u201348}}\n\n[[John Nelson Darby]] was a 19th-century Irish Anglican minister who devised modern [[dispensationalism]], an innovative Protestant theological interpretation of the Bible that was incorporated in the development of modern evangelicalism. [[Cyrus Scofield]] further promoted the influence of dispensationalism through the explanatory notes to his [[Scofield Reference Bible]]. According to scholar Mark S. Sweetnam, who takes a cultural studies perspective, dispensationalism can be defined in terms of its Evangelicalism, its insistence on the literal interpretation of Scripture, its recognition of stages in God's dealings with humanity, its expectation of the imminent return of Christ to rapture His saints, and its focus on both apocalypticism and premillennialism.<ref>{{Citation | first=Mark S | last=Sweetnam | title=Defining Dispensationalism: A Cultural Studies Perspective | journal=Journal of Religious History | year=2010 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=191\u2013212 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.2010.00862.x}}.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the revivalist [[Holiness movement]], based on the doctrine of \"entire sanctification,\" took a more extreme form in rural America and Canada, where it ultimately broke away from institutional Methodism.

In the early 20th century, a divide opened up between the fundamentalists and the mainline Protestant denominations, chiefly over the inerrancy of the Bible. The fundamentalists were those evangelicals who sought to defend their religious traditions, and feared that modern scientific leanings were leading away from the truth. After 1910, evangelicalism was dominated by the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]], who rejected [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and emphasized the inerrancy of the Scriptures. Evangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of secularism. At the same time, the modernists criticized fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the [[Social Gospel]]. A favored mode of fighting back against liberalism was to prohibit the teaching of Darwinism or macro-evolution as fact in the public schools, a movement that reached its peak in the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, and resumed in the 1980s. The more modernistic Protestants largely abandoned the term \"evangelical\" and tolerated evolutionary theories in modern science and even in Biblical studies.\n\nFollowing the [[Welsh Methodist revival]], the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in 1906 began the spread of [[Pentecostalism]] in North America.\n\nDuring and after World War II, evangelicals increasingly organized, and expanded their vision to include the entire world. There was a great expansion of Evangelical activity within the United States, \"a revival of revivalism.\" [[Youth for Christ]] was formed; it later became the base for [[Billy Graham]]'s revivals. At the same time, a split developed between evangelicals, as they disagreed among themselves about how a Christian ought to respond to an unbelieving world. Many evangelicals urged that Christians must engage the culture directly and constructively,<ref>{{Citation|last=Henry|first=Carl FH|title=The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism|date=August 29, 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN080282661X|origyear=1947|edition=reprint|place=Grand Rapids|publisher=Eerdmans|ISBN=0-8028-2661-X}}.</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2015}} and they began to express reservations about being known to the world as ''fundamentalists''.

It described the mood of positivism and non-militancy that characterized that generation. The new generation of evangelicals set as their goal to abandon a militant Bible stance. Instead, they would pursue dialogue, intellectualism, non-judgmentalism, and appeasement. They further called for an increased application of the gospel to the sociological, political, and economic areas. The self-identified fundamentalists also cooperated in separating their \"neo-Evangelical\" opponents from the ''fundamentalist'' name, by increasingly seeking to distinguish themselves from the more open group, whom they often characterized derogatorily by Ockenga's term, \"neo-Evangelical\" or just evangelical.[[File:Angelus Temple worship service 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Congregation at Angelus Temple during 14-hour Holy Ghost service led by Aimee Semple McPherson in Los Angeles, California in 1942.]]\n\nMore dramatic than the divisions and newfound organization within Evangelicalism was its expansion of international missionary activity. They had enthusiasm and self-confidence after the national victory in the world war. Many evangelicals came from poor rural districts, but wartime and postwar prosperity dramatically increased the funding resources available for missionary work. While mainline Protestant denominations cut back on their missionary activities, from 7000 to 3000 overseas workers between 1935 and 1980, the evangelicals increased their career foreign missionary force from 12,000 in 1935 to 35,000 in 1980. Meanwhile, Europe was falling behind, as North Americans comprised 41% of all the world's Protestant missionaries in 1936, rising to 52% in 1952 and 72% in 1969. The most active denominations were the Assemblies of God, which nearly tripled from 230 missionaries in 1935 to 626 in 1952, and the [[United Pentecostal Church International]], formed in 1945. The Southern Baptists more than doubled from 405 to 855, as did the Church of the Nazarene from 88 to 200.<ref>{{Citation|last=Carpenter|first=Joel A|title=Revive Us Again: The Reawakening of American Fundamentalism|year=1997|pages=184\u20135}}.</ref> Overseas missionaries began to prepare for the postwar challenge, most notably the Far Eastern Gospel Crusade (FEGC; now named \"Send International\").

[[United States Capitol]] in the background.]]\nIn the United States, [[evangelicalism]] is an umbrella group of [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestant]] Christians who believe in the necessity of being [[born again]], emphasize the importance of [[evangelism]], and affirm traditional Protestant teachings on the [[Biblical authority|authority]] and the [[historicity of the Bible]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} Nearly a quarter of the US population, evangelicals are diverse and drawn from a variety of denominational backgrounds, including [[Baptist]], [[Mennonite]], [[Methodist]], [[Holiness Movement|Holiness]], [[Pentecostal]], [[Reformed]] and [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] churches.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=2}}{{Sfn|Vickers|2013|p=27}}\n\nEvangelicalism has played an important role in shaping American religion and culture. The [[First Great Awakening]] of the 18th century marked the rise of evangelical religion in colonial America. As the [[Christian revival|revival]] spread throughout the [[Thirteen Colonies]], evangelicalism united Americans around a common faith.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=3}} The [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century led to what historian [[Martin Marty]] called the \"Evangelical Empire\", a period in which evangelicals dominated US cultural institutions, including schools and universities. Evangelicals in the [[northern United States]] were strong advocates of reform. They were involved in the [[temperance movement]] and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] in addition to working towards [[History of education in the United States|education]] and [[History of United States prison systems|criminal justice reform]]. In the [[southern United States]], evangelicals split from their northern counterparts on the issue of slavery, establishing new denominations that did not call for abolition of slavery.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=4-5}} (For example, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] was founded over the issue of slaveholders serving as foreign missionaries.)\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the old evangelical consensus that had united American Protestantism no longer existed. Protestant churches became divided over new intellectual and theological ideas, such as [[Darwinian evolution]] and [[historical criticism]] of the [[Protestant Bible|Bible]]. Those who embraced these liberal ideas became known as [[Christian Modernism|modernists]], while those who rejected them became known as [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]]. Fundamentalists defended the doctrine of [[biblical inerrancy]] and adopted a [[dispensationalist]] theological system for interpreting the Bible.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=5}} As a result of the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]] of the 1920s and 1930s, fundamentalists lost control of the [[Mainline Protestant]] churches and [[Ecclesiastical separatism|separated]] themselves from non-fundamentalist churches and cultural institutions.{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=3\u20134}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], a new generation of conservative Protestants rejected the separatist stance of fundamentalism and began calling themselves evangelicals. Popular evangelist [[Billy Graham]] was at the forefront of reviving use of the term. During this time period, a number of evangelical institutions were established, including the [[National Association of Evangelicals]], ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine and a number of educational institutions, such as [[Fuller Theological Seminary]].{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=5\u20136}} As a reaction to the [[1960s counterculture]], many evangelicals became politically active and involved in the [[Christian right]], which became an important [[voting bloc]] of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Observers such as [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]] have noted that since 2005 the influence of the Christian right among evangelicals has been in decline.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=8\u201310}} Though less visible, some evangelicals identify as [[Evangelical left|Progressive evangelicals]].\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:National Association of Evangelicals logo.jpg|thumb|[[National Association of Evangelicals]], a part of [[World Evangelical Alliance]], works to foster cooperation between evangelical churches in the United States]]\n\n[[Evangelicalism]] is a worldwide, diverse movement that is not always easy to define. Even in the United States, evangelicals can be found in a variety of denominations and traditions. In addition, evangelicalism is often conflated in the news media with \"conservative Protestantism\" or the [[Christian right]], even though not every conservative Protestant identifies as evangelical nor are all evangelicals political conservatives.{{Sfn|Woodberry|Smith|1998|pp=25\u201326}}\n\nEvangelicals are often defined in contrast to [[Mainline Protestants]]. According to sociologist Brian Steensland and colleagues, \"Evangelical denominations have typically sought more separation from the broader culture, emphasized missionary activity and individual conversion, and taught strict adherence to particular religious doctrines.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|Park|Regnerus|Robinson|2000|p=249}} Mainline Protestants are described as having \"an accommodating stance toward modernity, a proactive view on issues of social and economic justice, and pluralism in their tolerance of varied individual beliefs.\"{{Sfn|Steensland|Park|Regnerus|Robinson|2000|p=248}}\n\nOne popular definition was proposed by historian [[David Bebbington]]. According to Bebbington, evangelicalism has four major hallmarks. These are conversionism, or the doctrine that one's life must be changed; biblicism, a special emphasis on the teachings of the [[Bible]]; activism, the expression of [[the gospel]] through effort; and crucicentrism, which is an emphasis on the importance of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]]. This definition, however, has been criticized for being so broad as to include all Christians.<ref name=Defining>{{Citation|title=Defining Evangelicalism|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|contribution=Defining the Term in Contemporary Context|place=Wheaton College|publisher=Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals|access-date=June 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614171830/http://www.wheaton.edu/ISAE/Defining-Evangelicalism/Defining-the-Term|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}.</ref> \n\nHistorian [[George Marsden]] writes that during the 1950s and 1960s the simplest definition of an evangelical was \"anyone who likes [[Billy Graham]]\". During that period, most people who self-identified with the evangelical movement were affiliated with organizations with some connection to Graham.{{Sfn|Marsden|1991|p=6}} It can also be defined narrowly as a movement centered around organizations such as the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] and [[Youth for Christ]].<ref name=Defining/>\n\nScholars have found it useful to distinguish between the different types of evangelicals. One scheme by sociologist [[James Davison Hunter]] identifies four major types: the [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] tradition, the [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] tradition, the [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] tradition, and the Confessional tradition ([[evangelical Anglicans]], [[pietistic]] Lutherans and those evangelicals within the [[Calvinism|Reformed]] churches).{{Sfn|Dorrien|1998|p=2}}{{Sfn|Ellingsen|1991|p=234}}\n\nEthicist [[Max Lynn Stackhouse|Max Stackhouse]] and historians Donald W. Dayton and Timothy P. Weber divide evangelicalism into three main historical groupings. The first, called \"Puritan\" or classical evangelicalism, seeks to preserve the doctrinal heritage of the 16th century [[Protestant reformation|Protestant Reformation]], especially the Reformed tradition. Classical evangelicals emphasize absolute [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|divine sovereignty]], [[Forensic Justification|forensic justification]], and \"literalistic\" [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]]. The second, pietistic evangelicalism, originates from the 18th-century [[pietist]] movements in Europe and the [[Great Awakening]]s in America. Pietistic evangelicals embrace [[revivalism]] and a more experiential faith, emphasizing [[Born again|conversion]], [[Christian perfection|sanctification]], [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] and [[Faith healing|healing]]. The third, [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] evangelicalism, results from the [[Fundamentalist-Modernist]] split of the early 20th century. Fundamentalists always emphasize certain \"fundamental\" beliefs against modernist criticism and sometimes utilize an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic]], [[Premillennialism|premillennialist]] interpretation of the Bible. These three categories are more fluid than Hunter's, so an individual could identify with only one or all three.{{Sfn|Dorrien|1998|pp=2\u20133}}\n\n[[John C.

In 1734, [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]' preaching on [[justification by faith]] instigated a revival in Northampton, Massachusetts. Earlier Puritan revivals had been brief, local affairs, but the Northampton revival was part of a larger wave of revival that affected the Presbyterian and [[Dutch Reformed]] churches in the Middle Colonies as well.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=14\u201318}} There the Reformed minister [[Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen|Theodore Frelinghuysen]] and Presbyterian minister [[Gilbert Tennent]] led revivals.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=44}}\n\nThe English evangelist [[George Whitefield]] was responsible for spreading the revivals through all the colonies. An [[Anglican]] priest, Whitefield had studied at Oxford University prior to ordination and there befriended [[John Wesley]] and his brother [[Charles Wesley|Charles]], the founders of a pietistic movement within the [[Church of England]] called [[Methodism]]. Whitefield's dramatic preaching style and ability to simplify doctrine made him a popular preacher in England, and in 1739 he arrived in America preaching up and down the Atlantic coastline. Thousands flocked to open-air meetings to hear him preach, and he became a celebrity throughout the colonies.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}}\n\nThe Great Awakening hit its peak by 1740,{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=44, 48}} but it shaped a new form of Protestantism that emphasized, according to historian [[Thomas S. Kidd]], \"''seasons of revival'', or ''outpourings of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]'', and on ''converted sinners experiencing God's love personally''\" [emphasis in original].{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|p=xiv}} Evangelicals believed in the \"[[new birth]]\"\u2014a discernible moment of conversion\u2014and that it was normal for a Christian to have [[assurance of faith]].{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 66}} While the Puritans had also believed in the necessity of conversion, they \"had held that assurance is rare, late and the fruit of struggle in the experience of believers\".{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=43}} \n\nIts emphasis on the individual's relationship to God gave it an [[egalitarian]] streak as well, which was perceived by anti-revivalists as undermining social order. Radical evangelicals ordained uneducated ministers (sometimes nonwhite men) and sometimes allowed nonwhites and women to serve as [[Deacon|deacons]] and [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]. They also supported laypeople's right to dissent from their pastors and form new churches.{{Sfn|Kidd|2007|loc=Introduction, [[Amazon Kindle]] location 79\u201382}}\n\nThe Awakening split the Congregational and Presbyterian churches over support for the revival between [[Old and New Light]]s (see also the [[Old Side\u2013New Side Controversy]]). Ultimately, the evangelical New Lights became the larger faction among both Congregationalists and Presbyterians. The [[New England theology]], based on Jonathan Edwards' work, would become the dominant theological outlook within the Congregational churches.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=59}}{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=18}} In New England, radical New Lights broke away from the established churches and formed [[Separate Baptist]] congregations. In the 1740s and 1750s, New Side Presbyterians and Separate Baptists began moving to the Southern colonies and establishing churches.There they challenged the Anglican religious establishment, which was identified with the [[Planter class|planter elite]]. In contrast, evangelicals tended to be neither very rich nor very poor but hardworking farmers and tradesmen who disapproved of the worldliness of the planter class. In the 1760s, the first Methodist missionaries came to America and focused their ministry in the South as well. By 1776, evangelicals outnumbered Anglicans in the South.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nDuring and after the [[American Revolution]], the Anglican Church (now known as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]) experienced much disruption and lost its special legal status and privileges. The four largest denominations were now the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists. In the 1770s and 1780s, the Baptists and Methodists had experienced dramatic growth. In 1770, there were only 150 Baptist and 20 Methodist churches, but in 1790 there were 858 Baptist and 712 Methodist churches. These two evangelical denominations were still most successful in the southern states and along the [[American frontier|western frontier]]. They also appealed to African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]]; on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], for example, over a third of Methodists were black. In the 1790s, evangelical influence on smaller groups such as [[Quakers]], Lutherans, and the Dutch and [[German Reformed Church|German Reformed]] was still limited. Because of cultural and language barriers, the Dutch and German churches were not a major part of the evangelical revivals.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Camp meeting.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a camp meeting]]\n{{See|Benevolent Empire}}\n\nIn the 19th century, evangelicalism expanded as a result of the [[Second Great Awakening]] (1790s\u20131840s).{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=47}} The revivals influenced all the major Protestant denominations and turned most Protestants into evangelicals.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=25}} There were three major centers of revival. In New England, a major revival began among the Congregationalists by the 1820s, led by [[Edwardsian]] preachers such as [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]], [[Lyman Beecher]], [[Nathaniel William Taylor|Nathaniel Taylor]] and [[Asahel Nettleton]]. In western New York\u2014the so called \"[[burned-over district]]\"\u2014the revival was mainly led by Congregationalists and Presbyterians, but there was also some Baptist and Methodist involvement. The third major region of revival was the [[Cumberland River]] Valley in Tennessee and Kentucky.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=66\u201371}}\n\nUnlike the East Coast, where revivals tended to be quieter and more solemn, western revivals tended to be more emotional and dramatic.{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|pp=62-63}} Kentucky was the location of the [[Revival of 1800]] led by Presbyterian minister [[James McGready]]. It was here that the traditional Scottish communion season began to evolve into the American [[camp meeting]].{{Sfn|Wolffe|2007|p=58}} A year later, the [[Cane Ridge Revival]] led by [[Barton Stone]] lasted a week and drew crowds of 20,000 people from the thinly populated frontier. At Cane Ridge, many converts experienced religious ecstasy and \"bodily agitations\".{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26}} Some worshipers caught [[holy laughter]], barked like dogs, experienced convulsions, fell into trances, danced, shouted or were [[slain in the Spirit]]. Similar things had occurred in other revivals, but they were more intense at Cane Ridge. This revival was the origin of the [[Stone-Campbell Movement]], from which the [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Disciples of Christ]] denominations originate.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=72}}{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26}}\n\nDuring the Second Great Awakening, the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] was the most successful at gaining converts. It enthusiastically adopted camp meetings as a regular part of church life and devoted resources to evangelizing the western frontier. Itinerant ministers known as [[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]] traveled hundreds of miles each year to preach and serve scattered congregations. The Methodists took a democratic and egalitarian approach to ministry, allowing poor and uneducated young men to become circuit riders. The Baptists also expanded rapidly. Like the Methodists, Baptists also sent out itinerant ministers, often with little education.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=26\u201327}}\n\n[[File:Finney.png|thumb|upright|Charles Grandison Finney, the most prominent revivalist of the Second Great Awakening]]\n\nThe theology behind the First Great Awakening was largely [[Calvinist]].{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=66}} Calvinists taught [[Predestination in Calvinism|predestination]] and that God only gives [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] to a small group of the [[Unconditional election|elect]] and condemns everyone else to [[hell]]. The Calvinist doctrine of [[irresistible grace]] denied to humans [[Free will in theology|free will]] or any role in their own salvation.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=31}} The Second Great Awakening was heavily influenced by [[Arminianism]], a theology that allows for free will and gives humans a greater role in their own conversion.{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|p=66}} The Methodists had been Arminian from the beginning of their movement and taught that all people could choose salvation. They also taught that Christians could lose their salvation by [[backsliding]] or returning to sin.{{Sfn|FitzGerald|2017|p=31}}   \n\nThe most influential evangelical of the Second Great Awakening was [[Charles Grandison Finney]]. Though ordained by the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]], Finney deviated from traditional Calvinism. Finney taught that neither revivals nor conversion occurred without human effort. While divine grace is necessary to persuade people of the truth of Christianity, God does not force salvation upon people. Unlike Edwards, who described revival as a \"surprising work of God\", Finney taught that \"revival is not a miracle\" but \"the result of the right use of the appropriate means.\"{{Sfn|Sweeney|2005|pp=67\u201368}} Finney emphasized several methods to promote revival that have become known as the \"new measures\" (even though they were not new but had already been in use among the Methodists): mass advertising, protracted revival meetings, allowing women to speak and [[testify]] in revival meetings, and the [[mourner's bench]] where potential converts sat to pray for conversion.{{Sfn|Balmer|2002|p=491}}\n\nEvangelical views on [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] (the doctrine of the end times) have changed over time. The Puritans were [[premillennialists]], which means they believed that [[Second Coming|Christ would return]] before the [[Millennialism|Millennium]] (a thousand years of godly rule on earth). The First Great Awakening, however, convinced many evangelicals that the millennial kingdom was already being established before Christ returned, a belief known as [[postmillennialism]]. During the Second Great Awakening, postmillennialism (with its expectation that society would become progressively more Christianized) became the dominant view since it complemented the Arminian emphasis on self-determination and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment's]] positive view of human potential. This postmillennial optimism inspired a number of 19th-century reform movements, including [[Temperance movement|temperance]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], prison and educational reform. It also led to an increase in [[Christian mission|missionary]] work, and many of the major missionary societies were founded around this time (see [[Timeline of Christian missions]]).{{Sfn|Balmer|1999|p=47\u201348}}\n\n[[John Nelson Darby]] was a 19th-century Irish Anglican minister who devised modern [[dispensationalism]], an innovative Protestant theological interpretation of the Bible that was incorporated in the development of modern evangelicalism. [[Cyrus Scofield]] further promoted the influence of dispensationalism through the explanatory notes to his [[Scofield Reference Bible]]. According to scholar Mark S. Sweetnam, who takes a cultural studies perspective, dispensationalism can be defined in terms of its Evangelicalism, its insistence on the literal interpretation of Scripture, its recognition of stages in God's dealings with humanity, its expectation of the imminent return of Christ to rapture His saints, and its focus on both apocalypticism and premillennialism.<ref>{{Citation | first=Mark S | last=Sweetnam | title=Defining Dispensationalism: A Cultural Studies Perspective | journal=Journal of Religious History | year=2010 | volume=34 | issue=2 | pages=191\u2013212 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.2010.00862.x}}.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the revivalist [[Holiness movement]], based on the doctrine of \"entire sanctification,\" took a more extreme form in rural America and Canada, where it ultimately broke away from institutional Methodism.

In the early 20th century, a divide opened up between the fundamentalists and the mainline Protestant denominations, chiefly over the inerrancy of the Bible. The fundamentalists were those evangelicals who sought to defend their religious traditions, and feared that modern scientific leanings were leading away from the truth. After 1910, evangelicalism was dominated by the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalists]], who rejected [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and emphasized the inerrancy of the Scriptures. Evangelicals held the view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had surrendered their heritage as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of secularism. At the same time, the modernists criticized fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the [[Social Gospel]]. A favored mode of fighting back against liberalism was to prohibit the teaching of Darwinism or macro-evolution as fact in the public schools, a movement that reached its peak in the [[Scopes Trial]] of 1925, and resumed in the 1980s. The more modernistic Protestants largely abandoned the term \"evangelical\" and tolerated evolutionary theories in modern science and even in Biblical studies.\n\nFollowing the [[Welsh Methodist revival]], the [[Azusa Street Revival]] in 1906 began the spread of [[Pentecostalism]] in North America.\n\nDuring and after World War II, evangelicals increasingly organized, and expanded their vision to include the entire world. There was a great expansion of Evangelical activity within the United States, \"a revival of revivalism.\" [[Youth for Christ]] was formed; it later became the base for [[Billy Graham]]'s revivals. At the same time, a split developed between evangelicals, as they disagreed among themselves about how a Christian ought to respond to an unbelieving world. Many evangelicals urged that Christians must engage the culture directly and constructively,<ref>{{Citation|last=Henry|first=Carl FH|title=The Uneasy Conscience of Modern Fundamentalism|date=August 29, 2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN080282661X|origyear=1947|edition=reprint|place=Grand Rapids|publisher=Eerdmans|ISBN=0-8028-2661-X}}.</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2015}} and they began to express reservations about being known to the world as ''fundamentalists''.

It described the mood of positivism and non-militancy that characterized that generation. The new generation of evangelicals set as their goal to abandon a militant Bible stance. Instead, they would pursue dialogue, intellectualism, non-judgmentalism, and appeasement. They further called for an increased application of the gospel to the sociological, political, and economic areas. The self-identified fundamentalists also cooperated in separating their \"neo-Evangelical\" opponents from the ''fundamentalist'' name, by increasingly seeking to distinguish themselves from the more open group, whom they often characterized derogatorily by Ockenga's term, \"neo-Evangelical\" or just evangelical.[[File:Angelus Temple worship service 1942.jpg|thumb|right|Congregation at Angelus Temple during 14-hour Holy Ghost service led by Aimee Semple McPherson in Los Angeles, California in 1942.]]\n\nMore dramatic than the divisions and newfound organization within Evangelicalism was its expansion of international missionary activity. They had enthusiasm and self-confidence after the national victory in the world war. Many evangelicals came from poor rural districts, but wartime and postwar prosperity dramatically increased the funding resources available for missionary work. While mainline Protestant denominations cut back on their missionary activities, from 7000 to 3000 overseas workers between 1935 and 1980, the evangelicals increased their career foreign missionary force from 12,000 in 1935 to 35,000 in 1980. Meanwhile, Europe was falling behind, as North Americans comprised 41% of all the world's Protestant missionaries in 1936, rising to 52% in 1952 and 72% in 1969. The most active denominations were the Assemblies of God, which nearly tripled from 230 missionaries in 1935 to 626 in 1952, and the [[United Pentecostal Church International]], formed in 1945. The Southern Baptists more than doubled from 405 to 855, as did the Church of the Nazarene from 88 to 200.<ref>{{Citation|last=Carpenter|first=Joel A|title=Revive Us Again: The Reawakening of American Fundamentalism|year=1997|pages=184\u20135}}.</ref> Overseas missionaries began to prepare for the postwar challenge, most notably the Far Eastern Gospel Crusade (FEGC; now named \"Send International\").

In the section between Canal Road and South Middlebush Road, there are postings describing the foliage and the natural process. The \"Red Dot\" hiking trail, which runs between Canal Road and South Middlebush Road, has now been extended from South Middlebush Road up to NJ Route 27. There is a new White Trail, not fully blazed but very usable, running from a left fork off Red Dot near South Middlebush Road, to a parking lot off Jacques Lane.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Three Mile Run, New Jersey]], now incorporated into [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] <ref>[http://www.middlesexcountynj.gov/Government/Departments/BDE/Pages/Church-of-the-Three-Mile-Run.aspx Church of the Three Mile Run], [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]].

It includes a portion of the [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]] and the [[Six Mile Run Canal House]] that are separately listed on the National Register. It contains 149 contributing buildings, 5 contributing sites and 44 contributing structures.\n\nExamples of Six Mile Run Historic District contributing buildings are the three [[Meadows Foundation (New Jersey)|Meadows Foundation]] maintained properties listed here:\n*[[Van Liew-Suydam House]], 280 South Middlebush Road. It was built in  the 18th century by Peter Van Liew. Joseph Suydam later built the part of the house that is visible today. The newest and largest portion of the house was built in 1875.

In 1970, the land for the reservoir was acquired by the State through the [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]], Division of Water Resources as a future reservoir and recreation area and included many of the properties later listed as contributing to the Six Mile National Register Historic District. The reservoir was never built, and in 1993 administration of the area was transferred to the Division of Parks and Forestry.<ref name=Hunting/>\n\n==Six Mile Run Reservoir section of the Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park==\nToday the Six Mile Run Reservoir site is maintained as a State Park and includes several trails that are used primarily by mountain bikers, hikers, and horseback riders. It has {{convert|8|mi|km}} of twisting single track maintained by [[JORBA]].  Access to the park can be found at the large parking lot on Canal Road near Six Mile Run Road, from the parking lot of the private soccer club on Route 27, and from several smaller parking areas on roads that traverse the park.<ref>[http://www.dandrcanal.com/interest.html#sixmile Six Mile Run Reservoir Site], Delaware and Raritan Canal Commission.

In the section between Canal Road and South Middlebush Road, there are postings describing the foliage and the natural process. The \"Red Dot\" hiking trail, which runs between Canal Road and South Middlebush Road, has now been extended from South Middlebush Road up to NJ Route 27. There is a new White Trail, not fully blazed but very usable, running from a left fork off Red Dot near South Middlebush Road, to a parking lot off Jacques Lane.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Three Mile Run, New Jersey]], now incorporated into [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] <ref>[http://www.middlesexcountynj.gov/Government/Departments/BDE/Pages/Church-of-the-Three-Mile-Run.aspx Church of the Three Mile Run], [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]].
