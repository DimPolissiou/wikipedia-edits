Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat's leaders tend towards Sufism and recognize the four main Sufi orders. The consensus of tablighi scholars accept and teach Wahdatul wujood but the Ahle Sunnah wal jamaat doesn't accept it and believe it's a Sufi concept.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Extremist Sufis and Wahdatul-Wujood [Sheikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen al-Albaani]|url=https://www.facebook.com/tablighisufi/videos/the-extremist-sufis-and-wahdatul-wujood-sheikh-muhammad-naasir-ud-deen-al-albaan/447656339251960/|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 518</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 519</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 517</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings.

The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat's leaders tend towards Sufism and recognize the four main Sufi orders. The consensus of tablighi scholars accept and teach Wahdatul wujood but the Ahle Sunnah wal jamaat doesn't accept it and believe it's a Sufi concept.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Extremist Sufis and Wahdatul-Wujood [Sheikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen al-Albaani]|url=https://www.facebook.com/tablighisufi/videos/the-extremist-sufis-and-wahdatul-wujood-sheikh-muhammad-naasir-ud-deen-al-albaan/447656339251960/|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 518</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 519</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>[[#AMFO1994|Ahmed, \"Islamic Fundamentalism in South Asia\", 1994]]: p. 517</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

He felt the challenge a serious matter; that the pride of the university was at stake.<ref name=\"Bill\"/> In front of some 150 students in the [[gym]]nasium, Dudley explained that if the challenge were met, a new era of athletics would be created with the game of football. From his Kansas City law office many years later Jones remembered: \"There followed a general discussion of the whole situation. The difficulties, particularly the shortness of time for preparation, and the fact that regular football had not been theretofore played at Vanderbilt at all, were dealt upon. Many thought that it would be unfair to ourselves to hazard a contest under the circumstances. We knew that Peabody Normal had been playing intramural football for several years. The predominating note, however, for discussion was that we had never taken anything off Peabody Normal and should not do now. Finally, [[Pat Estes|P. M. (Pat) Estes]], then of [[St. Louis]], made a motion to the effect that the challenge be accepted and that E. H. Jones be authorized and directed to organize and captain a team for the occasion. The motion was unanimously carried.\"\n[[Image:ElliottJones.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Elliott Jones]].]]\nOf Dudley, Elliott Jones said:<blockquote>\"Too much cannot be said about Dr. William L. Dudley in connection with early football at Vanderbilt. Since college days his picture has adored my office wall, and when asked by any one who the gentleman is, I always reply, 'The best friend of myself and every other student at Vanderbilt, in my college days.' He went with the team on every trip, and watched over us like a father.\n\n\"He was our inspiration as well as our guardian. He was our true and loyal friend, under any and all circumstances, in adversity as well in prosperity. I have never known a more lovable, more genuine friend.

The difficulties, particularly the shortness of time for preparation, and the fact that regular football had not been theretofore played at Vanderbilt at all, were dealt upon. Many thought that it would be unfair to ourselves to hazard a contest under the circumstances. We knew that Peabody Normal had been playing intramural football for several years. The predominating note, however, for discussion was that we had never taken anything off Peabody Normal and should not do now. Finally, [[Pat Estes|P. M.

The motion was unanimously carried.\"\n[[Image:ElliottJones.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Elliott Jones]].]]\nOf Dudley, Elliott Jones said:<blockquote>\"Too much cannot be said about Dr. William L. Dudley in connection with early football at Vanderbilt. Since college days his picture has adored my office wall, and when asked by any one who the gentleman is, I always reply, 'The best friend of myself and every other student at Vanderbilt, in my college days.' He went with the team on every trip, and watched over us like a father.\n\n\"He was our inspiration as well as our guardian.

It is the sequel to DID's earlier software title, ''[[TFX (computer game)|TFX]]''. An [[expansion pack]], ''EF 2000: TACTCOM'', was released in 1996. A compilation, ''EF 2000: Evolution'', that included the main game and the expansion was released in 1996. An updated version, ''Super EF2000'', was released exclusively for [[Windows 95]] in 1996 in Europe. In 1997, a compilation titled ''EF2000: V2.0'' was released in North America that included the original DOS versions of ''EF2000'' and ''TACTCOM'' and also the Windows exclusive ''Super EF2000''. In June 1997, the graphics were boosted when DID released the \"Graphics+\" [[Patch (computing)|patch]], which added Rendition V\u00e9rit\u00e9 hardware support and [[Glide API]] for [[3dfx]] [[graphics card]] support to ''EF2000''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''EF2000'' is a [[combat flight simulator]] of the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] (EF2000) aircraft, featuring detailed terrain of the [[Baltic region]]. It supports [[virtual reality]] goggles. Graphics features included naturally irregular topography, clouds and darkening skies at high altitudes.\n\nGameplay consists of quick combat, simulator (free flight mode), training, [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] and campaign mode. The game featured a dynamic campaign simulating a campaign set in northern Europe. Missions require the player to evade ground-based and airborne defenses. [[Mid-air refueling]] is included.\n\n[[Multi-function display|MFD]]s allow player to attack both flying and grounded targets with a range of weapons, including [[precision-guided munition]]s, missiles and unguided bombs. Spot view allows for remote viewing of targets, enemies, friendly forces or the player's own EF2000.

In 1816, [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] commanded royalist troops countering the insurgency. In 1820, insurgents took the city, despite Santa Anna's attempts to stop them. The last viceroy of New Spain, [[Juan O'Donoj\u00fa]], arrived here in 1821, where he signed the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] with [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] at Fort San Juan de Ul\u00faa. In 1823, Spanish troops remaining at Fort San Juan de Ul\u00faa fired on the newly independent Mexican city of Veracruz.

It was defended by generals Juan Morales and Jos\u00e9 Juan de Landero. The siege continued with brisk firing until the 27th of March, by which time a considerable breach had been made in the wall surrounding the city. Upon this General Morales, who was Governor of both the city and of San Juan de Ulloa, commenced a correspondence with General Scott looking to the surrender of the town, forts and garrison. On the 29th Vera Cruz and San Juan de Ulloa were occupied by Scott's army. About five thousand prisoners and four hundred pieces of artillery, besides large amounts of small arms and ammunition, fell into the hands of the victorious force.

Eventually, unions came to have great power over the operations and tariffs charged. By the latter part of the 20th century, competing unions made the operations of the port difficult. Some blocked access to the port from federal roads and financial corruption was a problem.\n\nIn the 1970s, a federal commission was established to design a new administrative system for the ports of Mexico. The legislature passed laws authorizing the federal government to take control over important ports such as Veracruz. The federal government modernized the port, adopting automation of loading and unloading. This resulted in a reduction of 80% of the port's jobs and labor resistance through strikes. The dockworkers' unions unified, negotiating for members to have a stake in a new company to manage the port's functions, named the ''Empresa de Servicios Portuarios de Veracruz, S.A. de C.V''.

The island is part of a system of twenty-three coral reefs called the [[Veracruz Reef System]], which is protected as a national park.<ref name=\"jornada\">{{Cite news |title= La isla in disputa |first=Gabriela |last=Cortanos Delgado |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/10/31/eco-d.html |newspaper= La Jornada Ecol\u00f3gica |publisher=UNAM |location=Mexico City |date=31 October 2005 |accessdate=30 October 2009 |language=Spanish |trans-title= The island in dispute }}</ref> Visitors can kayak to the Isla de Sacrificios to observe seagulls, pelicans and the fish that inhabit the coral reef.<ref name=\"portal\">{{Cite web|url=http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=153,4198113&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |title=Portal de Ciudadano Veracruz |language=Spanish |trans-title=Veracruz Citizen Portal |accessdate=29 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405072945/http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=153%2C4198113&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL |archivedate=5 April 2009 }}</ref> In 1983, a study and initial cleanup project was undertaken at the island, which collected fifty tons of trash. Shortly thereafter, the island was closed to the public and since then, there has been a struggle among authorities, tour operators and fisherman as to the fate and uses of the island. There are those who would like to build hotels, restaurants and other facilities for ecotourism. However, access to the island has been restricted to research, teaching and the occasional sporting event.<ref name=\"jornada\"/>\n\nOther small islands and shoals off the coast include: [[Isla de Enmedio]], [[Isla Verde, Mexico|Isla Verde]], [[Anegada de Adentro]], [[Santiaguillo]] and [[Anegada de Afuera]], the last two next to Anton Lizardo beach. All of them are included within the Sistema Arrecifal Veracruzano national park and make fine sites for SCUBA diving. Several operators in Veracruz and in Boca del Rio offer scuba equipment and tours. The best season for scuba diving is May to August.\n\n[[File:Catedral de Veracruz.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Veracruz]]]]\nFor 400 years, the island has suffered ecologically from pollution related to development, as well as the pillaging of its coral reefs and archeological pieces.{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} Current pollution problems are mostly due to untreated wastewater that flows into the ocean from the city and the polluted [[Jamapa River]]. Its coastline has been modified and more than 200 hectares of reefs in its littoral zone have been pillaged. Coral and other marine species have been taken for commercial and craft purposes, as well as by fishermen. Some of these coral reefs have already died due to pollution. Since the island was closed, there has been some revival of marine life.<ref name=\"jornada\"/>\n\nRuins here have not been extensively studied but cover more than 700 years of history. In the pre-Hispanic era, the island was considered sacred and a sanctuary on which to perform religious rites. [[Human sacrifice]] was frequently performed and the remains buried here. A small altar is referred to in historic sources but it had not been found. The Spanish built a hospital here, but all that remains is part of one wall. Later, a storage faculty to store gunpowder was built, as well as an obelisk during the French Intervention, but these have crumbled as well. The only surviving structure is a small lighthouse. About 800 archeological artifacts have been partially excavated on the island but cannot be exhibited because the humidity and weather would damage them.<ref name=\"jornada\"/>\n\n[[File:Playa Villa del Mar-Puerto de Veracruz-Mexico.jpeg|thumb|left|Villa del Mar]]\nReopening the island is difficult because the ecosystem here is delicate, and any construction could damage archeological sites and valuable pieces. Any plans to reopen the island to visitors will require the collaboration of the [[Veracruzano Coral Reef System National Park|Veracruz Reef System Park]], to which it belongs, as well as Secretariat of the Navy, [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|INAH]], the Veracruz Aquarium and other government agencies negotiating with the local associations of hotels, tour operators and fishermen. So far, government agencies have blocked efforts to develop anything on the island. An ecotourism project consisting of guided tours is considered the most viable, such as that proposed by the [[Universidad Veracruzana|Veracruzana University]] and the Aquarium, but there is concern on the part of INAH and the Secretariat of the Navy.<ref name=\"jornada\"/>\n\nThe mainland has several beaches. Playa Mart\u00ed is located between the city of Veracruz and Boca del R\u00edo, five km from the historic center. This beach also has goals and nets for football and volleyball games. The Playa de Hornos is located next to the Veracruz Aquarium. It is safe to swim here. Amenities include tables, chairs and umbrellas to rent, as well as food stands. During the high seasons lifeguards are on duty. Banana boats may be rented. There are also boats that take tourist to the Isla Canuncito.

To request a refill, customers clink the sides of their glasses (not cups) with their spoons. This clinking can be heard from the early morning to late at night. The story behind this custom is that a trolley driver used to ring his bell when he was a block away from the Gran Caf\u00e9 del Portal to let the waiters know he was coming. When the driver died, his casket was borne on the trolley and when it passed the establishment, the customers and waiters tapped their glasses in his honor.<ref name=\"alisau\"/>\n\nThe song \"[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]],\" made famous by [[Ritchie Valens]], has its roots in the Veracruz [[son (music)|\"son\"]] style of music, which originated in southern Veracruz state. It has African and Caribbean influence and is popular throughout Mexico, Latin America and the United States. Traditional Veracruzian music is called \"[[Son Jarocho]]\". Although there are many types of son music found in Mexico, the Son Jarocho is typically associated with the city of Veracruz. Other types of son include \"Son Comercial\". This style is faster and flashier than the traditional Son Jarocho and can be heard in [[Ballet Folklorico de Mexico|Mexican folkdance exhibitions]], when Veracruz women with long white dresses and fans dance with partners also dressed in white. The Son Comercial developed in the 1940s from the Son Jarocho; in the 21st century it is so pervasive that many mistakenly believe it to be the first version.

While the events were officially held at these locations, many residents took advantage of the celebration on the streets near these sites.

In 1816, [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] commanded royalist troops countering the insurgency. In 1820, insurgents took the city, despite Santa Anna's attempts to stop them. The last viceroy of New Spain, [[Juan O'Donoj\u00fa]], arrived here in 1821, where he signed the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] with [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] at Fort San Juan de Ul\u00faa. In 1823, Spanish troops remaining at Fort San Juan de Ul\u00faa fired on the newly independent Mexican city of Veracruz.

The siege continued with brisk firing until the 27th of March, by which time a considerable breach had been made in the wall surrounding the city. Upon this General Morales, who was Governor of both the city and of San Juan de Ulloa, commenced a correspondence with General Scott looking to the surrender of the town, forts and garrison. On the 29th Vera Cruz and San Juan de Ulloa were occupied by Scott's army. About five thousand prisoners and four hundred pieces of artillery, besides large amounts of small arms and ammunition, fell into the hands of the victorious force.

Eventually, unions came to have great power over the operations and tariffs charged. By the latter part of the 20th century, competing unions made the operations of the port difficult. Some blocked access to the port from federal roads and financial corruption was a problem.\n\nIn the 1970s, a federal commission was established to design a new administrative system for the ports of Mexico. The legislature passed laws authorizing the federal government to take control over important ports such as Veracruz. The federal government modernized the port, adopting automation of loading and unloading. This resulted in a reduction of 80% of the port's jobs and labor resistance through strikes. The dockworkers' unions unified, negotiating for members to have a stake in a new company to manage the port's functions, named the ''Empresa de Servicios Portuarios de Veracruz, S.A. de C.V''.

Shortly thereafter, the island was closed to the public and since then, there has been a struggle among authorities, tour operators and fisherman as to the fate and uses of the island. There are those who would like to build hotels, restaurants and other facilities for ecotourism. However, access to the island has been restricted to research, teaching and the occasional sporting event.<ref name=\"jornada\"/>\n\nOther small islands and shoals off the coast include: [[Isla de Enmedio]], [[Isla Verde, Mexico|Isla Verde]], [[Anegada de Adentro]], [[Santiaguillo]] and [[Anegada de Afuera]], the last two next to Anton Lizardo beach. All of them are included within the Sistema Arrecifal Veracruzano national park and make fine sites for SCUBA diving. Several operators in Veracruz and in Boca del Rio offer scuba equipment and tours. The best season for scuba diving is May to August.\n\n[[File:Catedral de Veracruz.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Veracruz]]]]\nFor 400 years, the island has suffered ecologically from pollution related to development, as well as the pillaging of its coral reefs and archeological pieces.{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} Current pollution problems are mostly due to untreated wastewater that flows into the ocean from the city and the polluted [[Jamapa River]]. Its coastline has been modified and more than 200 hectares of reefs in its littoral zone have been pillaged. Coral and other marine species have been taken for commercial and craft purposes, as well as by fishermen. Some of these coral reefs have already died due to pollution. Since the island was closed, there has been some revival of marine life.<ref name=\"jornada\"/>\n\nRuins here have not been extensively studied but cover more than 700 years of history. In the pre-Hispanic era, the island was considered sacred and a sanctuary on which to perform religious rites. [[Human sacrifice]] was frequently performed and the remains buried here. A small altar is referred to in historic sources but it had not been found. The Spanish built a hospital here, but all that remains is part of one wall. Later, a storage faculty to store gunpowder was built, as well as an obelisk during the French Intervention, but these have crumbled as well. The only surviving structure is a small lighthouse. About 800 archeological artifacts have been partially excavated on the island but cannot be exhibited because the humidity and weather would damage them.<ref name=\"jornada\"/>\n\n[[File:Playa Villa del Mar-Puerto de Veracruz-Mexico.jpeg|thumb|left|Villa del Mar]]\nReopening the island is difficult because the ecosystem here is delicate, and any construction could damage archeological sites and valuable pieces. Any plans to reopen the island to visitors will require the collaboration of the [[Veracruzano Coral Reef System National Park|Veracruz Reef System Park]], to which it belongs, as well as Secretariat of the Navy, [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|INAH]], the Veracruz Aquarium and other government agencies negotiating with the local associations of hotels, tour operators and fishermen. So far, government agencies have blocked efforts to develop anything on the island. An ecotourism project consisting of guided tours is considered the most viable, such as that proposed by the [[Universidad Veracruzana|Veracruzana University]] and the Aquarium, but there is concern on the part of INAH and the Secretariat of the Navy.<ref name=\"jornada\"/>\n\nThe mainland has several beaches. Playa Mart\u00ed is located between the city of Veracruz and Boca del R\u00edo, five km from the historic center. This beach also has goals and nets for football and volleyball games. The Playa de Hornos is located next to the Veracruz Aquarium. It is safe to swim here. Amenities include tables, chairs and umbrellas to rent, as well as food stands.

Although there are many types of son music found in Mexico, the Son Jarocho is typically associated with the city of Veracruz. Other types of son include \"Son Comercial\". This style is faster and flashier than the traditional Son Jarocho and can be heard in [[Ballet Folklorico de Mexico|Mexican folkdance exhibitions]], when Veracruz women with long white dresses and fans dance with partners also dressed in white. The Son Comercial developed in the 1940s from the Son Jarocho; in the 21st century it is so pervasive that many mistakenly believe it to be the first version.
