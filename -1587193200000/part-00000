It was made in 1717 and was last produced during the 1840s. However, it still saw limited use in conflicts through the mid-19th century (such as the [[Crimean War]]).\n\n== History ==\n[[Marin le Bourgeoys]] created the first true [[flintlock]] weapons for King [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] shortly after his accession to the throne in 1610.<ref>\"Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact\" By Jeff Kinard, Published by ABC-CLIO, 2004</ref> Throughout the 17th century, flintlock muskets were produced in a wide variety of models.\n\nIn 1717, a flintlock [[musket]] for the French infantry was standardized. This became the first standard flintlock musket to be issued to all French troops. While it is more correctly called a '''French infantry musket''' or a '''French pattern musket''', these muskets later became known as \"Charleville muskets\", after the armory in [[Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res]], [[Ardennes (department)|Ardennes]], [[Kingdom of France|France]].<ref>http://www.militaryheritage.com/musket14.htm</ref> The standard French [[Long gun|infantry-long gun]] was also produced at [[Tulle]], [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]], Maubeuge Arsenal, and other sites. While technically not the correct name for these muskets, the use of the name Charleville dates back to the [[U.S. Revolutionary War]], when [[Americans]] tended to refer to all of the musket models as Charlevilles. The naming of these muskets is not consistent. Some references only refer to Model 1763 and later versions as Charleville flintlock muskets, while other references refer to all models as the Charleville.\nThe Charleville musket's design was refined several times during its service life. Later models of Charleville muskets remained in service until 1840, when [[caplock mechanism|percussion lock]] systems made the flintlock mechanism obsolete.<ref>\"Napoleon: a biography\" By Frank McLynn</ref>\n\n== Design features ==\n[[Image:Charleville exploded view.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Charleville Musket, [[exploded view]]]]\nCharleville muskets had a [[smoothbore]] barrel. Rifles were more accurate than smoothbore muskets, but military commanders favored smoothbores on the battlefield, since the round from a [[rifle]] had to fit tightly into the [[Barrel (firearm)|barrel]] and became very difficult to load after a few shots because the [[black powder]] quickly [[Fouling|fouled]] the barrel. The longer range and better [[Accuracy and precision|accuracy]] of the rifle was also considered to be of little value on a battlefield that was quickly obscured by black powder smoke. Like all smoothbore muskets, the Charleville flintlock musket was only accurate to about {{convert|110|yd|m|abbr=on}} against a column of men, or forty to fifty yards (37 to 46 m) against a single mansized target.\n\nThe Charleville's 0.69-inch (17.5 mm) caliber barrel was slightly smaller than its main competitor, the 0.75-inch caliber [[Brown Bess]] produced by the [[British people|British]]. The smaller round was intentionally chosen to reduce weight in the field, but still had enough mass to be effective as a military round. The Charleville's [[Stock (firearms)|stock]] was usually made out of [[walnut]].\n\nCharleville muskets were not used in battle like a modern rifle. Instead, Charleville muskets were fired in mass formations [''en masse'']. In modern warfare, [[bayonet]]s are considered to be last-ditch weapons, but in the days of the Charleville musket, they played a much more significant role on the battlefield, often accounting for roughly a third of all battlefield casualties. Muskets played a dual role on the battlefield, being used as a ranged weapon at a distance, and also being used as a pike-type weapon in close [[hand-to-hand combat]]. This use as a [[pike (weapon)|pike]] dictated the Charleville's general length and weight. A shorter weapon could not be used as a pike, and its weight was a balance between being heavy enough to be used as a pike or [[Club (weapon)|club]], but light enough to be carried and used by [[Line infantry|general infantrymen]].\n\nThe rate of fire depended on the skill of the soldier, which was typically about three shots per minute. The Charleville's barrel was held into place by three barrel bands. This made the Charleville sturdier than the British Brown Bess musket, which used pins to hold the barrel in place. The butt of the Charleville's stock was sometimes referred to as the \"patte de vache\" (French for \"cow's foot\"), as its shape was designed to be used as a club in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nCharleville muskets were [[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]-loaded and used a flintlock firing mechanism. They typically fired a round, lead ball but could fire other [[ammunition]] such as [[buck and ball]] or [[Shot (pellet)|shot]].\n== Variants ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:10%;\"|Model\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:25%;\"|Picture\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:20%;\"|Description\n|-\n|1717 || [[File:Charleville 1717.jpg|350px]] || After numerous musket designs in the late 17th and early 18th century, the infantry musket was standardized in what would become the Model 1717. This model standardized most of the design features that would be common to all subsequent models, such as a .69 caliber barrel, an approximate length of 60&nbsp;inches (1,524 mm) and an approximate weight of nine to ten pounds (4.1 to 4.5 kg). The Model 1717 also standardized the smoothbore barrel and flintlock firing mechanism.\n\nUnlike later models, the Model 1717 had a pinned barrel, similar in design of the British Brown Bess. It also had a single barrel band at the center of the barrel, and four iron pipes which held a wooden [[ramrod|scouring stick]]. All of the furniture was iron.\n\nThe Model 1717 had a 46-inch (1,168 mm) barrel and an overall length of 62&nbsp;inches (1,575 mm), and weighed approximately nine pounds. A total of 48,000 Model 1717 muskets were produced. \n|-\n|1728 || [[File:Charleville 1728.jpg|350px]] || The Model 1728 replaced the pinned barrel with a barrel held in place by three barrel bands, which would become standard on all subsequent Charleville muskets. The barrel band design was not only easier to disassemble for cleaning, but was also sturdier, which was an important consideration in bayonet combat.\n\nThe lock was also revised, with a longer [[Frizzen|''steel'']] spring and a slightly modified [[Hammer (firearms)|cock]] design.\n\nChanges in the 1740s included the standardized use of a steel scouring stick in 1741 and, after 1746, newly manufactured muskets had the pan/frizzen bridle removed. Other minor changes were also made throughout the Model 1728's production life. These modified versions are generally considered to be minor variations to the Model 1728, and are not typically considered to be a separate and distinct model of musket.\nA total of 375,000 Model 1728 muskets were produced. \n|-\n|1763 || [[File:Charleville 1763.jpg|350px]] || After the [[Seven Years' War]] (in [[North America]] often known as the [[French and Indian war]]), the French infantry musket was redesigned, resulting in the Model 1763.\n\nThe barrel was shortened from 46&nbsp;inches (1,168 mm) to 44&nbsp;inches (1,117 mm) and the [[Octagon|octagonal]] breech plug featured on earlier models was replaced with a more rounded design. The stock's distinctive \"cow's foot\" butt was modified with a much more straightened design. The scouring stick was also given a more trumpet shaped end.\n\nThough shorter in length, the Model 1763 was designed to be heavier and sturdier, and weighed over ten pounds.\n\nA total of 88,000 Model 1763 muskets were produced. \n|-\n|1766 || [[File:Charleville 1766.jpg|350px]] || The Model 1763's sturdier design proved to be a bit too heavy, so in 1766 the musket's design was lightened. The barrel wall was thinned, the lock was shortened, the stock was slimmed, and the Model 1763's long iron scouring stick cover was replaced by a pinned spring under the breech. The trumpet shaped scouring stick of the Model 1763 was also abandoned in favor of a scouring stick with a lighter button shaped end.\n\nThough usually considered to be a separate model, the Model 1766 was often referred to as a \"light Model 1763\" musket, especially in Revolutionary War invoices.<ref>\"Don Troiani's soldiers in America, 1754-1865\" By Don Troiani, Earl J. Coates, James L. Kochan</ref>\n\nDespite being thinned down, the Model 1766 proved to be rugged and reliable.\n\nA total of 140,000 Model 1766 muskets were produced.\n|-\n|1770 - 1776 || [[File:Charleville 1774.jpg|350px]] || Several changes were made to Charleville muskets during the 1770s. References are not consistent with respect to the naming of these models. Some consider many of them to be distinct models, while others consider them to be only variations of earlier models. Most of the modifications during this period were relatively minor.\n\nThe Model 1770 had a modified lock plate, stronger barrel bands, and a modified retaining [[Spring (device)|spring]]. The Model 1771 moved the [[bayonet lug]] and strengthened the barrel. The Model 1770 and 1771 are often grouped together as a single model. The Model 1773 was similar to previous models, but again modified the scouring stick-retaining spring. The Model 1773 is often considered to be a minor variant to the Model 1770/1771. The Model 1774 had a shorter [[trigger guard]], and the tail of the steel was cut square. The scouring stick-design was also modified in the Model 1774, giving it more of a pear shaped head.<ref>\"Arms and Armor in Colonial America, 1526-1783\" By Harold Leslie Peterson</ref> Similarly minor changes were made for the Model 1776, which is often not considered to be a separate model.\n\nThroughout the 1770s, the stock was modified in an inconsistent fashion. Some muskets were produced with a much more pronounced comb on the stock than others, which have an almost nonexistent comb.\n\nA total of 70,000 Model 1770 to 1776 muskets were produced.\n|-\n|1777 || [[File:Charleville 1777.jpg|350px]] ||\n\nThe design of the stock was again modified for the Model 1777, with a cheek rest cut into the inboard side of the butt. The Model 1777 also featured a slanted brass [[flash pan|priming pan]] and bridle, and a modified trigger guard with two rear finger ridges.\n\nThe Model 1777 is often incorrectly believed to have been used in large numbers by [[Patriot (American Revolution)|rebel]] troops during the [[American War of Independence]]. While the Model 1777 was used in the American Revolutionary War, it was generally only used by [[French Army|French troops]] who served on American soil, such as those under the command of [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|General Rochambeau]]. [[Continental Army|American troops]] were instead armed with earlier Model 1763 and 1766 muskets.\n\n(See also [[Musket Model 1777]]).\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Other variants ===\n[[File:Afghan muskets.jpg|thumb|Crude [[Khyber Pass copy]] of a Russian 1808 Tula musket (left).]]\n[[Image:Charleville.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Modern reproduction of the Charleville Model 1766 musket.]]\nIn 1754, the French introduced a shorter Officers version of the Charleville.\n\nMost models were produced in shorter [[dragoon]] versions, which were generally about ten inches (254 mm) shorter than their infantry counterpart. The Model 1763, 1766, and 1777 were all available in a [[cavalry]] version. These are also often called [[carbine]] versions.\n\nThe Model 1777 [[Artillery]] version had a 36-inch (914 mm) barrel and an overall length of 51&nbsp;inches (1,295 mm). The furniture was mostly made of brass.\n\nThe Model 1777 Dragoon version had a 42-inch barrel and an overall length of 57&nbsp;inches (1,447 mm). Most of the furniture was made of brass.\n\nThe Model 1777 [[French Navy|Navy]] version was similar in length to the Dragoon version. All furniture on the navy version was made of brass.\n\nThe [[Russian Empire|Russian]] Model 1808 Musket was based heavily on the design of the Model 1777 Charleville. This musket is often called a \"Tula musket\" since the majority were manufactured in [[Tula Governorate|Tula]] and bore its name on their [[Firing mechanism|locks]]. The Tula musket was manufactured with only minor changes until 1845, when it was replaced by a percussion lock musket.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] Model 1815 No. 1 and No. 2, as well as the Koloniaal Model 1836 and- 1837' were based heavily on the design of the [[Musket Model 1777|Model 1777 Corrig\u00e9 en l'an IX]].\n\nCharleville muskets were also copied by [[Kingdom of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] as the [[Augustin musket]] and [[1809 pattern Potzdam musket]].\n\nIn the 1830s and 1840s, many old Charleville muskets (mostly later models) were converted from flintlocks to percussion locks. Several Dutch guns were even converted to [[Breech-loading weapon|breechloaders]] with the Snider breech-loading system in the 1860s.\n\n== Use ==\n[[image:Nozon fabrique d'armes 08439.JPG|thumb|Historical birds-eye view of the arsenal at Charleville]]\nLarge numbers of Charleville Model 1763 and 1766 muskets were imported into the [[United States of America|United States]] from [[Kingdom of France|France]] during the [[American Revolution|American War of Independence]], due in large part to the influence of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]].<ref>\"Small Arms\", the Encyclopedia American, 1920</ref> The Charleville 1766 heavily influenced the design of the [[Model 1795 Musket|Springfield Musket of 1795]].\n\nThe Model 1766 and 1777 were also used by the [[French people|French]] during their participation in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nThe Model 1777 was used throughout the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It remained in service, at least partially, until the mid-1840s.\n\nModern replica Charleville muskets are produced by several manufacturers.

Muskets played a dual role on the battlefield, being used as a ranged weapon at a distance, and also being used as a pike-type weapon in close [[hand-to-hand combat]]. This use as a [[pike (weapon)|pike]] dictated the Charleville's general length and weight. A shorter weapon could not be used as a pike, and its weight was a balance between being heavy enough to be used as a pike or [[Club (weapon)|club]], but light enough to be carried and used by [[Line infantry|general infantrymen]].\n\nThe rate of fire depended on the skill of the soldier, which was typically about three shots per minute. The Charleville's barrel was held into place by three barrel bands. This made the Charleville sturdier than the British Brown Bess musket, which used pins to hold the barrel in place. The butt of the Charleville's stock was sometimes referred to as the \"patte de vache\" (French for \"cow's foot\"), as its shape was designed to be used as a club in hand-to-hand combat.\n\nCharleville muskets were [[Muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]-loaded and used a flintlock firing mechanism. They typically fired a round, lead ball but could fire other [[ammunition]] such as [[buck and ball]] or [[Shot (pellet)|shot]].\n== Variants ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:10%;\"|Model\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:25%;\"|Picture\n! style=\"text-align:left; width:20%;\"|Description\n|-\n|1717 || [[File:Charleville 1717.jpg|350px]] || After numerous musket designs in the late 17th and early 18th century, the infantry musket was standardized in what would become the Model 1717. This model standardized most of the design features that would be common to all subsequent models, such as a .69 caliber barrel, an approximate length of 60&nbsp;inches (1,524 mm) and an approximate weight of nine to ten pounds (4.1 to 4.5 kg). The Model 1717 also standardized the smoothbore barrel and flintlock firing mechanism.\n\nUnlike later models, the Model 1717 had a pinned barrel, similar in design of the British Brown Bess. It also had a single barrel band at the center of the barrel, and four iron pipes which held a wooden [[ramrod|scouring stick]]. All of the furniture was iron.\n\nThe Model 1717 had a 46-inch (1,168 mm) barrel and an overall length of 62&nbsp;inches (1,575 mm), and weighed approximately nine pounds. A total of 48,000 Model 1717 muskets were produced. \n|-\n|1728 || [[File:Charleville 1728.jpg|350px]] || The Model 1728 replaced the pinned barrel with a barrel held in place by three barrel bands, which would become standard on all subsequent Charleville muskets. The barrel band design was not only easier to disassemble for cleaning, but was also sturdier, which was an important consideration in bayonet combat.\n\nThe lock was also revised, with a longer [[Frizzen|''steel'']] spring and a slightly modified [[Hammer (firearms)|cock]] design.\n\nChanges in the 1740s included the standardized use of a steel scouring stick in 1741 and, after 1746, newly manufactured muskets had the pan/frizzen bridle removed. Other minor changes were also made throughout the Model 1728's production life. These modified versions are generally considered to be minor variations to the Model 1728, and are not typically considered to be a separate and distinct model of musket.\nA total of 375,000 Model 1728 muskets were produced. \n|-\n|1763 || [[File:Charleville 1763.jpg|350px]] || After the [[Seven Years' War]] (in [[North America]] often known as the [[French and Indian war]]), the French infantry musket was redesigned, resulting in the Model 1763.\n\nThe barrel was shortened from 46&nbsp;inches (1,168 mm) to 44&nbsp;inches (1,117 mm) and the [[Octagon|octagonal]] breech plug featured on earlier models was replaced with a more rounded design. The stock's distinctive \"cow's foot\" butt was modified with a much more straightened design. The scouring stick was also given a more trumpet shaped end.\n\nThough shorter in length, the Model 1763 was designed to be heavier and sturdier, and weighed over ten pounds.\n\nA total of 88,000 Model 1763 muskets were produced. \n|-\n|1766 || [[File:Charleville 1766.jpg|350px]] || The Model 1763's sturdier design proved to be a bit too heavy, so in 1766 the musket's design was lightened. The barrel wall was thinned, the lock was shortened, the stock was slimmed, and the Model 1763's long iron scouring stick cover was replaced by a pinned spring under the breech. The trumpet shaped scouring stick of the Model 1763 was also abandoned in favor of a scouring stick with a lighter button shaped end.\n\nThough usually considered to be a separate model, the Model 1766 was often referred to as a \"light Model 1763\" musket, especially in Revolutionary War invoices.<ref>\"Don Troiani's soldiers in America, 1754-1865\" By Don Troiani, Earl J. Coates, James L. Kochan</ref>\n\nDespite being thinned down, the Model 1766 proved to be rugged and reliable.\n\nA total of 140,000 Model 1766 muskets were produced.\n|-\n|1770 - 1776 || [[File:Charleville 1774.jpg|350px]] || Several changes were made to Charleville muskets during the 1770s. References are not consistent with respect to the naming of these models. Some consider many of them to be distinct models, while others consider them to be only variations of earlier models. Most of the modifications during this period were relatively minor.\n\nThe Model 1770 had a modified lock plate, stronger barrel bands, and a modified retaining [[Spring (device)|spring]]. The Model 1771 moved the [[bayonet lug]] and strengthened the barrel. The Model 1770 and 1771 are often grouped together as a single model. The Model 1773 was similar to previous models, but again modified the scouring stick-retaining spring. The Model 1773 is often considered to be a minor variant to the Model 1770/1771. The Model 1774 had a shorter [[trigger guard]], and the tail of the steel was cut square. The scouring stick-design was also modified in the Model 1774, giving it more of a pear shaped head.<ref>\"Arms and Armor in Colonial America, 1526-1783\" By Harold Leslie Peterson</ref> Similarly minor changes were made for the Model 1776, which is often not considered to be a separate model.\n\nThroughout the 1770s, the stock was modified in an inconsistent fashion. Some muskets were produced with a much more pronounced comb on the stock than others, which have an almost nonexistent comb.\n\nA total of 70,000 Model 1770 to 1776 muskets were produced.\n|-\n|1777 || [[File:Charleville 1777.jpg|350px]] ||\n\nThe design of the stock was again modified for the Model 1777, with a cheek rest cut into the inboard side of the butt. The Model 1777 also featured a slanted brass [[flash pan|priming pan]] and bridle, and a modified trigger guard with two rear finger ridges.\n\nThe Model 1777 is often incorrectly believed to have been used in large numbers by [[Patriot (American Revolution)|rebel]] troops during the [[American War of Independence]]. While the Model 1777 was used in the American Revolutionary War, it was generally only used by [[French Army|French troops]] who served on American soil, such as those under the command of [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|General Rochambeau]]. [[Continental Army|American troops]] were instead armed with earlier Model 1763 and 1766 muskets.\n\n(See also [[Musket Model 1777]]).\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Other variants ===\n[[File:Afghan muskets.jpg|thumb|Crude [[Khyber Pass copy]] of a Russian 1808 Tula musket (left).]]\nIn 1754, the French introduced a shorter Officers version of the Charleville.\n\nMost models were produced in shorter [[dragoon]] versions, which were generally about ten inches (254 mm) shorter than their infantry counterpart. The Model 1763, 1766, and 1777 were all available in a [[cavalry]] version. These are also often called [[carbine]] versions.\n\nThe Model 1777 [[Artillery]] version had a 36-inch (914 mm) barrel and an overall length of 51&nbsp;inches (1,295 mm). The furniture was mostly made of brass.\n\nThe Model 1777 Dragoon version had a 42-inch barrel and an overall length of 57&nbsp;inches (1,447 mm). Most of the furniture was made of brass.\n\nThe Model 1777 [[French Navy|Navy]] version was similar in length to the Dragoon version. All furniture on the navy version was made of brass.\n\nThe [[Russian Empire|Russian]] Model 1808 Musket was based heavily on the design of the Model 1777 Charleville. This musket is often called a \"Tula musket\" since the majority were manufactured in [[Tula Governorate|Tula]] and bore its name on their [[Firing mechanism|locks]]. The Tula musket was manufactured with only minor changes until 1845, when it was replaced by a percussion lock musket.\n\nThe [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] Model 1815 No. 1 and No. 2, as well as the Koloniaal Model 1836 and- 1837' were based heavily on the design of the [[Musket Model 1777|Model 1777 Corrig\u00e9 en l'an IX]].\n\nCharleville muskets were also copied by [[Kingdom of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Belgium|Belgium]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] as the [[Augustin musket]] and [[1809 pattern Potzdam musket]].\n\nIn the 1830s and 1840s, many old Charleville muskets (mostly later models) were converted from flintlocks to percussion locks. Several Dutch guns were even converted to [[Breech-loading weapon|breechloaders]] with the Snider breech-loading system in the 1860s.\n\n== Use ==\n[[image:Nozon fabrique d'armes 08439.JPG|thumb|Historical birds-eye view of the arsenal at Charleville]]\nLarge numbers of Charleville Model 1763 and 1766 muskets were imported into the [[United States of America|United States]] from [[Kingdom of France|France]] during the [[American Revolution|American War of Independence]], due in large part to the influence of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]].<ref>\"Small Arms\", the Encyclopedia American, 1920</ref> The Charleville 1766 heavily influenced the design of the [[Model 1795 Musket|Springfield Musket of 1795]].\n\nThe Model 1766 and 1777 were also used by the [[French people|French]] during their participation in the American Revolutionary War.\n\nThe Model 1777 was used throughout the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It remained in service, at least partially, until the mid-1840s.\n\nModern replica Charleville muskets are produced by several manufacturers. These are used by [[Historical reenactment|historical reenactor]]s in both in the [[Americas]] and [[Europe]].\n==See also==\n*[[List of infantry weapons in the American Revolution]]\n*[[French weapons in the American Civil War]]\n*[[List of wars involving France]]\n*[[Military history of France]]\n*[[French Armed Forces]]\n*[[Special Operations Command (France)|French Special Operations Command]]\n*[[French Foreign Legion]]\n*[[Modern equipment of the French Army]]\n*[[Tanegashima (gun)|Tanegashima]]\n*[[Brown Bess]]\n*[[Potzdam Musket 1723]]\n*[[Jezail]]\n*[[M1752 Musket]]\n*[[Musket Model 1777]]\n*[[Springfield musket]]\n*[[Carbine]]\n*[[Rifle]]\n*[[Musket]]\n*[[Historical reenactment]]\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20090216063113/http://11thpa.org/charleville.html\n* [http://www.militaryheritage.com/musket14.htm Detailed images of 1766 Charleville] [[replica]]\n* [http://web.bryant.edu/~ehu/h364/materials/musket/rev_gun1.htm]\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box | title=French Army rifle|\n before= ??? | years=1717-1777| after=[[Musket Model 1777]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Early firearms}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Charleville Musket}}\n[[Category:Muskets]]\n[[Category:Firearms of France]]\n[[Category:18th-century weapons]]\n", "name_user": "WikiFirearms", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleville_musket"}
