Retrieved 27 January 2009.</ref> which has been represented by [[Kieran Mullan]] since the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]].\n\n== History of Willaston ==\nWillaston is believed to have taken its name from an ancient farmstead known as Wiglaf's tun. Like other English villages, the name has been changed many times over the centuries. This is due to the neighbouring parish of Wistaston having a similar sounding name. To add confusion, Willaston was once ecclesiastically divided between the neighbouring communities of Nantwich and Wybunbury.\n\nWhilst there are at least two other villages called Willaston, the earliest documentary evidence relating to Willaston in this part of Cheshire can be found in the [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey of 1086, where is it referred to as Wilavestune. We know by reading this document that a 'free man' by the name of Ulviet once owned Wilvastune and that, just a few years after the Norman conquest, the title passed to Willam Malbank. The manor of Wilvastune remained in the Malbank family for several generations before ownership transferred to the Chanu family in the 13th century.\n\nAt this time, Willaston was a remote, sparsely populated community with no village centre. Nevertheless, it covered a much larger area than it does today, stretching from Newcastle Road and London Road Nantwich in the south, along Millstone Lane and as far as the ancient grazing land of Beam Heath in the north. These boundaries did not change until 1936, when local government decided to transfer some of Willaston's land to the expanding communities of [[Nantwich]] and Stapeley. In 1553, the manor of Willaston was bought by Richard Sneyd. Recorder of Chester. The Sneyd family lived at [[Keele Hall]] in Staffordshire and were the major landowners in WIllaston until the middle of the 19th century.\n\nAlthough Willaston had a number of farmsteads in the Middle Ages, most of the surrounding landscape was uncultivated. However, this began to change as more and more common land began to fall into private ownership during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The process (known as 'enclosure') brought major changes to rural communities such as Willaston, as individual plots of land were fenced off and used for arable farming, meadows and the grazing of livestock. The Sneyd family were absentee landlords but they owned most of the lands in Willaston from 1533 to the late 19th century.\n\nUnfortunately, the medieval moated site of the Chanu family was lost during the construction of the Nantwich by-pass in 1989. It was situated to the south-east of the Old Willaston Board School on land now owned by Cheerbrook Farm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://willastonparishcouncil.org.uk/files/Willaston_Parish_Plan_2009.pdf|title=Willaston Parish Plan - History of Willaston|last=|first=|date=|website=Willaston Parish Council|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Local amenities==\nThe village centre of Willaston has two [[public house]]s (The Lamb and The Nag's Head) and a social club, while an [[off-licence]] provides local produce and day to day goods. Another pub, The Peacock, is situated to the north-west of the village centre, on Crewe Road (the [[A534 road|A534]]). Alongside The Peacock pub is a hotel operated by [[Premier Inn]].\n \nThe social club offers many social events ranging from a monthly kids disco to various tribute bands and acts.  The club has two pool teams, a [[snooker]] team, two 7-a-side [[Association football|football]] teams, a darts and [[dominoes]] team and a ladies [[darts]] team. In summer 2013 the function room (available for hire) was refurbished.\n\nThe village also has a fish and chip shop, and hairdressing salons. There are local businesses within the village providing employment (Scanlans, SJB Steel). At the edge of the village is a farm shop, Cheerbrook,<ref>[http://www.cheerbrook.co.uk Cheerbrook Farm's Official Website] . Retrieved 31 January 2009.</ref> on the Newcastle Road. A plant nursery and garden centre is located on Crewe Road.\n\nWillaston Primary School<ref>[http://clc2.uniservity.com/Grouphomepage.asp?GroupId=71339 Willaston Primary School Website] .

For children of pre-school age, there is an Ofsted registered playgroup in the village.\n\nA [[Red telephone box|K6]] telephone box is located in the village on Wistaston Road and has been in place since the late 1940s. The box was decommissioned by [[BT Group|British Telecom]] in 2010. The telephone box was purchased by Willaston Parish Council and turned into a book exchange known as the book box. A restoration was carried out in September 2019.\n[[File:Willaston_Book_Box.jpg|thumb|Former K6 Telephone box converted into a book exchange box]]\n\n==Local events==\n[[File:Willaston - Worm Charming.jpg|thumb|right|The [[World Worm Charming Championships]] have been held in Willaston since 1980.]]\nOne of the major events in Willaston is the [[World Worm Charming Championships]].

Another pub, The Peacock, is situated to the north-west of the village centre, on Crewe Road (the [[A534 road|A534]]). Alongside The Peacock pub is a hotel operated by [[Premier Inn]].\n \nThe social club offers many social events ranging from a monthly kids disco to various tribute bands and acts.  The club has two pool teams, a [[snooker]] team, two 7-a-side [[Association football|football]] teams, a darts and [[dominoes]] team and a ladies [[darts]] team. In summer 2013 the function room (available for hire) was refurbished.\n\nThe village also has a fish and chip shop, and hairdressing salons. There are local businesses within the village providing employment (Scanlans, SJB Steel). At the edge of the village is a farm shop, Cheerbrook,<ref>[http://www.cheerbrook.co.uk Cheerbrook Farm's Official Website] . Retrieved 31 January 2009.</ref> on the Newcastle Road. A plant nursery and garden centre is located on Crewe Road.\n\nWillaston Primary School<ref>[http://clc2.uniservity.com/Grouphomepage.asp?GroupId=71339 Willaston Primary School Website] . Retrieved May 18th 2010.</ref> is the only education establishment in the village. For children of pre-school age, there is an Ofsted registered playgroup in the village.\n\nA [[Red telephone box|K6]] telephone box is located in the village on Wistaston Road and has been in place since the late 1940s. The box was decommissioned by [[BT Group|British Telecom]] in 2010. The telephone box was purchased by Willaston Parish Council and turned into a book exchange known as the book box. A restoration was carried out in September 2019.\n[[File:Willaston_Book_Box.jpg|thumb|Former K6 Telephone box converted into a book exchange box]]\n\n==Local events==\n[[File:Willaston - Worm Charming.jpg|thumb|right|The [[World Worm Charming Championships]] have been held in Willaston since 1980.]]\nOne of the major events in Willaston is the [[World Worm Charming Championships]]. It was started in 1980 by John Bailey. The event attracts many competitors from around the world, from the U.S. to Australia. The original event in 1980 was won with a total of 511 worms by Tom Shufflebotham - a record that stood until 2009.\n\nCelebrities that have taken part in the championships include [[Ben Fogle]] and [[Bob Carolgees]]. In 2008 celebrity contestants [[Paddy McGuinness]] and [[Rory McGrath]] filmed a slot for their series \"Rory & Paddy's Great British Adventure\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demand.five.tv/Episode.aspx?episodeBaseName=C5141230003 |title=Demand Five &#124; watch Rory & Paddy's Great British Adventure, Series 1 - episode 3, Episode 3 |publisher=Demand.five.tv |date= |accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref>\n\nThe 2008 championship was won by Mike and Claire Gaukroger with a total of 125 worms; the trophy for the heaviest worm went to Ray O'Grady and Steve Plant (4.6g).<ref>{{cite web |author=Nicola King on behalf of I.F.C.W.A.P. |url=http://www.wormcharming.com |title=The World Worm Charming Championships |publisher=Wormcharming.com |accessdate=2009-06-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504122657/http://www.wormcharming.com/ |archivedate=2009-05-04 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, due to particularly good conditions, three teams broke the previous world record of 511.

People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[https://www.diamondapproach.org/ways-to-engage Ways to Engage with The Diamond Approach]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''[[dantian]]'' and in Japanese culture as the [[Hara_(tanden)|hara]]). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Goal_of_DA \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free. Your personality itself is free from its suffering and conflict.\"<ref>''Diamond Heart, Book 2'', pg. 11 \u2013 [https://www.diamondapproach.org/glossary/refinery_phrases/ridhwan Book Excerpts about Ridhwan]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe school rejects \"quick fixes\" and graduation, and the students are engaged in learning and therapy for an indefinite period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34BBA41766BD2A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Treating the Soul for Life: School rejects 'quick fixes' |date= 23 October 1992 | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Elixir of Enlightenment'', 1984, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|978-0-87728-613-4}}\n*''Essence: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1986, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|0-87728-627-2}}\n*''Essence with The Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1998, [[Weiser Books]], {{ISBN|1-57863-044-4}}\n*''Facets of Unity: The Enneagram of Holy Ideas'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-14-4}}\n*''Luminous Night's Journey: An Autobiographical Fragment'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-08-3}}\n*''The Inner Journey Home: Soul's Realization of the Unity of Reality'', 2004, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-1-59030-109-8}}\n*''The Power of Divine Eros''.

''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[https://www.diamondapproach.org/ways-to-engage Ways to Engage with The Diamond Approach]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''[[dantian]]'' and in Japanese culture as the [[Hara_(tanden)|hara]]). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Goal_of_DA \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free. Your personality itself is free from its suffering and conflict.\"<ref>''Diamond Heart, Book 2'', pg. 11 \u2013 [https://www.diamondapproach.org/glossary/refinery_phrases/ridhwan Book Excerpts about Ridhwan]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe school rejects \"quick fixes\" and graduation, and the students are engaged in learning and therapy for an indefinite period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34BBA41766BD2A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Treating the Soul for Life: School rejects 'quick fixes' |date= 23 October 1992 | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Elixir of Enlightenment'', 1984, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|978-0-87728-613-4}}\n*''Essence: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1986, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|0-87728-627-2}}\n*''Essence with The Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1998, [[Weiser Books]], {{ISBN|1-57863-044-4}}\n*''Facets of Unity: The Enneagram of Holy Ideas'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-14-4}}\n*''Luminous Night's Journey: An Autobiographical Fragment'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-08-3}}\n*''The Inner Journey Home: Soul's Realization of the Unity of Reality'', 2004, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-1-59030-109-8}}\n*''The Power of Divine Eros''.

She has been called \"the finest Australian writer of her generation\".<ref name=craven/> For her career contribution to \"children's and young adult literature in the broadest sense\" Hartnett won the [[Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award]] from the Swedish Arts Council in 2008, the biggest prize in children's literature.<ref name=alma2008/><ref name=cassin/>\n\nShe has published books as Sonya Hartnett, S. L. Hartnett, and Cameron S. Redfern.<ref name=NLA/><ref name=austlit/>\n\n==Writer==\n\nHartnett was thirteen years old when she wrote her first novel and fifteen when it was published for the adult market in Australia, ''Trouble All the Way'' ([[Adelaide]]: Rigby Publishers, 1984).<ref>It has been classified as Juvenile Fiction by some libraries. {{worldcat |oclc=27549040 |Trouble All the Way}}. Retrieved 3 June 2013.</ref><ref name=Eccleshare/> For years she has written about one novel annually.<ref name=austlit/> Although she is often classified as a writer of young adult fiction, Hartnett does not consider this label entirely accurate: \"I've been perceived as a young adult writer whereas my books have never really been young adult novels in the sort of classic sense of the idea.\" She believes the distinction is not so important in Britain as in her native land.<ref>[http://www.achuka.co.uk/interviews/hartnett1.php \"Sonya Hartnett: London, 2002\"] (interview, part 1 of 5). ACHUKA (''achuka.co.uk''). 2002.</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[National Library of Australia]], \"The novel for which Hartnett has achieved the most critical (and controversial) acclaim was ''Sleeping Dogs''\" (1995). \"A book involving incest between brother and sister and often critiqued as 'without hope', Sleeping Dogs generated enormous discussion both within Australia and overseas.\"<ref name=NLA/>\n\nMany of Hartnett's books have been published in the UK and in North America.

Redfern. The book contains many sex scenes and Hartnett was almost immediately \"outed\" as the author. She said that she wanted to avoid the book being accidentally shelved with her work for children in libraries and denied that she used a pseudonym to evade responsibility for the work or as a [[publicity stunt]] \u00e0 la Nikki Gemmell's ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare (novel)|The Bride Stripped Bare]]''.<ref name=faking/> In a review published in ''[[The Age]]'', [[Peter Craven (literary critic)|Peter Craven]] savaged the book describing it as an \"overblown little sex shocker\", a \"tawdry little crotch tickler\" and lamented that Hartnett was \"too good a writer to put her name to this indigestible hairball of spunk and spite\".<ref name=\"craven\"/> It was defended vigorously in ''[[The Australian]]'' by [[Marion Halligan]] (\"I haven't read many books by Hartnett, but I think this is a much more amazing piece of writing than any of them\") who chastised Craven for missing the joke (\"How could an experienced critic get that so wrong?\") and wonders why female authors writing frankly about sex is so frowned upon.<ref>Marion Halligan (24 June 2006).

The populist ideology of the party remained to present day as described on their website.\n\n==History==\nThe original Nacionalista Party that was founded on August 21, 1901 in Calle Gunao, Quiapo, Manila, was forgotten. In that Quiapo Assembly, the following officers of the true Nacionalista were elected, namely Santiago \u00c1lvarez and Pascual Poblete as presidents; Andres Villanueva, vice president; Macario Sakay, secretary general; Francisco Carre\u00f3n, Alejandro Santiago, Domingo Moriones, \u00c1guedo del Rosario, Cen\u00f3n Nicdao, Nicol\u00e1s Rivera, Salustiano Santiago, Aurelio Tolentino, Pantale\u00f3n Torres, Valent\u00edn Diza, Briccio Pantas, Lope K. Santos, P\u00edo H. Santos, Salustiano Cruz, Valent\u00edn Sol\u00eds and Jos\u00e9 Palma.\n\nThe party began as the country's vehicle for independence, through the building of a modern nation-state and the advocacy of efficient self-rule, dominating the [[Philippine Assembly]] (1907\u20131916), the [[Philippine Legislature]] (1916\u20131935) and the pre-war years of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] (1935\u20131941). During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], political parties were replaced by the [[KALIBAPI]].\n\nBy the second half of the century, the party was one of the main political contenders for leadership in the country in competition with the Liberals and the Progressives during the decades between the devastation of World War II and the violent suppression of partisan politics of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship.\n\nIn 1978, in a throwback to the Japanese occupation, political parties were asked to merge into the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]], although the Nacionalistas preferred to go into hibernation. Eventually, the party was revived during the late 1980s and early 1990s by the Laurel family, which has dominated the party since the 1950s. The Nacionalista Party is now being led by party president and former Seanator [[Manuel Villar]] and had three vice presidential candidates running independently or in tandem with other political parties ([[Alan Peter Cayetano]], [[Bongbong Marcos]] and [[Antonio Trillanes]]) in the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 general elections]]. Two of the other present parties, the Liberal Party and the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]], are breakaways from the Nacionalista Party.<ref name=\"Neoliberalism\">Dayley, Robert (2016).

The populist ideology of the party remained to present day as described on their website.\n\n==History==\nThe original Nacionalista Party that was founded on August 21, 1901 in Calle Gunao, Quiapo, Manila, was forgotten. In that Quiapo Assembly, the following officers of the true Nacionalista were elected, namely Santiago \u00c1lvarez and Pascual Poblete as presidents; Andres Villanueva, vice president; Macario Sakay, secretary general; Francisco Carre\u00f3n, Alejandro Santiago, Domingo Moriones, \u00c1guedo del Rosario, Cen\u00f3n Nicdao, Nicol\u00e1s Rivera, Salustiano Santiago, Aurelio Tolentino, Pantale\u00f3n Torres, Valent\u00edn Diza, Briccio Pantas, Lope K. Santos, P\u00edo H. Santos, Salustiano Cruz, Valent\u00edn Sol\u00eds and Jos\u00e9 Palma.\n\nThe party began as the country's vehicle for independence, through the building of a modern nation-state and the advocacy of efficient self-rule, dominating the [[Philippine Assembly]] (1907\u20131916), the [[Philippine Legislature]] (1916\u20131935) and the pre-war years of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] (1935\u20131941). During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], political parties were replaced by the [[KALIBAPI]].\n\nBy the second half of the century, the party was one of the main political contenders for leadership in the country in competition with the Liberals and the Progressives during the decades between the devastation of World War II and the violent suppression of partisan politics of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship.\n\nIn 1978, in a throwback to the Japanese occupation, political parties were asked to merge into the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]], although the Nacionalistas preferred to go into hibernation. Eventually, the party was revived during the late 1980s and early 1990s by the Laurel family, which has dominated the party since the 1950s. The Nacionalista Party is now being led by party president and former Seanator [[Manuel Villar]] and had three vice presidential candidates running independently or in tandem with other political parties ([[Alan Peter Cayetano]], [[Bongbong Marcos]] and [[Antonio Trillanes]]) in the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 general elections]]. Two of the other present parties, the Liberal Party and the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]], are breakaways from the Nacionalista Party.<ref name=\"Neoliberalism\">Dayley, Robert (2016).

They are known for having one of the NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six [[List of NBA champions|NBA championships]] between 1991 and 1998 with two [[three-peat]]s. All six of their championship teams were led by [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]rs [[Michael Jordan]], [[Scottie Pippen]] and coach [[Phil Jackson]]. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships while never losing an [[NBA Finals]] series in their history.\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games during the [[1995\u201396 NBA season]], setting an [[NBA regular season records|NBA record]] that stood until the [[Golden State Warriors]] won 73 games during the [[2015\u201316 NBA season]].

The Bulls' rivalry with the Pistons was highlighted heavily during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Franchise history==\n===Team creation===\nOn January 16, 1966 [[Chicago]] was granted an NBA franchise to be called the Bulls. The Chicago Bulls became the third NBA franchise in the city, after the [[Chicago Stags]] (1946\u20131950) and the Chicago Packers/Zephyrs (1961\u20131963; now the [[Washington Wizards]]). The Bulls' founder, [[Dick Klein (basketball)|Dick Klein]], was the Bulls' only owner to ever play professional basketball (for the [[Chicago American Gears]]). He served as the Bulls' president and general manager in their initial years.\n\nAfter the [[1966 NBA Expansion Draft]], the newly founded Chicago Bulls were allowed to acquire players from the previously established teams in the league for the upcoming 1966\u201367 season. The team started in the [[1966\u201367 NBA season]], and posted a 33\u201348 record, the best by an expansion team in NBA history. Coached by Chicagoan and former NBA star [[Johnny \"Red\" Kerr]], and led by former NBA assist leader [[Guy Rodgers]], guard [[Jerry Sloan]] and forward [[Bob Boozer]], the Bulls qualified for the playoffs, the only NBA team to do so in their inaugural season.\n\n===1966\u20131975: Early success===\n[[File:Chicago bulls 1969-70 team.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1969\u201370 Chicago Bulls]]\nIn their first season, the Bulls played their home games at the [[International Amphitheatre]], before moving to [[Chicago Stadium]].\n\nFan interest was diminishing after four seasons, with one game in the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1968 season]] having an official attendance of 891 and some games being played in [[Kansas City]]. In 1969, Klein dropped out of the general manager job and hired [[Pat Williams (basketball)|Pat Williams]], who as the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]' business manager created promotions that helped the team become third in attendance the previous season. Williams revamped the team roster, acquiring [[Chet Walker]] from his old team in exchange for [[Jim Washington]] and drafting [[Norm Van Lier]] \u2013 who was traded to the [[Cincinnati Royals]] and only joined the Bulls in 1971 \u2013 while also investing in promotion, with actions such as creating mascot [[Benny the Bull]]. The Bulls under Williams and head coach [[Dick Motta]] qualified for four straight playoffs and had attendances grow to over 10,000.<ref name=pat>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Sam|title=Pat Williams Helped Save Pro Basketball in Chicago|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/pat-williams-helped-save-pro-basketball-chicago.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=September 1, 2012|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref> In 1972, the Bulls set a franchise win-loss record at 57 wins and 25 losses. During the 1970s, the Bulls relied on [[Jerry Sloan]], forwards [[Bob Love]] and [[Chet Walker]], point guard [[Norm Van Lier]], and centers [[Clifford Ray]] and [[Tom Boerwinkle]]. The team made the conference finals in 1975 but lost to the eventual champions, the [[Golden State Warriors]], 4 games to 3.\n\nAfter four 50-win seasons, Williams returned to Philadelphia, and Motta decided to take on the role of GM as well. The Bulls ended up declining, winning only 24 games in the 1975\u201376 season. Motta was fired and replaced by [[Ed Badger]].<ref name=pat/>\n\n===1976\u20131984: Gilmore and Theus===\n[[File:Artis Gilmore 1977.jpeg|thumb|left|175px|Gilmore in 1977]]\nKlein sold the Bulls to the Wirtz Family, longtime owners of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. Indifferent to NBA basketball, the new ownership group infamously implemented a shoestring budget, putting little time and investment into improving the team.\n\n[[Artis Gilmore]], acquired in the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] dispersal draft in 1976, led a Bulls squad which included guard [[Reggie Theus]], forward [[David Greenwood]] and forward [[Orlando Woolridge]].\n\nIn 1979, the Bulls lost a coin flip for the right to select first in the NBA draft ([[Rod Thorn]], the Bulls' General Manager, called \"heads\"). Had the Bulls won the toss, they would have selected [[Magic Johnson]]; instead, they selected [[David Greenwood]] with the second pick. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] selected Johnson with the pick acquired from the [[New Orleans Jazz (NBA team)|New Orleans Jazz]], who traded the selection for [[Gail Goodrich]].\n\nAfter Gilmore was traded to the San Antonio Spurs for center [[Dave Corzine]], the Bulls employed a high-powered offense centered around Theus, and which soon included guards [[Quintin Dailey]] and [[Ennis Whatley]]. However, with continued dismal results, the Bulls decided to change direction, trading Theus to the [[Kansas City Kings]] during the [[1983\u201384 NBA season|1983\u201384 season]]. Attendance began to dwindle, with the Wirtz Family looking to sell to ownership groups interested in moving the team out of Chicago, before selling to local ownership.\n\n===1984\u20131998: The Michael Jordan era===\n[[File:Jordan by Lipofsky 16577.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Jordan]] was drafted third overall by the Bulls in [[1984 NBA draft|1984]]. He won six championships and six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]]s for Chicago.]]\nIn the summer of 1984, the Bulls had the third pick of the [[1984 NBA draft]], after Houston and Portland. The [[Houston Rockets|Rockets]] selected [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], the [[Portland Trail Blazers|Blazers]] picked [[Sam Bowie]] and the Bulls chose shooting guard [[Michael Jordan]]. The team, with new management in owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and general manager [[Jerry Krause]], decided to rebuild around Jordan. Jordan set franchise records during his rookie campaign for scoring (third in the league) and steals (fourth), and led the Bulls back to [[1985 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they lost in four games to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nIn the following off-season, the team acquired point guard [[John Paxson]] and on draft day traded with the Cavaliers for the rights to power forward [[Charles Oakley]]. Along with Jordan and center [[Dave Corzine]], they provided much of the Bulls' offense for the next two years. After suffering a broken foot early in the [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386 season]], Jordan finished second on the team to Woolridge in scoring. Jordan returned for [[1986 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], and led the eighth-place Bulls against the 67\u201315 [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]]. At the time, the Bulls had the fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.<ref>{{cite news|title=Worst Records of Playoff Teams|date=April 28, 1986|first=|last=|newspaper=[[The Sporting News]]|page=46}}</ref> Though the Bulls were swept, Jordan recorded a playoff single-game record 63 points in Game 2 (which still stands to this day), prompting Bird to call him 'God disguised as Michael Jordan.'\n\nIn the [[1986\u201387 NBA season]], Jordan continued his assault on the record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team. The Bulls finished 40\u201342, which was good enough to qualify them for the playoffs. However, they were again swept by the Celtics in [[1987 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]]. In the [[1987 NBA draft|1987 draft]], to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center [[Olden Polynice]] eighth overall and power forward [[Horace Grant]] 10th overall, then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, [[small forward]] [[Scottie Pippen]]. With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt, [[Brad Sellers]] and Oakley at the forward spots, Corzine anchoring center, and [[rookie]]s Pippen and Grant coming off the bench, the Bulls won 50 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, where they were beaten by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions [[Detroit Pistons]] in five games. For his efforts, Jordan was named NBA [[Most Valuable Player]], an award he would win four more times over his career. The 1987\u201388 season would also mark the start of the Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 to 1991.\n\nThe [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988\u201389 season]] marked a second straight year of major off-season moves. Power forward [[Charles Oakley]], who had led the league in total rebounds in both 1987 and 1988, was traded on the eve of the [[1988 NBA draft]] to the [[New York Knicks]] along with a first round draft pick used by the Knicks to select [[Rod Strickland]] for center [[Bill Cartwright]] and a first round pick, which the Bulls used to obtain center [[Will Perdue]]. In addition, the Bulls acquired three-point shooter [[Craig Hodges]] from Phoenix. The new starting lineup of Paxson, Jordan, Pippen, Grant, and Cartwright took some time to mesh, winning fewer games than the previous season, but made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the NBA champion Pistons.\n\nIn [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]], Jordan led the league in scoring for the fourth straight season and was joined on the all-star squad for the first time by Pippen. There was also a major change during the off-season, where head coach [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] was replaced by assistant coach [[Phil Jackson]]. The Bulls also picked up rookie center [[Stacey King]] and rookie point guard [[B. J. Armstrong]] in the [[1989 NBA draft|1989 draft]]. With these additional players and the previous year's starting five, the Bulls again made it to the Conference Finals and pushed the Pistons to seven games before being eliminated for the third straight year, the Pistons going on to repeat as NBA champions.\n\n====1991\u20131993: First championship three-peat====\n[[File:Jordan vs lakers nba finals 1991.jpg|thumb|160px|Michael Jordan v [[Los Angeles Lakers]] at the [[1991 NBA Finals]]]]\nIn the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], the Bulls recorded a then-franchise record 61 wins, and romped through [[1991 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they swept the Knicks in the first round, defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the semifinals, then eliminated defending champion Pistons in the Conference Finals and won the [[1991 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] in five games over the [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nThe Bulls won their second straight title in {{nbafy|1992}} after racking up another franchise record for wins with 67. They swept the [[Miami Heat]] in the first round, the Knicks in seven games in the second round, then the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in six games in the Eastern Conference to the [[1992 NBA Finals|Finals]] for the second year in a row where they defeated the [[Clyde Drexler]]-led [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in six games.\n\nIn {{nbafy|1993}}, the Bulls won their third consecutive championship by defeating the [[Atlanta Hawks]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[New York Knicks]] in the first three rounds of the playoffs and then defeating regular season MVP [[Charles Barkley]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the Finals, with Paxson's three-pointer with 3.9 seconds left giving them a 99\u201398 victory in Game 6 in Phoenix.\n\n====1993\u20131995: Jordan's first retirement====\n[[File:United Center 060716.jpg|thumb|[[United Center]]]]\nOn October 6, 1993, [[Michael Jordan]] shocked the basketball community by announcing his retirement, three months after his [[James R. Jordan, Sr.|father's murder]]. The Bulls were then led by Scottie Pippen, who established himself as one of the top players in the league by winning the [[1994 NBA All-Star Game|1994 All-Star]] MVP. He received help from [[Horace Grant]] and [[B. J. Armstrong]], who were named to their first all-star games. The three were assisted by [[Bill Cartwright|Cartwright]], [[Will Perdue|Perdue]], shooting guard [[Pete Myers]], and [[Croats|Croatian]] rookie forward [[Toni Kuko\u010d]]. Despite the Bulls winning 55 games during the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], they were beaten in seven games by the Knicks in the second round of [[1994 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], after a controversial foul call by referee [[Hue Hollins]] in game 5 of that series. The Knicks eventually reached the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] that year, but lost to the [[Houston Rockets]]. The Bulls opened the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]] by leaving their home of 27 years, [[Chicago Stadium]], and moving into their current home, the [[United Center]].\n\nIn 1994, the Bulls lost Grant, Cartwright and [[Scott Williams (basketball)|Scott Williams]] to free agency, and [[John Paxson]] to retirement, but picked up shooting guard [[Ron Harper]], the seeming heir apparent to Jordan in assistant coach [[Tex Winter]]'s triple-post offense, and small-forward [[Jud Buechler]]. The Bulls started Armstrong and Harper in the backcourt, Pippen and Kuko\u010d at the forward spots, and Perdue at center. They also had sharpshooter [[Steve Kerr]], whom they acquired via free agency before the 1993\u201394 season, Myers, and centers [[Luc Longley]] (acquired via trade in 1994 from the Minnesota Timberwolves) and [[Bill Wennington]]. However, they were struggling during the season, on March 18, 1995, they received the news that Michael Jordan was coming out of retirement. He scored 55 points against the Knicks in only his fifth game back, and led the Bulls to the fifth seed in [[1995 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they defeated the Charlotte Hornets. However, Jordan and the Bulls were unable to overcome the eventual Eastern Conference champion [[Orlando Magic]], which included [[Horace Grant]], [[Anfernee Hardaway]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. When Jordan returned to the Bulls, he initially wore No. 45 (which was his number while playing for the [[Birmingham Barons]], a [[minor league baseball|minor-league]] affiliate of the [[Chicago White Sox]]). He chose the No. 45 because his older brother Larry wore that number in high school. Michael wanted to be half as good as his brother so he chose 23 which is half of 45 (22.5) rounded up. However, Jordan switched back to the familiar 23 before game 2 of the Orlando Magic series.\n\nIn the off-season, the Bulls lost Armstrong in the expansion draft, and Krause traded Perdue to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for rebounding specialist [[Dennis Rodman]], who had won the past four rebounding titles, and who had also been a member of the [[Detroit Pistons]]' \"Bad Boys\" squad that served as the Bulls' chief nemesis in the late 1980s.\n\n====1995\u20131998: Second championship three-peat====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width =\n| image1 = Jordan Lipofsky.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| caption1 = [[Michael Jordan]]\n| image2 = Lipofsky Pippen.jpg\n| width2 = 151\n| caption2 = Scottie Pippen\n| image3 = \n| width3 = 130\n| caption3 = [[Dennis Rodman]]\n}}\nWith a lineup of Harper, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman and Longley, and perhaps the league's best bench in [[Steve Kerr]], Kuko\u010d, Wennington, Buechler, and guard [[Randy Brown]], the Bulls were seen as the team to win again for the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Bulls started their 1995\u201396 campaign with a 105\u201391 win over the visiting Hornets.

Scottie Pippen was looking for a significant contract extension that he thought he deserved, but was not getting from the organization. In spite of the turmoil that surrounded the Bulls, they still had a remarkable season, with a final regular season record of 62\u201320. Jordan would be named the league MVP for the fifth and final time, and the Bulls went into the playoffs as the number one seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe first round of the playoffs for the Bulls was against the [[New Jersey Nets]], a team led by [[Keith Van Horn]], [[Kendall Gill]] and [[Sam Cassell]]. The Bulls swept the Nets three to nothing in a best of five series. The conference semi-finals were more challenging with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] stealing game two from the Bulls at the United Center, and tying the series 1\u20131. But the Bulls easily defeated the Hornets in the next three games of the series. The Conference Finals was a challenge for the Bulls as they went up against the [[Reggie Miller]]-led [[Indiana Pacers]]. Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best chance to defeat the Bulls.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The Pacers gave the Bulls no road wins, winning games 3, 4, and 6, sending the series to a deciding game seven at the United Center. The Bulls prevailed and beat the Pacers 88\u201383, winning their 6th Eastern Conference Championship.\n\nIn a much anticipated Finals, The Bulls faced the team they beat the previous year, the [[Utah Jazz]]. Led by [[Karl Malone]] and [[John Stockton]], the Jazz felt confident that they could defeat the Bulls, winning game one at Utah's Delta Center. Facing a potential two to nothing deficit, the Bulls won Game 2 at the Delta Center and tied the series. The Bulls returned to the United Center and, by winning the next two games, took a 3\u20131 series lead. The Jazz won Game 5 by two points, 83\u201381. Game 6 was a tough battle for both teams, as the Jazz had a lead late in the game. Down by three points to the Jazz, Michael Jordan led the Bulls to one final win. Jordan hit a shot to bring the Bulls within 1, then stole the ball from Karl Malone and hit [[The Last Shot (basketball)|the game winning shot]] with 5.2 seconds remaining on the clock. With a score of 87\u201386, John Stockton put up a three-pointer, but missed, giving the Bulls their sixth championship in eight years. Jordan would be named the Finals MVP for the sixth time in his career. He retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.\n\n===1998\u20132008: Post-Dynasty struggles===\nThe summer of 1998 brought an abrupt end to the championship era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/schedule/results_1998.html|title=Bulls Schedule 1998\u201399|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|accessdate=August 1, 2009}}</ref> Krause felt that the Bulls were on the verge of being too old and unable to compete. He decided that the team's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow decline. His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft picks while clearing salary cap space to make a run at several promising free agents in two years' time. After having been vetoed in a previous attempt by owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], Krause traded Scottie Pippen for [[Roy Rogers (basketball)|Roy Rogers]] (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. He also decided not to re-sign [[Dennis Rodman]], and traded [[Luc Longley]] and [[Steve Kerr]] for other draft picks. He hired a new coach, [[Tim Floyd]], who had run a successful program at [[Iowa State University]]. Upon Phil Jackson's departure, Michael Jordan made his second retirement official. With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy Brown, shooting guard [[Ron Harper]], newcomer [[Brent Barry]] at small forward, power forward Toni Kuko\u010d, and center Bill Wennington, the team began the [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]]-shortened [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]]. Kuko\u010d led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists, but the team won only 13 of 50 games. The lowest point of the season came on April 10 in a game against the Miami Heat. In that game, the Bulls scored 49 points to set an NBA record for the fewest points in a game in the shot clock era.\n\nThe previous year's dismal finish came with one highlight: the team won the draft lottery and the rights to power forward [[Elton Brand]]. Since the team lost Harper, Wennington and Barry in the off-season, Brand and fellow rookie [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]] led the team throughout the year, especially after Kuko\u010d missed most of the season due to injury and was then dealt for a draft pick at the trading deadline. Brand recorded the first 20\u201310 average for the Bulls since the days of [[Artis Gilmore]]. He led all rookies in scoring, [[Rebound (sports)|rebounds]], blocks, field goal percentage and minutes, while Artest led all rookies in steals and finished second on the team in scoring. For his efforts Brand was named [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000]] co-[[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] with [[Houston Rockets|Houston]]'s [[Steve Francis]], and to the all-rookie first team, while Artest was named to the all-rookie second team. However, the team established a franchise low at 17\u201365, second worst in the league.\n\nAfter a summer in which the Bulls witnessed most major and minor free agents [[Tim Duncan]], [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]], [[Tracy McGrady]], [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and even [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] choose to stay with their teams (or go elsewhere) rather than sign with them, Krause signed free agent center [[Brad Miller (basketball player)|Brad Miller]] and shooting guard [[Ron Mercer]], and drafted power forward [[Marcus Fizer]] and traded draft pick Chris Mihm to Cleveland for the rights of guard [[Jamal Crawford]]. Brand again led the team in scoring and rebounds with another 20\u201310 season, but the new acquisitions failed to make a major impact, and they finished with the worst record in team history and the league's worst for the season at 15\u201367.\n\nKrause shocked Bulls fans on [[2001 NBA draft|draft day in 2001]] when he traded franchise player Brand to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for the second pick in the draft, [[Tyson Chandler]]. He also selected [[Eddy Curry]] with the fourth pick. Since both Chandler and Curry came straight out of high school, neither was expected to make much of a contribution for several years, but they were seen as potential franchise players. The team floundered without veteran leadership. At mid-season, the Bulls traded their top three scorers\u2014Mercer, [[Metta World Peace|Artest]], and [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Miller]] along with Kevin Ollie\u2014to the [[Indiana Pacers]] for veteran guard [[Jalen Rose]], [[Travis Best]] and Norman Richardson. There was also a change in coaching, with Floyd being dismissed in favor of assistant coach and former Bulls co-captain Bill Cartwright, following a series of arguments with players and management. The Bulls improved from 15 to 21 wins, although they were still tied for last in the league.\n\nFor the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]], the Bulls came to play with much optimism. They picked up college phenom [[Jay Williams (basketball)|Jay Williams]] with the second pick in [[2002 NBA draft|the draft]]. Williams teamed with Jalen Rose, Crawford, Fizer, newcomer [[Donyell Marshall]], Curry, Chandler, and guard [[Trenton Hassell]] to form a young and exciting nucleus which improved to 30\u201352 in Bill Cartwright's first full season as [[head coach]]. Curry led the league in field goal percentage, becoming the first Bull since Jordan to lead the league in a major statistical category.\n\nDuring the summer of 2003, long-time GM [[Jerry Krause]] retired, and former player and color commentator John Paxson was tapped as his successor. Jay Williams, coming off a promising rookie campaign, was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. His contract was bought out by the Bulls in February 2004 and he has yet to return to the game. Paxson selected point guard [[Kirk Hinrich]] with the seventh pick in the draft, and signed veteran free agent and former franchise player Scottie Pippen. With Pippen playing, Cartwright at the sidelines, and Paxson in the [[Front office (sports)|front office]], the Bulls hoped that some of the championship magic from before would return.\n\nHowever, the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]] was a resounding disappointment. Eddy Curry regressed, leading to questions about his conditioning and commitment. Tyson Chandler was plagued by a chronic back injury, missing more than thirty games. Pippen's ability to influence games was impaired by knee problems, and he openly contemplated retirement. Jamal Crawford remained inconsistent. Bill Cartwright was fired as head coach in December and replaced with former Phoenix coach [[Scott Skiles]]. A trade with the [[Toronto Raptors]] brought [[Antonio Davis]] and Jerome Williams in exchange for Rose and Marshall in what was seen as a major shift in team strategy from winning with athleticism to winning with hard work and defense. After struggling throughout the season, the Bulls finished with 23 wins and 59 losses, the second-worst record in the league. Fizer was not re-signed, and Crawford was re-signed and traded to the Knicks for expiring contracts. Hinrich provided the lone bright spot, becoming a fan favorite for his gritty determination and tenacious defense. He won a place on the All-Rookie first team.\n\n====2004\u20132007: Resurgence====\n[[File:Luol Deng Wizards.jpg|thumb|left|[[Luol Deng]] made his first All-Star appearance with the team in 2012 and his second in 2013.]]\nDuring the 2004 off-season, Paxson traded a [[2005 NBA draft|2005 draft pick]] to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in return for an additional pick in the [[2004 NBA draft]]. He used the picks to select [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]] guard [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] and [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] small forward [[Luol Deng]] in the first round, and Duke point guard [[Chris Duhon]] in the second. Paxson also signed free agent small forward [[Andr\u00e9s Nocioni]], who had recently won an [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] gold medal as a member of the [[Argentina national basketball team]]. After losing the first nine games of the season, the Bulls began to show signs of improvement behind their improved team defense and clutch fourth-quarter play from Gordon. The Bulls, who were 0\u20139 to start the season, finished the regular season 47\u201335, with the third-best record in the Eastern Conference and advanced to the [[2004 NBA playoffs|NBA playoffs]] for the first time since Jordan's departure. In the first round, the 4th-seeded Bulls played the Washington Wizards. Despite an injury to Deng and a heart issue with Curry, the Bulls opened the series with two wins at home, but lost the next four games and the series. After the season, Ben Gordon became the first rookie to win the [[NBA Sixth Man Award]] and the first Bull since [[Toni Kuko\u010d]] in 1996 to win the award.\n\nDuring the 2005 off-season, the Bulls re-signed free agent [[Tyson Chandler]]. However, Curry showed possible symptoms of a heart disease resulting of a heart murmur during checkups, and Paxson would not clear him to play without extensive [[DNA]] testing. Ultimately, Curry refused to participate in the tests, and he was traded along with Antonio Davis to the [[New York Knicks]] for [[Michael Sweetney]], [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]], and what became the second pick of the [[2006 NBA draft]]\u2014as well as the right to swap picks with New York in the [[2007 NBA draft]].\n\nWithout a significant post presence, the Bulls struggled for most of the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]]. However, a late-season 12\u20132 surge allowed them to finish 41\u201341 and qualify for the [[2006 NBA playoffs|2006 playoffs]] as the seventh seed. There, the Bulls faced the [[Miami Heat]]. After two close losses in Miami, the Bulls broke through with a blowout win in Game 3, and another win in Game 4. However, the Heat took the next two games to win the series and went on to win that year's championship. The Bulls' several young players nevertheless earned additional postseason experience, and Nocioni turned in a remarkable series of performances that far exceeded his season averages.\n\nIn the 2006 NBA Draft, the Bulls were awarded forward-center [[LaMarcus Aldridge]] and immediately traded him to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] for forward [[Tyrus Thomas]] and forward [[Viktor Khryapa]]. In a second draft-day trade, the Bulls selected [[Rodney Carney]] and traded him to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] for guard [[Thabo Sefolosha]]. Later that summer, four-time Defensive Player of the Year [[Ben Wallace]] signed with the Bulls for a reported four-year, $60&nbsp;million contract. Following the signing of Wallace, the Bulls traded [[Tyson Chandler]], the last remaining player of the Krause era, to the (then) [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets|New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets]] for veteran power forward [[P.J. Brown]] and [[J. R. Smith]] and salary cap space that was used to sign former Chicago co-captain [[Adrian Griffin]].\n\nIn 2006\u201307, the Bulls overcame a 3\u20139 season start to finish 49\u201333, the third-best record in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]. In the first round, the Bulls again faced [[Miami Heat|Miami]], the defending NBA champions. The Bulls narrowly won Game 1 at home, then followed it with a blowout victory in Game 2. In Miami, the Bulls rallied from a 12-point second-half deficit to win Game 3 and then posted another comeback win in Game 4. The Bulls' four-game sweep of the defending champions stunned many NBA observers. It was Chicago's first playoff series victory since 1998, Jordan's last season with the team.\n\nThe Bulls then advanced to face the [[Detroit Pistons]], marking the first time the [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]] rivals had met in the playoffs since 1991. The Pistons won the first three games including a big comeback in Game 3. No NBA team had ever come back from a 0\u20133 deficit to win the series, but the Bulls avoided a sweep by winning Game 4 by 10 points. The Bulls then easily won Game 5 in Detroit, and had a chance to make NBA history. But they lost at home in game 6 by 10, and the Pistons won the series 4\u20132 on May 17.\n\n====2007\u20132008: Missing the playoffs====\n[[File:Joakim Noah 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joakim Noah]] was drafted by the Bulls in 2007. He was named an All Star for the first time in 2013 and for the second time in 2014.]]\nDuring the off season, the Bulls signed forward [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]] and guard [[Adrian Griffin]], and drafted center [[Joakim Noah]]. However, distractions began when [[Luol Deng]] and [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] turned down contract extensions, never citing reasons. Then rumors surfaced that the Bulls were pursuing stars like [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Pau Gasol]], and most notably, [[Kobe Bryant]]. None of these deals happened, and general manager [[John Paxson]] denied a deal was ever imminent.\n\nThe Bulls started the [[2007\u201308 NBA season]] by losing 10 of their first 12 games and on December 24, 2007, after a 9\u201316 start, the Bulls fired head coach [[Scott Skiles]]. [[Jim Boylan]] was named the interim head coach on December 27, 2007.\n\nOn February 21, 2008, [[Ben Wallace]], [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]], [[Adrian Griffin]] and the Bulls' 2009 2nd round draft pick were exchanged for [[Drew Gooden]], [[Cedric Simmons]], [[Larry Hughes]] and [[Shannon Brown]] in a three-team trade deal involving the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/transactions/current_month_transactions.html |title=NBA.com: February 2008 Transactions |accessdate=February 21, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018110518/http://www.nba.com/transactions/current_month_transactions.html |archive-date=October 18, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Boylan was not retained on April 17 at the conclusion of the 2007\u201308 season after compiling a 24\u201332 record with the Bulls. The Bulls ended the 2007\u201308 campaign with a 33\u201349 record, a complete reversal of last year's record.\n\nAfter [[Jim Boylan]]'s interim tenure expired, the Bulls began the process of selecting a new head coach. They were in talks with former [[Phoenix Suns|Phoenix]] head coach [[Mike D'Antoni]], but on May 10, 2008, he signed with the [[New York Knicks]]. Other possible options included former [[Dallas Mavericks|Dallas]] head coach [[Avery Johnson]] and former Bulls head coach [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]]. Collins resigned from the coaching list on June 4, 2008, reporting that he did not want to ruin his friendship with [[Jerry Reinsdorf]].\n\nOn June 10, 2008, the Chicago Bulls G.M. [[John Paxson]] hired [[Vinny Del Negro]], with no coaching experience, to coach the young Bulls. On July 3, 2008, the ''Chicago Tribune'' reported that Del Harris agreed to become an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls along with former Charlotte Bobcats head coach [[Bernie Bickerstaff]] and longtime NBA assistant Bob Ociepka. Along with Bickerstaff and Ociepka, Harris helped establish a veteran presence on the coaching staff and helped rookie head coach Del Negro.\n\n===2008\u20132016: Derrick Rose era===\n====2008\u20132010: Derrick Rose appearance====\nWith a slim 1.7% chance of winning the rights to draft number 1, the Bulls won the 2008 [[NBA Draft Lottery]] and selected first overall. With this, the Bulls became the team with the lowest chance of winning to ever win the lottery since it was modified for the [[1994 NBA draft]], and second lowest ever. On June 26, 2008, the Bulls drafted Chicago native [[Derrick Rose]] from the [[University of Memphis]] as the number 1 draft pick. At pick number 39 they selected [[Sonny Weems]]. The Bulls later traded Weems to the [[Denver Nuggets]] for Denver's 2009 regular second round draft pick. The Bulls then acquired [[\u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k]] from the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] (selected with the 36th pick) for Denver's 2009 second round draft pick, [[New York Knicks|New York]]'s 2009 second round draft pick, and the Bulls' 2010 regular second round draft pick. The Bulls re-signed [[Luol Deng]] to a six-year $71&nbsp;million contract on July 30, 2008. He was later plagued with an injury keeping him from action for most of the [[2008\u201309 Chicago Bulls season|2008\u201309 season]]. [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] signed a one-year contract on October 2, 2008.\n\n[[File:Derrick Rose 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Derrick Rose]] was drafted first overall by the Bulls in 2008.

Afterwards, the Bulls traded veteran point guard [[Kirk Hinrich]] to the [[Washington Wizards]] to create more cap space. The Bulls also signed former [[Philadelphia 76ers|76er]] and Jazz sharpshooter [[Kyle Korver]] to a three-year, $15&nbsp;million contract. The same day that the Bulls signed Kyle Korver, they signed Turkish All-Star [[\u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k]]. After being matched by the [[Orlando Magic]] for [[JJ Redick|J. J. Redick]], they signed their third free agent from the Jazz in the off-season in shooting guard [[Ronnie Brewer]], traded for former [[Golden State Warriors|Warrior]] point guard [[C.J. Watson]], and signed former [[Milwaukee Bucks|Bucks]] power forward [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] as well as former [[San Antonio Spurs|Spurs]] player [[Keith Bogans]] and former Celtic [[Brian Scalabrine]].\n\nRose earned the 2011 NBA MVP Award, thereby becoming the youngest player in NBA history to win it. He became the first Bulls player since [[Michael Jordan]] to win the award. As a team, Chicago finished the regular season with a league-best 62\u201320 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 1998. The Bulls defeated the [[Indiana Pacers]] and the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in five and six games, respectively, thereby reaching the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 1998, and faced the [[Miami Heat]]. After winning the first game of the series, they lost the next four games, ending their season.\n\n====2011\u20132014: Injury-plagued seasons for Derrick Rose====\nDuring the off-season, the Bulls drafted [[Jimmy Butler]] 30th overall in the [[2011 NBA draft]]. After the [[2011 NBA Lockout|NBA lockout]] ended, the Bulls lost Kurt Thomas to free agency, and released Keith Bogans. The Bulls signed veteran shooting guard [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton]] to a three-year deal, after he was waived by the Detroit Pistons. The Bulls also gave MVP Derrick Rose a 5-year contract extension worth $94.8 million.\n\nDerrick Rose was voted as an NBA All-Star starter for the second consecutive year, and was the third leading voted player overall behind [[Dwight Howard]] and [[Kobe Bryant]]. Luol Deng was also selected as a reserve for the Eastern Conference. This was the first time that the Bulls had two all stars since 1997, when Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen were the duo. Derrick Rose was injured for most of the [[2011\u201312 NBA season]]; however, the team was still able to finish with a 50\u201316 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the second straight year and the best overall record in the NBA (tied with the [[San Antonio Spurs]]). Rose suffered a new injury when he tore his [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] during the 4th quarter of the first playoff game on April 28, 2012, against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and missed the rest of the series. Head coach [[Tom Thibodeau]] was criticized for keeping Rose in the game even though the Bulls were essentially minutes away from their victory over the 76ers. The Bulls lost the next three games, and also lost Noah to a foot injury after he severely rolled his ankle stepping on [[Andre Iguodala]]'s foot in Game 3; he briefly returned for part of the fourth quarter of that game, but missed the following games in the series. After winning Game 5 at home, Bulls were eliminated by the 76ers in Game 6 in Philadelphia, becoming the fifth team in NBA history to be eliminated as a first seed by an eighth seed. In Game 6, Andre Iguodala sank two free throws with 2.2 seconds left to put the 76ers up 79\u201378 after getting fouled by [[\u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k]], who had missed two free throws five seconds earlier. At the end of the season, Boozer and A\u015f\u0131k were the only members on the Bulls' roster to have played in every game, with Korver and Brewer missing one game apiece. In the off-season, the Bulls gave up Lucas to the [[Toronto Raptors]], Brewer to the [[New York Knicks]], Korver to the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Watson to the [[Brooklyn Nets]] and A\u015f\u0131k to the [[Houston Rockets]], but brought back [[Kirk Hinrich]]. In addition, they added [[Marco Belinelli]], [[Vladimir Radmanovic]], [[Nazr Mohammed]] and [[Nate Robinson]] to the roster via free agency.\n\nRose missed the entire [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]], but despite his absence, the Bulls finished 45\u201337, second in the Central Division (behind the [[Indiana Pacers]]) and 5th in their conference. They defeated the [[Brooklyn Nets]] 4\u20133 (after leading 3\u20131) in the first round of the playoffs and lost to the Miami Heat 4\u20131 in the next round.\n\nDuring the season, the Bulls snapped both Miami's 27-game winning streak and the New York Knicks' 13-game winning streak, becoming the second team in NBA history to snap two winning streaks of 13 games or more in a season.\n\nJust 10 games into the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], Derrick Rose would tear his medial meniscus on a non-contact play. He declared he would miss the remainder of the season. On January 7, 2014, veteran forward [[Luol Deng]] was traded to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] for center [[Andrew Bynum]] and a set of picks. Bynum was immediately waived after the trade went through. The Bulls would finish second in the Central Division with 48 wins, and earned home-court advantage in the first round. However, due to lack of a strong offensive weapon,\nthey failed to win a single home game en route to losing to the [[Washington Wizards]] in five games.\n\nIn the [[2014 NBA draft]], the Bulls traded their 16th and 19th picks for [[Doug McDermott]], the former [[Creighton Bluejays men's basketball|Creighton]] star and 5th leading scorer in NCAA history, who was selected with the 11th pick, and in the second round, took [[Cameron Bairstow]] with the 49th pick. That off-season, they signed [[Pau Gasol]], re-signed [[Kirk Hinrich]] and brought over Eurostar [[Nikola Miroti\u0107]], who was acquired via a draft day trade in 2011, but could not come over sooner, due to salary cap constraints.\n\n====2014\u20132015: Derrick Rose return to health====\nThe second return of [[Derrick Rose]] gave the Bulls and their fans optimism for the 2014\u201315 season. With 2-time NBA Champion [[Pau Gasol]] and a deep bench consisting of [[Taj Gibson]], [[Nikola Miroti\u0107]], [[Tony Snell (basketball)|Tony Snell]], [[Aaron Brooks (basketball)|Aaron Brooks]], [[Doug McDermott]], [[Kirk Hinrich]], among others, the Bulls were one of the two favorite teams to come out of the Eastern Conference along with the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. The Bulls started off the season in style with a blowout win of the [[New York Knicks]], and then winning 7 of their first 9 games (losses coming to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Boston Celtics]]). The emergence of [[Jimmy Butler]] as a primary scorer for the Bulls was a major surprise and he surged into the forefront of the \"[[NBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player of the Year]]\" award race. Butler's statistical jump was noted by many as one of the greatest in NBA History,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/chicago-bulls-jimmy-butler-wins-nba-most-improved-player-050715|title=Chicago Bulls' Jimmy Butler Most Improved Players|date=May 7, 2015|accessdate=May 28, 2015|work=ESPN}}</ref> going from scoring just 13 points per game in 2013\u201314 to scoring 20 points per game in 2014\u201315. Pau Gasol was considered a huge asset for the Bulls and averaged a double-double throughout the season. Both Butler and Gasol ended up making the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The Bulls' second half of the season was marred by inconsistency and frustration set in with Derrick Rose blasting the team for not being on the same page. Tension between management and [[Tom Thibodeau]] continued to be a dark cloud hanging over the organization. The Bulls finished with a 50\u201332 record and the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference. They faced the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in the first round, and took advantage of the young and inexperienced Bucks by going up a quick 3\u20130 in the series. However, inconsistency and not being on the same page yet again plagued the Bulls as the Bucks won the next two games, sending a scare to Chicago. The Bulls bounced back with fury in Game 6 however, beating the Bucks by a playoff record 54 points winning the series 4\u20132. The next round saw the Bulls facing their arch-rival [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and their biggest nemesis, [[LeBron James]], who had beaten the Bulls in all three of their previous playoff meetings. The Bulls shocked the Cavs in Game 1 dominating them and never trailing. The Cavs answered back in Game 2 in the same fashion, never trailing the entire game. In a pivotal Game 3 in Chicago, the Bulls and Cavs battled closely all the way through, but the Bulls prevailed on a last-second buzzer beating 3-pointer by [[Derrick Rose]]. In Game 4, the Cavs would answer once again, with [[LeBron James]] hitting the buzzer-beating shot to win the game. The Bulls lack of consistency and poor offensive showing doomed them once again as the Cavs won the next 2 games handily and closed out the series 4\u20132. After the series, speculation erupted about [[Tom Thibodeau]]'s job security due to escalating feud between Thibodeau and Bulls front office managers [[Gar Forman]] and [[John Paxson]].\n\n====2015\u20132016: Change in approach====\n[[File:Fred Hoiberg 2010 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fred Hoiberg]] was the 22nd head coach in the franchise's history.]]\nOn May 28, 2015, the Bulls fired Tom Thibodeau to seek a \"change in approach\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/nba/story/_/id/12968728/chicago-bulls-fire-tom-thibodeau-coach-five-seasons|title=Tom Thibodeau out in Chicago as Bulls seek 'change in approach'|first=Nick|last=Friedell|date=May 28, 2015|accessdate=May 28, 2015|work=ESPN}}</ref> The Bulls named [[Fred Hoiberg]] as their head coach on June 2, 2015.<ref name=\"BullsHoiberg\">{{cite press release|title=Bulls Name Fred Hoiberg Head Coach|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/release/bulls-name-hoiberg-head-coach|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref> The Bulls had only 1 draft pick in the [[2015 NBA draft]], and selected center [[Bobby Portis]] from the [[University of Arkansas]]. Bulls forward [[Mike Dunleavy Jr.]] was ruled out for at least the first four months of the season after completing back surgery. With Dunleavy out indefinitely, the Bulls promoted Doug McDermott to the starting lineup in his place at small forward. Before the season started, coach Fred Hoiberg made an incredibly controversial move by putting Nikola Miroti\u0107 as his starting power forward to pair with center Pau Gasol, meaning Joakim Noah, a long-time Bulls veteran and a fan-favorite was to come off the bench. Hoiberg told the media that the move was suggested by Noah himself but Noah denied having made any suggestions to Hoiberg, which sparked a distrust between the two before the season even began.\n\nThe Bulls started the 2015\u201316 season off well with an impressive season-opening 97\u201395 victory against archrivals and defending Eastern Conference Champion [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and jumped to an 8\u20133 record in the first month. The Bulls went 10\u20139 and through late November and December. The Bulls came back and won six straight games. However soon afterwards, they lost 12 of their next 17 games and Butler missed four weeks after injuring his knee. The Bulls were eliminated from playoff contention after a loss to the Miami Heat on April 7, 2016 although finishing with season with a winning record of 42\u201340. It was the first time in 8 years that the Bulls had missed the playoffs.\n\n====2016\u20132017: Derrick Rose departs====\nOn June 22, 2016, [[Derrick Rose]] and [[Justin Holiday]], along with a 2017 second round draft pick, were traded to the [[New York Knicks]] for center [[Robin Lopez]], and point guards [[Jerian Grant]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (basketball)|Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n]], who was soon traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/knicks/knicks-acquire-derrick-rose|title=Knicks Acquire Derrick Rose|work=NBA.com|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> On July 7, the Bulls announced the signing of Rose's replacement, guard [[Rajon Rondo]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Bulls Sign Rajon Rondo|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/bulls-sign-rajon-rondo/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref> On July 15, the Bulls signed Chicago native [[Dwyane Wade]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Bulls Sign Dwayne Wade|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/release/bulls-sign-dwyane-wade/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=July 15, 2016|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref> On October 17, 2016, the Bulls acquired [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|2014 Rookie of the Year]] [[Michael Carter-Williams]] in exchange for Tony Snell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bucks Acquire Tony Snell from the Bulls|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/bucks-acquire-tony-snell-bulls|website=NBA.com|accessdate=October 17, 2016|date=October 17, 2016}}</ref>\n \nOn February 23, 2017, [[Taj Gibson]] and [[Doug McDermott]], along with a 2018 second round draft pick, were traded to the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] for point guard [[Cameron Payne]], shooting guard [[Anthony Morrow]], and power forward/center [[Joffrey Lauvergne]].

The two teams met in the playoffs four consecutive years, with the Pistons winning each time until 1991. The Eastern Conference Finals in 1991 ended with a four-game sweep of the Pistons, who walked off the floor with time still on the game clock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicsportsgamesondvd.com/michaeljordan.htm |title=Michael Jordan |publisher=Classicsportsgamesondvd.com |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2012}}</ref> The rivalry was renewed in the 2007 Eastern Conference Semifinals, in which former Detroit cornerstone [[Ben Wallace]] met his former team (the Pistons won in 6 games). The geographic proximity and membership in the [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]] further intensify the rivalry, which has been characterized by intense, physical play ever since the teams met in the late 1980s. Chicago fans have been known to have a disliking for Detroit professional teams, as it was in the same division as Chicago in all four major North American sports until recently when the Red Wings moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference for the 2013\u201314 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/01/26/jimmy-butler-dwyane-wade-call-out-teammates-after-tough-loss|title=Jimmy Butler, Dwyane Wade call out teammates after tough loss - NBA.com|last=Staff|first=NBA.com|website=www.nba.com|language=en|access-date=March 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Miami Heat===\n{{Further|Bulls\u2013Heat rivalry}}\nThe Bulls and the [[Miami Heat]] rivalry began once the Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade dominated by the Bulls. They were eliminated 3 times by Chicago, who went on to win the title each time. The rivalry has come back due to the return of the Bulls to the playoffs in the post-[[Michael Jordan]] era and the emergence of [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Derrick Rose]]. The revived rivalry has been very physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players, most notably the actions of former Heat player [[James Posey]]. The Bulls and Heat met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, with the Heat winning in 5 games. On March 27, 2013, Chicago snapped Miami's 27-game winning streak. The Bulls and Heat met later that year in the 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Miami won the series 4\u20131. Since [[LeBron James]]'s departure from Miami, the Bulls-Heat rivalry has experienced a tough in comparison to the better part of the century as the Bulls chop the Heat's playoff hopes in the 2017 regular season.\n\n===New York Knicks===\n{{Further|Bulls\u2013Knicks rivalry}}\nAnother franchise that the Bulls have competed fiercely with is the [[New York Knicks]]. The two teams met in the playoffs in four consecutive years (1991\u201394) and again in 1996, with the teams' series twice (1992 and 1994) going the full seven games. Their first playoff confrontation, however, came in 1989 when both teams were called \"teams on the rise\" under [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Patrick Ewing]], respectively (rivalry that started their freshman year in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game]] with Jordan hitting the deciding jumper of the final). That first confrontation would belong to Chicago with six games of the Eastern Semifinals. The Bulls won in the first three years (1991\u201393) before losing in 1994 but got revenge in 1996. As with Detroit, the historic rivalry between the cities has led to animosity between the teams and occasionally their fans.\n\n==Traditions==\n===Starting lineup introductions===\nDuring the Bulls' run of dominance, the player introductions became world-famous. Longtime announcer [[Tommy Edwards (announcer)|Tommy Edwards]] was the first to use [[Sirius (instrumental)|\"Sirius\"]],<ref name=WSJ>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Ben|title=The One Record the Warriors Can\u2019t Take From the Bulls: Even as Golden State closes on a historic 73rd win, Chicago\u2019s pre-game music still sets the standard|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-one-record-the-warriors-cant-take-from-the-bulls-1460498500|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=April 12, 2016|accessdate=October 8, 2018}}</ref> [[On the Run (instrumental)|\"On The Run\"]] and other songs in game presentation in the NBA. When Edwards moved to Boston for employment with CBS Radio, he was replaced by [[Ray Clay]] in 1990, and Clay continued many of the traditional aspects of the Bulls introductions, including the music, [[The Alan Parsons Project]]'s \"Sirius\", for all six championship runs. The lights are first dimmed during the visiting team introduction, accompanied by \"[[The Imperial March]]\" from ''[[Star Wars]]'' composed by John Williams or \"On the Run\" by Pink Floyd, or \"Tick of the Clock\" by [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]]. Virtually all lights in the stadium are then shut off for the Bulls introduction, and a spotlight illuminates each player as he is introduced and runs onto the court; the spotlight is also focused on the Bulls logo prior to the introductions. Since the move to the United Center, lasers and fireworks have been added, and with improvements to the arena's White Way video screen, computer graphics on the stadium monitors have been added. These graphics feature the [[computer animation|3D-animated]] '[[Running of the Bulls]]' en route to the United Center, along the way smashing a bus featuring the opposing team's logo. Coincidentally, [[Alan Parsons]] wrote \"Sirius\" for his own band and was the sound engineer for \"On the Run\" from Pink Floyd's album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.\n\nTraditionally, the players have been introduced in the following order: small forward, power forward, center, point guard, shooting guard. During the championship era, Scottie Pippen was usually the first (or second after [[Horace Grant]]) Bulls player introduced, and [[Michael Jordan]] the last. (Pippen and Jordan are the only players to play on all six Bulls championship teams.) More recently with [[Derrick Rose]]'s arrival, the guards have been reversed in order, making the Chicago-bred point guard the last player introduced. <!-- more history of the evolution of the starting introduction here --> Although internal disputes eventually led to the dismissal of Clay, the Bulls in 2006 announced the return of [[Tommy Edwards (announcer)|Tommy Edwards]] as the announcer.<ref>{{cite news|title=BULLS: Tommy Edwards|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/edwards_060912.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=September 12, 2006|accessdate=August 1, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201152828/http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/edwards_060912.html|archivedate=December 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs part of Edwards' return, the introductions changed as a new introduction was developed by [[Wachowski Sisters|Lily and Lana Wachowski]], [[Ethan Stoller]] and Jamie Poindexter, all from Chicago. The introduction also included a newly composed remix of the traditional Sirius theme.\n\n===Black shoes and socks===\nThe Bulls have an unofficial tradition of wearing black shoes (regardless of being home or away) during the playoffs, which dates all the way back to [[1989 NBA playoffs|1989]] when they debuted the tradition.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ask Sam Smith: The Tribune's pro basketball reporter answers reader questions |url=http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/askthewriter/cs-070426asksamsmith,1,1025838.story?page=2&coll=cs-bulls-ask-headlines |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |date=April 26, 2007 |publisher=ChicagoSports.com}}</ref> Then-Bulls backup center [[Brad Sellers]] suggested to wear black shoes as a way to show unity within the team. \nFor the 1996 playoffs, they became the first team to wear black socks with the black shoes, similar to the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|University of Michigan]] and the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] which started the trend in college earlier in the decade. Since, many teams have this look in both the regular season and playoffs.\nIt was noted when the Bulls made their first playoff appearance during the 2004\u201305 season after a six-year hiatus, they continued the tradition and wore black shoes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bulls Take Game 1 |url=http://chicago.comcastsportsnet.com/view_content_1p.asp?ID=8033 |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |date=April 24, 2005 |publisher=ComcastSportsNet.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124525/http://chicago.comcastsportsnet.com/view_content_1p.asp?ID=8033 |archivedate=October 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEven though the Bulls generally wear black footwear in the playoffs since 1989, there have been some notable exceptions. In the [[1995 NBA playoffs|1995 playoffs]] against the Magic, when Michael Jordan debuted his [[Air Jordan#Product history|Air Jordan XI]] shoe, he wore the white colorway during the Bulls' playoff games in Orlando. He was fined by the Bulls for not complying with their colorway policy. During the [[2009 NBA playoffs|2009 playoffs]], the Bulls again broke the tradition when all of their players wore white shoes and socks in Game 3 of the first round against the Boston Celtics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tradition broken |url=http://www.blogabull.com/2009/4/24/851230/image-fanshot |accessdate=April 24, 2009 |date=April 24, 2009 |publisher=ESPN}}</ref> More recently, since the NBA's relaxation of sneaker color rules, some Bulls players wore either red or white sneakers in defiance of the tradition.\n\n===The circus trip===\nThe Bulls and their arena mates, the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], shared an odd tradition dating to the opening of Chicago Stadium. Every fall, [[Feld Entertainment]]'s now-defunct [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]] came to Chicago on its nationwide tour. Since it used large indoor venues rather than tents, it took over the United Center for its entire run and the Bulls were forced, along with the Blackhawks, to take an extended road trip that lasted around two weeks. The start of the \"circus trip\", as many sportscasters dubbed it, was noted in local newspapers, television and radio sports reports as \"the circus trip\", along with national programs like ''[[SportsCenter]]''.<ref>K.C.

Klein considered names like [[Matador]]s or [[Torero|Toreadors]], but dismissed them, saying, \"If you think about it, no team with as many as three syllables in its nickname has ever had much success except for the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Montreal Canadiens]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>.\" After discussing possible names with his family, Klein settled on ''Bulls'' when his son Mark said, \"Dad, that's a bunch of bull!\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind The Name\u2013Chicago Bulls|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/behind_the_name.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chicago Bulls wordmark.gif|thumb|right|upright|Chicago Bulls wordmark (1966\u2013present)]]\n\n===Logo===\nThe Bulls are unique in the fact they have used the same logo with very little change since the team's inception. The iconic logo is a charging red bull's face (seen at left). The logo was designed by noted American graphic designer Dean P. Wessel<ref>{{cite news|last=Hilkevitch|first=Jon|title=Logo Designer Has Reason To Horn In On Bulls' Glory|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-06-23/sports/9306230212_1_bulls-commercial-design-firm-logo|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 23, 1993|accessdate=October 8, 2018}}</ref> and was adopted in 1966. At one point, the Bulls also had an alternate logo during the early 1970s, featuring the same Bulls logo, but with a cloud that says \"Windy City\" below the bull's nose.\n\n===Uniforms===\n====1966\u201373 uniforms====\nThe Bulls currently wear three different uniforms: a white uniform, a red uniform, and a black [[third jersey|alternate]] uniform. The original uniforms were aesthetically close to what the Bulls wear today, featuring the iconic diamond surrounding the Bulls logo on the shorts and block lettering. What distinguished the original uniforms were the black drop shadows, red or white side stripes with black borders, and white lettering on the red uniforms. For the 1969\u201370 season, the red uniforms were tweaked to include the city name.<ref name=bullsuniforms>{{cite news|title=9 eye-catching Bulls jerseys over the years|url=http://history.bulls.com/9-eye-catching-bulls-jerseys-over-the-years/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=History.Bulls.com|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1973\u201385 uniforms====\nFor the 1973\u201374 season, the Bulls drastically changed their look, removing the side stripes and drop shadows while moving the front numbers to the left chest. While the white uniforms saw the \"Bulls\" wordmark go from a vertically arched to radially arched arrangement, the red uniforms saw a more significant makeover, featuring black lettering and a script \"Chicago\" wordmark. With a few tweaks in the lettering, these uniforms were used until 1985.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nThis uniform set was later revived as a throwback uniform during the 2003\u201304 and 2015\u201316 seasons.\n\n====1985\u2013present uniforms====\nStarting with the 1985\u201386 season, the Bulls updated their uniform. Among the more notable changes in the look were centered uniform numbers and a vertically arched \"Bulls\" wordmark in both the red and white uniforms. Like the previous set, this uniform saw a few tweaks particularly in the treatment of the player's name.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nWhen [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, the Bulls kept much of the same look save for the truncated shoulder striping and the addition of the [[Flag of Chicago|Chicago four stars]] on the waistline. With Nike and the NBA eliminating designations on home and away uniforms, the Bulls also announced that their red \"Icon\" uniforms would become their home uniforms, and the white \"Association\" uniforms would become their away uniforms.<ref>{{cite news|title=LOOK: Chicago Bulls unveil revamped Nike jerseys, opt to wear red for home games|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-chicago-bulls-unveil-revamped-nike-jerseys-opt-to-wear-red-for-home-games/|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=August 2, 2017|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Alternate black uniforms====\nIn the 1995\u201396 season, the Bulls added a black uniform to their set. The initial look featured red pinstripes and lacked the classic diamond on the shorts. This set was revived as throwback uniforms in the 2007\u201308 and 2012\u201313 seasons.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nFrom the 1997\u201398 to the 2005\u201306 seasons, the Bulls wore slightly modified black uniforms without pinstripes. This set, with a few slight changes in the template, also marked the return of the city name in front of the uniform during the 1999\u20132000 season.\n\nThe 2006\u201307 season saw another change in the Bulls' black alternate uniform, now resembling the red and white uniform with the addition of a red diamond in the shorts. For the 2014\u201315 season, the uniforms were tweaked a bit to include sleeves and a modernized diamond treatment in black with red and white borders.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nSince the 2017\u201318 season, the Bulls' black uniforms remained mostly untouched save for the aforementioned switch to the new Nike logo that affected the treatment towards the shoulder piping. Nike also dubbed this uniform as the \"Statement\" uniform in reference to its third jerseys. The Bulls began wearing the Statement uniforms after Thanksgiving and is currently used in away games against teams that wear their white, grey/silver or cream uniforms.\n\nThe 2019\u201320 season marked the return of pinstripes to the Bulls' \"Statement\" uniform, albeit in dark grey. In addition, the diamond treatment returned to red, piping was tweaked, and four six-point stars were featured on the beltline. The Bulls wore this \"Statement\" uniform in select home games and away games against teams wearing white, cream or silver uniforms.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chicago Bulls Introduce New Statement Edition Uniforms for 2019-20 Season|url=https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/chicago-bulls-introduce-new-statement-edition-uniforms-2019-20-season|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=October 5, 2019|accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NBA Lockervision|url=https://lockervision.nba.com/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Other uniforms====\nDuring the 2005\u201306 season, the Bulls honored the defunct [[Chicago Stags]] by wearing the team's red and blue throwback uniforms. The set featured red tops and blue shorts.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2017, the Bulls wore a green version of their red uniforms during the week of [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States|St. Patrick's Day]] in March. The only red elements visible were those found on the team logo. For 2015 the Bulls wore sleeved versions of the green uniform that featured white lettering with gold and black trim and the \"Chicago\" wordmark replacing \"Bulls in front. In 2016 and 2017, they wore the same uniforms minus the sleeves.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2017, the Bulls wore a variation of their red uniforms as part of the NBA's \"Noche Latina\" festivities every March. The only notable change in this uniform was the \"Los Bulls\" wordmark in front. For 2014, the Bulls briefly retired the look in favor of a black sleeved uniform featuring \"Los Bulls\" in white with red trim.\n\nDuring the NBA's \"Green Week\" celebrations, the Bulls also wore green uniforms, but with a slightly darker shade from their St. Patrick's Day counterparts. They used their black alternate uniforms as its template. They donned the uniforms in a game against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] on April 9, 2009.\n\nThe Bulls also wore special edition Christmas uniforms as part of the [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|NBA's Christmas Day games]]. The one-off Christmas uniforms were as follows:\n*2012: Monochrome red uniforms with lettering in red with black trim.\n*2013: Sleeved red uniforms with Bulls logo rendered in silver.\n*2014: Modified version of red uniform featuring the Bulls logo in front and a contrasting white nameplate of the player's first name. \n*2015: Red uniforms with ornate script letters in cream.\n*2016: Monochrome red uniforms with ornate script letters in black.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, the Bulls wore a grey \"Pride\" sleeved uniform, featuring the team name and other lettering in red with white trim. The shorts featured a more modernized version of the diamond, along with four six-pointed stars on either side.\n\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, the Bulls wore special \"City\" uniforms designed by Nike. The uniforms, designed to pay homage to Chicago's flag, are in white and feature the classic \"Chicago\" script and numbers in red with light blue trim along with four six-pointed stars on each side.\n\nThe Bulls' 2018\u201319 \"City\" uniform is once again inspired from Chicago's flag, with a black base and a portion of the flag with four red six-point stars and two powder blue stripes in front.\n\nThe Bulls' \"City\" uniform for 2019\u201320 continued the flag theme, featuring a light blue base and a recolored Bulls logo in front. The predominantly blue uniform was also inspired from the waters of [[Lake Michigan]] and the [[Chicago River]].\n\n==Mascots==\n[[File:20180206 UM-NW Benny The Bull 7DM27126.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benny the Bull]] in February 2018]]\n{{See also|Benny the Bull}}\n[[Benny the Bull]] is the main mascot of the Chicago Bulls. He was first introduced in 1969. Benny is a red bull who wears number 1. Benny is one of the oldest and best known mascots in all of professional sports. The Bulls also had another mascot named Da Bull. Introduced in 1995, he was described on the team website as being the high flying cousin of Benny, known for his dunking skills. The man who portrayed Da Bull was arrested in 2004 for possession and selling marijuana from his car.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=ratto_ray&id=1715534 |title=The Mascots' stigmata |accessdate=January 29, 2012 |work=ESPN}}</ref> Da Bull was retired soon after the incident. While Benny has a family-friendly design, Da Bull was designed as a more realistic bull. Unlike Benny, Da Bull was brown. He also had a meaner facial expression and wore number 95.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the Bulls.

They are known for having one of the NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six [[List of NBA champions|NBA championships]] between 1991 and 1998 with two [[three-peat]]s.

The Bulls' founder, [[Dick Klein (basketball)|Dick Klein]], was the Bulls' only owner to ever play professional basketball (for the [[Chicago American Gears]]). He served as the Bulls' president and general manager in their initial years.\n\nAfter the [[1966 NBA Expansion Draft]], the newly founded Chicago Bulls were allowed to acquire players from the previously established teams in the league for the upcoming 1966\u201367 season. The team started in the [[1966\u201367 NBA season]], and posted a 33\u201348 record, the best by an expansion team in NBA history. Coached by Chicagoan and former NBA star [[Johnny \"Red\" Kerr]], and led by former NBA assist leader [[Guy Rodgers]], guard [[Jerry Sloan]] and forward [[Bob Boozer]], the Bulls qualified for the playoffs, the only NBA team to do so in their inaugural season.\n\n===1966\u20131975: Early success===\n[[File:Chicago bulls 1969-70 team.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The 1969\u201370 Chicago Bulls]]\nIn their first season, the Bulls played their home games at the [[International Amphitheatre]], before moving to [[Chicago Stadium]].\n\nFan interest was diminishing after four seasons, with one game in the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1968 season]] having an official attendance of 891 and some games being played in [[Kansas City]]. In 1969, Klein dropped out of the general manager job and hired [[Pat Williams (basketball)|Pat Williams]], who as the [[Philadelphia 76ers]]' business manager created promotions that helped the team become third in attendance the previous season. Williams revamped the team roster, acquiring [[Chet Walker]] from his old team in exchange for [[Jim Washington]] and drafting [[Norm Van Lier]] \u2013 who was traded to the [[Cincinnati Royals]] and only joined the Bulls in 1971 \u2013 while also investing in promotion, with actions such as creating mascot [[Benny the Bull]]. The Bulls under Williams and head coach [[Dick Motta]] qualified for four straight playoffs and had attendances grow to over 10,000.<ref name=pat>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Sam|title=Pat Williams Helped Save Pro Basketball in Chicago|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/pat-williams-helped-save-pro-basketball-chicago.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=September 1, 2012|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref> In 1972, the Bulls set a franchise win-loss record at 57 wins and 25 losses. During the 1970s, the Bulls relied on [[Jerry Sloan]], forwards [[Bob Love]] and [[Chet Walker]], point guard [[Norm Van Lier]], and centers [[Clifford Ray]] and [[Tom Boerwinkle]]. The team made the conference finals in 1975 but lost to the eventual champions, the [[Golden State Warriors]], 4 games to 3.\n\nAfter four 50-win seasons, Williams returned to Philadelphia, and Motta decided to take on the role of GM as well. The Bulls ended up declining, winning only 24 games in the 1975\u201376 season. Motta was fired and replaced by [[Ed Badger]].<ref name=pat/>\n\n===1976\u20131984: Gilmore and Theus===\n[[File:Artis Gilmore 1977.jpeg|thumb|left|175px|Gilmore in 1977]]\nKlein sold the Bulls to the Wirtz Family, longtime owners of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. Indifferent to NBA basketball, the new ownership group infamously implemented a shoestring budget, putting little time and investment into improving the team.\n\n[[Artis Gilmore]], acquired in the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] dispersal draft in 1976, led a Bulls squad which included guard [[Reggie Theus]], forward [[David Greenwood]] and forward [[Orlando Woolridge]].\n\nIn 1979, the Bulls lost a coin flip for the right to select first in the NBA draft ([[Rod Thorn]], the Bulls' General Manager, called \"heads\"). Had the Bulls won the toss, they would have selected [[Magic Johnson]]; instead, they selected [[David Greenwood]] with the second pick. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] selected Johnson with the pick acquired from the [[New Orleans Jazz (NBA team)|New Orleans Jazz]], who traded the selection for [[Gail Goodrich]].\n\nAfter Gilmore was traded to the San Antonio Spurs for center [[Dave Corzine]], the Bulls employed a high-powered offense centered around Theus, and which soon included guards [[Quintin Dailey]] and [[Ennis Whatley]]. However, with continued dismal results, the Bulls decided to change direction, trading Theus to the [[Kansas City Kings]] during the [[1983\u201384 NBA season|1983\u201384 season]]. Attendance began to dwindle, with the Wirtz Family looking to sell to ownership groups interested in moving the team out of Chicago, before selling to local ownership.\n\n===1984\u20131998: The Michael Jordan era===\n[[File:Jordan by Lipofsky 16577.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michael Jordan]] was drafted third overall by the Bulls in [[1984 NBA draft|1984]]. He won six championships and six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP]]s for Chicago.]]\nIn the summer of 1984, the Bulls had the third pick of the [[1984 NBA draft]], after Houston and Portland. The [[Houston Rockets|Rockets]] selected [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], the [[Portland Trail Blazers|Blazers]] picked [[Sam Bowie]] and the Bulls chose shooting guard [[Michael Jordan]]. The team, with new management in owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] and general manager [[Jerry Krause]], decided to rebuild around Jordan. Jordan set franchise records during his rookie campaign for scoring (third in the league) and steals (fourth), and led the Bulls back to [[1985 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they lost in four games to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nIn the following off-season, the team acquired point guard [[John Paxson]] and on draft day traded with the Cavaliers for the rights to power forward [[Charles Oakley]]. Along with Jordan and center [[Dave Corzine]], they provided much of the Bulls' offense for the next two years. After suffering a broken foot early in the [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386 season]], Jordan finished second on the team to Woolridge in scoring. Jordan returned for [[1986 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], and led the eighth-place Bulls against the 67\u201315 [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]]. At the time, the Bulls had the fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.<ref>{{cite news|title=Worst Records of Playoff Teams|date=April 28, 1986|first=|last=|newspaper=[[The Sporting News]]|page=46}}</ref> Though the Bulls were swept, Jordan recorded a playoff single-game record 63 points in Game 2 (which still stands to this day), prompting Bird to call him 'God disguised as Michael Jordan.'\n\nIn the [[1986\u201387 NBA season]], Jordan continued his assault on the record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team. The Bulls finished 40\u201342, which was good enough to qualify them for the playoffs. However, they were again swept by the Celtics in [[1987 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]]. In the [[1987 NBA draft|1987 draft]], to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center [[Olden Polynice]] eighth overall and power forward [[Horace Grant]] 10th overall, then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, [[small forward]] [[Scottie Pippen]]. With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt, [[Brad Sellers]] and Oakley at the forward spots, Corzine anchoring center, and [[rookie]]s Pippen and Grant coming off the bench, the Bulls won 50 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, where they were beaten by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions [[Detroit Pistons]] in five games. For his efforts, Jordan was named NBA [[Most Valuable Player]], an award he would win four more times over his career. The 1987\u201388 season would also mark the start of the Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 to 1991.\n\nThe [[1988\u201389 NBA season|1988\u201389 season]] marked a second straight year of major off-season moves. Power forward [[Charles Oakley]], who had led the league in total rebounds in both 1987 and 1988, was traded on the eve of the [[1988 NBA draft]] to the [[New York Knicks]] along with a first round draft pick used by the Knicks to select [[Rod Strickland]] for center [[Bill Cartwright]] and a first round pick, which the Bulls used to obtain center [[Will Perdue]]. In addition, the Bulls acquired three-point shooter [[Craig Hodges]] from Phoenix. The new starting lineup of Paxson, Jordan, Pippen, Grant, and Cartwright took some time to mesh, winning fewer games than the previous season, but made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the NBA champion Pistons.\n\nIn [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390]], Jordan led the league in scoring for the fourth straight season and was joined on the all-star squad for the first time by Pippen. There was also a major change during the off-season, where head coach [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] was replaced by assistant coach [[Phil Jackson]]. The Bulls also picked up rookie center [[Stacey King]] and rookie point guard [[B. J. Armstrong]] in the [[1989 NBA draft|1989 draft]]. With these additional players and the previous year's starting five, the Bulls again made it to the Conference Finals and pushed the Pistons to seven games before being eliminated for the third straight year, the Pistons going on to repeat as NBA champions.\n\n====1991\u20131993: First championship three-peat====\n[[File:Jordan vs lakers nba finals 1991.jpg|thumb|160px|Michael Jordan v [[Los Angeles Lakers]] at the [[1991 NBA Finals]]]]\nIn the [[1990\u201391 NBA season|1990\u201391 season]], the Bulls recorded a then-franchise record 61 wins, and romped through [[1991 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they swept the Knicks in the first round, defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the semifinals, then eliminated defending champion Pistons in the Conference Finals and won the [[1991 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] in five games over the [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nThe Bulls won their second straight title in {{nbafy|1992}} after racking up another franchise record for wins with 67. They swept the [[Miami Heat]] in the first round, the Knicks in seven games in the second round, then the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in six games in the Eastern Conference to the [[1992 NBA Finals|Finals]] for the second year in a row where they defeated the [[Clyde Drexler]]-led [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in six games.\n\nIn {{nbafy|1993}}, the Bulls won their third consecutive championship by defeating the [[Atlanta Hawks]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[New York Knicks]] in the first three rounds of the playoffs and then defeating regular season MVP [[Charles Barkley]] and the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the Finals, with Paxson's three-pointer with 3.9 seconds left giving them a 99\u201398 victory in Game 6 in Phoenix.\n\n====1993\u20131995: Jordan's first retirement====\n[[File:United Center 060716.jpg|thumb|[[United Center]]]]\nOn October 6, 1993, [[Michael Jordan]] shocked the basketball community by announcing his retirement, three months after his [[James R. Jordan, Sr.|father's murder]]. The Bulls were then led by [[Scottie Pippen]], who established himself as one of the top players in the league by winning the [[1994 NBA All-Star Game|1994 All-Star]] MVP. He received help from [[Horace Grant]] and [[B. J. Armstrong]], who were named to their first all-star games. The three were assisted by [[Bill Cartwright|Cartwright]], [[Will Perdue|Perdue]], shooting guard [[Pete Myers]], and [[Croats|Croatian]] rookie forward [[Toni Kuko\u010d]]. Despite the Bulls winning 55 games during the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]], they were beaten in seven games by the Knicks in the second round of [[1994 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], after a controversial foul call by referee [[Hue Hollins]] in game 5 of that series. The Knicks eventually reached the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] that year, but lost to the [[Houston Rockets]]. The Bulls opened the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]] by leaving their home of 27 years, [[Chicago Stadium]], and moving into their current home, the [[United Center]].\n\nIn 1994, the Bulls lost Grant, Cartwright and [[Scott Williams (basketball)|Scott Williams]] to free agency, and [[John Paxson]] to retirement, but picked up shooting guard [[Ron Harper]], the seeming heir apparent to Jordan in assistant coach [[Tex Winter]]'s triple-post offense, and small-forward [[Jud Buechler]]. The Bulls started Armstrong and Harper in the backcourt, Pippen and Kuko\u010d at the forward spots, and Perdue at center. They also had sharpshooter [[Steve Kerr]], whom they acquired via free agency before the 1993\u201394 season, Myers, and centers [[Luc Longley]] (acquired via trade in 1994 from the Minnesota Timberwolves) and [[Bill Wennington]]. However, they were struggling during the season, on March 18, 1995, they received the news that Michael Jordan was coming out of retirement. He scored 55 points against the Knicks in only his fifth game back, and led the Bulls to the fifth seed in [[1995 NBA playoffs|the playoffs]], where they defeated the Charlotte Hornets. However, Jordan and the Bulls were unable to overcome the eventual Eastern Conference champion [[Orlando Magic]], which included [[Horace Grant]], [[Anfernee Hardaway]], and [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. When Jordan returned to the Bulls, he initially wore No. 45 (which was his number while playing for the [[Birmingham Barons]], a [[minor league baseball|minor-league]] affiliate of the [[Chicago White Sox]]). He chose the No. 45 because his older brother Larry wore that number in high school. Michael wanted to be half as good as his brother so he chose 23 which is half of 45 (22.5) rounded up. However, Jordan switched back to the familiar 23 before game 2 of the Orlando Magic series.\n\nIn the off-season, the Bulls lost Armstrong in the expansion draft, and Krause traded Perdue to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for rebounding specialist [[Dennis Rodman]], who had won the past four rebounding titles, and who had also been a member of the [[Detroit Pistons]]' \"Bad Boys\" squad that served as the Bulls' chief nemesis in the late 1980s.\n\n====1995\u20131998: Second championship three-peat====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width =\n| image1 = Jordan Lipofsky.jpg\n| width1 = 136\n| caption1 = [[Michael Jordan]]\n| image2 = Lipofsky Pippen.jpg\n| width2 = 151\n| caption2 = [[Scottie Pippen]]\n| image3 = \n| width3 = 130\n| caption3 = [[Dennis Rodman]]\n}}\nWith a lineup of Harper, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman and Longley, and perhaps the league's best bench in [[Steve Kerr]], Kuko\u010d, Wennington, Buechler, and guard [[Randy Brown]], the Bulls were seen as the team to win again for the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Bulls started their 1995\u201396 campaign with a 105\u201391 win over the visiting Hornets.

Scottie Pippen was looking for a significant contract extension that he thought he deserved, but was not getting from the organization. In spite of the turmoil that surrounded the Bulls, they still had a remarkable season, with a final regular season record of 62\u201320. Jordan would be named the league MVP for the fifth and final time, and the Bulls went into the playoffs as the number one seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe first round of the playoffs for the Bulls was against the [[New Jersey Nets]], a team led by [[Keith Van Horn]], [[Kendall Gill]] and [[Sam Cassell]]. The Bulls swept the Nets three to nothing in a best of five series. The conference semi-finals were more challenging with the [[Charlotte Hornets]] stealing game two from the Bulls at the United Center, and tying the series 1\u20131. But the Bulls easily defeated the Hornets in the next three games of the series. The Conference Finals was a challenge for the Bulls as they went up against the [[Reggie Miller]]-led [[Indiana Pacers]]. Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best chance to defeat the Bulls.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The Pacers gave the Bulls no road wins, winning games 3, 4, and 6, sending the series to a deciding game seven at the United Center. The Bulls prevailed and beat the Pacers 88\u201383, winning their 6th Eastern Conference Championship.\n\nIn a much anticipated Finals, The Bulls faced the team they beat the previous year, the [[Utah Jazz]]. Led by [[Karl Malone]] and [[John Stockton]], the Jazz felt confident that they could defeat the Bulls, winning game one at Utah's Delta Center. Facing a potential two to nothing deficit, the Bulls won Game 2 at the Delta Center and tied the series. The Bulls returned to the United Center and, by winning the next two games, took a 3\u20131 series lead. The Jazz won Game 5 by two points, 83\u201381. Game 6 was a tough battle for both teams, as the Jazz had a lead late in the game. Down by three points to the Jazz, Michael Jordan led the Bulls to one final win. Jordan hit a shot to bring the Bulls within 1, then stole the ball from Karl Malone and hit [[The Last Shot (basketball)|the game winning shot]] with 5.2 seconds remaining on the clock. With a score of 87\u201386, John Stockton put up a three-pointer, but missed, giving the Bulls their sixth championship in eight years. Jordan would be named the Finals MVP for the sixth time in his career. He retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.\n\n===1998\u20132008: Post-Dynasty struggles===\nThe summer of 1998 brought an abrupt end to the championship era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/schedule/results_1998.html|title=Bulls Schedule 1998\u201399|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|accessdate=August 1, 2009}}</ref> Krause felt that the Bulls were on the verge of being too old and unable to compete. He decided that the team's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow decline. His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft picks while clearing salary cap space to make a run at several promising free agents in two years' time. After having been vetoed in a previous attempt by owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], Krause traded [[Scottie Pippen]] for [[Roy Rogers (basketball)|Roy Rogers]] (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. He also decided not to re-sign [[Dennis Rodman]], and traded [[Luc Longley]] and [[Steve Kerr]] for other draft picks. He hired a new coach, [[Tim Floyd]], who had run a successful program at [[Iowa State University]]. Upon Phil Jackson's departure, Michael Jordan made his second retirement official. With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy Brown, shooting guard [[Ron Harper]], newcomer [[Brent Barry]] at small forward, power forward Toni Kuko\u010d, and center Bill Wennington, the team began the [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]]-shortened [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]]. Kuko\u010d led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists, but the team won only 13 of 50 games. The lowest point of the season came on April 10 in a game against the Miami Heat. In that game, the Bulls scored 49 points to set an NBA record for the fewest points in a game in the shot clock era.\n\nThe previous year's dismal finish came with one highlight: the team won the draft lottery and the rights to power forward [[Elton Brand]]. Since the team lost Harper, Wennington and Barry in the off-season, Brand and fellow rookie [[Metta World Peace|Ron Artest]] led the team throughout the year, especially after Kuko\u010d missed most of the season due to injury and was then dealt for a draft pick at the trading deadline. Brand recorded the first 20\u201310 average for the Bulls since the days of [[Artis Gilmore]]. He led all rookies in scoring, [[Rebound (sports)|rebounds]], blocks, field goal percentage and minutes, while Artest led all rookies in steals and finished second on the team in scoring. For his efforts Brand was named [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|1999\u20132000]] co-[[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] with [[Houston Rockets|Houston]]'s [[Steve Francis]], and to the all-rookie first team, while Artest was named to the all-rookie second team. However, the team established a franchise low at 17\u201365, second worst in the league.\n\nAfter a summer in which the Bulls witnessed most major and minor free agents [[Tim Duncan]], [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]], [[Tracy McGrady]], [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]] and even [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] choose to stay with their teams (or go elsewhere) rather than sign with them, Krause signed free agent center [[Brad Miller (basketball player)|Brad Miller]] and shooting guard [[Ron Mercer]], and drafted power forward [[Marcus Fizer]] and traded draft pick Chris Mihm to Cleveland for the rights of guard [[Jamal Crawford]]. Brand again led the team in scoring and rebounds with another 20\u201310 season, but the new acquisitions failed to make a major impact, and they finished with the worst record in team history and the league's worst for the season at 15\u201367.\n\nKrause shocked Bulls fans on [[2001 NBA draft|draft day in 2001]] when he traded franchise player Brand to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] for the second pick in the draft, [[Tyson Chandler]]. He also selected [[Eddy Curry]] with the fourth pick. Since both Chandler and Curry came straight out of high school, neither was expected to make much of a contribution for several years, but they were seen as potential franchise players. The team floundered without veteran leadership. At mid-season, the Bulls traded their top three scorers\u2014Mercer, [[Metta World Peace|Artest]], and [[Brad Miller (basketball)|Miller]] along with Kevin Ollie\u2014to the [[Indiana Pacers]] for veteran guard [[Jalen Rose]], [[Travis Best]] and Norman Richardson. There was also a change in coaching, with Floyd being dismissed in favor of assistant coach and former Bulls co-captain Bill Cartwright, following a series of arguments with players and management. The Bulls improved from 15 to 21 wins, although they were still tied for last in the league.\n\nFor the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]], the Bulls came to play with much optimism. They picked up college phenom [[Jay Williams (basketball)|Jay Williams]] with the second pick in [[2002 NBA draft|the draft]]. Williams teamed with Jalen Rose, Crawford, Fizer, newcomer [[Donyell Marshall]], Curry, Chandler, and guard [[Trenton Hassell]] to form a young and exciting nucleus which improved to 30\u201352 in Bill Cartwright's first full season as [[head coach]]. Curry led the league in field goal percentage, becoming the first Bull since Jordan to lead the league in a major statistical category.\n\nDuring the summer of 2003, long-time GM [[Jerry Krause]] retired, and former player and color commentator John Paxson was tapped as his successor. Jay Williams, coming off a promising rookie campaign, was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. His contract was bought out by the Bulls in February 2004 and he has yet to return to the game. Paxson selected point guard [[Kirk Hinrich]] with the seventh pick in the draft, and signed veteran free agent and former franchise player Scottie Pippen. With Pippen playing, Cartwright at the sidelines, and Paxson in the [[Front office (sports)|front office]], the Bulls hoped that some of the championship magic from before would return.\n\nHowever, the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]] was a resounding disappointment. Eddy Curry regressed, leading to questions about his conditioning and commitment. Tyson Chandler was plagued by a chronic back injury, missing more than thirty games. Pippen's ability to influence games was impaired by knee problems, and he openly contemplated retirement. Jamal Crawford remained inconsistent. Bill Cartwright was fired as head coach in December and replaced with former Phoenix coach [[Scott Skiles]]. A trade with the [[Toronto Raptors]] brought [[Antonio Davis]] and Jerome Williams in exchange for Rose and Marshall in what was seen as a major shift in team strategy from winning with athleticism to winning with hard work and defense. After struggling throughout the season, the Bulls finished with 23 wins and 59 losses, the second-worst record in the league. Fizer was not re-signed, and Crawford was re-signed and traded to the Knicks for expiring contracts. Hinrich provided the lone bright spot, becoming a fan favorite for his gritty determination and tenacious defense. He won a place on the All-Rookie first team.\n\n====2004\u20132007: Resurgence====\n[[File:Luol Deng Wizards.jpg|thumb|left|[[Luol Deng]] made his first All-Star appearance with the team in 2012 and his second in 2013.]]\nDuring the 2004 off-season, Paxson traded a [[2005 NBA draft|2005 draft pick]] to the [[Phoenix Suns]] in return for an additional pick in the [[2004 NBA draft]]. He used the picks to select [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]] guard [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] and [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] small forward [[Luol Deng]] in the first round, and Duke point guard [[Chris Duhon]] in the second. Paxson also signed free agent small forward [[Andr\u00e9s Nocioni]], who had recently won an [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] gold medal as a member of the [[Argentina national basketball team]]. After losing the first nine games of the season, the Bulls began to show signs of improvement behind their improved team defense and clutch fourth-quarter play from Gordon. The Bulls, who were 0\u20139 to start the season, finished the regular season 47\u201335, with the third-best record in the Eastern Conference and advanced to the [[2004 NBA playoffs|NBA playoffs]] for the first time since Jordan's departure. In the first round, the 4th-seeded Bulls played the Washington Wizards. Despite an injury to Deng and a heart issue with Curry, the Bulls opened the series with two wins at home, but lost the next four games and the series. After the season, Ben Gordon became the first rookie to win the [[NBA Sixth Man Award]] and the first Bull since [[Toni Kuko\u010d]] in 1996 to win the award.\n\nDuring the 2005 off-season, the Bulls re-signed free agent [[Tyson Chandler]]. However, Curry showed possible symptoms of a heart disease resulting of a heart murmur during checkups, and Paxson would not clear him to play without extensive [[DNA]] testing. Ultimately, Curry refused to participate in the tests, and he was traded along with Antonio Davis to the [[New York Knicks]] for [[Michael Sweetney]], [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]], and what became the second pick of the [[2006 NBA draft]]\u2014as well as the right to swap picks with New York in the [[2007 NBA draft]].\n\nWithout a significant post presence, the Bulls struggled for most of the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306 season]]. However, a late-season 12\u20132 surge allowed them to finish 41\u201341 and qualify for the [[2006 NBA playoffs|2006 playoffs]] as the seventh seed. There, the Bulls faced the [[Miami Heat]]. After two close losses in Miami, the Bulls broke through with a blowout win in Game 3, and another win in Game 4. However, the Heat took the next two games to win the series and went on to win that year's championship. The Bulls' several young players nevertheless earned additional postseason experience, and Nocioni turned in a remarkable series of performances that far exceeded his season averages.\n\nIn the 2006 NBA Draft, the Bulls were awarded forward-center [[LaMarcus Aldridge]] and immediately traded him to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] for forward [[Tyrus Thomas]] and forward [[Viktor Khryapa]]. In a second draft-day trade, the Bulls selected [[Rodney Carney]] and traded him to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] for guard [[Thabo Sefolosha]]. Later that summer, four-time Defensive Player of the Year [[Ben Wallace]] signed with the Bulls for a reported four-year, $60&nbsp;million contract. Following the signing of Wallace, the Bulls traded [[Tyson Chandler]], the last remaining player of the Krause era, to the (then) [[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Hornets|New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets]] for veteran power forward [[P.J. Brown]] and [[J. R. Smith]] and salary cap space that was used to sign former Chicago co-captain [[Adrian Griffin]].\n\nIn 2006\u201307, the Bulls overcame a 3\u20139 season start to finish 49\u201333, the third-best record in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]. In the first round, the Bulls again faced [[Miami Heat|Miami]], the defending NBA champions. The Bulls narrowly won Game 1 at home, then followed it with a blowout victory in Game 2. In Miami, the Bulls rallied from a 12-point second-half deficit to win Game 3 and then posted another comeback win in Game 4. The Bulls' four-game sweep of the defending champions stunned many NBA observers. It was Chicago's first playoff series victory since 1998, Jordan's last season with the team.\n\nThe Bulls then advanced to face the [[Detroit Pistons]], marking the first time the [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]] rivals had met in the playoffs since 1991. The Pistons won the first three games including a big comeback in Game 3. No NBA team had ever come back from a 0\u20133 deficit to win the series, but the Bulls avoided a sweep by winning Game 4 by 10 points. The Bulls then easily won Game 5 in Detroit, and had a chance to make NBA history. But they lost at home in game 6 by 10, and the Pistons won the series 4\u20132 on May 17.\n\n====2007\u20132008: Missing the playoffs====\n[[File:Joakim Noah 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joakim Noah]] was drafted by the Bulls in 2007. He was named an All Star for the first time in 2013 and for the second time in 2014.]]\nDuring the off season, the Bulls signed forward [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]] and guard [[Adrian Griffin]], and drafted center [[Joakim Noah]]. However, distractions began when [[Luol Deng]] and [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] turned down contract extensions, never citing reasons. Then rumors surfaced that the Bulls were pursuing stars like [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Pau Gasol]], and most notably, [[Kobe Bryant]]. None of these deals happened, and general manager [[John Paxson]] denied a deal was ever imminent.\n\nThe Bulls started the [[2007\u201308 NBA season]] by losing 10 of their first 12 games and on December 24, 2007, after a 9\u201316 start, the Bulls fired head coach [[Scott Skiles]]. [[Jim Boylan]] was named the interim head coach on December 27, 2007.\n\nOn February 21, 2008, [[Ben Wallace]], [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]], [[Adrian Griffin]] and the Bulls' 2009 2nd round draft pick were exchanged for [[Drew Gooden]], [[Cedric Simmons]], [[Larry Hughes]] and [[Shannon Brown]] in a three-team trade deal involving the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and the [[Seattle SuperSonics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/transactions/current_month_transactions.html |title=NBA.com: February 2008 Transactions |accessdate=February 21, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018110518/http://www.nba.com/transactions/current_month_transactions.html |archive-date=October 18, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Boylan was not retained on April 17 at the conclusion of the 2007\u201308 season after compiling a 24\u201332 record with the Bulls. The Bulls ended the 2007\u201308 campaign with a 33\u201349 record, a complete reversal of last year's record.\n\nAfter [[Jim Boylan]]'s interim tenure expired, the Bulls began the process of selecting a new head coach. They were in talks with former [[Phoenix Suns|Phoenix]] head coach [[Mike D'Antoni]], but on May 10, 2008, he signed with the [[New York Knicks]]. Other possible options included former [[Dallas Mavericks|Dallas]] head coach [[Avery Johnson]] and former Bulls head coach [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]]. Collins resigned from the coaching list on June 4, 2008, reporting that he did not want to ruin his friendship with [[Jerry Reinsdorf]].\n\nOn June 10, 2008, the Chicago Bulls G.M. [[John Paxson]] hired [[Vinny Del Negro]], with no coaching experience, to coach the young Bulls. On July 3, 2008, the ''Chicago Tribune'' reported that Del Harris agreed to become an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls along with former Charlotte Bobcats head coach [[Bernie Bickerstaff]] and longtime NBA assistant Bob Ociepka. Along with Bickerstaff and Ociepka, Harris helped establish a veteran presence on the coaching staff and helped rookie head coach Del Negro.\n\n===2008\u20132016: Derrick Rose era===\n====2008\u20132010: Derrick Rose appearance====\nWith a slim 1.7% chance of winning the rights to draft number 1, the Bulls won the 2008 [[NBA Draft Lottery]] and selected first overall. With this, the Bulls became the team with the lowest chance of winning to ever win the lottery since it was modified for the [[1994 NBA draft]], and second lowest ever. On June 26, 2008, the Bulls drafted Chicago native [[Derrick Rose]] from the [[University of Memphis]] as the number 1 draft pick. At pick number 39 they selected [[Sonny Weems]]. The Bulls later traded Weems to the [[Denver Nuggets]] for Denver's 2009 regular second round draft pick. The Bulls then acquired [[\u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k]] from the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] (selected with the 36th pick) for Denver's 2009 second round draft pick, [[New York Knicks|New York]]'s 2009 second round draft pick, and the Bulls' 2010 regular second round draft pick. The Bulls re-signed [[Luol Deng]] to a six-year $71&nbsp;million contract on July 30, 2008. He was later plagued with an injury keeping him from action for most of the [[2008\u201309 Chicago Bulls season|2008\u201309 season]]. [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]] signed a one-year contract on October 2, 2008.\n\n[[File:Derrick Rose 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Derrick Rose]] was drafted first overall by the Bulls in 2008.

In Game 1, [[Derrick Rose]] scored 36 points, along with 11 assists, tying [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]'s record for most points scored by a rookie in a playoff debut.

On April 14, 2010, the Bulls clinched the playoffs with the number 8 seed.

Afterwards, the Bulls traded veteran point guard [[Kirk Hinrich]] to the [[Washington Wizards]] to create more cap space. The Bulls also signed former [[Philadelphia 76ers|76er]] and Jazz sharpshooter [[Kyle Korver]] to a three-year, $15&nbsp;million contract. The same day that the Bulls signed Kyle Korver, they signed Turkish All-Star [[\u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k]]. After being matched by the [[Orlando Magic]] for [[JJ Redick|J. J. Redick]], they signed their third free agent from the Jazz in the off-season in shooting guard [[Ronnie Brewer]], traded for former [[Golden State Warriors|Warrior]] point guard [[C.J. Watson]], and signed former [[Milwaukee Bucks|Bucks]] power forward [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] as well as former [[San Antonio Spurs|Spurs]] player [[Keith Bogans]] and former Celtic [[Brian Scalabrine]].\n\nRose earned the 2011 NBA MVP Award, thereby becoming the youngest player in NBA history to win it. He became the first Bulls player since [[Michael Jordan]] to win the award. As a team, Chicago finished the regular season with a league-best 62\u201320 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 1998. The Bulls defeated the [[Indiana Pacers]] and the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in five and six games, respectively, thereby reaching the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 1998, and faced the [[Miami Heat]]. After winning the first game of the series, they lost the next four games, ending their season.\n\n====2011\u20132014: Injury-plagued seasons for Derrick Rose====\nDuring the off-season, the Bulls drafted [[Jimmy Butler]] 30th overall in the [[2011 NBA draft]]. After the [[2011 NBA Lockout|NBA lockout]] ended, the Bulls lost Kurt Thomas to free agency, and released Keith Bogans. The Bulls signed veteran shooting guard [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton]] to a three-year deal, after he was waived by the Detroit Pistons. The Bulls also gave MVP Derrick Rose a 5-year contract extension worth $94.8 million.\n\nDerrick Rose was voted as an NBA All-Star starter for the second consecutive year, and was the third leading voted player overall behind [[Dwight Howard]] and [[Kobe Bryant]]. Luol Deng was also selected as a reserve for the Eastern Conference. This was the first time that the Bulls had two all stars since 1997, when Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen were the duo. Derrick Rose was injured for most of the [[2011\u201312 NBA season]]; however, the team was still able to finish with a 50\u201316 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the second straight year and the best overall record in the NBA (tied with the [[San Antonio Spurs]]). Rose suffered a new injury when he tore his [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] during the 4th quarter of the first playoff game on April 28, 2012, against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and missed the rest of the series. Head coach [[Tom Thibodeau]] was criticized for keeping Rose in the game even though the Bulls were essentially minutes away from their victory over the 76ers. The Bulls lost the next three games, and also lost Noah to a foot injury after he severely rolled his ankle stepping on [[Andre Iguodala]]'s foot in Game 3; he briefly returned for part of the fourth quarter of that game, but missed the following games in the series. After winning Game 5 at home, Bulls were eliminated by the 76ers in Game 6 in Philadelphia, becoming the fifth team in NBA history to be eliminated as a first seed by an eighth seed. In Game 6, Andre Iguodala sank two free throws with 2.2 seconds left to put the 76ers up 79\u201378 after getting fouled by [[\u00d6mer A\u015f\u0131k]], who had missed two free throws five seconds earlier. At the end of the season, Boozer and A\u015f\u0131k were the only members on the Bulls' roster to have played in every game, with Korver and Brewer missing one game apiece. In the off-season, the Bulls gave up Lucas to the [[Toronto Raptors]], Brewer to the [[New York Knicks]], Korver to the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Watson to the [[Brooklyn Nets]] and A\u015f\u0131k to the [[Houston Rockets]], but brought back [[Kirk Hinrich]]. In addition, they added [[Marco Belinelli]], [[Vladimir Radmanovic]], [[Nazr Mohammed]] and [[Nate Robinson]] to the roster via free agency.\n\nRose missed the entire [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]], but despite his absence, the Bulls finished 45\u201337, second in the Central Division (behind the [[Indiana Pacers]]) and 5th in their conference. They defeated the [[Brooklyn Nets]] 4\u20133 (after leading 3\u20131) in the first round of the playoffs and lost to the Miami Heat 4\u20131 in the next round.\n\nDuring the season, the Bulls snapped both Miami's 27-game winning streak and the New York Knicks' 13-game winning streak, becoming the second team in NBA history to snap two winning streaks of 13 games or more in a season.\n\nJust 10 games into the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], Derrick Rose would tear his medial meniscus on a non-contact play. He declared he would miss the remainder of the season. On January 7, 2014, veteran forward [[Luol Deng]] was traded to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] for center [[Andrew Bynum]] and a set of picks. Bynum was immediately waived after the trade went through. The Bulls would finish second in the Central Division with 48 wins, and earned home-court advantage in the first round. However, due to lack of a strong offensive weapon,\nthey failed to win a single home game en route to losing to the [[Washington Wizards]] in five games.\n\nIn the [[2014 NBA draft]], the Bulls traded their 16th and 19th picks for [[Doug McDermott]], the former [[Creighton Bluejays men's basketball|Creighton]] star and 5th leading scorer in NCAA history, who was selected with the 11th pick, and in the second round, took [[Cameron Bairstow]] with the 49th pick. That off-season, they signed [[Pau Gasol]], re-signed [[Kirk Hinrich]] and brought over Eurostar [[Nikola Miroti\u0107]], who was acquired via a draft day trade in 2011, but could not come over sooner, due to salary cap constraints.\n\n====2014\u20132015: Derrick Rose return to health====\nThe second return of [[Derrick Rose]] gave the Bulls and their fans optimism for the 2014\u201315 season. With 2-time NBA Champion [[Pau Gasol]] and a deep bench consisting of [[Taj Gibson]], [[Nikola Miroti\u0107]], [[Tony Snell (basketball)|Tony Snell]], [[Aaron Brooks (basketball)|Aaron Brooks]], [[Doug McDermott]], [[Kirk Hinrich]], among others, the Bulls were one of the two favorite teams to come out of the Eastern Conference along with the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]. The Bulls started off the season in style with a blowout win of the [[New York Knicks]], and then winning 7 of their first 9 games (losses coming to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Boston Celtics]]). The emergence of [[Jimmy Butler]] as a primary scorer for the Bulls was a major surprise and he surged into the forefront of the \"[[NBA Most Improved Player Award|Most Improved Player of the Year]]\" award race. Butler's statistical jump was noted by many as one of the greatest in NBA History,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/chicago-bulls-jimmy-butler-wins-nba-most-improved-player-050715|title=Chicago Bulls' Jimmy Butler Most Improved Players|date=May 7, 2015|accessdate=May 28, 2015|work=ESPN}}</ref> going from scoring just 13 points per game in 2013\u201314 to scoring 20 points per game in 2014\u201315. Pau Gasol was considered a huge asset for the Bulls and averaged a double-double throughout the season. Both Butler and Gasol ended up making the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The Bulls' second half of the season was marred by inconsistency and frustration set in with Derrick Rose blasting the team for not being on the same page. Tension between management and [[Tom Thibodeau]] continued to be a dark cloud hanging over the organization. The Bulls finished with a 50\u201332 record and the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference. They faced the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in the first round, and took advantage of the young and inexperienced Bucks by going up a quick 3\u20130 in the series. However, inconsistency and not being on the same page yet again plagued the Bulls as the Bucks won the next two games, sending a scare to Chicago. The Bulls bounced back with fury in Game 6 however, beating the Bucks by a playoff record 54 points winning the series 4\u20132. The next round saw the Bulls facing their arch-rival [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and their biggest nemesis, [[LeBron James]], who had beaten the Bulls in all three of their previous playoff meetings. The Bulls shocked the Cavs in Game 1 dominating them and never trailing. The Cavs answered back in Game 2 in the same fashion, never trailing the entire game. In a pivotal Game 3 in Chicago, the Bulls and Cavs battled closely all the way through, but the Bulls prevailed on a last-second buzzer beating 3-pointer by [[Derrick Rose]]. In Game 4, the Cavs would answer once again, with [[LeBron James]] hitting the buzzer-beating shot to win the game. The Bulls lack of consistency and poor offensive showing doomed them once again as the Cavs won the next 2 games handily and closed out the series 4\u20132. After the series, speculation erupted about [[Tom Thibodeau]]'s job security due to escalating feud between Thibodeau and Bulls front office managers [[Gar Forman]] and [[John Paxson]].\n\n====2015\u20132016: Change in approach====\n[[File:Fred Hoiberg 2010 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fred Hoiberg]] was the 22nd head coach in the franchise's history.]]\nOn May 28, 2015, the Bulls fired Tom Thibodeau to seek a \"change in approach\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/chicago/nba/story/_/id/12968728/chicago-bulls-fire-tom-thibodeau-coach-five-seasons|title=Tom Thibodeau out in Chicago as Bulls seek 'change in approach'|first=Nick|last=Friedell|date=May 28, 2015|accessdate=May 28, 2015|work=ESPN}}</ref> The Bulls named [[Fred Hoiberg]] as their head coach on June 2, 2015.<ref name=\"BullsHoiberg\">{{cite press release|title=Bulls Name Fred Hoiberg Head Coach|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/release/bulls-name-hoiberg-head-coach|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref> The Bulls had only 1 draft pick in the [[2015 NBA draft]], and selected center [[Bobby Portis]] from the [[University of Arkansas]]. Bulls forward [[Mike Dunleavy Jr.]] was ruled out for at least the first four months of the season after completing back surgery. With Dunleavy out indefinitely, the Bulls promoted Doug McDermott to the starting lineup in his place at small forward. Before the season started, coach Fred Hoiberg made an incredibly controversial move by putting Nikola Miroti\u0107 as his starting power forward to pair with center Pau Gasol, meaning Joakim Noah, a long-time Bulls veteran and a fan-favorite was to come off the bench. Hoiberg told the media that the move was suggested by Noah himself but Noah denied having made any suggestions to Hoiberg, which sparked a distrust between the two before the season even began.\n\nThe Bulls started the 2015\u201316 season off well with an impressive season-opening 97\u201395 victory against archrivals and defending Eastern Conference Champion [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and jumped to an 8\u20133 record in the first month. The Bulls went 10\u20139 and through late November and December. The Bulls came back and won six straight games.

The two teams met in the playoffs four consecutive years, with the Pistons winning each time until 1991. The Eastern Conference Finals in 1991 ended with a four-game sweep of the Pistons, who walked off the floor with time still on the game clock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicsportsgamesondvd.com/michaeljordan.htm |title=Michael Jordan |publisher=Classicsportsgamesondvd.com |date= |accessdate=December 7, 2012}}</ref> The rivalry was renewed in the 2007 Eastern Conference Semifinals, in which former Detroit cornerstone [[Ben Wallace]] met his former team (the Pistons won in 6 games). The geographic proximity and membership in the [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]] further intensify the rivalry, which has been characterized by intense, physical play ever since the teams met in the late 1980s. Chicago fans have been known to have a disliking for Detroit professional teams, as it was in the same division as Chicago in all four major North American sports until recently when the Red Wings moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference for the 2013\u201314 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/01/26/jimmy-butler-dwyane-wade-call-out-teammates-after-tough-loss|title=Jimmy Butler, Dwyane Wade call out teammates after tough loss - NBA.com|last=Staff|first=NBA.com|website=www.nba.com|language=en|access-date=March 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Miami Heat===\n{{Further|Bulls\u2013Heat rivalry}}\nThe Bulls and the [[Miami Heat]] rivalry began once the Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade dominated by the Bulls. They were eliminated 3 times by Chicago, who went on to win the title each time. The rivalry has come back due to the return of the Bulls to the playoffs in the post-[[Michael Jordan]] era and the emergence of [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Derrick Rose]]. The revived rivalry has been very physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players, most notably the actions of former Heat player [[James Posey]]. The Bulls and Heat met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, with the Heat winning in 5 games. On March 27, 2013, Chicago snapped Miami's 27-game winning streak. The Bulls and Heat met later that year in the 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Miami won the series 4\u20131. Since [[LeBron James]]'s departure from Miami, the Bulls-Heat rivalry has experienced a tough in comparison to the better part of the century as the Bulls chop the Heat's playoff hopes in the 2017 regular season.\n\n===New York Knicks===\n{{Further|Bulls\u2013Knicks rivalry}}\nAnother franchise that the Bulls have competed fiercely with is the [[New York Knicks]]. The two teams met in the playoffs in four consecutive years (1991\u201394) and again in 1996, with the teams' series twice (1992 and 1994) going the full seven games. Their first playoff confrontation, however, came in 1989 when both teams were called \"teams on the rise\" under [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Patrick Ewing]], respectively (rivalry that started their freshman year in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game]] with Jordan hitting the deciding jumper of the final). That first confrontation would belong to Chicago with six games of the Eastern Semifinals. The Bulls won in the first three years (1991\u201393) before losing in 1994 but got revenge in 1996. As with Detroit, the historic rivalry between the cities has led to animosity between the teams and occasionally their fans.\n\n==Traditions==\n===Starting lineup introductions===\nDuring the Bulls' run of dominance, the player introductions became world-famous. Longtime announcer [[Tommy Edwards (announcer)|Tommy Edwards]] was the first to use [[Sirius (instrumental)|\"Sirius\"]],<ref name=WSJ>{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Ben|title=The One Record the Warriors Can\u2019t Take From the Bulls: Even as Golden State closes on a historic 73rd win, Chicago\u2019s pre-game music still sets the standard|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-one-record-the-warriors-cant-take-from-the-bulls-1460498500|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=April 12, 2016|accessdate=October 8, 2018}}</ref> [[On the Run (instrumental)|\"On The Run\"]] and other songs in game presentation in the NBA. When Edwards moved to Boston for employment with CBS Radio, he was replaced by [[Ray Clay]] in 1990, and Clay continued many of the traditional aspects of the Bulls introductions, including the music, [[The Alan Parsons Project]]'s \"Sirius\", for all six championship runs. The lights are first dimmed during the visiting team introduction, accompanied by \"[[The Imperial March]]\" from ''[[Star Wars]]'' composed by John Williams or \"On the Run\" by Pink Floyd, or \"Tick of the Clock\" by [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]]. Virtually all lights in the stadium are then shut off for the Bulls introduction, and a spotlight illuminates each player as he is introduced and runs onto the court; the spotlight is also focused on the Bulls logo prior to the introductions. Since the move to the United Center, lasers and fireworks have been added, and with improvements to the arena's White Way video screen, computer graphics on the stadium monitors have been added. These graphics feature the [[computer animation|3D-animated]] '[[Running of the Bulls]]' en route to the United Center, along the way smashing a bus featuring the opposing team's logo. Coincidentally, [[Alan Parsons]] wrote \"Sirius\" for his own band and was the sound engineer for \"On the Run\" from Pink Floyd's album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]''.\n\nTraditionally, the players have been introduced in the following order: small forward, power forward, center, point guard, shooting guard. During the championship era, [[Scottie Pippen]] was usually the first (or second after [[Horace Grant]]) Bulls player introduced, and [[Michael Jordan]] the last. (Pippen and Jordan are the only players to play on all six Bulls championship teams.) More recently with [[Derrick Rose]]'s arrival, the guards have been reversed in order, making the Chicago-bred point guard the last player introduced. <!-- more history of the evolution of the starting introduction here --> Although internal disputes eventually led to the dismissal of Clay, the Bulls in 2006 announced the return of [[Tommy Edwards (announcer)|Tommy Edwards]] as the announcer.<ref>{{cite news|title=BULLS: Tommy Edwards|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/edwards_060912.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=September 12, 2006|accessdate=August 1, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201152828/http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/edwards_060912.html|archivedate=December 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs part of Edwards' return, the introductions changed as a new introduction was developed by [[Wachowski Sisters|Lily and Lana Wachowski]], [[Ethan Stoller]] and Jamie Poindexter, all from Chicago. The introduction also included a newly composed remix of the traditional Sirius theme.\n\n===Black shoes and socks===\nThe Bulls have an unofficial tradition of wearing black shoes (regardless of being home or away) during the playoffs, which dates all the way back to [[1989 NBA playoffs|1989]] when they debuted the tradition.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ask Sam Smith: The Tribune's pro basketball reporter answers reader questions |url=http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/bulls/askthewriter/cs-070426asksamsmith,1,1025838.story?page=2&coll=cs-bulls-ask-headlines |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |date=April 26, 2007 |publisher=ChicagoSports.com}}</ref> Then-Bulls backup center [[Brad Sellers]] suggested to wear black shoes as a way to show unity within the team. \nFor the 1996 playoffs, they became the first team to wear black socks with the black shoes, similar to the [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|University of Michigan]] and the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]] which started the trend in college earlier in the decade. Since, many teams have this look in both the regular season and playoffs.\nIt was noted when the Bulls made their first playoff appearance during the 2004\u201305 season after a six-year hiatus, they continued the tradition and wore black shoes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bulls Take Game 1 |url=http://chicago.comcastsportsnet.com/view_content_1p.asp?ID=8033 |accessdate=September 9, 2007 |date=April 24, 2005 |publisher=ComcastSportsNet.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124525/http://chicago.comcastsportsnet.com/view_content_1p.asp?ID=8033 |archivedate=October 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEven though the Bulls generally wear black footwear in the playoffs since 1989, there have been some notable exceptions. In the [[1995 NBA playoffs|1995 playoffs]] against the Magic, when Michael Jordan debuted his [[Air Jordan#Product history|Air Jordan XI]] shoe, he wore the white colorway during the Bulls' playoff games in Orlando. He was fined by the Bulls for not complying with their colorway policy. During the [[2009 NBA playoffs|2009 playoffs]], the Bulls again broke the tradition when all of their players wore white shoes and socks in Game 3 of the first round against the Boston Celtics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tradition broken |url=http://www.blogabull.com/2009/4/24/851230/image-fanshot |accessdate=April 24, 2009 |date=April 24, 2009 |publisher=ESPN}}</ref> More recently, since the NBA's relaxation of sneaker color rules, some Bulls players wore either red or white sneakers in defiance of the tradition.\n\n===The circus trip===\nThe Bulls and their arena mates, the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], shared an odd tradition dating to the opening of Chicago Stadium. Every fall, [[Feld Entertainment]]'s now-defunct [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]] came to Chicago on its nationwide tour. Since it used large indoor venues rather than tents, it took over the United Center for its entire run and the Bulls were forced, along with the Blackhawks, to take an extended road trip that lasted around two weeks. The start of the \"circus trip\", as many sportscasters dubbed it, was noted in local newspapers, television and radio sports reports as \"the circus trip\", along with national programs like ''[[SportsCenter]]''.<ref>K.C.

Klein considered names like [[Matador]]s or [[Torero|Toreadors]], but dismissed them, saying, \"If you think about it, no team with as many as three syllables in its nickname has ever had much success except for the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Montreal Canadiens]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>.\" After discussing possible names with his family, Klein settled on ''Bulls'' when his son Mark said, \"Dad, that's a bunch of bull!\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Behind The Name\u2013Chicago Bulls|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/behind_the_name.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chicago Bulls wordmark.gif|thumb|right|upright|Chicago Bulls wordmark (1966\u2013present)]]\n\n===Logo===\nThe Bulls are unique in the fact they have used the same logo with very little change since the team's inception.

At one point, the Bulls also had an alternate logo during the early 1970s, featuring the same Bulls logo, but with a cloud that says \"Windy City\" below the bull's nose.\n\n===Uniforms===\n====1966\u201373 uniforms====\nThe Bulls currently wear three different uniforms: a white uniform, a red uniform, and a black [[third jersey|alternate]] uniform. The original uniforms were aesthetically close to what the Bulls wear today, featuring the iconic diamond surrounding the Bulls logo on the shorts and block lettering. What distinguished the original uniforms were the black drop shadows, red or white side stripes with black borders, and white lettering on the red uniforms. For the 1969\u201370 season, the red uniforms were tweaked to include the city name.<ref name=bullsuniforms>{{cite news|title=9 eye-catching Bulls jerseys over the years|url=http://history.bulls.com/9-eye-catching-bulls-jerseys-over-the-years/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=History.Bulls.com|date=December 16, 2015|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1973\u201385 uniforms====\nFor the 1973\u201374 season, the Bulls drastically changed their look, removing the side stripes and drop shadows while moving the front numbers to the left chest. While the white uniforms saw the \"Bulls\" wordmark go from a vertically arched to radially arched arrangement, the red uniforms saw a more significant makeover, featuring black lettering and a script \"Chicago\" wordmark. With a few tweaks in the lettering, these uniforms were used until 1985.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nThis uniform set was later revived as a throwback uniform during the 2003\u201304 and 2015\u201316 seasons.\n\n====1985\u2013present uniforms====\nStarting with the 1985\u201386 season, the Bulls updated their uniform. Among the more notable changes in the look were centered uniform numbers and a vertically arched \"Bulls\" wordmark in both the red and white uniforms. Like the previous set, this uniform saw a few tweaks particularly in the treatment of the player's name.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nWhen [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, the Bulls kept much of the same look save for the truncated shoulder striping and the addition of the [[Flag of Chicago|Chicago four stars]] on the waistline. With Nike and the NBA eliminating designations on home and away uniforms, the Bulls also announced that their red \"Icon\" uniforms would become their home uniforms, and the white \"Association\" uniforms would become their away uniforms.<ref>{{cite news|title=LOOK: Chicago Bulls unveil revamped Nike jerseys, opt to wear red for home games|url=https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/look-chicago-bulls-unveil-revamped-nike-jerseys-opt-to-wear-red-for-home-games/|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=August 2, 2017|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Alternate black uniforms====\nIn the 1995\u201396 season, the Bulls added a black uniform to their set. The initial look featured red pinstripes and lacked the classic diamond on the shorts. This set was revived as throwback uniforms in the 2007\u201308 and 2012\u201313 seasons.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nFrom the 1997\u201398 to the 2005\u201306 seasons, the Bulls wore slightly modified black uniforms without pinstripes. This set, with a few slight changes in the template, also marked the return of the city name in front of the uniform during the 1999\u20132000 season.\n\nThe 2006\u201307 season saw another change in the Bulls' black alternate uniform, now resembling the red and white uniform with the addition of a red diamond in the shorts. For the 2014\u201315 season, the uniforms were tweaked a bit to include sleeves and a modernized diamond treatment in black with red and white borders.<ref name=bullsuniforms/>\n\nSince the 2017\u201318 season, the Bulls' black uniforms remained mostly untouched save for the aforementioned switch to the new Nike logo that affected the treatment towards the shoulder piping. Nike also dubbed this uniform as the \"Statement\" uniform in reference to its third jerseys. The Bulls began wearing the Statement uniforms after Thanksgiving and is currently used in away games against teams that wear their white, grey/silver or cream uniforms.\n\nThe 2019\u201320 season marked the return of pinstripes to the Bulls' \"Statement\" uniform, albeit in dark grey. In addition, the diamond treatment returned to red, piping was tweaked, and four six-point stars were featured on the beltline. The Bulls wore this \"Statement\" uniform in select home games and away games against teams wearing white, cream or silver uniforms.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chicago Bulls Introduce New Statement Edition Uniforms for 2019-20 Season|url=https://www.nba.com/bulls/news/chicago-bulls-introduce-new-statement-edition-uniforms-2019-20-season|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bulls.com|date=October 5, 2019|accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NBA Lockervision|url=https://lockervision.nba.com/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|accessdate=October 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Other uniforms====\nDuring the 2005\u201306 season, the Bulls honored the defunct [[Chicago Stags]] by wearing the team's red and blue throwback uniforms. The set featured red tops and blue shorts.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2017, the Bulls wore a green version of their red uniforms during the week of [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States|St. Patrick's Day]] in March. The only red elements visible were those found on the team logo. For 2015 the Bulls wore sleeved versions of the green uniform that featured white lettering with gold and black trim and the \"Chicago\" wordmark replacing \"Bulls in front. In 2016 and 2017, they wore the same uniforms minus the sleeves.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2017, the Bulls wore a variation of their red uniforms as part of the NBA's \"Noche Latina\" festivities every March. The only notable change in this uniform was the \"Los Bulls\" wordmark in front. For 2014, the Bulls briefly retired the look in favor of a black sleeved uniform featuring \"Los Bulls\" in white with red trim.\n\nDuring the NBA's \"Green Week\" celebrations, the Bulls also wore green uniforms, but with a slightly darker shade from their St. Patrick's Day counterparts. They used their black alternate uniforms as its template. They donned the uniforms in a game against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] on April 9, 2009.\n\nThe Bulls also wore special edition Christmas uniforms as part of the [[National Basketball Association Christmas games|NBA's Christmas Day games]]. The one-off Christmas uniforms were as follows:\n*2012: Monochrome red uniforms with lettering in red with black trim.\n*2013: Sleeved red uniforms with Bulls logo rendered in silver.\n*2014: Modified version of red uniform featuring the Bulls logo in front and a contrasting white nameplate of the player's first name. \n*2015: Red uniforms with ornate script letters in cream.\n*2016: Monochrome red uniforms with ornate script letters in black.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, the Bulls wore a grey \"Pride\" sleeved uniform, featuring the team name and other lettering in red with white trim.

The uniforms, designed to pay homage to Chicago's flag, are in white and feature the classic \"Chicago\" script and numbers in red with light blue trim along with four six-pointed stars on each side.\n\nThe Bulls' 2018\u201319 \"City\" uniform is once again inspired from Chicago's flag, with a black base and a portion of the flag with four red six-point stars and two powder blue stripes in front.\n\nThe Bulls' \"City\" uniform for 2019\u201320 continued the flag theme, featuring a light blue base and a recolored Bulls logo in front.

He was first introduced in 1969. Benny is a red bull who wears number 1. Benny is one of the oldest and best known mascots in all of professional sports. The Bulls also had another mascot named Da Bull. Introduced in 1995, he was described on the team website as being the high flying cousin of Benny, known for his dunking skills. The man who portrayed Da Bull was arrested in 2004 for possession and selling marijuana from his car.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=ratto_ray&id=1715534 |title=The Mascots' stigmata |accessdate=January 29, 2012 |work=ESPN}}</ref> Da Bull was retired soon after the incident. While Benny has a family-friendly design, Da Bull was designed as a more realistic bull. Unlike Benny, Da Bull was brown. He also had a meaner facial expression and wore number 95.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the Bulls.

The name is of ancient origin, and is retained in the name of the [[Hadhramaut Governorate]] of [[Yemen]]. The people of Hadhramaut are called [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]]. They formerly spoke [[Hadramautic language|Hadramautic]], but now predominantly speak [[Hadhrami Arabic]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name \"\u1e24a\u1e0dramawt\" is not exactly known, and there are numerous competing hypotheses about its meaning. The most common [[folk etymology]] is that the region's name means \"death has come,\" from {{lang-ar|\u062d\u064e\u0636\u064e\u0631|\u1e25a\u1e0dara|lit=he came}} and {{lang-ar|\u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062a|mawt|lit=death}}, though there are multiple explanations for how it came to be known as such. One explanation is that this is a nickname of [[Amar bin Qahtan|'Amar ibn Qa\u1e25\u1e6d\u0101n]], a legendary invader of the region, whose battles always left many dead. Another theory is that after the destruction of [[Thamud|Tham\u016bd]], the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Saleh|\u1e62\u0101li\u1e25]] relocated himself and about 4,000 of his followers to the region and it was there that he died, thus lending the region its morbid name \"death has come.\" A third related etymology posits that {{lang|ar|\u062d\u0636\u0631}} refers to the inhabitants of the area, themselves, and hints that the way of life of the ancient Hadhrami people was severe and ascetic in the eyes of the bordering kingdoms situated in today's North Yemen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n\u1e24a\u1e0dramawt is also identified with [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Hazarmaveth|Hazarmawet]] ({{lang-hbo|\u05d7\u05b2\u05e6\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d5\u05b6\u05ea|italic=no|rtl=yes}}; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10:26<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10:26|KJV}}</ref> and [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 1:20).<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|1:20|KJV}}</ref> There, it is the name of a son of [[Joktan]] (who is also identified with [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]]), the ancestor of the South Arabian kingdoms. According to various Bible dictionaries, the name \"Hazarmaveth\" means \"court of death,\" reflecting a meaning similar to the Arabic folk etymologies.\n\nScholarly theories of the name's origin are somewhat more varied, but none have gained general acceptance. [[Juris Zarins]], rediscoverer of the city claimed to be the ancient [[Incense Route]] trade capital [[Iram of the Pillars|Ubar]] in Oman, suggested that the name may come from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u1f55\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1}} {{transl|grc|hydreumata}}, or enclosed (and often fortified) watering stations at [[wadi]]s. In a ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]'' interview,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ubar/zarins/index.html |title=Lost City of Arabia |format=NOVA online interview with Dr. Juris Zarins, September 1996 |publisher=[[PBS]] |date=September 1996}}</ref> he described Ubar as:\n\n{{Quote|a kind of fortress/administration center set up to protect the water supply from raiding [[Bedouin]] tribes. Surrounding the site, as far as six miles away, were smaller villages, which served as small-scale encampments for the caravans. An interesting parallel to this are the fortified water holes in the [[Eastern Desert]] of [[Egypt]] from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times. There, they were called ''hydreumata''.}}\n\nThough it accurately describes the configuration of settlements in the pre-7th century Wadi \u1e24a\u1e0dramawt, this explanation for the name is anachronistic and has gained no wider scholarly acceptance. Already in the [[pre-Islamic Arabia|period before the advent of Islam]] in the 7th century [[Common Era|CE]], variations of the name are attested as early as the middle of the First Millennium BC. The names ''\u1e25\u1e0drmt'' (\ud802\ude62\ud802\ude73\ud802\ude67\ud802\ude63\ud802\ude69) and ''\u1e25\u1e0drmwt'' (\ud802\ude62\ud802\ude73\ud802\ude67\ud802\ude63\ud802\ude65\ud802\ude69) are found in texts of the [[Old South Arabian|Old South Arabian languages]] ([[Hadramautic language|\u1e24a\u1e0dramitic]], [[Minaean language|Minaic]], [[Qatabanian language|Qatabanic]], and [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]]), though the second form is not found in any known \u1e24a\u1e0dramitic inscriptions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=32&prjId=1&corId=0&colId=0&navId=22579382&wl_group=11&wl_subgroup=5 |website=DASI: Digital Archive for the Study of pre-islamic arabian Inscriptions |title=General word list |access-date=1 May 2016}}</ref> In either form, the word itself can be a toponym, a tribal name, or the name of the kingdom of \u1e24a\u1e0dramawt.

[[Kamal Salibi]] proposed an alternative etymology for the name which argues that the diphthong \"aw\" in the name is an incorrect vocalization.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Salibi|first1=Kamal|editor1-last=al-Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b|title=\u1e24a\u1e0dram\u016bt: A Name with a Story|journal=Studia Arabica et Islamica: Festschrift for I\u1e25s\u0101n \u02bfAbb\u0101s on His Sixtieth Birthday|date=1981|pages=393\u2013397}}</ref> He notes that \"-\u016bt\" is a frequent ending for place names in the \u1e24a\u1e0dramawt, and given that \"\u1e24a\u1e0dram\u016bt\" is the colloquial pronunciation of the name, and apparently also its ancient pronunciation, the correct reading of the name should be \"place of \u1e25\u1e0drm.\" He proposes, then, that the name means \"the green place,\" which is apt for its well-watered wadis whose lushness contrasts with the surrounding high desert plateau.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n{{See also|Geology of Yemen|Geography of Yemen}}\n[[File:Hadramaut.JPG|thumb|Region close to [[Seiyun]] in the Hadhramaut Valley]]\n\nNarrowly, Hadhramaut refers to the historical [[Qu'aiti]] and [[Kathiri]] [[sultan]]ates {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}, which were in the [[Aden Protectorate]] overseen by the [[Resident (title)|British Resident]] at [[Aden]] until their abolition upon the independence of [[South Yemen]] in 1967.

The British Government and the traditional and scholarly sultan Ali bin Salah signed a treaty in 1937 appointing the British government as \"advisors\" in Hadhramaut.

They formerly spoke [[Hadramautic language|Hadramautic]], but now predominantly speak [[Hadhrami Arabic]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name \"\u1e24a\u1e0dramawt\" is not exactly known, and there are numerous competing hypotheses about its meaning. The most common [[folk etymology]] is that the region's name means \"death has come,\" from {{lang-ar|\u062d\u064e\u0636\u064e\u0631|\u1e25a\u1e0dara|lit=he came}} and {{lang-ar|\u0645\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062a|mawt|lit=death}}, though there are multiple explanations for how it came to be known as such. One explanation is that this is a nickname of [[Amar bin Qahtan|'Amar ibn Qa\u1e25\u1e6d\u0101n]], a legendary invader of the region, whose battles always left many dead. Another theory is that after the destruction of [[Thamud|Tham\u016bd]], the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Saleh|\u1e62\u0101li\u1e25]] relocated himself and about 4,000 of his followers to the region and it was there that he died, thus lending the region its morbid name \"death has come.\" A third related etymology posits that {{lang|ar|\u062d\u0636\u0631}} refers to the inhabitants of the area, themselves, and hints that the way of life of the ancient Hadhrami people was severe and ascetic in the eyes of the bordering kingdoms situated in today's North Yemen.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\n\u1e24a\u1e0dramawt is also identified with [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Hazarmaveth|Hazarmawet]] ({{lang-hbo|\u05d7\u05b2\u05e6\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d5\u05b6\u05ea|italic=no|rtl=yes}}; [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 10:26<ref>{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10:26|KJV}}</ref> and [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 1:20).<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Chronicles|1:20|KJV}}</ref> There, it is the name of a son of [[Joktan]] (who is also identified with [[Qahtanite|Qahtan]]), the ancestor of the South Arabian kingdoms. According to various Bible dictionaries, the name \"Hazarmaveth\" means \"court of death,\" reflecting a meaning similar to the Arabic folk etymologies.\n\nScholarly theories of the name's origin are somewhat more varied, but none have gained general acceptance. [[Juris Zarins]], rediscoverer of the city claimed to be the ancient [[Incense Route]] trade capital [[Iram of the Pillars|Ubar]] in Oman, suggested that the name may come from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u1f55\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1}} {{transl|grc|hydreumata}}, or enclosed (and often fortified) watering stations at [[wadi]]s.

The family first moved into the house in 1692, and apart from in both [[World War 1]] and [[World War 2]] when the house was used as an auxiliary hospital, the family have lived in the main house and it has been the seat of the [[Holbech]] family.  \n\nWilliam Holbech bought the estate in 1684 and built the house but the major changes to the property occurred between 1745 and 1750 when the entrance front was remodelled and the [[rococo]] plasterwork was added to the interior. This work was carried out by William Holbech junior who wanted a suitable setting for the sculpture and art he had brought back from his [[Grand Tour]].
