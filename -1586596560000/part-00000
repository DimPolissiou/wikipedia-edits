It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

He had a highly successful spell with Juventus, where he won three [[Serie A]] titles, the [[Coppa Italia]], the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]], among other titles; he won a second Coppa Italia with Lazio before retiring with the club in 2007. At international level, he played 31 times for the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] from his debut in 1995, and was a member of their squad which won the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. He also represented them at the [[Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]], at [[UEFA Euro 1996]] (as a starting goalkeeper), and at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]].\n\n==Club career==\nPeruzzi began his [[Serie A]] career with [[A.S.

He was loaned to [[Hellas Verona F.C.|Hellas Verona]] in 1989, but was one of the two Roma players (the other being [[Andrea Carnevale]]) to be suspended for a year in October 1990 after failing a doping test because of an appetite suppressant he was taking at the time, which contained the banned substance [[Phentermine]].<ref name=\"Peruzzi, il doping e quel gol fantasma\"/> His signing with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 1991 successfully revived his career and he soon surpassed [[Stefano Tacconi]] as the club's starting goalkeeper, remaining with the team until 1999, and winning the [[Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year]] Award in 1997 and 1998, as well as the [[Guerin d'oro]] in 1997. Peruzzi won three Serie A titles, a [[Coppa Italia]], two [[Supercoppa Italiana]] titles, a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], a [[UEFA Super Cup]], an [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] and was part of Juventus' 1996 [[UEFA Champions League]] title squad that defeated [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the final on penalties, saving two in the [[1996 UEFA Champions League Final|final shoot-out]]. He also reached two more consecutive Champions League finals with the [[Turin]]-based club, as well as a semi-final finish during his final season with the club.

However, he was put on in the final few minutes in Lazio's final home match of the season, a goalless draw against [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] on 20 May, as a goodbye to the fans.

Typically, there are four approaches to PSS design.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}{{specify|date=June 2019|reason=What is the fourth?}}\n* Function-based PSS: add new functions to increase product value in the competing market. For example, [[General Motors]] added [[OnStar]] in 1992 to product emergency services for customers. It integrated GPS with vehicle sensory system for telematics-based on-demand services.\n* Value-added PSS: companies added new features to increase value of a product to expand its value to customers and users. For example, Otis Elevator added Remote Elevator Maintenance (REM) system to its fleet system to monitor their elevators to reduce failures. [[GE Healthcare]] (formerly GE Medical Systems) developed InSite to remotely monitor its medical equipment in order to reduce service costs and increase users' {{Weasel inline|text=benefits.|date=June 2019}}\n* Evidence-based Service: companies use [[big data]] analytics to provide the actual saving and further develop a service contract for customer to pay for part of the savings.\n\nThere are many methodologies on PSS design. Dominant Innovation system uses an Innovation Matrix to identified gaps from customer's fear, not needs based on scenario-based path finding. A new value-chain ecosystem can be further developed to link these gaps between two invisible spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dominantinnovation.com/english/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218220259/http://dominantinnovation.com/english/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-12-18|title=Dominant Innovation Official Website|website=www.dominantinnovation.com|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> For example, John Deere developed Agric Service business based on the customers' worries on soil related issues. It integrates sensors with GPS to develop cognitive site map about soil content to optimize crop yields.]\n\nIn recent years,{{Clarify timeframe|date=June 2019}} PSS has been further integrated with big data analytics for accelerated innovation. Other technologies such as [[prognostics]], health management and [[cyber-physical system]]s have further created service innovation technologies for PSS.

''See [[service economy]] for more on the servitization of products.''\n\n;Types\nOne type of servicizing solutions is based on transactions where payment is made\u2014not for the \"product\"\u2014but for the \"product-service package\" (part of PSS) which has been sold to the customer. This servicized purchase extends the buying transaction from a one-time sale (product acquisition), to a long-term service relationship (such as in the case of a long-term maintenance-free [[Extended warranty|service contract]]).<ref name=\"Eco\">{{cite book|last=Stahel|first=W.|title=The Performance Economy|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave-MacMillan|location=London}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of servicizing may be a strategy for providing access to services for people who cannot afford to buy products outright. For example, in the case where auto ownership is economically unfeasible, creative servicizing offers at least three possible solutions: one in which transportation can be achieved ''simultaneously'' (as in car-pooling); one in which transportation can be achieved ''sequentially'' (as in car-sharing);<ref name=\"Eco\"/> and one in which transportation can be achieved ''eventually'' ([[rent-to-own]]).\n\n== Types ==\nThere are various issues in the nomenclature of the discussion of PSS, not least that services are products, and need material products in order to support delivery, however, it has been a major focus of research for several years. The research has focussed on a PSS as system comprising tangibles (the products) and intangibles (the services) in combination for fulfilling specific customer needs. The research has shown that manufacturing firms are more amenable to producing \"results\", rather than solely products as specific artefacts, and that consumers are more amenable to consuming such results. This research has identified three classes of PSS:<ref name=DMSD>{{cite book|title=Design and Manufacture for Sustainable Development 2004|editor1=Tracy Bhamra|editor2=Bernard Hon|author=M Cook|chapter=Understanding the potential opportunities provided by service-orientated concepts to improve resource productivity|pages=125|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-86058-470-1}}</ref>\n\n*Product Oriented PSS: This is a PSS where ownership of the tangible product is transferred to the consumer, but additional services, such as [[maintenance contract]]s, are provided.\n*Use Oriented PSS: This is a PSS where ownership of the tangible product is retained by the service provider, who sells the functions of the product, via modified distribution and payment systems, such as sharing, pooling, and leasing.\n*Result Oriented PSS: This is a PSS where products are replaced by services, such as, for example, [[voicemail]] replacing [[answering machine]]s.\n\n{{aut|Van Ostaeyen et al}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Ostaeyen|first=Joris|title=A refined typology of Product-Service Systems based on Functional Hierarchy Modeling|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.01.036|display-authors=etal|volume=51|pages=261\u2013276|year=2013}}</ref> criticize this typology for failing to capture the complexity of PSS examples found in practice. They propose an alternative that categorizes PSS types according to two distinguishing features: the performance orientation of the dominant revenue mechanism and the degree of integration between product and service elements. According to the first distinguishing feature, a PSS can be designated as ''input-based (IB)'', ''availability-based (AB)'', ''usage-based (UB)'' or ''performance-based (PB)''. The performance-based type can be further subdivided into three subtypes:\n\n*Solution oriented (PB-SO) PSS: (e.g. selling a promised level of heat transfer efficiency instead of selling radiators)\n*Effect oriented (PB-EO) PSS: (e.g. selling a promised temperature level in a building instead of selling radiators)\n*Demand-fulfillment oriented (PB-DO) PSS: (e.g. selling a promised level of thermal comfort for building occupants instead of selling radiators)\n\nAccording to the second distinguishing feature, a PSS can be designated as segregated, semi-integrated, and integrated, depending on to what extent the product and service elements (e.g. maintenance service, spare parts) are combined into a single offering.\n\n== Examples ==\nThe following existing offerings illustrate the PSS concept:<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Ostaeyen|first=Joris|year=2014|title=Analysis of the Business Potential of Product-Service Systems for Investment Goods.

Typically, there are four approaches to PSS design.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}{{specify|date=June 2019|reason=What is the fourth?}}\n* Function-based PSS: add new functions to increase product value in the competing market. For example, [[General Motors]] added [[OnStar]] in 1992 to product emergency services for customers. It integrated GPS with vehicle sensory system for telematics-based on-demand services.\n* Value-added PSS: companies added new features to increase value of a product to expand its value to customers and users. For example, Otis Elevator added Remote Elevator Maintenance (REM) system to its fleet system to monitor their elevators to reduce failures. [[GE Healthcare]] (formerly GE Medical Systems) developed InSite to remotely monitor its medical equipment in order to reduce service costs and increase users' {{Weasel inline|text=benefits.|date=June 2019}}\n* Evidence-based Service: companies use [[big data]] analytics to provide the actual saving and further develop a service contract for customer to pay for part of the savings.\n\nThere are many methodologies on PSS design. Dominant Innovation system uses an Innovation Matrix to identified gaps from customer's fear, not needs based on scenario-based path finding. A new value-chain ecosystem can be further developed to link these gaps between two invisible spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dominantinnovation.com/english/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218220259/http://dominantinnovation.com/english/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-12-18|title=Dominant Innovation Official Website|website=www.dominantinnovation.com|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> For example, John Deere developed Agric Service business based on the customers' worries on soil related issues. It integrates sensors with GPS to develop cognitive site map about soil content to optimize crop yields.]\n\nIn recent years,{{Clarify timeframe|date=June 2019}} PSS has been further integrated with big data analytics for accelerated innovation. Other technologies such as [[prognostics]], health management and [[cyber-physical system]]s have further created service innovation technologies for PSS. For example, [[Alstom]] has been developing Train Tracer technologies{{clarify|date=June 2019}} since 2006 and is implementing Health Hub system{{clarify|date=June 2019}} for its transport fleets.\n\n=== Servicizing === <!-- Anchor from redirect; caution. -->\n\"''Servicizing''\" is a transaction through which value is provided by a combination of products and services in which the satisfaction of customer needs is achieved either by selling the function of the product rather than the product itself, or by increasing the service component of a product offer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Toffel|first=Mike|title=Contracting for Servicizing|url=http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/08-063.pdf|publisher=Harvard Business School|accessdate=23 May 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> The concept is based on the idea that what customers want from products is not necessarily ownership, but rather the function that the product provides or the service the product can deliver.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stahel|first=W.|title=The Utilisation-Focused Service Economy: Resource Efficiency and Product-Life Extension|year=1994|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, DC|pages=178\u2013190}}</ref> This means that the provider of \"servicizing solutions\" may get paid by the unit-of-service (or product function) delivered, as opposed to the (more traditional) unit-of-products sold. ''See [[service economy]] for more on the servitization of products.''\n\n;Types\nOne type of servicizing solutions is based on transactions where payment is made\u2014not for the \"product\"\u2014but for the \"product-service package\" (part of PSS) which has been sold to the customer. This servicized purchase extends the buying transaction from a one-time sale (product acquisition), to a long-term service relationship (such as in the case of a long-term maintenance-free [[Extended warranty|service contract]]).<ref name=\"Eco\">{{cite book|last=Stahel|first=W.|title=The Performance Economy|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave-MacMillan|location=London}}</ref>\n\nAnother type of servicizing may be a strategy for providing access to services for people who cannot afford to buy products outright. For example, in the case where auto ownership is economically unfeasible, creative servicizing offers at least three possible solutions: one in which transportation can be achieved ''simultaneously'' (as in car-pooling); one in which transportation can be achieved ''sequentially'' (as in car-sharing);<ref name=\"Eco\"/> and one in which transportation can be achieved ''eventually'' ([[rent-to-own]]).\n\n== Types ==\nThere are various issues in the nomenclature of the discussion of PSS, not least that services are products, and need material products in order to support delivery, however, it has been a major focus of research for several years. The research has focussed on a PSS as system comprising tangibles (the products) and intangibles (the services) in combination for fulfilling specific customer needs. The research has shown that manufacturing firms are more amenable to producing \"results\", rather than solely products as specific artefacts, and that consumers are more amenable to consuming such results. This research has identified three classes of PSS:<ref name=DMSD>{{cite book|title=Design and Manufacture for Sustainable Development 2004|editor1=Tracy Bhamra|editor2=Bernard Hon|author=M Cook|chapter=Understanding the potential opportunities provided by service-orientated concepts to improve resource productivity|pages=125|year=2004|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-86058-470-1}}</ref>\n\n*Product Oriented PSS: This is a PSS where ownership of the tangible product is transferred to the consumer, but additional services, such as [[maintenance contract]]s, are provided.\n*Use Oriented PSS: This is a PSS where ownership of the tangible product is retained by the service provider, who sells the functions of the product, via modified distribution and payment systems, such as sharing, pooling, and leasing.\n*Result Oriented PSS: This is a PSS where products are replaced by services, such as, for example, [[voicemail]] replacing [[answering machine]]s.\n\n{{aut|Van Ostaeyen et al}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Ostaeyen|first=Joris|title=A refined typology of Product-Service Systems based on Functional Hierarchy Modeling|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2013.01.036|display-authors=etal|volume=51|pages=261\u2013276|year=2013}}</ref> criticize this typology for failing to capture the complexity of PSS examples found in practice. They propose an alternative that categorizes PSS types according to two distinguishing features: the performance orientation of the dominant revenue mechanism and the degree of integration between product and service elements. According to the first distinguishing feature, a PSS can be designated as ''input-based (IB)'', ''availability-based (AB)'', ''usage-based (UB)'' or ''performance-based (PB)''. The performance-based type can be further subdivided into three subtypes:\n\n*Solution oriented (PB-SO) PSS: (e.g. selling a promised level of heat transfer efficiency instead of selling radiators)\n*Effect oriented (PB-EO) PSS: (e.g. selling a promised temperature level in a building instead of selling radiators)\n*Demand-fulfillment oriented (PB-DO) PSS: (e.g. selling a promised level of thermal comfort for building occupants instead of selling radiators)\n\nAccording to the second distinguishing feature, a PSS can be designated as segregated, semi-integrated, and integrated, depending on to what extent the product and service elements (e.g. maintenance service, spare parts) are combined into a single offering.\n\n== Examples ==\nThe following existing offerings illustrate the PSS concept:<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Ostaeyen|first=Joris|year=2014|title=Analysis of the Business Potential of Product-Service Systems for Investment Goods.

After a selection process 4 were chosen for further development of their business models through a series of tools (debugging, light experimentation, simulation, etc.).

First, product ownership is not transferred to the customers, but remains with the PSS operating firm. Second, the purpose of a product is different if it is used within PSS solutions than compared to the purpose of products in classical transaction based business models. When offering PSS, products are used as a means for offering a service. Third, the profit function of PSS operating firms differs substantially from profit functions of firms that develop, manufacture and sell their products.<ref>Tietze and Hansen (2013).

On March 3, 2004, at Disney's annual shareholders' meeting, a surprising 43% of Disney's shareholders, predominantly rallied by Roy Disney and fellow former board member [[Stanley Gold]], voted to oppose the re-election of Eisner to the corporate board of directors. This vigorous opposition, unusual in major public corporations, persuaded Disney's board to replace Eisner as chairman with [[George J. Mitchell]]; he did, however, remain as chief executive. This \"Save Disney\" campaign regarded Mitchell himself unfavorably and in the same election 25% of shareholders opposed Mitchell's re-election to the board.\n\nAs criticism of Eisner intensified in the wake of the shareholder meeting, his position became increasingly tenuous, culminating on March 13, 2005 with the announcement of Eisner's resignation as CEO effective September 30, one year before his contract would expire. On July 8, Roy and the Walt Disney Company, agreed to \"put aside their differences.\" Roy rejoined the board as a non-voting Director Emeritus and consultant. Roy and Gold consequently shut down their SaveDisney.com website effective August 7 that year.\n\nAs announced, on September 30, Eisner resigned both chief executive and a member of the board. Severing all formal ties with the company, he waived his contractual rights to perks such as use of a corporate jet, a [[Golden Pass (Disney)|Golden Pass]] and an office at the company's Burbank headquarters. [[Bob Iger]], Eisner's long-time lieutenant, who had been effectively running the company, now assumed the title of CEO. One of Roy Disney's stated reasons for engineering his second \"Save Disney\" initiative had been Eisner's well-publicized disputes with long-time production partner [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and its CEO [[Steve Jobs]], with whom Disney had produced such [[Computer animation|computer animated]] hits as ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', which were both critically acclaimed and financially successful for both partners. Iger quickly repaired the estrangement, and on January 24, 2006, the company announced the acquisition of Pixar in an all-stock deal worth $7.4 billion. This deal made Jobs, best known as co-founder and CEO of [[Apple, Inc]], Disney's largest shareholder with 7% of all outstanding shares and gave him a new seat on Disney's board of directors. Eisner, who retained 1.7% of shares, became Disney's second-largest shareholder, followed by Roy Disney, with 1% of shares.

This \"Save Disney\" campaign regarded Mitchell himself unfavorably and in the same election 25% of shareholders opposed Mitchell's re-election to the board.\n\nAs criticism of Eisner intensified in the wake of the shareholder meeting, his position became increasingly tenuous, culminating on March 13, 2005 with the announcement of Eisner's resignation as CEO effective September 30, one year before his contract would expire. On July 8, Roy and the Walt Disney Company, agreed to \"put aside their differences.\" Roy rejoined the board as a non-voting Director Emeritus and consultant. Roy and Gold consequently shut down their SaveDisney.com website effective August 7 that year.\n\nAs announced, on September 30, Eisner resigned both chief executive and a member of the board. Severing all formal ties with the company, he waived his contractual rights to perks such as use of a corporate jet, a [[Golden Pass (Disney)|Golden Pass]] and an office at the company's Burbank headquarters. [[Bob Iger]], Eisner's long-time lieutenant, who had been effectively running the company, now assumed the title of CEO. One of Roy Disney's stated reasons for engineering his second \"Save Disney\" initiative had been Eisner's well-publicized disputes with long-time production partner [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and its CEO [[Steve Jobs]], with whom Disney had produced such [[Computer animation|computer animated]] hits as ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', which were both critically acclaimed and financially successful for both partners. Iger quickly repaired the estrangement, and on January 24, 2006, the company announced the acquisition of Pixar in an all-stock deal worth $7.4 billion. This deal made Jobs, best known as co-founder and CEO of [[Apple, Inc]], Disney's largest shareholder with 7% of all outstanding shares and gave him a new seat on Disney's board of directors. Eisner, who retained 1.7% of shares, became Disney's second-largest shareholder, followed by Roy Disney, with 1% of shares. Disney's second \"Save Disney\" campaign against Eisner was chronicled by [[James B. Stewart]] in his best-selling book, ''[[DisneyWar]]''.\n\n==Other work==\n* Disney was a trustee of the [[California Institute of the Arts]],<ref>{{cite web|title=CalArts: Officers & Trustees |url=http://www.calarts.edu/aboutcalarts/officerstrustees |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420213717/http://calarts.edu/aboutcalarts/officerstrustees |archivedate=April 20, 2008}}</ref> another institution founded by his uncle Walt.\n* He appeared as himself in a voice cameo in an episode of the animated show ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' (later shown on ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'') in which [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] accidentally sent him an angry fax meant for [[Mortimer Mouse (Disney)|Mortimer Mouse]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* He appeared in the 1985 documentary film ''[[The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal]]'' (produced and directed by [[Arnold Leibovit]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* He also appeared in the 2002 documentary ''[[The Sweatbox]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* He made an appearance in the 2007 documentary ''[[The Pixar Story]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* He executive produced the multiple network anti-drug program ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]'' in 1990.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n* In 1998 he executive produced ''[[The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit]]'', written by [[Ray Bradbury]] and directed by [[Stuart Gordon]].

The design of the Chuck Taylor All Star has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in the 1920s. The shoe consists of a stitched upper portion, a toe cap that is usually made of white rubber, and a sole that is usually made of brown rubber. Although Chuck Taylors are made of various materials such as leather, the original and most widely known version of the shoe is made from cotton [[canvas]]. The innovative detail of the original shoe was the \"loose lining\" of soft canvas that  was intended to provide flexibility and prevent blisters.\n\nThe '''Chuck Taylor II''', an improved model, was announced by company management in July 2015.

The design of the Chuck Taylor All Star has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in the 1920s. The shoe consists of a stitched upper portion, a toe cap that is usually made of white rubber, and a sole that is usually made of brown rubber. Although Chuck Taylors are made of various materials such as leather, the original and most widely known version of the shoe is made from cotton [[canvas]]. The innovative detail of the original shoe was the \"loose lining\" of soft canvas that  was intended to provide flexibility and prevent blisters.\n\nThe '''Chuck Taylor II''', an improved model, was announced by company management in July 2015. Incorporating Nike technology, it retains the outward appearance of the original shoe while employing a full-length Lunarlon insole.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Gerald |title=Is the Converse Chuck Taylor II Really Better Than the Original? |url=https://solecollector.com/news/2015/08/converse-chuck-2-comparison |website=Sole Collector |publisher=Complex Media |accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=CTII>{{cite news |title= Converse's new Chuck Taylors get a comfort boost:  Minimalist sneaker launched in 1917 receives upgrade with Nike tech |url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/07/21/after-years-converse-set-unveil-chuck-taylor/RdAdxoiLOs8dva8tHtVxLN/story.html?p1=Article_Trending_Most_Viewed |work= Boston Globe |date= July 22, 2015 |first= Taryn |last= Luna |access-date= July 24, 2015 |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150724175515/http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/07/21/after-years-converse-set-unveil-chuck-taylor/RdAdxoiLOs8dva8tHtVxLN/story.html?p1=Article_Trending_Most_Viewed |archivedate= July 24, 2015 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nConverse started making an early basketball shoe in 1917 and redesigned it in 1922, when [[Chuck Taylor (salesman)|Chuck Taylor]] asked the company to create a better shoe with more support and flexibility.

This case is currently on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\n==Design==\n===Early styles===\nWhen first designed in the early decades of the twentieth century, the Converse All Star had three main styles: a monochromatic shoe with a black canvas upper and black rubber soles, an all-white, high-top model with blue and red trim (designed for the 1936 Olympic Games), and an all black leather and rubber shoe.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nBy 1923 the Converse All Star shoe was designed in its present-day form after the company made improvements to the design based on [[Chuck Taylor (salesman)|Chuck Taylor]]'s input. The restyled Converse All Star basketball shoe also had a distinctive five-pointed-star logo displayed on the high-top shoe's ankle patch. In addition, Taylor's signature was incorporated \ninto the high-top's ankle patch, resulting in the design that became known as the Chuck Taylor All Star.<ref name=DeMello/><ref name=KyNewEra/><ref name=Aamidor5-10>Aamidor, \"Who Was Chuck Taylor?\" pp. 5, 10.</ref>\n\nIn 1949 Converse decided to make a black canvas shoe with a white toe guard, laces and outer wraps to create the iconic black-and-white version of Converse All Stars. In 1957 Converse introduced the low-cut \"Oxford\"-style version of the All Star shoe, and within a short time the company began to produce All Stars in multiple colors and prints. Today, Converse makes the Chuck Taylor All Star in a variety of colors, styles, prints and fabrics.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n[[File:White converse heel.JPG|thumbnail|right|A pair of white low-cut All Star sneakers, showing the current back heel logo]]\nOnly the high-cut shoe design features the iconic ankle patch with the All Star logo, but the heel of the shoe's high- and low-cut designs include a glued-on label with an \"ALL\u2605STAR\" logo.

This retro model was different from the then-current Chuck Taylor All Stars due to various changes that happened to the All Star shoes over the intervening three decades. The '70 model featured thicker canvas, a higher rubber midsole and foxing, thicker cushioning, a smaller toe cap, extra material that was stitched on the side wall behind the toe cap for reinforcement, a one-piece rubber bottom sole versus the three piece sole on the modern All Stars, and a black heel patch versus a white one on the modern All Star.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stupiddope.com/2013/02/14/who-doesnt-love-chucks-converse-1970s-chuck-taylor-all-star-collection/ |title=Who Doesn't Love Chuck's? &#124; Converse 1970s Chuck Taylor All Star Collection |publisher=stupidDOPE |accessdate=January 8, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200212/http://stupiddope.com/2013/02/14/who-doesnt-love-chucks-converse-1970s-chuck-taylor-all-star-collection/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Chuck II Knit, black laces.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Chuck II with knit canvas]]\n\n===Chuck Taylor All Star II===\nOn July 28, 2015, Converse released the Chuck Taylor All Star II.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=196\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=203}}</ref>\n\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=196\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nEarly sources indicate that that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4 |pages=203}}</ref>\n\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit.

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884. The Habr Awal continued a to have a lucrative trading agreement with Arabs and Indian traders, many of whom were also under British rule in their respective nations.

Habr Awal Commanders carried out many successful operations that led to the decisive victory of the group and to the downfall of the Siad Barre regime.\n\nIn western Somaliland, this group was prominently represented in the 99 division of the [[Somali National Movement]] which was founded in [[Gabiley]] with the majority of the divisions troops consisting of militia fighters hailing from the Jibril Abokor section of the Sa'ad Muuse sub-clan of the Habr Awal that dominates the [[Gabiley]] region. The 99 division was Commanded by General [[Mohamed Hasan Abdullahi]] (Jidhif) of the Jibril Abokor who successfully conquered [[Awdal]] region and completely erased the presence of [[Somali National Army]] forces within [[Gabiley]] and [[Awdal]] and forced the local [[Gadabursi]] inhabitants of [[Awdal]] to pledge loyalty to [[Somaliland]]. As commander of the 99 division, General [[Mohamed Hasan Abdullahi]] (Jidhif) also established a [[Somali National Movement]] military base in [[Zeila]] where the [[Somali National Movement|SNM]] occupied the Awdal region for 4 years and successfully defeated attempts by USF militia forces loyal to [[Djibouti]] who tried to take advantage of the fall of Siad Barre's [[Military Junta]] in 1991 and annex the city of [[Zeila]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=lAyeNqKK7bQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=jibril+abokor+militia#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= Hassan Ali Jama, Who cares about Somalia |isbn= 9783899300758 |last1= Jama |first1= Hassan Ali |year= 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn central Somaliland, [[Muse Bihi Abdi]] and his Hussein Abokor section of the Sa'ad Muuse sub-clan of the Habr Awal successfully liberated [[Hargeisa]] from the brutal communist regime and played a preeminent role for the SNM where they liberated [[Hargeisa]], and [[Faraweyne]].

He is said to have been descended from Prophet Mohammed's daughter [[Fatimah]]. Hence the Sheikh belonged to the [[Ashraf]] or [[Sayyid|Sada]], titles given to the descendants of the prophet. He married two local women in Somalia that left him eight sons, one of them being Abdirahman (Awal). The descendants of those eight sons are the what is known as Isaaq clan today.\n\nThe grave of Zubeyr Awal, the eponymous ancestor of the Habr Awal subclan of the [[Isaaq]], is located in Jidali in [[Sanaag]] which is about 100&nbsp;km east of the tomb of his grandfather Sheikh Ishaaq Bin Ahmed, the founding father of the [[Isaaq]] clan, whose tomb is located in the coastal town of [[Maydh]].\n\n===Medieval Period (Conquest of Abbysinia)===\n\nHistorically the Habr Awal were part of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and are mentioned in the renowned \"Futuh Al-Habash\" for their major contributions in the [[Abyssinian-Adal war]] as the Habr Magaadle along with the [[Garhajis]], Arap and Ayub clans against the [[Abyssinian empire]], and also for producing a historical figure known as Ahmad Girri bin Husain who was the righthand partner of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] and a chieftain for the Habr Magaadle forces during the Abyssinian\u2013Adal war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://makhtota.ksu.edu.sa/makhtota/554/16|title=\u0645\u062e\u0637\u0648\u0637\u0627\u062a > \u0628\u0647\u062c\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 > \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629 \u0631\u0642\u0645 16|website=makhtota.ksu.edu.sa|access-date=2017-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Early Modern Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal have a rich mercantile history largely due to their possession of the major Somali port of [[Berbera]], which was the chief port and settlement of Habr Awal clan during the early modern period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reerahmednuux.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/piece-of-berbera-history-reer-ahmed-nuh-ismail/ |title=Piece of Berbera History: Reer Ahmed Nuh Ismail |website=wordpress.com|date=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Habr Awal as a whole are a rich people, mainly thanks to the trade passing though the port of Berbera which lies in the territory of the Sa\u2019ad Musa.<ref>{{cite book|title= Ethnographic Survey of Africa, Volume 5 |date=1969|pages=24|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Berbera Mosque Engraving.jpg|thumb|350px|Engraving of Berbera, including a Mosque and fort]]\nThe Habr Awal merchants had extensive trade relations with Arab and Indian merchants from Arabia and the Indian subcontinent respectively. When these foreign traders arrived in [[Berbera]] and [[Bulhar]] to conduct trade, there was a mutually beneficial arrangement based on the abban (protection) system between them and the local Ahmed Nuh and Yunis Nuh lineages of Sa\u2019ad Musa, Habr Awal:\n\n<blockquote>Before this, and prior to the British settlement at Aden in 1839, the Ayyal Yunis and Ayyal Ahmed lineages of the Habr Awal clan had held Berbera and jointly managed its trade, sharing in the profits on all commercial transactions as \u2018protectors\u2019 (abans) of foreign merchants from Arabia and India. When under the stimulus of developments at Aden the port\u2019s prosperity markedly increased, the numerically dominant Ayyal Yunis drove out their rival kinsmen and declared themselves commercial masters of Berbera. This led to a feud in which each side sought outside help; the defeated Ayyal Yunis turned to Haji Shirmarke \u2018Ali and his Habr Yunis clansmen for support. With this backing, they were then able to re-establish themselves and to expel the Ayyal Yunis who moved to the small roadstead of Bulhar, some miles to the west of Berbera.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=I.M.|title= The Modern History of Somaliland: from Nation to State |date=1965|publisher=Praeger|pages=35|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNot only did the Habr Awal host foreign merchants at their ports, they also conducted trade missions on their own vessels to the Arabian ports<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prichard|first1=J.

The majority of the Somali merchants who frequented Aden and other Southern Arabian ports hailed from the Habr Awal clan. They procured various raw goods from Harar and the interior in exchange for manufactured goods. During their stay, the Habr Awal rented their own houses and hired their own servants, whereas other Somali clans tended to stay with relatives already established across the Gulf. \n\n<blockquote>Merchants. \u2014 These are generally members of the Habr Awal tribe. They bring from Harrar and the Galla country, coffee, saffron (bastard), tusks (ivory), and feathers, taking away in return zinc, brass, broad cloth, and piece goods. They remain in Aden for about twenty days at a time during the trading season, which lasts about nine months,' making four trips. During their residence they hire a house, and are accompanied by their own domestics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Frederick|title=An Account of the British Settlement of Aden in Arabia|date=1877|publisher=Cengage Gale|pages=41|language=english}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the interior, Habr Awal trade caravans (khafilas) were a frequent sight according to contemporary European accounts of the Somali Peninsula:\n\n<blockquote>On leaving Hargeisa we travelled for many miles through beautiful park-like land, alive with birds and jungle fowl. We met the usual Somali khafilas [trading caravans] of Habr-Awal men, carrying their skins, gums, ghee, and coffee to our port at Bulhar, situated between Berbera and Zeila.<ref>'Twixt sirdar & Menelik: an account of a year's expedition from Zeila to Cairo, p. 18, 1901</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Somalis from the deep interior, principally those from the [[Ogaden (clan)|Ogaden]], also gained most of their resources from the Habr Awal merchants who they called \"iidoor\", an enviable pejorative meaning [[merchant]] or trader, a reference to the mercantile nature of the Habr Awal traders at the time.<ref name=\"Info\">Somali Poetry, Lewis & Adrzejewski, 1964, pp. 111\u2013115</ref>\n\n===British Protectorate Period===\n\nThe Habr Awal clan came under the [[British Protectorate]] by signing a treaty with the [[British Empire]] on 14 July 1884.

In the 19th century it acquired a meaning more closely related to biological deformities, mostly in the field of botany. Currently, its most instrumental meaning is that of the medical study of teratogenesis, [[Congenital disorder|congenital malformations]] or individuals with significant malformations. Historically, people have used many pejorative terms to describe/label cases of significant physical malformations.\nIn the 1960s [[David Weyhe Smith|David W.

With the growth of understanding of the origins of birth defects, the field of teratology {{as of | 2015 | lc = on}} overlaps with other fields of science, including [[developmental biology]], [[embryology]], and [[genetics]].\nUntil the 1940s teratologists regarded birth defects as primarily hereditary.

These principles of teratology were put forth by [[James G. Wilson|Jim Wilson]] in 1959 and in his monograph ''Environment and Birth Defects''.<ref name=\"isbn0-12-757750-5\">{{cite book |author=James G. Wilson |title=Environment and Birth Defects (Environmental Science Series) |publisher=Academic Pr |location=London |year=1973 |pages= |isbn=0-12-757750-5 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://archive.org/details/environmentbirth00wils }}</ref> These principles guide the study and understanding of teratogenic agents and their effects on developing organisms:\n\n# Susceptibility to teratogenesis depends on the [[genotype]] of the [[conceptus]] and the manner in which this interacts with adverse environmental factors.\n# Susceptibility to teratogenesis varies with the developmental stage at the time of exposure to an adverse influence. There are critical periods of susceptibility to agents and organ systems affected by these agents.\n# Teratogenic agents act in specific ways on developing cells and tissues to initiate sequences of abnormal developmental events.\n# The access of adverse influences to developing tissues depends on the nature of the influence. Several factors affect the ability of a teratogen to contact a developing conceptus, such as the nature of the agent itself, route and degree of maternal exposure, rate of placental transfer and systemic absorption, and composition of the maternal and embryonic/fetal genotypes.\n# There are four manifestations of deviant development (Death, Malformation, Growth Retardation and Functional Defect).\n# Manifestations of deviant development increase in frequency and degree as dosage increases from the [[No Observable Adverse Effect Level]] (NOAEL) to a dose producing 100% Lethality (LD100).\n\nStudies designed to test the teratogenic potential of environmental agents use animal model systems (e.g., rat, mouse, rabbit, dog, and monkey). Early teratologists exposed pregnant animals to environmental agents and observed the fetuses for gross visceral and skeletal abnormalities. While this is still part of the teratological evaluation procedures today, the field of Teratology is moving to a more [[molecular]] level, seeking the mechanism(s) of action by which these agents act. One example of this is the use of mammalian animal models to evaluate the molecular role of Teratogens in the development of embryonic populations, such as the [[Neural crest|Neural Crest]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cerrizuela|first=Santiago|last2=Vega\u2010Lopez|first2=Guillermo A.|last3=Aybar|first3=Manuel J.|title=The role of teratogens in neural crest development|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bdr2.1644|journal=Birth Defects Research|language=en|volume=n/a|issue=n/a|doi=10.1002/bdr2.1644|issn=2472-1727}}</ref> , which can lead to the development of [[Neurocristopathies]]. [[Genetically modified]] mice are commonly used for this purpose. In addition, pregnancy registries are large, prospective studies that monitor exposures women receive during their pregnancies and record the outcome of their births. These studies provide information about possible risks of medications or other exposures in human pregnancies.\n\nUnderstanding how a '''teratogen''' causes its effect is not only important in preventing congenital abnormalities but also has the potential for developing new therapeutic drugs safe for use with pregnant women.\n\n===Humans===\n{{Main|Congenital disorder}}\nIn [[human]]s, [[congenital disorder]]s resulted in about 510,000 deaths globally in 2010.<ref name=Loz2012>{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=December 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095\u2013128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30050819}}</ref>\n\nAbout 3% of newborns have a \"major physical anomaly\", meaning a physical anomaly that has cosmetic or functional significance.<ref>Kumar, Abbas and Fausto (eds.), ''Robbins and Cotran's Pathologic Basis of Disease, 7th edition'', p.&nbsp;470.</ref>\n\n====Vaccinating while pregnant====\nIn [[human]]s, vaccination has become readily available, and is important to the prevention of some diseases like polio, rubella, and smallpox, among others. There has been no association between congenital malformations and vaccination, as shown in Finland in which expecting mothers received the oral polio vaccine and saw no difference in infant outcomes than mothers who had not received the vaccine.<ref name=Harj1993>{{cite journal|last=Harjulehto-Mervaala|first=T|title=Oral Polio Vaccination during Pregnancy: No Increase in the Occurrence of Congenital Malformations|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1993|volume=138|issue=6|pages=407\u2013414|pmid= 8213746|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116873}}</ref> However, it is still not recommended to vaccinate for polio while pregnant unless there is risk of infection <ref>{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Vaccinating Pregnant Women|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/guidelines.html#polio|website=cdc.gov|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)|quote=Although no adverse effects of IPV have been documented among pregnant women or their fetuses, vaccination of pregnant women should be avoided on theoretical grounds.

Another important implication of this includes the ability to get the influenza vaccine while pregnant. During the 1918 and 1957 influenza pandemics, mortality in pregnant women was 45%. However, even with prevention through vaccination, influenza vaccination in pregnant women remains low at 12%.

[[Potassium iodide]] in its raw form is a mild irritant and should be handled with gloves. Chronic overexposure can have adverse effects on the thyroid.\n*[[Vertically transmitted infection]]\n*Lack of nutrients. For example, lack of folate acid in the [[nutrition in pregnancy]] for humans can result in [[spina bifida]]. Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate acid. Folic is added to processed food products, such as flour and breakfast cereals. High levels of un-metabolized folic acid have been associated with several health problems.<ref>https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid-vs-folate</ref>\n*Physical restraint. An example is [[Potter syndrome]] due to [[oligohydramnios]] in humans.\n*[[Genetic disorder]]s\n*[[Alcohol and Pregnancy|Alcohol consumption]] during pregnancy.\n\n==Other animals==\n\n===Fossil record===\n{{Further|Paleopathology}}\nEvidence for congenital deformities found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. Fossils bearing evidence of congenital deformity are scientifically significant because they can help scientists infer the evolutionary history of life's developmental processes. For instance, because a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' specimen has been discovered with a [[block vertebra]], it means that vertebrae have been developing the same basic way since at least the most recent common ancestor of dinosaurs and mammals. Other notable fossil deformities include a hatchling specimen of the bird-like dinosaur, ''[[Troodon]]'', the tip of whose jaw was twisted.<ref name=\"molnar-pathology\">Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic  Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D.

For example, the discovery of abnormal flowers\u2014for example, flowers with leaves instead of petals, or flowers with staminoid pistils\u2014furnished important evidence for the \"[[ABC model of flower development|foliar theory]]\", the theory that all flower parts are highly specialised leaves.\n\n===Types of deformations in vegetals===\nPlants can have mutations that leads to different types of deformations such as:\n*[[fasciation]] : development of the apex (growing tip) in a flat plane perpendicular to the axis of elongation,\n*[[variegation]] : degenerescence of genes, manifesting itself among other things by anomalous pigmentation,\n*[[virescence]] : anomalous development of a green pigmentation in unexpected parts of the plant,\n*[[phyllody]] : floral organs or fruits are transformed into leaves,\n*[[witch's broom]] : unusually high multiplication of branches in the upper part of the plant, mainly tree,\n*[[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|pelory]] : zygomorphic flower regress to their ancestral actinomorph symetry,\n*proliferation : repetitive growth of an entire organ like a flower\n\n[[Gall| Galls]] are not part of the vegetal teratology as they are outgrowth due to external factors like insects bites or parasites.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Biology}}\n* [[Carcinogen]]\n* [[Congenital abnormalities]]\n* [[Mutagen]]\n* [[Teratoma]]\n* [[Thalidomide]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.teratology.org/ Society of Teratology]\n*[http://www.etsoc.com/ European Teratology Society]\n*[http://www.otispregnancy.org/ Organization of Teratology Information Specialists]\n*[http://www.marchofdimes.org/ March of Dimes Foundation]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131212054644/http://www.nyam.org/library/rare-book-room/exhibits/telling-of-wonders/ A Telling of Wonders: Teratology in Western Medicine through 1800 (New York Academy of Medicine Historical Collections)]\n*[http://www.reprotox.org/ The Reproductive Toxicology Center Database]\n\n{{Biology-footer}}\n{{Developmental biology}}\n{{HealthIssuesOfPlastics}}\n\n[[Category:Developmental biology]]\n[[Category:Radiation health effects]]\n[[Category:Teratogens| Teratology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|The study of all developmental anomalies}}\n{{Redirect|Teratogenesis|the Revocation extended play|Teratogenesis (EP)}}\n'''Teratology''' is the study of abnormalities of [[physiological development]].

In the 19th century it acquired a meaning more closely related to biological deformities, mostly in the field of botany. Currently, its most instrumental meaning is that of the medical study of teratogenesis, [[Congenital disorder|congenital malformations]] or individuals with significant malformations. Historically, people have used many pejorative terms to describe/label cases of significant physical malformations.\nIn the 1960s [[David Weyhe Smith|David W. Smith]] of the [[University of Washington]] Medical School (one of the researchers who became known in 1973 for the discovery of [[fetal alcohol syndrome]]<ref name=Jonesetal1973>{{cite journal |author1=Jones K.L. |author2=Smith D.W |author3=Ulleland C.N. |author4=Streissguth A.P. | year = 1973 | title = Pattern of malformation in offspring of chronic alcoholic mothers | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 7815| pages = 1267\u20131271 | pmid = 4126070 | doi= 10.1016/S0140-6736(73)91291-9}}</ref>), popularized the term ''teratology''.  With the growth of understanding of the origins of birth defects, the field of teratology {{as of | 2015 | lc = on}} overlaps with other fields of science, including [[developmental biology]], [[embryology]], and [[genetics]].\nUntil the 1940s teratologists regarded birth defects as primarily hereditary. In 1941 the first well-documented cases of environmental agents being the cause of severe birth defects were reported.{{by whom|date=November 2015}}<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title=Birth Defects|url= http://howmed.net/anatomy/embryology/birth-defects/|publisher=Howmed.net|accessdate= 2015-11-01\n| quote = Until 1940, it was assumed that congenital defects were caused primarily by hereditary factors.

These principles of teratology were put forth by [[James G. Wilson|Jim Wilson]] in 1959 and in his monograph ''Environment and Birth Defects''.<ref name=\"isbn0-12-757750-5\">{{cite book |author=James G. Wilson |title=Environment and Birth Defects (Environmental Science Series) |publisher=Academic Pr |location=London |year=1973 |pages= |isbn=0-12-757750-5 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://archive.org/details/environmentbirth00wils }}</ref> These principles guide the study and understanding of teratogenic agents and their effects on developing organisms:\n\n# Susceptibility to teratogenesis depends on the [[genotype]] of the [[conceptus]] and the manner in which this interacts with adverse environmental factors.\n# Susceptibility to teratogenesis varies with the developmental stage at the time of exposure to an adverse influence. There are critical periods of susceptibility to agents and organ systems affected by these agents.\n# Teratogenic agents act in specific ways on developing cells and tissues to initiate sequences of abnormal developmental events.\n# The access of adverse influences to developing tissues depends on the nature of the influence. Several factors affect the ability of a teratogen to contact a developing conceptus, such as the nature of the agent itself, route and degree of maternal exposure, rate of placental transfer and systemic absorption, and composition of the maternal and embryonic/fetal genotypes.\n# There are four manifestations of deviant development (Death, Malformation, Growth Retardation and Functional Defect).\n# Manifestations of deviant development increase in frequency and degree as dosage increases from the [[No Observable Adverse Effect Level]] (NOAEL) to a dose producing 100% Lethality (LD100).\n\nStudies designed to test the teratogenic potential of environmental agents use animal model systems (e.g., rat, mouse, rabbit, dog, and monkey). Early teratologists exposed pregnant animals to environmental agents and observed the fetuses for gross visceral and skeletal abnormalities. While this is still part of the teratological evaluation procedures today, the field of Teratology is moving to a more [[molecular]] level, seeking the mechanism(s) of action by which these agents act. [[Genetically modified]] mice are commonly used for this purpose. In addition, pregnancy registries are large, prospective studies that monitor exposures women receive during their pregnancies and record the outcome of their births. These studies provide information about possible risks of medications or other exposures in human pregnancies.\n\nUnderstanding how a '''teratogen''' causes its effect is not only important in preventing congenital abnormalities but also has the potential for developing new therapeutic drugs safe for use with pregnant women.\n\n===Humans===\n{{Main|Congenital disorder}}\nIn [[human]]s, [[congenital disorder]]s resulted in about 510,000 deaths globally in 2010.<ref name=Loz2012>{{cite journal|last=Lozano|first=R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=December 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095\u2013128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30050819}}</ref>\n\nAbout 3% of newborns have a \"major physical anomaly\", meaning a physical anomaly that has cosmetic or functional significance.<ref>Kumar, Abbas and Fausto (eds.), ''Robbins and Cotran's Pathologic Basis of Disease, 7th edition'', p.&nbsp;470.</ref>\n\n====Vaccinating while pregnant====\nIn [[human]]s, vaccination has become readily available, and is important to the prevention of some diseases like polio, rubella, and smallpox, among others. There has been no association between congenital malformations and vaccination, as shown in Finland in which expecting mothers received the oral polio vaccine and saw no difference in infant outcomes than mothers who had not received the vaccine.<ref name=Harj1993>{{cite journal|last=Harjulehto-Mervaala|first=T|title=Oral Polio Vaccination during Pregnancy: No Increase in the Occurrence of Congenital Malformations|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1993|volume=138|issue=6|pages=407\u2013414|pmid= 8213746|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116873}}</ref> However, it is still not recommended to vaccinate for polio while pregnant unless there is risk of infection <ref>{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Vaccinating Pregnant Women|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/hcp/guidelines.html#polio|website=cdc.gov|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)|quote=Although no adverse effects of IPV have been documented among pregnant women or their fetuses, vaccination of pregnant women should be avoided on theoretical grounds. However, if a pregnant woman is at increased risk for infection and requires immediate protection against polio, IPV can be administered in accordance with the recommended schedules for adults.}}</ref>.  Another important implication of this includes the ability to get the influenza vaccine while pregnant. During the 1918 and 1957 influenza pandemics, mortality in pregnant women was 45%. However, even with prevention through vaccination, influenza vaccination in pregnant women remains low at 12%. Munoz et al. demonstrated that there was no adverse outcomes observed in the new infants or mothers.<ref name=Mun2005>{{cite journal|last=Munoz|first=F|title=Safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=2005|volume=192|issue=4|pages=1098\u20131106|doi= 10.1016/j.ajog.2004.12.019|pmid=15846187}}</ref>\n\n===Causes===\n{{Further|Congenital disorder}}\nCauses of teratogenesis can broadly be classified as:\n*Toxic substances, such as, for humans, [[drugs in pregnancy]] and [[Environmental toxins and fetal development|environmental toxins in pregnancy]].\n**[[Potassium iodide]] is a possible teratogen. [[Potassium iodide]] in its raw form is a mild irritant and should be handled with gloves. Chronic overexposure can have adverse effects on the thyroid.\n*[[Vertically transmitted infection]]\n*Lack of nutrients. For example, lack of folate acid in the [[nutrition in pregnancy]] for humans can result in [[spina bifida]]. Folic acid is a synthetic form of folate acid. Folic is added to processed food products, such as flour and breakfast cereals. High levels of un-metabolized folic acid have been associated with several health problems.<ref>https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/folic-acid-vs-folate</ref>\n*Physical restraint. An example is [[Potter syndrome]] due to [[oligohydramnios]] in humans.\n*[[Genetic disorder]]s\n*[[Alcohol and Pregnancy|Alcohol consumption]] during pregnancy.\n\n==Other animals==\n\n===Fossil record===\n{{Further|Paleopathology}}\nEvidence for congenital deformities found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. Fossils bearing evidence of congenital deformity are scientifically significant because they can help scientists infer the evolutionary history of life's developmental processes. For instance, because a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' specimen has been discovered with a [[block vertebra]], it means that vertebrae have been developing the same basic way since at least the most recent common ancestor of dinosaurs and mammals. Other notable fossil deformities include a hatchling specimen of the bird-like dinosaur, ''[[Troodon]]'', the tip of whose jaw was twisted.<ref name=\"molnar-pathology\">Molnar, R.

For example, the discovery of abnormal flowers\u2014for example, flowers with leaves instead of petals, or flowers with staminoid pistils\u2014furnished important evidence for the \"[[ABC model of flower development|foliar theory]]\", the theory that all flower parts are highly specialised leaves.\n\n===Types of deformations in vegetals===\nPlants can have mutations that leads to different types of deformations such as:\n*[[fasciation]] : development of the apex (growing tip) in a flat plane perpendicular to the axis of elongation,\n*[[variegation]] : degenerescence of genes, manifesting itself among other things by anomalous pigmentation,\n*[[virescence]] : anomalous development of a green pigmentation in unexpected parts of the plant,\n*[[phyllody]] : floral organs or fruits are transformed into leaves,\n*[[witch's broom]] : unusually high multiplication of branches in the upper part of the plant, mainly tree,\n*[[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|pelory]] : zygomorphic flower regress to their ancestral actinomorph symetry,\n*proliferation : repetitive growth of an entire organ like a flower\n\n[[Gall| Galls]] are not part of the vegetal teratology as they are outgrowth due to external factors like insects bites or parasites.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Biology}}\n* [[Carcinogen]]\n* [[Congenital abnormalities]]\n* [[Mutagen]]\n* [[Teratoma]]\n* [[Thalidomide]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.teratology.org/ Society of Teratology]\n*[http://www.etsoc.com/ European Teratology Society]\n*[http://www.otispregnancy.org/ Organization of Teratology Information Specialists]\n*[http://www.marchofdimes.org/ March of Dimes Foundation]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131212054644/http://www.nyam.org/library/rare-book-room/exhibits/telling-of-wonders/ A Telling of Wonders: Teratology in Western Medicine through 1800 (New York Academy of Medicine Historical Collections)]\n*[http://www.reprotox.org/ The Reproductive Toxicology Center Database]\n\n{{Biology-footer}}\n{{Developmental biology}}\n{{HealthIssuesOfPlastics}}\n\n[[Category:Developmental biology]]\n[[Category:Radiation health effects]]\n[[Category:Teratogens| Teratology]]\n", "name_user": "Santicerri", "label": "safe", "comment": "I added how teratogenesis is investigating the role of teratogens in the development of embryonic populations such as the Neural Crest", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratology"}
