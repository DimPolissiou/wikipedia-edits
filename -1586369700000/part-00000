{"title_page": "Wake-on-LAN", "text_new": "A physical Wake-on-LAN connector (white object in foreground) featured on the IBM PCI Token-Ring Adapter 2.\n\nWake-on-LAN (WoL) is an Ethernet or token ring computer networking standard that allows a computer to be turned on or awakened by a network message.\n\nThe message is usually sent to the target computer by a program executed on a device connected to the same local area network, such as a smartphone. It is also possible to initiate the message from another network by using subnet directed broadcasts or a WOL gateway service. Equivalent terms include wake on WAN, remote wake-up, power on by LAN, power up by LAN, resume by LAN, resume on LAN and wake up on LAN. If the computer being awakened is communicating via Wi-Fi, a supplementary standard called Wake on Wireless LAN (WoWLAN) must be employed.\n\nThe WOL and WoWLAN standards are often supplemented by vendors to provide protocol-transparent on-demand services, for example in the Apple Bonjour wake-on-demand (Sleep Proxy) feature.\n\n<br />\n\n==History==\nIn October 1996, [[Intel]] and [[IBM]] formed the ''Advanced Manageability Alliance'' (AMA). In April 1997, this alliance introduced the Wake-on-LAN technology.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/519210/intel_ibm_strike_deal_lower_pc_ownership_costs/ |title=Intel, IBM strike deal to lower PC ownership costs |first=Kristi |last=Essick |work=[[Computerworld]] |location=New Zealand |date=31 October 1996 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/2705.wss |title=IBM Announces Universal Management - Industry's Most Comprehensive Tools to Lower Total Cost of Ownership |date=14 April 1998 |work=IBM News Room |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Principle of operation==\n[[Ethernet]] connections, including home and work networks, wireless data networks  and the [[Internet]] itself, are based on frames sent between computers. Wake-on-LAN (\"WOL\") is implemented using a specially designed frame called a [[#Magic packet|magic packet]], which is sent to all computers in a network, among them the computer to be awakened. The magic packet contains the [[MAC address]] of the destination computer, an identifying number built into each [[Network interface controller|network interface card]] (\"NIC\") or other ethernet device in a computer, that enables it to be uniquely recognized and addressed on a network. Powered-down or turned off computers capable of Wake-on-LAN will contain network devices able to \"listen\" to incoming packets in low-power mode while the system is powered down. If a magic packet is received that is directed to the device's MAC address, the NIC signals the computer's [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supply]] or [[motherboard]] to initiate system wake-up, in the same way that pressing the power button would do.\n\nThe magic packet is sent on the [[data link layer]] (layer 2 in the [[OSI model]]) and when sent, is broadcast to all attached devices on a given network, using the network [[broadcast address]]; the IP-address (layer 3 in the OSI model) is not used.\n\nBecause Wake-on-LAN is built upon broadcast technology, it can generally only be used within the current network subnet. There are some exceptions, though, and Wake-on-LAN can operate across any network in practice, given appropriate configuration and hardware, including remote wake-up across the Internet.\n\nIn order for Wake-on-LAN to work, parts of the network interface need to stay on. This consumes a small amount of [[standby power]], much less than normal operating power. The link speed is usually reduced to the lowest possible speed to not waste power (e.g. a Gigabit Ethernet NIC maintains only a 10&nbsp;Mbit/s link). Disabling wake-on-LAN when not needed, can very slightly reduce power consumption on computers that are switched off but still plugged into a power socket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesswatts.org/tips/ethernet.php |work=Less Watts |title=Ethernet Tips & Tricks |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126071350/http://www.lesswatts.org/tips/ethernet.php |archivedate=November 26, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Magic packet===\n\nThe ''magic packet'' is a broadcast [[Ethernet frame|frame]] containing anywhere within its payload 6 [[bytes]] of all 255 (FF FF FF FF FF FF in [[hexadecimal]]), followed by sixteen repetitions of the target computer's 48-bit MAC address, for a total of 102 bytes.\n\nSince the magic packet is only scanned for the string above, and not actually parsed by a full protocol stack, it could be sent as any network- and transport-layer protocol, although it is typically sent as a [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] [[datagram]] to [[TCP and UDP port|port]] 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://community.landesk.com/support/docs/DOC-1866 |title=Understanding Wake On LAN |work=LANdesk.com |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> 7 or 9, or directly over Ethernet as [[EtherType]] 0x0842.<ref>[http://wiki.wireshark.org/WakeOnLAN WakeOnLAN] on Wireshark wiki.</ref> A [[connection-oriented]] transport-layer protocol like [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] is less suited for this task as it requires establishing an active connection before sending user data.\n\nA standard magic packet has the following basic limitations:\n\n* Requires destination computer MAC address (also may require a ''SecureOn'' password)\n* Does not provide a delivery confirmation\n* May not work outside of the local network\n* Requires hardware support of Wake-on-LAN on destination computer\n* Most 802.11 wireless interfaces do not maintain a link in low power states and cannot receive a magic packet\n\nThe Wake-on-LAN implementation is designed to be very simple and to be quickly processed by the circuitry present on the network interface card with minimal power requirement. Because Wake-on-LAN operates below the IP protocol layer, IP addresses and DNS names are meaningless and so the MAC address is required.\n\n===Subnet directed broadcasts===\n\nA principal limitation of standard broadcast wake-on-LAN is that broadcast packets are generally not routed. This prevents the technique being used in larger networks or over the Internet. Subnet directed broadcasts (SDB)<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl= http://rtfm.adamant.net/books/tcp-ip_illustrated/broadcas.htm |title=TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols |chapter=Chapter 12.

SDB may require changes to intermediate router configuration. Subnet directed broadcasts are treated like unicast network packets until processed by the final (local) router. This router then broadcasts the packet using layer 2 broadcast. This technique allows a broadcast to be initiated on a remote network but requires all intervening routers to forward the SDB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/20213.pdf |title=Magic Packet Technology (White Paper, Publication# 20213, Rev: A Amendment/0) |work=AMD |date=November 1995 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb632807.aspx |title=About Subnet-Directed Broadcast Wake-Up Packets for Wake On LAN |work=Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager |year=2007 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> When preparing a network to forward SDB packets, care must be taken to filter packets so that only desired (e.g. WoL) SDB packets are permitted \u2014 otherwise the network may become a participant in [[DDoS]] attacks such as the [[Smurf Attack]].\n\n===Troubleshooting magic packets===\n\nWake-on-LAN can be a difficult technology to implement, because it requires appropriate BIOS, network card and, sometimes, operating system and router support to function reliably. In some cases, hardware may wake from one low power state but not from others. This means that due to hardware issues the computer may be waking up from the \"fully off state\" (S5) but doesn't wake from sleep or hibernation or vice versa. Also, it is not always clear what kind of magic packet a NIC expects to see.\n\nIn that case, software tools like a [[packet analyzer]] can help with Wake-on-LAN troubleshooting as they allow confirming (while the PC is still on) that the magic packet is indeed visible to a particular computer's NIC. The same magic packet can then be used to find out if the computer powers up from an offline state. This allows networking issues to be isolated from other hardware issues. In some cases they also confirm that the packet was destined for a specific PC or sent to a [[broadcast address]] and they can additionally show the packet's internals.\n\nStarting with Windows Vista, the operating system logs all wake sources in the \"System\" event log. The [[Event Viewer]] and the <code>powercfg.exe /lastwake</code> command can retrieve them.<ref name=\"download.microsoft.com\">{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/cpa002_wh06.ppt |title=ACPI In Windows Vista |first=Allen |last=Marshall |work=[[Windows Hardware Engineering Conference|WinHEC 2006]] |publisher=Microsoft |pages=23\u201325}}</ref>\n\n==Security considerations==\n\n===Unauthorized access===\n\nMagic packets are sent via the [[Data link layer|data link or OSI-2 layer]], which can be used or abused by anyone on the same LAN, unless the L2 LAN equipment is capable of (and configured for) filtering such traffic to match site-wide security requirements.\n\nFirewalls may be used to prevent clients among the public [[Wide area network|WAN]] from accessing the broadcast addresses of inside LAN segments, or routers may be configured to ignore subnet-directed broadcasts (see above.)\n\nCertain NICs support a security feature called \"SecureOn\". It allows users to store within the NIC a hexadecimal password of 6 bytes. Clients have to append this password to the magic packet. The NIC wakes the system only if the MAC address and password are correct. This security measure significantly decreases the risk of successful [[brute force attack]]s, by increasing the search space by 48 bits (6 bytes), up to 2<sup>96</sup> combinations if the MAC address is entirely unknown. However any network eavesdropping will expose the cleartext password. Still, only a few NIC and [[Router (computing)|router]] manufacturers support such security features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAbuse of the Wake-on-LAN feature only allows computers to be switched on; it does not in itself bypass password and other forms of security, and is unable to power off the machine once on. However, many client computers attempt booting from a [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE]] server when powered up by WoL. So, a combination of [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and PXE servers on the network can sometimes be used to start a computer with an attacker's boot image, bypassing any security of the installed operating system and granting access to unprotected, local disks over the network.\n\n===Interactions with network access control===\n\nThe use of Wake-on-LAN technology on enterprise networks can sometimes conflict with network access control solutions such as [[802.1x]] or MAC-based authentication, which may prevent magic packet delivery if a machine's WoL hardware has not been designed to maintain a live authentication session while in a sleep state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding 802.1X Authentication with Wake-on-LAN |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12.2SX/configuration/guide/dot1x.html#wp1133592 |work=Cisco Catalyst 6500 Release 12.2SX Software Configuration Guide}}</ref>  Configuration of these two features in tandem often requires tuning of timing parameters and thorough testing.\n\n===Data privacy===\n\nSome PCs include technology built into the [[chipset]] to improve security for Wake-on-LAN. For example, [[Intel Active Management Technology|Intel AMT]] (a component of [[Intel vPro]] technology), includes [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS), an industry-standard protocol that strengthens [[encryption]].<ref name=\"multiple-vPro-WP\"/>\n\nAMT uses TLS encryption to secure an [[Out-of-band management|out-of-band]] communication tunnel to an AMT-based PC for remote management commands such as Wake-on-LAN. AMT secures the communication tunnel with [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) 128-bit encryption and [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] with modulus lengths of 2,048 bits.<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Instructions Set |url=http://softwarecommunity.intel.com/articles/eng/3788.htm |publisher=Intel |accessdate=6 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hardening Measures Built into Intel Active Management Technology |url=http://softwarecommunity.intel.com/articles/eng/3703.htm |publisher=Intel |accessdate=11 June 2008}}</ref> Because the encrypted communication is out-of-band, the PC's hardware and firmware receive the magic packet before network traffic reaches the software stack for the operating system (OS). Since the encrypted communication occurs \"below\" the OS level, it is less vulnerable to attacks by viruses, worms, and other threats that typically target the OS level.<ref name=\"multiple-vPro-WP\">{{cite web |title=Intel Centrino 2 with vPro technology and Intel Core2 processor with vPro technology |url=http://download.intel.com/products/vpro/whitepaper/crossclient.pdf |publisher=Intel |accessdate=7 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nIT shops using Wake-on-LAN through the Intel AMT implementation can wake an AMT PC over network environments that require TLS-based security, such as [[IEEE 802.1x]], [[Cisco]] [[Network Access Control|Self Defending Network]] (SDN), and [[Microsoft]] [[Network Access Protection]] (NAP) environments.<ref name=\"multiple-vPro-WP\"/> The Intel implementation also works for [[wireless]] networks.<ref name=\"multiple-vPro-WP\"/>\n\n==Hardware requirements==\n\nWake-on-LAN support is implemented on the [[motherboard]] of a computer and the network interface (firmware), and is consequently not dependent on the operating system running on the hardware. Some operating systems can control Wake-on-LAN behaviour via NIC drivers. With older motherboards, if the network interface is a plug-in card rather than being integrated into the motherboard, the card may need to be connected to the motherboard by an additional cable. Motherboards with an embedded Ethernet controller which supports Wake-on-LAN do not need a cable. The power supply must meet [[ATX]] 2.01 specifications.\n\n===Hardware implementations===\n\nOlder motherboards must have a WAKEUP-LINK header onboard connected to the network card via a special 3-pin cable; however, systems supporting the [[PCI Local Bus|PCI]] 2.2 standard and with a PCI 2.2 compliant network adapter card do not usually require a Wake-on-LAN cable as the required standby power is relayed through the PCI bus.\n\nPCI version 2.2 supports PME (Power Management Events). PCI cards send and receive PME signals via the PCI socket directly, without the need for a Wake-on-LAN cable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xlife.zuavra.net/index.php/60/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308143030/http://xlife.zuavra.net/index.php/60/ |title=Xlife \u00bb Using Wake-On-LAN WOL/PME to power up your computer remotely |archivedate=8 March 2007 |work=zuavra.net |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><!--wrecked since 2007?-->\n\nWake-on-LAN usually needs to be enabled in the Power Management section of a PC motherboard's [[BIOS setup]] utility, although on some systems, such as Apple computers, it is enabled by default. On older systems the bios setting may be referred to as \"WOL\", on newer systems supporting PCI version 2.2, it may be referred to as \"PME\" (Power Management Events, which include WOL). It may also be necessary to configure the computer to reserve standby power for the network card when the system is shut down.\n\nIn addition, in order to get Wake-on-LAN to work, enabling this feature on the network interface card or on-board silicon is sometimes required. Details of how to do this depend upon the [[operating system]] and the device driver.\n\nLaptops powered by the Intel Centrino Processor Technology or newer<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intel.com/network/connectivity/products/wireless/prowireless_mobile.htm |title=Intel\u00ae PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection \u2013 Overview |work=Intel.com |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> (with explicit BIOS support) allow waking up the machine using wireless Wake on Wireless LAN (WoWLAN).\n\nIn most modern PCs, [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] is notified of the \"waking up\" and take control of the Power up. In ACPI, OSPM must record the \"wake source\" or the device that is causing the power-up. The device being the \"Soft\" power switch, the NIC (via Wake-on-LAN), the cover being opened, a temperature change, etc.<ref name=\"download.microsoft.com\"/>\n\nThe 3-pin WOL interface on the motherboard consist of pin-1 +5V DC (red), pin-2 Ground (black), pin-3 {{nowrap|Wake signal}} (green or yellow).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.skynet.be/sky50985/optionsb.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121141824/http://users.skynet.be/sky50985/optionsb.htm | title=How to connect the UIRT2 B |archivedate=21 January 2007 |work=skynet.be |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> By supplying the pin-3 wake signal with +5V DC the computer will be triggered to power up provided WOL is enabled in the [[BIOS]] configuration.\n\n==Software requirements==\n\nSoftware which sends a WoL magic packet is referred to in different circles as both a \"client\" and a \"server\", which can be a source of confusion.  While WoL hardware/firmware is arguably performing the role of a \"server\", web based interfaces which act as a gateway through which users can issue WoL packets without downloading a local client often become known as \"The Wake On LAN Server\" to users.  Additionally, software that administers WoL capabilities from the host OS side may be carelessly referred to as a \"client\" on occasion, and of course, machines running WoL generally tend to be end-user desktops, and as such, are \"clients\" in modern IT parlance.\n\n===Create and send the ''Magic Packet''===\n\nTo create a ''Magic Packet'' you need to know the MAC address of the specific computer that will be turned on.\nSoftware to send WoL magic packets is available for all modern platforms, including Windows, Macintosh and Linux, plus many smartphones. Examples include: Wake On LAN GUI, LAN Helper, Magic Packet Utility, NetWaker for Windows, Nirsoft WakeMeOnLAN, WakeOnLANx, EMCO WOL, Aquila Tech Wake on LAN, ManageEngine WOL utility, FusionFenix and SolarWinds WOL Tool.<ref>{{cite web|last1=p|first1=Jessica|title=Wake On Lan Tools|url=http://www.pcwdld.com/free-wake-on-lan-tools|website=PCWDLD.com|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> There are also web sites that allow a ''Magic Packet'' to be sent online without charge. Example [[source code]] for a developer to add Wake-on-LAN to a program is readily available in many [[computer language]]s.\n\n===Ensure the ''Magic Packet'' travels from source to destination===\nIf the sender is on the same subnet ([[Local area network|local network, aka LAN]]) as the computer to be awakened there are generally no issues. When sending over the Internet, and in particular where a [[Network address translation|NAT]] (Network Address Translator) router, as typically deployed in most homes, is involved, special settings often need to be set. For example, in the router, the computer to be controlled needs to have a dedicated IP address assigned (aka a [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] reservation). Also, since the controlled computer will be \"sleeping\" except for some electricity on to part of its LAN card, typically it will not be registered at the router as having an ''active'' IP lease.\n\nFurther, the WoL protocol operates on a \"deeper level\" in the multi-layer networking architecture. To ensure the ''Magic Packet'' gets from source to destination, while the destination is ''sleeping'', the [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] Binding (aka IP & MAC binding) must typically be set in a NAT Router. This allows the Router to forward the ''Magic Packet'' to the ''sleeping'' computer's MAC adapter at a networking layer below typical IP usage. In the NAT router ARP (aka MAC & IP) binding requires just a dedicated IP number and the MAC address of the destination computer. There are some security implications associated with ARP binding (see [[ARP spoofing]]) however as long as none of the computers connected to the LAN are compromised, an attacker must use a computer that is connected directly to the target LAN (plugged into the LAN via cable, or gains free access to the LAN by breaking through the Wi\u2011Fi connection security).\n\nMost home routers are able to send magic packets to LAN, for example routers with the [[DD-WRT]], [[Tomato firmware|Tomato]] or [[PfSense]] firmware have a built-in Wake On Lan client. The 3rd party FOSS project [[OpenWrt]] supports both Linux implementations for WoL etherwake and WoLs.\n\n===Respond to the ''Magic Packet'' and restore full power===\n\nMost WoL hardware functionally is typically blocked by default and needs to be enabled in using the system BIOS. Further configuration from the OS is required in some cases, for example, via Device Manager network card properties on Windows Operating systems. More below.\n\n====Microsoft Windows====\n\nNewer versions of Microsoft Windows integrate WoL functionality into the Device Manager. This is available in the Power Management tab of each network device's driver properties. For full support of a device's WoL capabilities (such as the ability to wake from an ACPI S5 power off state), installation of the full driver suite from the network device manufacturer may be necessary, rather than the bare driver provided by Microsoft or the computer manufacturer. In most cases{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} correct BIOS configuration is also required for WoL to function.\n\nThe ability to wake from a hybrid shutdown state (S4) or a fully powered off state (S5) is unsupported in Windows 8 and above,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2776718 |title='Wake on LAN' (WOL) behavior in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 |work=Microsoft |year=2015 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa373229(v=vs.85).aspx |title=System Power States |work=Microsoft |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> and Windows Server 2012 and above.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c03774694|title=HP Support document |work=Hewlett-Packard Support Center |accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> This is because of a change in the OS behavior which causes network adapters to be explicitly not armed for WOL when shutdown to these states occurs. WOL from a sleep state (S3) or non-hybrid hibernation state (S4) is supported.\n\n====Mac hardware (OS X)====\n\nModern Mac hardware supports WoL functionality when the computer is in a sleep state, but it is not possible to wake up a Mac computer from a powered-off state.\n\nThe feature is controlled via the OS X System Preferences Energy Saver panel, in the Options tab. Marking the ''Wake for network access'' checkbox enables Wake-on-LAN.\n \t\nApple's [[Apple Remote Desktop]] client management system can be used to send Wake-on-LAN packets, but there are also freeware and shareware Mac OS X applications available.\n\nOn [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard]] and later, the service is called Wake on Demand or [[Bonjour Sleep Proxy]] and is synonymous with the Sleep Proxy Service. It comes enabled out of the box, but in previous versions of the operating system, the service needs to be enabled under the Energy Saver pane of [[System Preferences]]. The network interface card may allow the service to function only on Wi\u2011Fi, only on Ethernet, or both.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3774 |title=About Wake on Demand and Bonjour Sleep Proxy |work=apple.com |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Linux====\n\nWake-on-LAN support may be changed using a subfunction of the [[ethtool]] command.\n\n==Other machine states and LAN wakeup signals==\nIn the early days of Wake-on-LAN the situation was relatively simple: a machine was connected to power but switched off, and it was arranged that a special packet be sent to switch the machine on.\n\nSince then many options have been added and standards agreed upon. A machine can be in 7 [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface#Power states|power states]] from S0 (fully on) through S5 (powered down but plugged in) and disconnected from power (G3, Mechanical Off), with names such as \"sleep\", \"standby\", and \"hibernate\". In some reduced-power modes the system state is stored in RAM and the machine can ''wake up'' very quickly; in others the state is saved to disk and the motherboard powered down, taking at least several seconds to wake up. The machine can be awakened from a reduced-power state by a variety of signals.\n\nThe machine's BIOS must be set to allow Wake-on-LAN. To allow wakeup from powered-down state S5, wakeup on PME (Power Management Event) is also required. The Intel adapter allows \"Wake on Directed Packet\", \"Wake on Magic Packet\", \"Wake on Magic Packet from power off state\", and \"Wake on Link\".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~brecht/servers/docs/PowerEdge-2600/en/IntelNIC/wol.htm |title=Remote Wake-Up: Intel\u00ae Network Adapters User Guide |first=Tim |last=Brecht |work=[[University of Waterloo]] |year=2003 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> Wake on Directed Packet is particularly useful as the machine will automatically come out of standby or hibernation when it is referenced, without the user or application needing to explicitly send a magic packet. Unfortunately in many networks waking on directed packet (any packet with the adapter's MAC address or IP address) or on link is likely to cause wakeup immediately after going to a low-power state. Details for any particular motherboard and network adapter are to be found in the relevant manuals; there is no general method. Knowledge of signals on the network may also be needed to prevent spurious wakening.\n\n===Unattended operation===\nFor a machine which is normally unattended, precautions need to be taken to make the Wake-on-LAN function as reliable as possible. For a machine procured to work in this way, Wake-on-LAN functionality is an important part of the purchase procedure.\n\nSome machines do not support Wake-on-LAN after they have been disconnected from power (e.g., when power is restored after a power failure). Use of an [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) will give protection against a short period without power, although the battery will discharge during a prolonged power cut.\n\n===Waking up without operator presence===\n\nIf a machine that is not designed to support Wake-on-LAN is left powered down after power failure, it may be possible to set the BIOS to start it up automatically on restoration of power, so that it is never left in an unresponsive state. A typical BIOS setting is ''AC back function'' which may be ''on'', ''off'', or ''memory''. ''On'' is the correct setting in this case; ''memory'', which restores the machine to the state it was in when power was lost, may leave a machine which was hibernating in an unwakeable state.\n\nOther problems can affect the ability to start or control the machine remotely: hardware failure of the machine or network, failure of the BIOS settings battery (the machine will halt when started before the network connection is made, displaying an error message and requiring a keypress), loss of control of the machine due to software problems (machine hang, termination of remote control or networking software, etc.), and virus infection or hard disk corruption. Therefore, the use of a reliable server-class machine with [[RAID]] drives, redundant power supplies, etc., will help to maximize availability. Additionally, a device which can switch the machine off and on again, controlled perhaps by a remote signal, can force a reboot which will clear problems due to misbehaving software.\n\nFor a machine not in constant use, energy can be conserved by putting the machine into low-power RAM standby after a short timeout period. If a connection delay of a minute or two is acceptable, the machine can timeout into hibernation, powered off with its state saved to disk.\n\n==Wake on Internet==\n{{See also|Bonjour Sleep Proxy}}\nThe computer being awakened does not know whether the wakeup signal comes from another machine on the same network or from anywhere else. If the magic packet can be made to reach a computer, it can originate anywhere (e.g., from the Internet). This can be achieved by a [[virtual private network]] (VPN), which makes the remote computer appear to be a member of the [[local area network]] (LAN). In the absence of a VPN, a computer connected to a router can be awakened if a magic packet sent over the Internet is routed to it. This requires any firewall to be set up to allow entry of the Wake-on-LAN signal to a specified port. The port can be forwarded to the computer to be awakened; or some routers permit the packet to be broadcast to the entire LAN.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm |title=Router Port Forwarding Guides |work=portforward.com |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> However, some routers do not support this as they will not forward broadcast packets.\n\nOn routers that have this capability, the default TCP or UDP ports preconfigured to relay WOL requests are usually ports 7 ([[Echo Protocol]]) and/or 9 ([[Discard Protocol]]). However this proxy setting must be enabled in the router, and port forwarding rules may needed to be configured in its embedded [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] in order to accept magic packets coming from the Internet side to these restricted port numbers, and to allow rebroadcasting them on the local network (normally to the same ports and the same TCP or UDP protocol). Such routers may also be configurable to use different port numbers for this proxying service.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alert on LAN]]\n* [[Alert Standard Format]]\n* [[Desktop and mobile Architecture for System Hardware]]\n* [[RTC Alarm]]\n* [[Wake-on-Ring]] - Telephone line ring event\n* [[Conventional PCI#Connector pinout|Conventional PCI pinout]] - Power Management Event (PME#) signal\n* [[Wired for Management]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wake-On-Lan}}\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1997]]\n[[Category:Networking standards]]\n[[Category:BIOS]]\n[[Category:Remote control]]\n[[Category:Ethernet]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|mechanism to wake up computers via a network}}\n[[File:Wake on LAN connector.JPG|alt=|thumb|A physical Wake-on-LAN connector (white object in foreground) featured on the IBM PCI Token-Ring Adapter 2.]]\n'''Wake-on-LAN''' ('''WoL''') is an [[Ethernet]] or [[token ring]] [[computer network]]ing standard that allows a computer to be turned on or ''[[power management|awakened]]'' by a network message.\n\nThe message is usually sent to the target computer by a [[computer program|program]] executed on a device connected to the same [[local area network]], such as a [[smartphone]].

If the computer being awakened is communicating via [[Wi-Fi]], a supplementary standard called '''Wake on Wireless LAN''' (WoWLAN) must be employed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://revolutionwifi.blogspot.com/2010/11/wake-on-wireless-lan.html |title=Wake on Wireless LAN |first=Andrew |last=von Nagy |date=8 November 2010 |work=Revolution Wi-Fi Blog |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe WOL and WoWLAN standards are often supplemented by vendors to provide protocol-transparent on-demand services, for example in the [[Bonjour (software)|Apple Bonjour]] wake-on-demand ([[Bonjour Sleep Proxy|Sleep Proxy]]) feature.<ref name=\"macworld-glenn\">{{cite journal |first=Glenn |last=Fleishman |title=Wake on Demand lets Snow Leopard sleep with one eye open |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/142468/2009/08/wake_on_demand.html |journal=[[Macworld]] |date=28 August 2009 |accessdate=15 September 2009 |quote=How it works, Energy Saver preference pane}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn October 1996, [[Intel]] and [[IBM]] formed the ''Advanced Manageability Alliance'' (AMA). In April 1997, this alliance introduced the Wake-on-LAN technology.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.computerworld.co.nz/article/519210/intel_ibm_strike_deal_lower_pc_ownership_costs/ |title=Intel, IBM strike deal to lower PC ownership costs |first=Kristi |last=Essick |work=[[Computerworld]] |location=New Zealand |date=31 October 1996 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/2705.wss |title=IBM Announces Universal Management - Industry's Most Comprehensive Tools to Lower Total Cost of Ownership |date=14 April 1998 |work=IBM News Room |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Principle of operation==\n[[Ethernet]] connections, including home and work networks, wireless data networks  and the [[Internet]] itself, are based on frames sent between computers. Wake-on-LAN (\"WOL\") is implemented using a specially designed frame called a [[#Magic packet|magic packet]], which is sent to all computers in a network, among them the computer to be awakened. The magic packet contains the [[MAC address]] of the destination computer, an identifying number built into each [[Network interface controller|network interface card]] (\"NIC\") or other ethernet device in a computer, that enables it to be uniquely recognized and addressed on a network. Powered-down or turned off computers capable of Wake-on-LAN will contain network devices able to \"listen\" to incoming packets in low-power mode while the system is powered down. If a magic packet is received that is directed to the device's MAC address, the NIC signals the computer's [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supply]] or [[motherboard]] to initiate system wake-up, in the same way that pressing the power button would do.\n\nThe magic packet is sent on the [[data link layer]] (layer 2 in the [[OSI model]]) and when sent, is broadcast to all attached devices on a given network, using the network [[broadcast address]]; the IP-address (layer 3 in the OSI model) is not used.\n\nBecause Wake-on-LAN is built upon broadcast technology, it can generally only be used within the current network subnet. There are some exceptions, though, and Wake-on-LAN can operate across any network in practice, given appropriate configuration and hardware, including remote wake-up across the Internet.\n\nIn order for Wake-on-LAN to work, parts of the network interface need to stay on. This consumes a small amount of [[standby power]], much less than normal operating power. The link speed is usually reduced to the lowest possible speed to not waste power (e.g. a Gigabit Ethernet NIC maintains only a 10&nbsp;Mbit/s link). Disabling wake-on-LAN when not needed, can very slightly reduce power consumption on computers that are switched off but still plugged into a power socket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesswatts.org/tips/ethernet.php |work=Less Watts |title=Ethernet Tips & Tricks |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126071350/http://www.lesswatts.org/tips/ethernet.php |archivedate=November 26, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Magic packet===\n\nThe ''magic packet'' is a broadcast [[Ethernet frame|frame]] containing anywhere within its payload 6 [[bytes]] of all 255 (FF FF FF FF FF FF in [[hexadecimal]]), followed by sixteen repetitions of the target computer's 48-bit MAC address, for a total of 102 bytes.\n\nSince the magic packet is only scanned for the string above, and not actually parsed by a full protocol stack, it could be sent as any network- and transport-layer protocol, although it is typically sent as a [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] [[datagram]] to [[TCP and UDP port|port]] 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://community.landesk.com/support/docs/DOC-1866 |title=Understanding Wake On LAN |work=LANdesk.com |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> 7 or 9, or directly over Ethernet as [[EtherType]] 0x0842.<ref>[http://wiki.wireshark.org/WakeOnLAN WakeOnLAN] on Wireshark wiki.</ref> A [[connection-oriented]] transport-layer protocol like [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] is less suited for this task as it requires establishing an active connection before sending user data.\n\nA standard magic packet has the following basic limitations:\n\n* Requires destination computer MAC address (also may require a ''SecureOn'' password)\n* Does not provide a delivery confirmation\n* May not work outside of the local network\n* Requires hardware support of Wake-on-LAN on destination computer\n* Most 802.11 wireless interfaces do not maintain a link in low power states and cannot receive a magic packet\n\nThe Wake-on-LAN implementation is designed to be very simple and to be quickly processed by the circuitry present on the network interface card with minimal power requirement. Because Wake-on-LAN operates below the IP protocol layer, IP addresses and DNS names are meaningless and so the MAC address is required.\n\n===Subnet directed broadcasts===\n\nA principal limitation of standard broadcast wake-on-LAN is that broadcast packets are generally not routed. This prevents the technique being used in larger networks or over the Internet. Subnet directed broadcasts (SDB)<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl= http://rtfm.adamant.net/books/tcp-ip_illustrated/broadcas.htm |title=TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols |chapter=Chapter 12.

SDB may require changes to intermediate router configuration. Subnet directed broadcasts are treated like unicast network packets until processed by the final (local) router. This router then broadcasts the packet using layer 2 broadcast. This technique allows a broadcast to be initiated on a remote network but requires all intervening routers to forward the SDB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/20213.pdf |title=Magic Packet Technology (White Paper, Publication# 20213, Rev: A Amendment/0) |work=AMD |date=November 1995 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb632807.aspx |title=About Subnet-Directed Broadcast Wake-Up Packets for Wake On LAN |work=Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager |year=2007 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> When preparing a network to forward SDB packets, care must be taken to filter packets so that only desired (e.g. WoL) SDB packets are permitted \u2014 otherwise the network may become a participant in [[DDoS]] attacks such as the [[Smurf Attack]].\n\n===Troubleshooting magic packets===\n\nWake-on-LAN can be a difficult technology to implement, because it requires appropriate BIOS, network card and, sometimes, operating system and router support to function reliably. In some cases, hardware may wake from one low power state but not from others. This means that due to hardware issues the computer may be waking up from the \"fully off state\" (S5) but doesn't wake from sleep or hibernation or vice versa. Also, it is not always clear what kind of magic packet a NIC expects to see.\n\nIn that case, software tools like a [[packet analyzer]] can help with Wake-on-LAN troubleshooting as they allow confirming (while the PC is still on) that the magic packet is indeed visible to a particular computer's NIC. The same magic packet can then be used to find out if the computer powers up from an offline state. This allows networking issues to be isolated from other hardware issues. In some cases they also confirm that the packet was destined for a specific PC or sent to a [[broadcast address]] and they can additionally show the packet's internals.\n\nStarting with Windows Vista, the operating system logs all wake sources in the \"System\" event log. The [[Event Viewer]] and the <code>powercfg.exe /lastwake</code> command can retrieve them.<ref name=\"download.microsoft.com\">{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/cpa002_wh06.ppt |title=ACPI In Windows Vista |first=Allen |last=Marshall |work=[[Windows Hardware Engineering Conference|WinHEC 2006]] |publisher=Microsoft |pages=23\u201325}}</ref>\n\n==Security considerations==\n\n===Unauthorized access===\n\nMagic packets are sent via the [[Data link layer|data link or OSI-2 layer]], which can be used or abused by anyone on the same LAN, unless the L2 LAN equipment is capable of (and configured for) filtering such traffic to match site-wide security requirements.\n\nFirewalls may be used to prevent clients among the public [[Wide area network|WAN]] from accessing the broadcast addresses of inside LAN segments, or routers may be configured to ignore subnet-directed broadcasts (see above.)\n\nCertain NICs support a security feature called \"SecureOn\". It allows users to store within the NIC a hexadecimal password of 6 bytes. Clients have to append this password to the magic packet. The NIC wakes the system only if the MAC address and password are correct. This security measure significantly decreases the risk of successful [[brute force attack]]s, by increasing the search space by 48 bits (6 bytes), up to 2<sup>96</sup> combinations if the MAC address is entirely unknown. However any network eavesdropping will expose the cleartext password. Still, only a few NIC and [[Router (computing)|router]] manufacturers support such security features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAbuse of the Wake-on-LAN feature only allows computers to be switched on; it does not in itself bypass password and other forms of security, and is unable to power off the machine once on. However, many client computers attempt booting from a [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE]] server when powered up by WoL. So, a combination of [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and PXE servers on the network can sometimes be used to start a computer with an attacker's boot image, bypassing any security of the installed operating system and granting access to unprotected, local disks over the network.\n\n===Interactions with network access control===\n\nThe use of Wake-on-LAN technology on enterprise networks can sometimes conflict with network access control solutions such as [[802.1x]] or MAC-based authentication, which may prevent magic packet delivery if a machine's WoL hardware has not been designed to maintain a live authentication session while in a sleep state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Understanding 802.1X Authentication with Wake-on-LAN |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12.2SX/configuration/guide/dot1x.html#wp1133592 |work=Cisco Catalyst 6500 Release 12.2SX Software Configuration Guide}}</ref>  Configuration of these two features in tandem often requires tuning of timing parameters and thorough testing.\n\n===Data privacy===\n\nSome PCs include technology built into the [[chipset]] to improve security for Wake-on-LAN. For example, [[Intel Active Management Technology|Intel AMT]] (a component of [[Intel vPro]] technology), includes [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS), an industry-standard protocol that strengthens [[encryption]].<ref name=\"multiple-vPro-WP\"/>\n\nAMT uses TLS encryption to secure an [[Out-of-band management|out-of-band]] communication tunnel to an AMT-based PC for remote management commands such as Wake-on-LAN. AMT secures the communication tunnel with [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) 128-bit encryption and [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] with modulus lengths of 2,048 bits.<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Instructions Set |url=http://softwarecommunity.intel.com/articles/eng/3788.htm |publisher=Intel |accessdate=6 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hardening Measures Built into Intel Active Management Technology |url=http://softwarecommunity.intel.com/articles/eng/3703.htm |publisher=Intel |accessdate=11 June 2008}}</ref> Because the encrypted communication is out-of-band, the PC's hardware and firmware receive the magic packet before network traffic reaches the software stack for the operating system (OS). Since the encrypted communication occurs \"below\" the OS level, it is less vulnerable to attacks by viruses, worms, and other threats that typically target the OS level.<ref name=\"multiple-vPro-WP\">{{cite web |title=Intel Centrino 2 with vPro technology and Intel Core2 processor with vPro technology |url=http://download.intel.com/products/vpro/whitepaper/crossclient.pdf |publisher=Intel |accessdate=7 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nIT shops using Wake-on-LAN through the Intel AMT implementation can wake an AMT PC over network environments that require TLS-based security, such as [[IEEE 802.1x]], [[Cisco]] [[Network Access Control|Self Defending Network]] (SDN), and [[Microsoft]] [[Network Access Protection]] (NAP) environments.<ref name=\"multiple-vPro-WP\"/> The Intel implementation also works for [[wireless]] networks.<ref name=\"multiple-vPro-WP\"/>\n\n==Hardware requirements==\n\nWake-on-LAN support is implemented on the [[motherboard]] of a computer and the network interface (firmware), and is consequently not dependent on the operating system running on the hardware. Some operating systems can control Wake-on-LAN behaviour via NIC drivers. With older motherboards, if the network interface is a plug-in card rather than being integrated into the motherboard, the card may need to be connected to the motherboard by an additional cable. Motherboards with an embedded Ethernet controller which supports Wake-on-LAN do not need a cable. The power supply must meet [[ATX]] 2.01 specifications.\n\n===Hardware implementations===\n\nOlder motherboards must have a WAKEUP-LINK header onboard connected to the network card via a special 3-pin cable; however, systems supporting the [[PCI Local Bus|PCI]] 2.2 standard and with a PCI 2.2 compliant network adapter card do not usually require a Wake-on-LAN cable as the required standby power is relayed through the PCI bus.\n\nPCI version 2.2 supports PME (Power Management Events). PCI cards send and receive PME signals via the PCI socket directly, without the need for a Wake-on-LAN cable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xlife.zuavra.net/index.php/60/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308143030/http://xlife.zuavra.net/index.php/60/ |title=Xlife \u00bb Using Wake-On-LAN WOL/PME to power up your computer remotely |archivedate=8 March 2007 |work=zuavra.net |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><!--wrecked since 2007?-->\n\nWake-on-LAN usually needs to be enabled in the Power Management section of a PC motherboard's [[BIOS setup]] utility, although on some systems, such as Apple computers, it is enabled by default. On older systems the bios setting may be referred to as \"WOL\", on newer systems supporting PCI version 2.2, it may be referred to as \"PME\" (Power Management Events, which include WOL). It may also be necessary to configure the computer to reserve standby power for the network card when the system is shut down.\n\nIn addition, in order to get Wake-on-LAN to work, enabling this feature on the network interface card or on-board silicon is sometimes required. Details of how to do this depend upon the [[operating system]] and the device driver.\n\nLaptops powered by the Intel Centrino Processor Technology or newer<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intel.com/network/connectivity/products/wireless/prowireless_mobile.htm |title=Intel\u00ae PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection \u2013 Overview |work=Intel.com |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> (with explicit BIOS support) allow waking up the machine using wireless Wake on Wireless LAN (WoWLAN).\n\nIn most modern PCs, [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] is notified of the \"waking up\" and take control of the Power up. In ACPI, OSPM must record the \"wake source\" or the device that is causing the power-up. The device being the \"Soft\" power switch, the NIC (via Wake-on-LAN), the cover being opened, a temperature change, etc.<ref name=\"download.microsoft.com\"/>\n\nThe 3-pin WOL interface on the motherboard consist of pin-1 +5V DC (red), pin-2 Ground (black), pin-3 {{nowrap|Wake signal}} (green or yellow).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.skynet.be/sky50985/optionsb.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121141824/http://users.skynet.be/sky50985/optionsb.htm | title=How to connect the UIRT2 B |archivedate=21 January 2007 |work=skynet.be |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> By supplying the pin-3 wake signal with +5V DC the computer will be triggered to power up provided WOL is enabled in the [[BIOS]] configuration.\n\n==Software requirements==\n\nSoftware which sends a WoL magic packet is referred to in different circles as both a \"client\" and a \"server\", which can be a source of confusion.  While WoL hardware/firmware is arguably performing the role of a \"server\", web based interfaces which act as a gateway through which users can issue WoL packets without downloading a local client often become known as \"The Wake On LAN Server\" to users.  Additionally, software that administers WoL capabilities from the host OS side may be carelessly referred to as a \"client\" on occasion, and of course, machines running WoL generally tend to be end-user desktops, and as such, are \"clients\" in modern IT parlance.\n\n===Create and send the ''Magic Packet''===\n\nTo create a ''Magic Packet'' you need to know the MAC address of the specific computer that will be turned on.\nSoftware to send WoL magic packets is available for all modern platforms, including Windows, Macintosh and Linux, plus many smartphones. Examples include: Wake On LAN GUI, LAN Helper, Magic Packet Utility, NetWaker for Windows, Nirsoft WakeMeOnLAN, WakeOnLANx, EMCO WOL, Aquila Tech Wake on LAN, ManageEngine WOL utility, FusionFenix and SolarWinds WOL Tool.<ref>{{cite web|last1=p|first1=Jessica|title=Wake On Lan Tools|url=http://www.pcwdld.com/free-wake-on-lan-tools|website=PCWDLD.com|accessdate=9 September 2016}}</ref> There are also web sites that allow a ''Magic Packet'' to be sent online without charge. Example [[source code]] for a developer to add Wake-on-LAN to a program is readily available in many [[computer language]]s.\n\n===Ensure the ''Magic Packet'' travels from source to destination===\nIf the sender is on the same subnet ([[Local area network|local network, aka LAN]]) as the computer to be awakened there are generally no issues. When sending over the Internet, and in particular where a [[Network address translation|NAT]] (Network Address Translator) router, as typically deployed in most homes, is involved, special settings often need to be set. For example, in the router, the computer to be controlled needs to have a dedicated IP address assigned (aka a [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] reservation). Also, since the controlled computer will be \"sleeping\" except for some electricity on to part of its LAN card, typically it will not be registered at the router as having an ''active'' IP lease.\n\nFurther, the WoL protocol operates on a \"deeper level\" in the multi-layer networking architecture. To ensure the ''Magic Packet'' gets from source to destination, while the destination is ''sleeping'', the [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] Binding (aka IP & MAC binding) must typically be set in a NAT Router. This allows the Router to forward the ''Magic Packet'' to the ''sleeping'' computer's MAC adapter at a networking layer below typical IP usage. In the NAT router ARP (aka MAC & IP) binding requires just a dedicated IP number and the MAC address of the destination computer. There are some security implications associated with ARP binding (see [[ARP spoofing]]) however as long as none of the computers connected to the LAN are compromised, an attacker must use a computer that is connected directly to the target LAN (plugged into the LAN via cable, or gains free access to the LAN by breaking through the Wi\u2011Fi connection security).\n\nMost home routers are able to send magic packets to LAN, for example routers with the [[DD-WRT]], [[Tomato firmware|Tomato]] or [[PfSense]] firmware have a built-in Wake On Lan client. The 3rd party FOSS project [[OpenWrt]] supports both Linux implementations for WoL etherwake and WoLs.\n\n===Respond to the ''Magic Packet'' and restore full power===\n\nMost WoL hardware functionally is typically blocked by default and needs to be enabled in using the system BIOS. Further configuration from the OS is required in some cases, for example, via Device Manager network card properties on Windows Operating systems. More below.\n\n====Microsoft Windows====\n\nNewer versions of Microsoft Windows integrate WoL functionality into the Device Manager. This is available in the Power Management tab of each network device's driver properties. For full support of a device's WoL capabilities (such as the ability to wake from an ACPI S5 power off state), installation of the full driver suite from the network device manufacturer may be necessary, rather than the bare driver provided by Microsoft or the computer manufacturer. In most cases{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} correct BIOS configuration is also required for WoL to function.\n\nThe ability to wake from a hybrid shutdown state (S4) or a fully powered off state (S5) is unsupported in Windows 8 and above,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2776718 |title='Wake on LAN' (WOL) behavior in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 |work=Microsoft |year=2015 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa373229(v=vs.85).aspx |title=System Power States |work=Microsoft |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> and Windows Server 2012 and above.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c03774694|title=HP Support document |work=Hewlett-Packard Support Center |accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> This is because of a change in the OS behavior which causes network adapters to be explicitly not armed for WOL when shutdown to these states occurs. WOL from a sleep state (S3) or non-hybrid hibernation state (S4) is supported.\n\n====Mac hardware (OS X)====\n\nModern Mac hardware supports WoL functionality when the computer is in a sleep state, but it is not possible to wake up a Mac computer from a powered-off state.\n\nThe feature is controlled via the OS X System Preferences Energy Saver panel, in the Options tab. Marking the ''Wake for network access'' checkbox enables Wake-on-LAN.\n \t\nApple's [[Apple Remote Desktop]] client management system can be used to send Wake-on-LAN packets, but there are also freeware and shareware Mac OS X applications available.\n\nOn [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard]] and later, the service is called Wake on Demand or [[Bonjour Sleep Proxy]] and is synonymous with the Sleep Proxy Service. It comes enabled out of the box, but in previous versions of the operating system, the service needs to be enabled under the Energy Saver pane of [[System Preferences]]. The network interface card may allow the service to function only on Wi\u2011Fi, only on Ethernet, or both.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3774 |title=About Wake on Demand and Bonjour Sleep Proxy |work=apple.com |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Linux====\n\nWake-on-LAN support may be changed using a subfunction of the [[ethtool]] command.\n\n==Other machine states and LAN wakeup signals==\nIn the early days of Wake-on-LAN the situation was relatively simple: a machine was connected to power but switched off, and it was arranged that a special packet be sent to switch the machine on.\n\nSince then many options have been added and standards agreed upon. A machine can be in 7 [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface#Power states|power states]] from S0 (fully on) through S5 (powered down but plugged in) and disconnected from power (G3, Mechanical Off), with names such as \"sleep\", \"standby\", and \"hibernate\". In some reduced-power modes the system state is stored in RAM and the machine can ''wake up'' very quickly; in others the state is saved to disk and the motherboard powered down, taking at least several seconds to wake up. The machine can be awakened from a reduced-power state by a variety of signals.\n\nThe machine's BIOS must be set to allow Wake-on-LAN. To allow wakeup from powered-down state S5, wakeup on PME (Power Management Event) is also required. The Intel adapter allows \"Wake on Directed Packet\", \"Wake on Magic Packet\", \"Wake on Magic Packet from power off state\", and \"Wake on Link\".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~brecht/servers/docs/PowerEdge-2600/en/IntelNIC/wol.htm |title=Remote Wake-Up: Intel\u00ae Network Adapters User Guide |first=Tim |last=Brecht |work=[[University of Waterloo]] |year=2003 |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> Wake on Directed Packet is particularly useful as the machine will automatically come out of standby or hibernation when it is referenced, without the user or application needing to explicitly send a magic packet. Unfortunately in many networks waking on directed packet (any packet with the adapter's MAC address or IP address) or on link is likely to cause wakeup immediately after going to a low-power state. Details for any particular motherboard and network adapter are to be found in the relevant manuals; there is no general method. Knowledge of signals on the network may also be needed to prevent spurious wakening.\n\n===Unattended operation===\nFor a machine which is normally unattended, precautions need to be taken to make the Wake-on-LAN function as reliable as possible. For a machine procured to work in this way, Wake-on-LAN functionality is an important part of the purchase procedure.\n\nSome machines do not support Wake-on-LAN after they have been disconnected from power (e.g., when power is restored after a power failure). Use of an [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) will give protection against a short period without power, although the battery will discharge during a prolonged power cut.\n\n===Waking up without operator presence===\n\nIf a machine that is not designed to support Wake-on-LAN is left powered down after power failure, it may be possible to set the BIOS to start it up automatically on restoration of power, so that it is never left in an unresponsive state. A typical BIOS setting is ''AC back function'' which may be ''on'', ''off'', or ''memory''. ''On'' is the correct setting in this case; ''memory'', which restores the machine to the state it was in when power was lost, may leave a machine which was hibernating in an unwakeable state.\n\nOther problems can affect the ability to start or control the machine remotely: hardware failure of the machine or network, failure of the BIOS settings battery (the machine will halt when started before the network connection is made, displaying an error message and requiring a keypress), loss of control of the machine due to software problems (machine hang, termination of remote control or networking software, etc.), and virus infection or hard disk corruption. Therefore, the use of a reliable server-class machine with [[RAID]] drives, redundant power supplies, etc., will help to maximize availability. Additionally, a device which can switch the machine off and on again, controlled perhaps by a remote signal, can force a reboot which will clear problems due to misbehaving software.\n\nFor a machine not in constant use, energy can be conserved by putting the machine into low-power RAM standby after a short timeout period. If a connection delay of a minute or two is acceptable, the machine can timeout into hibernation, powered off with its state saved to disk.\n\n==Wake on Internet==\n{{See also|Bonjour Sleep Proxy}}\nThe computer being awakened does not know whether the wakeup signal comes from another machine on the same network or from anywhere else. If the magic packet can be made to reach a computer, it can originate anywhere (e.g., from the Internet). This can be achieved by a [[virtual private network]] (VPN), which makes the remote computer appear to be a member of the [[local area network]] (LAN). In the absence of a VPN, a computer connected to a router can be awakened if a magic packet sent over the Internet is routed to it. This requires any firewall to be set up to allow entry of the Wake-on-LAN signal to a specified port. The port can be forwarded to the computer to be awakened; or some routers permit the packet to be broadcast to the entire LAN.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm |title=Router Port Forwarding Guides |work=portforward.com |accessdate=28 October 2015}}</ref> However, some routers do not support this as they will not forward broadcast packets.\n\nOn routers that have this capability, the default TCP or UDP ports preconfigured to relay WOL requests are usually ports 7 ([[Echo Protocol]]) and/or 9 ([[Discard Protocol]]).

It has the sea to the north and east and parts of the border with [[County Londonderry]] to the west \u2013 the County Antrim town of [[Portrush]] is included in the East Londonderry constituency (although it was in this seat until 1983).\n\n[[File:Irish parliamentary constituencies 1885 - 1922 North Antrim.svg|thumbnail|right|North Antrim constituency, 1885 \u2013 1922]]\nFrom 1885, this constituency was one of four county divisions carved out of the former constituency of [[Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim]]. It comprised the baronies of [[Cary (barony)|Cary]], [[Dunluce Lower]], [[Dunluce Upper]] and [[Kilconway]] and returned one Member of Parliament from 1885 until 1922, when it was merged into a new Antrim constituency.\n\nNorth Antrim was re-created in 1950 when the old Antrim two MP constituency was abolished as part of the final move to single member seats.\n\nThe constituency is largely rural. Amongst the features within its boundaries are [[Rathlin Island]] and [[Giant's Causeway]].\n\n[[Image:RathlinBirdSanctuary.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rathlin Island]]]]\n\nThe [[Boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission]] initially proposed alterations for the boundaries of North Antrim prior to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]. It was proposed to transfer [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] and the Glens, including Rathlin Island, in Moyle to [[East Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|East Antrim]] and rename that seat '''Antrim Coast & Glens'''. However that proposal raised many questions, with some arguing that the Glens have no natural ties to [[Jordanstown]]. Following consultation and revision, the constituency alterations were passed through the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/draft/ukdsi_9780110813172_en_1 Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order].\n\n==History==\n'''North Antrim''' is an overwhelmingly [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] seat. It first existed from 1885 to 1922.  From 1886 to 1974 the Conservative and Unionist members of the United Kingdom House of Commons formed a single Parliamentary party.\n\nUnusually for Ireland, the Liberal Party retained significant strength in this constituency after the split over [[Irish home rule movement|Home Rule]] in 1886. The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] never contested the seat.\n\nIn 1906 the constituency was won by a [[Russellite Unionist]], at least somewhat linked to the Liberal Party. Although the Unionists regained the seat when the sitting MP retired, the constituency was one of very few Unionist/Liberal marginals in Ireland at both 1910 elections.\n\nA victory for the [[Irish Unionist|Unionist]] candidate in 1918 by 9,621 votes to Sinn F\u00e9in's 2,673 votes demonstrated the strength of the unionist support in the area.\n\nIn 1922, the constituency reverted to being part of the two member [[Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim]] seat (as it had been before 1885). North Antrim was re-created in 1950 as a larger seat than it had been in its first incarnation. [[County Antrim]], excluding the parts in the [[Belfast]] constituencies, was split into two divisions instead of four as previously. The 1950 North Antrim was comparable to the North and [[Mid Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Antrim]] divisions which had existed from 1885 to 1922.\n\nSince 1950 the Westminster elections have been relatively uncompetitive. In 1951, it was one of the last four seats to be uncontested in a UK general election.  More recently, one man repeatedly won by a large majority: the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]] was first elected as a [[Protestant Unionist Party]] candidate in the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] after narrowly defeating sitting member [[Henry Clark (Northern Irish politician|Henry Clark]]. The following year that party changed to the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and Paisley easily held the seat for 40 years until his retirement in 2010. This is the longest continuous period for which the current holding party has held any Northern Irish seat. In elections at all levels, the DUP have frequently had their highest share of the vote in North Antrim and have rarely been seriously challenged.\n\nIn March 2010 Ian Paisley announced that he would step down at the 2010 general election. His son [[Ian Paisley Jr]] was selected by the DUP to replace him as candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8557018.stm|title=BBC News - Ian Paisley jnr picked to fight father's seat|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Former DUP MEP [[Jim Allister]] announced that he would contest the constituency for the [[Traditional Unionist Voice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/allister-calls-for-election-powersharing-test-14385230.html|title=Allister calls for election power-sharing test - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|publisher=}}</ref> He was elected with a significantly reduced majority.\n\nIn July 2018 a [[2018 North Antrim recall petition|recall petition]] was launched following a critical report into Paisley Jr's conduct in respect to an undeclared trip to Sri Lanka. The petition narrowly failed.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\nThe Member of Parliament since the 2010 general election is [[Ian Paisley Jr]] of the DUP. He succeeded his father, the Rev. Dr. [[Ian Paisley]], who was initially elected in the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] as a member of the [[Protestant Unionist Party]], which became the DUP the following year.\n\nNorth Antrim has had comparatively few MPs in its lifetime compared to other parliamentary constituencies. Sir Hugh O'Neill had sat for one of the predecessor seats of [[Mid Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Antrim]] between 1915 and 1922 and [[Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim]] between 1922 until 1950, making this one of the few seats where four individuals between them represented the seat continuously over a period of ninety years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" | Election || Member || Party \n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885]]\n|rowspan=\"2\" | [[Edward Macnaghten, Baron Macnaghten|Edward Macnaghten]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1886 United Kingdom general election|1886]]\n|rowspan=\"5\"| [[Irish Unionist Party|Irish Unionist]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1887 North Antrim by-election|1887 by-election]]\n| [[Sir Charles Lewis, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Lewis]] Bt\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1892 United Kingdom general election|1892]]\n| [[Charles Cunningham Connor]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895]]\n| Colonel [[Hugh McCalmont]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1899 North Antrim by-election|1899 by-election]]\n| [[Sir William Moore, 1st Baronet|William Moore]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Russellite Unionist/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]]\n| [[Robert Glendinning]]\n| [[Russellite Unionist]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|1910 (Jan)]]\n| [[Peter Kerr-Smiley]]\n| [[Irish Unionist Party|Irish Unionist]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" | [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\n|colspan=\"3\" | ''Constituency abolished.

It has the sea to the north and east and parts of the border with [[County Londonderry]] to the west \u2013 the County Antrim town of [[Portrush]] is included in the East Londonderry constituency (although it was in this seat until 1983).\n\n[[File:Irish parliamentary constituencies 1885 - 1922 North Antrim.svg|thumbnail|right|North Antrim constituency, 1885 \u2013 1922]]\nFrom 1885, this constituency was one of four county divisions carved out of the former constituency of [[Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim]]. It comprised the baronies of [[Cary (barony)|Cary]], [[Dunluce Lower]], [[Dunluce Upper]] and [[Kilconway]] and returned one Member of Parliament from 1885 until 1922, when it was merged into a new Antrim constituency.\n\nNorth Antrim was re-created in 1950 when the old Antrim two MP constituency was abolished as part of the final move to single member seats.\n\nThe constituency is largely rural. Amongst the features within its boundaries are [[Rathlin Island]] and [[Giant's Causeway]].\n\n[[Image:RathlinBirdSanctuary.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rathlin Island]]]]\n\nThe [[Boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission]] initially proposed alterations for the boundaries of North Antrim prior to the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]]. It was proposed to transfer [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] and the Glens, including Rathlin Island, in Moyle to [[East Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|East Antrim]] and rename that seat '''Antrim Coast & Glens'''. However that proposal raised many questions, with some arguing that the Glens have no natural ties to [[Jordanstown]]. Following consultation and revision, the constituency alterations were passed through the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/draft/ukdsi_9780110813172_en_1 Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order].\n\n==History==\n'''North Antrim''' is an overwhelmingly [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionist]] seat. It first existed from 1885 to 1922.  From 1886 to 1974 the Conservative and Unionist members of the United Kingdom House of Commons formed a single Parliamentary party.\n\nUnusually for Ireland, the Liberal Party retained significant strength in this constituency after the split over [[Irish home rule movement|Home Rule]] in 1886. The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] never contested the seat.\n\nIn 1906 the constituency was won by a [[Russellite Unionist]], at least somewhat linked to the Liberal Party. Although the Unionists regained the seat when the sitting MP retired, the constituency was one of very few Unionist/Liberal marginals in Ireland at both 1910 elections.\n\nA victory for the [[Irish Unionist|Unionist]] candidate in 1918 by 9,621 votes to Sinn F\u00e9in's 2,673 votes demonstrated the strength of the unionist support in the area.\n\nIn 1922, the constituency reverted to being part of the two member [[Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim]] seat (as it had been before 1885). North Antrim was re-created in 1950 as a larger seat than it had been in its first incarnation. [[County Antrim]], excluding the parts in the [[Belfast]] constituencies, was split into two divisions instead of four as previously. The 1950 North Antrim was comparable to the North and [[Mid Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Antrim]] divisions which had existed from 1885 to 1922.\n\nSince 1950 the Westminster elections have been relatively uncompetitive. In 1951, it was one of the last four seats to be uncontested in a UK general election.  More recently, one man repeatedly won by a large majority: the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]] was first elected as a [[Protestant Unionist Party]] candidate in the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] after narrowly defeating sitting member [[Henry Clark]]. The following year that party changed to the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and Paisley easily held the seat for 40 years until his retirement in 2010. This is the longest continuous period for which the current holding party has held any Northern Irish seat. In elections at all levels, the DUP have frequently had their highest share of the vote in North Antrim and have rarely been seriously challenged.\n\nIn March 2010 Ian Paisley announced that he would step down at the 2010 general election. His son [[Ian Paisley Jr]] was selected by the DUP to replace him as candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8557018.stm|title=BBC News - Ian Paisley jnr picked to fight father's seat|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Former DUP MEP [[Jim Allister]] announced that he would contest the constituency for the [[Traditional Unionist Voice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/allister-calls-for-election-powersharing-test-14385230.html|title=Allister calls for election power-sharing test - BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|publisher=}}</ref> He was elected with a significantly reduced majority.\n\nIn July 2018 a [[2018 North Antrim recall petition|recall petition]] was launched following a critical report into Paisley Jr's conduct in respect to an undeclared trip to Sri Lanka. The petition narrowly failed.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\nThe Member of Parliament since the 2010 general election is [[Ian Paisley Jr]] of the DUP. He succeeded his father, the Rev. Dr. [[Ian Paisley]], who was initially elected in the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] as a member of the [[Protestant Unionist Party]], which became the DUP the following year.\n\nNorth Antrim has had comparatively few MPs in its lifetime compared to other parliamentary constituencies. Sir Hugh O'Neill had sat for one of the predecessor seats of [[Mid Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Antrim]] between 1915 and 1922 and [[Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|Antrim]] between 1922 until 1950, making this one of the few seats where four individuals between them represented the seat continuously over a period of ninety years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" | Election || Member || Party \n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885]]\n|rowspan=\"2\" | [[Edward Macnaghten, Baron Macnaghten|Edward Macnaghten]]\n| [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1886 United Kingdom general election|1886]]\n|rowspan=\"5\"| [[Irish Unionist Party|Irish Unionist]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1887 North Antrim by-election|1887 by-election]]\n| [[Sir Charles Lewis, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Lewis]] Bt\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1892 United Kingdom general election|1892]]\n| [[Charles Cunningham Connor]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895]]\n| Colonel [[Hugh McCalmont]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1899 North Antrim by-election|1899 by-election]]\n| [[Sir William Moore, 1st Baronet|William Moore]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Russellite Unionist/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1906 United Kingdom general election|1906]]\n| [[Robert Glendinning]]\n| [[Russellite Unionist]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Irish Unionist Party/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|1910 (Jan)]]\n| [[Peter Kerr-Smiley]]\n| [[Irish Unionist Party|Irish Unionist]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" | [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]]\n|colspan=\"3\" | ''Constituency abolished.

Mockapetris |authorlink=Paul Mockapetris |date=November 1987 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) has a [[tree structure]] or hierarchy, with each non-RR ([[resource record]]) node on the tree being a [[domain name]].  A '''subdomain''' is a domain that is part of a larger domain; the only domain that is not also a subdomain is the [[root domain]].<ref name=\"RFC 1034 section 3.1\" /> For example, <code>west.example.com</code> and <code>east.example.com</code> are subdomains of the <code>example.com</code> domain, which in turn is a subdomain of the <code>com</code> [[top-level domain]] (TLD).  A \"subdomain\" expresses relative dependence, not absolute dependence: for example, <code>wikipedia.org</code> comprises a subdomain of the <code>org</code> domain, and <code>en.wikipedia.org</code> comprises a subdomain of the domain <code>wikipedia.org</code>. Each label may contain from 1 to 63 [[octet (computing)|octets]]. The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a [[full stop|dot]]. The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation.<ref name=rfc1035>RFC 1035, ''Domain names--Implementation and specification'', P. Mockapetris (Nov 1987)</ref> Thus, when using a single character per label, the limit is 127 levels: 127 characters plus 126 dots have a total length of 253. In practice, some [[domain name registry|domain registries]] may have shorter limits.\n\nSubdomains in this context are defined by editing the DNS '''zone''' file pertaining to the parent domain. However, there is an ongoing debate over the use of the term \u201csubdomain\u201d when referring to names which map to the [[List of DNS record types#A|Address record]] A (host) and various other types of zone records which may map to any public [[IP address]] destination and any type of server. Certain{{which|date=March 2015}} groups insist that it is inappropriate to use the term \u201csubdomain\u201d to refer to any mapping other than that provided by zone [[Authoritative name server|NS]] (name server) records and any server-destination other than that.\n\n== Uses ==\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the second-level domain names are standard and branch off from the [[top-level domain]]. For example:\n\n* .ac.uk - [[academic]] ([[tertiary education]], [[further education colleges]] and [[research institute|research establishments]]) and [[learned society|learned societies]]\n* .co.uk - general use (usually [[Commercial enterprise|commercial]])\n* .gov.uk - [[government]] (central and local)\n* .judiciary.uk - [[court]]s (to be introduced in the near future)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15860533 |title=BBC News - UK court systems set to adopt judiciary.uk domain names |publisher=BBC News |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n* .ltd.uk - [[limited company|limited companies]]\n* .me.uk - general use (usually [[person]]al)\n* .mod.uk - [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and [[HM Forces]] public sites\n* .net.uk - [[ISP]]s and [[Telecommunications company|network companies]] (unlike [[.net]], use is restricted to these users)\n* .nhs.uk - [[National Health Service]] institutions\n* .nic.uk - [http://www.nic.uk/registrars/becomeregistrar/taglist/ network use only] ([[Nominet UK]])\n* .org.uk - general use (usually for [[non-profit organisation]]s)\n* .parliament.uk - parliamentary use (only for the [[UK Parliament]] and the [[Scottish Parliament]])\n* .plc.uk - [[public limited company|public limited companies]]\n* .police.uk - [[UK police|police forces]]\n* .sch.uk - [[Local education authority|Local Education Authorities]], [[school]]s, [[Primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], [[community education]]\n\nSubdomains are also used by organizations that wish to assign a unique name to a particular department, function, or service related to the organization.  For example, a university might assign \"cs\" to the computer science department, such that a number of hosts could be used inside that subdomain, such as <code>mail.cs.example.edu</code> or <code>www.cs.example.edu</code>.\n\n=== Vanity domain ===\nA [[vanity domain]] is a subdomain of an ISP's domain that is aliased to an individual user account, or a subdomain that expresses the individuality of the person on whose behalf it is registered.\n\n=== Server cluster ===\nDepending on application, a [[Resource record|record]] inside a domain, or subdomain might refer to a [[hostname]], or a service provided by a number of machines in a cluster. Some websites use different subdomains to point to different [[server cluster]]s. For example, <code>[[example.com|www.example.com]]</code> points to Server Cluster 1 or Datacentre 1, and <code>www2.example.com</code> points to Server Cluster 2 or Datacentre 2 etc..\n\nSome domains host their [[nameservers]] as ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com, etc., and these do not typically show up in search engine results.\n\n==== Subdomains versus directories ====\nSubdomains are different from directories. For example, [[example.com|example.com/yn]] points to a [[Directory (computing)|directory]] within the example.com domain, not to a subdomain of example.com.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Domain name]]\n*[[Hostname]]\n*[[Subdirectory]]\n*[[Webpage]]\n*[[Subpage]]\n*[[Vanity domain]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Domain name system]]\n\n[[de:Domain#Subdomain]]\n", "name_user": "43.245.120.178", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain"}

It translates an often humanly meaningful, text-based identifier to a system-internal, often numeric identification or addressing component. This service is performed by the server in response to a [[protocol (computing)|service protocol]] request.\n\nAn example of a name server is the server component of the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), one of the two principal [[namespace]]s of the [[Internet]]. The most important function of DNS servers is the translation (resolution) of human-memorable [[domain name]]s and [[hostname]]s into the corresponding numeric [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) addresses, the second principal name space of the Internet which is used to identify and locate computer systems and resources on the Internet.\n\n==Domain Name Server==\n{{Main|Domain Name System}}\n\nThe Internet maintains two principal [[namespace]]s: the domain name hierarchy<ref name=\"rfc1034\">RFC 1034, ''Domain Names\u2014Concepts and Facilities'', P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987)</ref> and the IP address system.<ref name=\"rfc781\">RFC 781, ''Internet Protocol\u2014DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'', Information Sciences Institute, J.

Internet name servers implement the Domain Name System.<ref name=\"rfc1035\">RFC 1035, ''Domain Names&nbsp;\u2014 Implementation and Specification'', P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987)</ref> The top hierarchy of the Domain Name System is served by the [[Root nameserver|root name servers]] maintained by delegation by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). Below the root, Internet resources are organized into a hierarchy of domains, administered by the respective registrars and domain name holders.  A DNS name server is a server that stores the [[Domain Name System|DNS records]], such as address (A, AAAA) records, name server (NS) records, and mail exchanger (MX) records for a domain name (see also [[List of DNS record types]]) and responds with answers to queries against its database.\n\n===Authoritative name server===\nAn authoritative name server is a name server that gives [[#Authoritative answer|answers]] in response to questions asked about names in a [[DNS zone|zone]]. An authoritative-only name server returns answers only to queries about domain names that have been specifically configured by the administrator. Name servers can also be configured to give authoritative answers to queries in some zones, while acting as a [[#Caching name server|caching name server]] for all other zones.<ref>{{cite IETF |title=DNS Terminology |bcp=219 |author1=Paul Hoffman |author2=Andrew Sullivan |author3=Kazunori Fujiwara |date=January 2019 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAn authoritative name server can either be a ''primary'' server (master) or a ''secondary'' server (slave). A primary server for a zone is the server that stores the definitive versions of all records in that zone.  It is identified by start-of-authority (SOA) resource record.  A secondary server for a zone uses an automatic updating mechanism to maintain an identical copy of the primary server's database for a zone. Examples of such mechanisms include [[DNS zone transfer]]s and file transfer protocols. DNS provides a mechanism whereby the primary for a zone can notify all the known secondaries for that zone when the contents of the zone have changed. The contents of a zone are either manually configured by an administrator, or managed using [[Dynamic DNS]].<ref>{{cite IETF |title=Dynamic Updates in the Domain Name System (DNS Update) |rfc=2136 |author1=Yakov Rekhter |author2=Susan Thomson |author3=Jim Bound |author4=Paul Vixie |date=April 1007 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\nEvery domain name appears in a zone served by one or more authoritative name servers.

The registrar provides the names of these servers to the [[domain registry]] for the [[top level domain]] containing the zone. The domain registry in turn configures the authoritative name servers for that top level domain with delegations for each server for the zone. If the fully qualified domain name of any name server for a zone appears within that zone, the zone administrator provides IP addresses for that name server, which are installed in the parent zone as [[glue records]]; otherwise, the delegation consists of the list of NS records for that zone.<ref>{{cite IETF |title=Domain Names - Domain Concepts and Facilities |rfc=1034 |sectionname=Technical considerations |section=4.2.1 |author1=Paul Mockapetris |date=November 1987 |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=17 December 2015 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Authoritative answer===<!-- 'Authoritative Answer' redirects here -->\nA name server indicates that its response is authoritative by setting the ''Authoritative Answer'' (''AA'') bit in the response to a query on a name for which it is authoritative.

However, with only authoritative name-servers operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the [[DNS root zone|root zone]] of the Domain Name System and each user system must implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.{{clarify|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Caching name server===\nCaching name servers (''DNS caches'') store DNS query results for a period of time determined in the configuration (time-to-live) of each domain-name record. DNS caches improve the efficiency of the DNS by reducing DNS traffic across the Internet, and by reducing load on authoritative name-servers, particularly root name-servers. Because they can answer questions more quickly, they also increase the performance of end-user applications that use the DNS.\n''Recursive name servers'' resolve any query they receive, even if they are not authoritative for the question being asked, by consulting the server or servers that are authoritative for the question.\nCaching name servers are often also recursive name servers\u2014they perform every step necessary to answer any DNS query they receive. To do this the name server queries each authoritative name-server in turn, starting from the DNS root zone. It continues until it reaches the authoritative server for the zone that contains the queried domain name. That server provides the answer to the question, or definitively says it can't be answered, and the ''caching resolver'' then returns this response to the client that asked the question.\nThe authority, resolving and caching functions can all be present in a DNS server implementation, but this is not required: a DNS server can implement any one of these functions alone, without implementing the others.\n[[Internet service providers]] typically provide caching resolvers for their customers. In addition, many [[home networking|home-networking]] routers implement caching resolvers to improve efficiency in the local network.\nSome systems utilize <code>nscd</code> - the name service caching daemon<ref>, though this is typically not used for caching DNS names.\n{{cite book\n| last          = Nemeth\n| first         = Evi\n| authorlink    = Evi Nemeth\n| first2        = Garth\n| last2         = Snyder\n| first3        = Trent R.\n| last3         = Hein\n| title         = Linux administration handbook\n| url           = //books.google.com/books?id=GB_O89fnz_sC\n| accessdate    = 2012-02-14\n| edition       = 2\n| year          = 2006\n| publisher     = Addison-Wesley Professional\n| isbn          = 978-0-13-148004-9\n| page          = 504e\n| quote         = ncsd [.....] cache[s] the results of DNS lookups [...] but it also wraps the library routines that access information from the <code> passwd</code> and <code>group</code> files and their network database equivalents.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[BIND]]\n* [[Comparison of DNS server software]]\n* [[Trojan.Win32.DNSChanger]]\n* [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]]\n* [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]]\n* [[Network Information Service]]\n* [[Name Service Switch|Name Servic india]]\n* [[Resolver (DNS)|resolver]], [[resolv.conf]], [[resolvconf]] for [[Unix]]/[[Linux]]\n* [[Open Root Server Network]]\n* [[RealNames]]\n* [[List of managed DNS providers]]\n* [[Public recursive name servers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://pcsupport.about.com/od/tipstricks/a/free-public-dns-servers.htm Free and Public DNS Servers], article on ''about.com'' by Tim Fisher, retrieved on 2015-02-08 21-59 UTC\n* [http://www.bind9.net/ DNS & BIND Resources]\n\n[[Category:Internet Protocol based network software]]\n[[Category:Domain name system]]\n\n[[de:Domain Name System#Nameserver]]\n<s></s>\n", "name_user": "43.245.120.178", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_server"}

A market economy is a decentralised economic system because it does not function via a central, economic plan (which is usually headed by a governmental body) but instead, acts through the distributed, local interactions in the market (e.g. individual [[investment]]s). While a \"market economy\" is a broad term and can differ greatly in terms of state or governmental control (and thus central control), the final \"behaviour\" of any market economy emerges from these local interactions and is not directly the result of a central body's set of instructions or regulation.\n\n==Application==\n[[File:RechargingSwarm.jpg|thumb|right|Swarm of [[open-source]] Jasmine micro-robots recharging themselves]]\n\n===Artificial intelligence and robotics===\nWhile classic [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) in the 1970s was focused on [[knowledge-based systems]] or planning robots, [[Rodney Brooks]]' [[behavior-based robotics|behaviour-based robots]] and their success in acting in the real, unpredictably changing world has led many AI researchers to shift from a planned, centralised symbolic architecture to studying intelligence as an emergent product of simple interactions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/JRA.1986.1087032 |title=A robust layered control system for a mobile robot |year=1986 |last1=Brooks |first1=R. |journal=IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation |volume=2 |pages=14\u201323|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA160833 }}</ref> This thus reflects a general shift from applying a centralised system in robotics to applying a more decentralised system based on local interactions at various levels of abstraction.\n\nFor example, largely stemming from [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon's]] [[physical symbol system|physical-symbol theory]], researchers in the 1970s designed robots with a course of action that, when executed, would result in the achievement of some desired goal; thus the robots were seen as \"intelligent\" if they could follow the directions of their central controller (the program or the programmer) (for an example, see [[Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver|STRIPS]]). However, upon Rodney Brooks' introduction of [[subsumption architecture]], which enabled robots to perform \"intelligent\" behaviour without using symbolic knowledge or explicit reasoning, increasingly more researchers have viewed intelligent behaviour as an emergent property that arises from an agent's interaction with the environment, including other agents in that environment.\n\nWhile certain researchers have begun to design their robots with closely coupled perception and action systems and attempted to [[embodied agent|embody]] and [[situated cognition|situate]] their agents a la Brooks, other researchers have attempted to simulate multi-agent behaviour and thus further dissect the phenomena of decentralised systems in achieving global goals. For example, in 1996, Minar, Burkhard, Lang-ton and Askenazi created a multi-agent software platform for the stimulation of interacting agents and their emergent collective behaviour called \"[[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]]\". While the basic unit in Swarm is the \"swarm\", a collection of agents executing a schedule of actions, agents can be composed of swarms of other agents in nested structures. As the software also provides object-oriented libraries of reusable components for building models and analyzing, displaying and controlling experiments on those models, it ultimately attempts to not only simulate multi-agent behaviour but to serve as a basis for further exploration of how collective groups of agents can achieve global goals through careful, yet implicit, coordination.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Minar |first1=N. |last2=Burkhart |first2=R. |last3=Langton |first3=C. |last4=Askenazi |first4=M. |year=1996 |url=http://www.santafe.edu/research/working-papers/abstract/70e0c84b2cff6e8e87f2940fa60965e9/ |title=The Swarm Simulation System: A Toolkit for Building Multi-Agent Simulations |work=SFI Working Papers |publisher=Sante Fe Institute}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Centralized system]]\n*[[Decentralization]]\n*[[Distributed system]]\n*[[Swarm intelligence]]\n\nExamples of decentralized systems:\n\n* Network: [[peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer technology]] (e.g. [[Decentralized network 42]])\n* Monetary: [[Bitcoin]]\n* Animal communities: [[Red harvester ant]]\n\nExamples of \"decentralized system culture\": [[Small Is Beautiful]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80098-0 |title=A model of collective nectar source selection by honey bees: Self-organization through simple rules |year=1991 |last1=Camazine |first1=Scott |last2=Sneyd |first2=James |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=547}}\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.6.1190 |title=There's more to self-esteem than whether it is high or low: The importance of stability of self-esteem |year=1993 |last1=Kernis |first1=Michael H. |last2=Cornell |first2=David P. |last3=Sun |first3=Chien-ru |last4=Berry |first4=Andrea |last5=Harlow |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=1190\u2013204 |pmid=8295118 |first5=T}}\n*{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Peter |work=National Geographic |date=July 2007 |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/07/swarms/miller-text |title=Swarm Theory |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}\n*{{cite web |last=Abeysinghe |first=Asanka |work=WSO2, Inc |date=July 2018 |url=https://git.io/fpwtf |title=Cell-based Architecture |accessdate=February 14, 2019}}\n\n{{swarming}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Decentralised System}}\n[[Category:Social systems]]\n[[Category:Systems theory]]\n[[Category:Emergence]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Short description|Systems without a single most important component or cluster}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2013}}\n[[File:Decentralization.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Graphical comparison of a centralised (A) and a decentralised (B) system]]\n\nA '''decentralised system''' in [[systems theory]] is a system in which lower level components operate on local information to accomplish global goals.

For example, the foraging behaviour of ''[[wasps]]'' is under the constant regulation and control of the queen.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1163/156853986X00090 |title=Queen Regulation of Worker Foraging in Paper Wasps: A Social Feedback Control System (Polistes Fuscatus, Hymenoptera: Vespidae) |year=1987 |last1=Reeve |first1=Hudson K. |last2=Gamboa |first2=George J. |journal=Behaviour |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=147|title-link=Paper Wasp }}</ref>\n\nThe [[ant mill]] is an example of when a biological decentralized system fails, when the rules governing the individual agents are not sufficient to handle certain scenarios.\n\n=== Human society: Market economy ===\nA [[market economy]] is an economy in which decisions on investment and the allocation of producer goods are mainly made through markets and not by a plan of production (see [[planned economy]]). A market economy is a decentralised economic system because it does not function via a central, economic plan (which is usually headed by a governmental body) but instead, acts through the distributed, local interactions in the market (e.g. individual [[investment]]s). While a \"market economy\" is a broad term and can differ greatly in terms of state or governmental control (and thus central control), the final \"behaviour\" of any market economy emerges from these local interactions and is not directly the result of a central body's set of instructions or regulation.\n\n==Application==\n[[File:RechargingSwarm.jpg|thumb|right|Swarm of [[open-source]] Jasmine micro-robots recharging themselves]]\n\n===Artificial intelligence and robotics===\nWhile classic [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) in the 1970s was focused on [[knowledge-based systems]] or planning robots, [[Rodney Brooks]]' [[behavior-based robotics|behaviour-based robots]] and their success in acting in the real, unpredictably changing world has led many AI researchers to shift from a planned, centralised symbolic architecture to studying intelligence as an emergent product of simple interactions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/JRA.1986.1087032 |title=A robust layered control system for a mobile robot |year=1986 |last1=Brooks |first1=R. |journal=IEEE Journal on Robotics and Automation |volume=2 |pages=14\u201323|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA160833 }}</ref> This thus reflects a general shift from applying a centralised system in robotics to applying a more decentralised system based on local interactions at various levels of abstraction.\n\nFor example, largely stemming from [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon's]] [[physical symbol system|physical-symbol theory]], researchers in the 1970s designed robots with a course of action that, when executed, would result in the achievement of some desired goal; thus the robots were seen as \"intelligent\" if they could follow the directions of their central controller (the program or the programmer) (for an example, see [[Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver|STRIPS]]). However, upon Rodney Brooks' introduction of [[subsumption architecture]], which enabled robots to perform \"intelligent\" behaviour without using symbolic knowledge or explicit reasoning, increasingly more researchers have viewed intelligent behaviour as an emergent property that arises from an agent's interaction with the environment, including other agents in that environment.\n\nWhile certain researchers have begun to design their robots with closely coupled perception and action systems and attempted to [[embodied agent|embody]] and [[situated cognition|situate]] their agents a la Brooks, other researchers have attempted to simulate multi-agent behaviour and thus further dissect the phenomena of decentralised systems in achieving global goals. For example, in 1996, Minar, Burkhard, Lang-ton and Askenazi created a multi-agent software platform for the stimulation of interacting agents and their emergent collective behaviour called \"[[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]]\". While the basic unit in Swarm is the \"swarm\", a collection of agents executing a schedule of actions, agents can be composed of swarms of other agents in nested structures. As the software also provides object-oriented libraries of reusable components for building models and analyzing, displaying and controlling experiments on those models, it ultimately attempts to not only simulate multi-agent behaviour but to serve as a basis for further exploration of how collective groups of agents can achieve global goals through careful, yet implicit, coordination.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Minar |first1=N. |last2=Burkhart |first2=R. |last3=Langton |first3=C. |last4=Askenazi |first4=M. |year=1996 |url=http://www.santafe.edu/research/working-papers/abstract/70e0c84b2cff6e8e87f2940fa60965e9/ |title=The Swarm Simulation System: A Toolkit for Building Multi-Agent Simulations |work=SFI Working Papers |publisher=Sante Fe Institute}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Centralized system]]\n*[[Decentralization]]\n*[[Distributed system]]\n*[[Swarm intelligence]]\n\nExamples of decentralized systems:\n\n* Network: [[peer-to-peer|peer-to-peer technology]] (e.g. [[Decentralized network 42]])\n* Monetary: [[Bitcoin]]\n* Animal communities: [[Red harvester ant]]\n\nExamples of \"decentralized system culture\": [[Small Is Beautiful]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80098-0 |title=A model of collective nectar source selection by honey bees: Self-organization through simple rules |year=1991 |last1=Camazine |first1=Scott |last2=Sneyd |first2=James |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=547}}\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.6.1190 |title=There's more to self-esteem than whether it is high or low: The importance of stability of self-esteem |year=1993 |last1=Kernis |first1=Michael H. |last2=Cornell |first2=David P. |last3=Sun |first3=Chien-ru |last4=Berry |first4=Andrea |last5=Harlow |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=65 |issue=6 |pages=1190\u2013204 |pmid=8295118 |first5=T}}\n*{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Peter |work=National Geographic |date=July 2007 |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/07/swarms/miller-text |title=Swarm Theory |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}\n*{{cite web |last=Abeysinghe |first=Asanka |work=WSO2, Inc |date=July 2018 |url=https://git.io/fpwtf |title=Cell-based Architecture |accessdate=February 14, 2019}}\n\n{{swarming}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Decentralised System}}\n[[Category:Social systems]]\n[[Category:Systems theory]]\n[[Category:Emergence]]\n", "name_user": "43.245.120.178", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralised_system"}
