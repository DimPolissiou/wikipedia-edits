It is {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vancouver]]. Situated at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater]] rivers, it is the first major community encountered after travelling along [[British Columbia Highway 5|Phase One of the Coquihalla Highway]] and acts as the gateway to all other major highways to the B.C. Interior. The city developed in 1893 when part of the ranches owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and John Charters were surveyed for a town site.<ref name=history>{{Cite book|editor=Nicola Valley Museum Archives Association|title=Merritt & The Nicola Valley: An Illustrated History|year=1998|publisher=Sonotek Publishing|location=Merritt, BC|pages=32\u201337|isbn=0-929069-11-0 }}</ref>\n\nOnce known as Forksdale, the community adopted its current name in 1906 in honour of mining engineer and railway promoter [[William Hamilton Merritt III]].<ref name=\"akrigg\">Akrigg, Helen B. and Akrigg, G.P.V; 1001 British Columbia Place Names; Discovery Press, Vancouver 1969, 1970, 1973, p. 114</ref> The {{convert|24|km2|adj=on}} city limits consist of the community, a number of civic parks, historical sites, an aquatic centre, a local arena, a public library (which is a branch of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library System) and a civic centre. Merritt has dozens of bronzed hand prints of country music stars who have been in the city for the annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] displayed throughout town. Merritt is also home to a local radio station, a weekly newspaper and the [[Nicola Valley Institute of Technology]] campus. Nearby, there are four [[List of British Columbia Provincial Parks|provincial park]]s, numerous lakes, and several recreational trails. Merritt is known as the \"Country Music Capital of Canada\" for its wealth of country music attractions, activities, and events.\n\n[[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]], and [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] intersect at Merritt with Highway 97C East connecting the city to [[Kelowna]] and [[Penticton]], Highway 97C Northwest to [[Logan Lake, British Columbia|Logan Lake]], [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]] to [[Spences Bridge, British Columbia|Spences Bridge]] and [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] South to [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]], Highway 5A North to [[Kamloops]], Highway 5 South to [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]], and Highway 5 North to [[Kamloops]]. Merritt's economy is dominated by the primary industries of forestry, tourism, and service.\n\n== History ==\n\nFor years, the Merritt area was a gathering place for local European colonists and [[First Nations]], as the area was a focus of transportation routes used by early [[settler|pioneers]]. The grasslands eventually drew the attention of settlers interested in [[ranching]], and the first ranches were staked in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the 1880s three ranches located at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater River]]s, owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and the John Charters Estate, became the focus of a farming community known as \"The Forks\". With the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through [[British Columbia]] in 1885, interest increased in the [[coal]] deposits south of The Forks.\n\nParts of the ranches owned by Voght, Garcia and Charters were surveyed in 1893 for the townsite of Forksdale, but the name did not catch on with locals. Instead, the name was changed in 1906 to honour [[William Hamilton Merritt III]], a mining engineer and railway promoter. By 1907, the [[coal]] mines were in operation and with the completion of the railway from [[Spences Bridge]], government and other offices starting moving from [[Lower Nicola|Lower]] and [[Upper Nicola Band|Upper Nicola]] to establish Merritt as the major settlement in the [[Nicola Valley]].\n\nArmstrong's Store moved from Lower Nicola to Nicola Avenue in Merritt in the spring of 1907. G.B. Armstrong became Merritt's first [[postmaster]] at this location in 1908. In 1910, Armstrong's Department Store moved to 2025 Quilchena Avenue. In 1909, the [[Bank of Montreal]] moved from the settlement of Nicola to Merritt. A.E. Howse moved his department store to the west end of Nicola Avenue. The ''Nicola Herald'', founded at Nicola Lake in 1905, moved from Nicola to Merritt in 1909 and the name was changed to the ''[[Merritt Herald]] and Nicola Valley Advocate''. Other industries developed in the [[Nicola Valley|Valley]], including [[ranching]], copper, nickel, gold and silver mining, and [[forestry]], and as a result, new business buildings were constructed.\n\nThe move toward incorporation began in 1910 and culminated on April 1, 1911 when Merritt was granted its city charter. The first Merritt [[City Hall]] was built in 1912. The top floor was police headquarters, the second for administration offices, and the bottom for the jail. The building included the fire hall and tower that housed a whistle to summon the [[volunteer fire department|volunteer fire fighters]].\n\nMerritt dedicated the names of its streets and avenues to early settlers. Among the names honoured were Charters, Chapman, Cleasby, Garcia, Voght, Coutlee, Nicola, Granite, and Quilchena.\n\nAs the town grew, it featured a drug store, a general store, a brewery and a jewellery store. The first electrical power service by the city was provided in February 1913.\n\nMerritt and the Nicola Valley experienced prosperity until the passage of restrictive trade legislation in the United States in 1930. Because the city had financially backed one of the major sawmills, the loss of lumber markets caused the city to go into receivership from 1933 to 1952.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe next wave of immigrants, primarily [[Sikh]], from the [[Punjab region]] of India, arrived in Merritt in the 1950s, followed by a large influx in the late 1960s and early 1970s to work in the booming forestry sector of the time and adding to the cultural mosaic of Merritt. Known as [[Indo-Canadians]], they continue to play a crucial part in the economy\u2014Aspen Planers Ltd., a major employer in the city, and many other businesses, restaurants and hotels in Merritt are owned by members of this group.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=SFU Archives|url=http://aabc.bc.ca/access/aabc/archbc/display/SFU-143}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn advance polls during the 2015 Canadian elections, an unexpectedly high turnout in Merritt resulted in there being an insufficient quantity of ballots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kamloops/democracy-watch-calls-for-audit-after-voting-mix-ups-1.3270400|title=Democracy Watch calls for audit after voting mix-ups - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n[[File:Merritt-panorama.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Merritt in winter]]\nMerritt is composed of four distinct residential areas: Bench, Collettville, Central and Diamondvale. The Bench is a residential mountain bench, hence the name, sited on the northwest side of the valley. Collettville, on the southwest edge of the community south of the Coldwater River, was the newest addition to Merritt. Central is situated at the south of the city centre. Diamond Vale is in the heart of the valley, and is the most populated. Each area is served by an elementary school: [[Merritt Bench Elementary School|Bench Elementary]], [[Collettville Elementary School|Collettville Elementary and French Immersion]], [[Merritt Central Elementary School|Central Elementary]], [[Diamond Vale Elementary School|Diamond Vale Elementary]]. Also, a high school, [[Merritt Secondary School]], that services the area. The main office for [[School District 58 Nicola-Similkameen]], which operates the schools in the area, is also located in Merritt. The town is also served by the [[Nicola Valley Museum and Archives]].\n\n== Commerce and industry ==\n\nToday, [[ranching]], [[farming]], [[forestry]], [[transport]]ation and [[tourism]] are the primary [[industry|industries]]. Merritt is the nearest large community to the [[Douglas Lake Cattle Company]], Canada's largest working cattle ranch.\n\nMerritt was once host to an annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] that is estimated to have drawn as many as 148,000 people at its peak in the summer of 2005. The Mountain Music Festival, combined with the development of the Merritt Walk of Stars - a display of bronzed handprints of Mountainfest artists placed around the community - the Mural Project, designed by artist [[Michelle Loughery]]{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} , the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame, Music in the Square and in the Park along with other tourism development activities have been used to solidify the city's branding as the Country Music Capital of Canada.\n\nMerritt's prime location has provided the opportunity to host many events, the West Coast Rally Association's Pacific Forest Rally, an off-road rally conducted as part of the Canadian Rally Championship series every October, also the annual winter Thunderbird Rally often begins and ends in Merritt. The Bass Coast Festival held annually on the BC Day weekend and supports electronic music and creative arts draws attendees from all over North America. The annual Labour Day Rodeo and Fall Fair are long standing traditions in this ranching valley, drawing participants from all over Canada and the US.\n\n== Merritt on film ==\n\nMerritt provided the backdrop for the [[Academy Award]]-nominated movie ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120255/locations|title=Filming Locations for The Sweet Hereafter|publisher=The Internet Movie Database (IMDB)|accessdate=2008-11-15}}</ref> The debut episode of ''[[Smallville]]'' was partly filmed on location in Merritt. [[Jack Nicholson]]'s ''[[The Pledge (film)|The Pledge]]'' and the 2006 remake of ''[[The Wicker Man (2006 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' were also filmed partly in the area. In 2013 ''[[Shana: The Wolf's Music]]'' directed by Nino Jacusso was released, it is a drama about a First Nations girl coming of age set in a First Nations location. The Nicola Valley is also host to the shooting of numerous commercials.

It is {{convert|270|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vancouver]]. Situated at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater]] rivers, it is the first major community encountered after travelling along [[British Columbia Highway 5|Phase One of the Coquihalla Highway]] and acts as the gateway to all other major highways to the B.C. Interior. The city developed in 1893 when part of the ranches owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and John Charters were surveyed for a town site.<ref name=history>{{Cite book|editor=Nicola Valley Museum Archives Association|title=Merritt & The Nicola Valley: An Illustrated History|year=1998|publisher=Sonotek Publishing|location=Merritt, BC|pages=32\u201337|isbn=0-929069-11-0 }}</ref>\n\nOnce known as Forksdale, the community adopted its current name in 1906 in honour of mining engineer and railway promoter [[William Hamilton Merritt III]].<ref name=\"akrigg\">Akrigg, Helen B. and Akrigg, G.P.V; 1001 British Columbia Place Names; Discovery Press, Vancouver 1969, 1970, 1973, p. 114</ref> The {{convert|24|km2|adj=on}} city limits consist of the community, a number of civic parks, historical sites, an aquatic centre, a local arena, a public library (which is a branch of the Thompson-Nicola Regional District Library System) and a civic centre. Merritt has dozens of bronzed hand prints of country music stars who have been in the city for the annual [[Merritt Mountain Music Festival]] displayed throughout town. Merritt is also home to a local radio station, a weekly newspaper and the [[Nicola Valley Institute of Technology]] campus. Nearby, there are four [[List of British Columbia Provincial Parks|provincial park]]s, numerous lakes, and several recreational trails. Merritt is known as the \"Country Music Capital of Canada\" for its wealth of country music attractions, activities, and events.\n\n[[British Columbia Highway 5|Highway 5]], and [[British Columbia Highway 97C|Highway 97C]] intersect at Merritt with Highway 97C East connecting the city to [[Kelowna]] and [[Penticton]], Highway 97C Northwest to [[Logan Lake, British Columbia|Logan Lake]], [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]] to [[Spences Bridge, British Columbia|Spences Bridge]] and [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]] South to [[Princeton, British Columbia|Princeton]], Highway 5A North to [[Kamloops]], Highway 5 South to [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]], and Highway 5 North to [[Kamloops]]. Merritt's economy is dominated by the primary industries of forestry, tourism, and service.\n\n== History ==\n\nFor years, the Merritt area was a gathering place for local European colonists and [[First Nations]], as the area was a focus of transportation routes used by early [[settler|pioneers]]. The grasslands eventually drew the attention of settlers interested in [[ranching]], and the first ranches were staked in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the 1880s three ranches located at the confluence of the [[Nicola River|Nicola]] and [[Coldwater River (British Columbia)|Coldwater River]]s, owned by William Voght, Jesus Garcia, and the John Charters Estate, became the focus of a farming community known as \"The Forks\". With the completion of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] through [[British Columbia]] in 1885, interest increased in the [[coal]] deposits south of The Forks.\n\nParts of the ranches owned by Voght, Garcia and Charters were surveyed in 1893 for the townsite of Forksdale, but the name did not catch on with locals. Instead, the name was changed in 1906 to honour [[William Hamilton Merritt III]], a mining engineer and railway promoter. By 1907, the [[coal]] mines were in operation and with the completion of the railway from [[Spences Bridge]], government and other offices starting moving from [[Lower Nicola|Lower]] and [[Upper Nicola Band|Upper Nicola]] to establish Merritt as the major settlement in the [[Nicola Valley]].\n\nArmstrong's Store moved from Lower Nicola to Nicola Avenue in Merritt in the spring of 1907. G.B. Armstrong became Merritt's first [[postmaster]] at this location in 1908. In 1910, Armstrong's Department Store moved to 2025 Quilchena Avenue. In 1909, the [[Bank of Montreal]] moved from the settlement of Nicola to Merritt. A.E. Howse moved his department store to the west end of Nicola Avenue. The ''Nicola Herald'', founded at Nicola Lake in 1905, moved from Nicola to Merritt in 1909 and the name was changed to the ''[[Merritt Herald]] and Nicola Valley Advocate''. Other industries developed in the [[Nicola Valley|Valley]], including [[ranching]], copper, nickel, gold and silver mining, and [[forestry]], and as a result, new business buildings were constructed.\n\nThe move toward incorporation began in 1910 and culminated on April 1, 1911 when Merritt was granted its city charter. The first Merritt [[City Hall]] was built in 1912. The top floor was police headquarters, the second for administration offices, and the bottom for the jail. The building included the fire hall and tower that housed a whistle to summon the [[volunteer fire department|volunteer fire fighters]].\n\nMerritt dedicated the names of its streets and avenues to early settlers. Among the names honoured were Charters, Chapman, Cleasby, Garcia, Voght, Coutlee, Nicola, Granite, and Quilchena.\n\nAs the town grew, it featured a drug store, a general store, a brewery and a jewellery store. The first electrical power service by the city was provided in February 1913.\n\nMerritt and the Nicola Valley experienced prosperity until the passage of restrictive trade legislation in the United States in 1930. Because the city had financially backed one of the major sawmills, the loss of lumber markets caused the city to go into receivership from 1933 to 1952.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe next wave of immigrants, primarily [[Sikh]], from the [[Punjab region]] of India, arrived in Merritt in the 1950s, followed by a large influx in the late 1960s and early 1970s to work in the booming forestry sector of the time and adding to the cultural mosaic of Merritt. Known as [[Indo-Canadians]], they continue to play a crucial part in the economy\u2014Aspen Planers Ltd., a major employer in the city, and many other businesses, restaurants and hotels in Merritt are owned by members of this group.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=SFU Archives|url=http://aabc.bc.ca/access/aabc/archbc/display/SFU-143}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn advance polls during the 2015 Canadian elections, an unexpectedly high turnout in Merritt resulted in there being an insufficient quantity of ballots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kamloops/democracy-watch-calls-for-audit-after-voting-mix-ups-1.3270400|title=Democracy Watch calls for audit after voting mix-ups - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n[[File:Merritt-panorama.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Merritt in winter]]\nMerritt is composed of four distinct residential areas: Bench, Collettville, Central and Diamondvale. The Bench is a residential mountain bench, hence the name, sited on the northwest side of the valley. Collettville, on the southwest edge of the community south of the Coldwater River, was the newest addition to Merritt. Central is situated at the south of the city centre. Diamond Vale is in the heart of the valley, and is the most populated. Each area is served by an elementary school: [[Merritt Bench Elementary School|Bench Elementary]], [[Collettville Elementary School|Collettville Elementary and French Immersion]], [[Merritt Central Elementary School|Central Elementary]], [[Diamond Vale Elementary School|Diamond Vale Elementary]]. Also, a high school, [[Merritt Secondary School]], that services the area.

A large systematic review of the literature was recently performed to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnosing organic dyspepsia by clinical opinion versus computer models in patients referred for [[upper endoscopy]]. The computer models were based on patient demographics, risk factors, historical items, and symptoms. The study showed that neither clinical impression nor computer models were able to adequately distinguish organic from functional disease.<ref name=MoayyediTalley2006>{{cite journal|vauthors=Moayyedi P, Talley NJ, Fennerty MB, Vakil N|title=Can the clinical history distinguish between organic and functional dyspepsia?|journal=JAMA|volume=295|issue=13|pages=1566\u201376|date=Apr 5, 2006 |pmid=16595759|type=Review|doi=10.1001/jama.295.13.1566}}</ref>\n\nIn a recent study, patients with peptic ulcer disease were compared with patients with functional dyspepsia in an age and sex-matched study. Although the functional dyspepsia group reported more upper abdominal fullness, nausea, and overall greater distress and anxiety, almost all the same symptoms were seen in both groups. \nTherefore, it is the clinician\u2019s challenging task to separate patients who may have an organic disorder, and thus warrant further diagnostic testing, from patients who have functional dyspepsia, who are given empiric symptomatic treatment. The workup should be targeted to identify or rule out specific causes. Traditionally, people at high-risk have been identified by \"alarm\" features. However, the utility of these features in identifying the presence of upper cancer of the esophagus or stomach has been debated. A meta analysis looking at the sensitivity and specificity of alarm features found a range of 0\u201383% and 40\u201398%, respectively. However, there was high heterogeneity between studies.<ref name=VakilMoayyedi2006>{{cite journal|vauthors=Vakil N, Moayyedi P, Fennerty MB, Talley NJ|title=Limited value of alarm features in the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal malignancy: systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Gastroenterology|volume=131|issue=2|pages=390\u2013401|date=Aug 2006|pmid=16890592|url=http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2806%2900840-7/fulltext|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2006.04.029|type=Review}}</ref>\n\nThe physical examination may elicit abdominal tenderness, but this finding is nonspecific.

[[Anxiety]] is also associated with functional dyspepsia. In some people, it appears before the onset of gut symptoms; in other cases, anxiety develops after onset of the disorder, which suggests that a [[gut\u2013brain axis|gut-driven brain]] disorder may be a possible cause.

Similarly, recent European trials have not shown significant differences in symptoms after ''H. pylori'' eradication as compared with controls. Systematic reviews of eradication have been conducted, with varying results. A systematic review in the ''Annals of Internal Medicine'' suggested no statistically significant effect, with an odds ratio (OR) for treatment success versus control of 1.29 (95% CI, 0.89\u20131.89; P = 0.18).

The psychiatric hypothesis holds that the symptoms of dyspepsia may be due to depression, increased anxiety, or a somatization disorder. Epidemiological studies suggest there is an association between functional dyspepsia and psychological disorders. Symptoms of neurosis, anxiety, hypochondriasis, and depression are more common in patients being evaluated for unexplained gastrointestinal complaints than in healthy controls. Comparisons of functional and organic dyspepsia have demonstrated that patients with functional dyspepsia are less likely to have decreased stress or anxiety at 1-year follow-up after being reassured of having no serious disease. This suggests that functional dyspepsia symptoms are long-lasting, compared with those of organic dyspepsia, and that the emotional ties are strong.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pajala|first1=M|last2=Heikkinen|first2=M|title=A prospective 1-year follow-up study in patients with functional or organic dyspepsia: changes in gastrointestinal symptoms, mental distress and fear of serious illness.|journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther|date=2006|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1241\u20131246|pmid=17014583|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03108.x}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nPeople under 55 years without [[alarm symptoms]] can be treated without investigation.

Investigation for ''H. pylori'' infection is usually performed when there is a moderate to high prevalence of this infection in the local community or the person with dyspepsia has other risk factors for ''H. pylori'' infection, related for example to ethnicity or immigration from a high-prevalence area. If infection is confirmed, it can usually be eradicated by medication.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMedication-related dyspepsia is usually related to NSAIDs and can be complicated by bleeding or ulceration with perforation of stomach wall.\n\n==Treatment==\n\nFunctional and undifferentiated dyspepsia have similar treatments. Drug therapy decisions are difficult because trials included heartburn in the definition of dyspepsia. This led to the results favoring [[proton pump inhibitors]] (PPIs), which are effective for the treatment of heartburn.\n\nTraditional therapies used for this diagnosis include lifestyle modification, [[antacid]]s, [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists (H2-RAs)]], [[prokinetic]] agents, and [[antiflatulent]]s.

A large systematic review of the literature was recently performed to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnosing organic dyspepsia by clinical opinion versus computer models in patients referred for [[upper endoscopy]]. The computer models were based on patient demographics, risk factors, historical items, and symptoms. The study showed that neither clinical impression nor computer models were able to adequately distinguish organic from functional disease.<ref name=MoayyediTalley2006>{{cite journal|vauthors=Moayyedi P, Talley NJ, Fennerty MB, Vakil N|title=Can the clinical history distinguish between organic and functional dyspepsia?|journal=JAMA|volume=295|issue=13|pages=1566\u201376|date=Apr 5, 2006 |pmid=16595759|type=Review|doi=10.1001/jama.295.13.1566}}</ref>\n\nIn a recent study, patients with peptic ulcer disease were compared with patients with functional dyspepsia in an age and sex-matched study. Although the functional dyspepsia group reported more upper abdominal fullness, nausea, and overall greater distress and anxiety, almost all the same symptoms were seen in both groups. \nTherefore, it is the clinician\u2019s challenging task to separate patients who may have an organic disorder, and thus warrant further diagnostic testing, from patients who have functional dyspepsia, who are given empiric symptomatic treatment. The workup should be targeted to identify or rule out specific causes. Traditionally, people at high-risk have been identified by \"alarm\" features. However, the utility of these features in identifying the presence of upper cancer of the esophagus or stomach has been debated. A meta analysis looking at the sensitivity and specificity of alarm features found a range of 0\u201383% and 40\u201398%, respectively. However, there was high heterogeneity between studies.<ref name=VakilMoayyedi2006>{{cite journal|vauthors=Vakil N, Moayyedi P, Fennerty MB, Talley NJ|title=Limited value of alarm features in the diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal malignancy: systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Gastroenterology|volume=131|issue=2|pages=390\u2013401|date=Aug 2006|pmid=16890592|url=http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2806%2900840-7/fulltext|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2006.04.029|type=Review}}</ref>\n\nThe physical examination may elicit abdominal tenderness, but this finding is nonspecific.

More than 70% of people have no obvious organic cause for their symptoms after evaluation. Symptoms may arise from a complex interaction of increased visceral afferent sensitivity, gastric delayed emptying ([[gastroparesis]]) or impaired accommodation to food. [[Anxiety]] is also associated with functional dyspepsia. In some people, it appears before the onset of gut symptoms; in other cases, anxiety develops after onset of the disorder, which suggests that a [[gut\u2013brain axis|gut-driven brain]] disorder may be a possible cause.

Similarly, recent European trials have not shown significant differences in symptoms after ''H. pylori'' eradication as compared with controls. Systematic reviews of eradication have been conducted, with varying results.

The psychiatric hypothesis holds that the symptoms of dyspepsia may be due to depression, increased anxiety, or a somatization disorder. Epidemiological studies suggest there is an association between functional dyspepsia and psychological disorders. Symptoms of neurosis, anxiety, hypochondriasis, and depression are more common in patients being evaluated for unexplained gastrointestinal complaints than in healthy controls. Comparisons of functional and organic dyspepsia have demonstrated that patients with functional dyspepsia are less likely to have decreased stress or anxiety at 1-year follow-up after being reassured of having no serious disease. This suggests that functional dyspepsia symptoms are long-lasting, compared with those of organic dyspepsia, and that the emotional ties are strong.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pajala|first1=M|last2=Heikkinen|first2=M|title=A prospective 1-year follow-up study in patients with functional or organic dyspepsia: changes in gastrointestinal symptoms, mental distress and fear of serious illness.|journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther|date=2006|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1241\u20131246|pmid=17014583|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03108.x}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nPeople under 55 years without [[alarm symptoms]] can be treated without investigation.

Investigation for ''H. pylori'' infection is usually performed when there is a moderate to high prevalence of this infection in the local community or the person with dyspepsia has other risk factors for ''H. pylori'' infection, related for example to ethnicity or immigration from a high-prevalence area. If infection is confirmed, it can usually be eradicated by medication.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMedication-related dyspepsia is usually related to NSAIDs and can be complicated by bleeding or ulceration with perforation of stomach wall.\n\n==Treatment==\n\nFunctional and undifferentiated dyspepsia have similar treatments. Drug therapy decisions are difficult because trials included heartburn in the definition of dyspepsia. This led to the results favoring [[proton pump inhibitors]] (PPIs), which are effective for the treatment of heartburn.\n\nTraditional therapies used for this diagnosis include lifestyle modification, [[antacid]]s, [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists (H2-RAs)]], [[prokinetic]] agents, and [[antiflatulent]]s.

The story of the game centres on The Club, an underground blood sport controlled by a wealthy elite who place their bets on who will survive the gladiatorial-style combat.<ref>A. Fitch, Tyler, and Gord, \"''The Club'': Stick with the guest pass,\" ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 226 (March 2008): 83.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe player chooses from a roster of characters who are forced to compete in The Club, a modern form of gladiatorial combat. There are 8 characters to choose from: Renwick, Dragov, Nemo, Seager, Adjo, Kuro, Finn, and Killen.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Club'' is played from a third-person perspective. The player must make their way through a level as quickly as possible, or defend one location and survive attacks from [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawning]] enemies for a set amount of time. Gameplay is centred on a [[High score|score]] mechanic where each kill acts as a [[bonus multiplier]]. Various kill methods, such as [[ricochet]]s, head shots, and long range shots earn extra points. After each kill, the player has several seconds to get another kill before the bonus multiplier starts to reduce. This interval also reduces the higher the multiplier gets. Icons are scattered throughout each level, offering bonuses. Weapons, ammunition and health are present but the player is not rewarded for picking them up.  ''The Club'' incorporates elements from [[racing video game]]s, including [[time attack]] events.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nThe game includes eight multiplayer modes, with online leaderboards to compare scores. Online games can feature up to seven opponents on-line, or four-player local [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]].\n\n==Development==\nThe lead designer of the game was Matt Cavanagh who described the title as \"a racing game with guns.\"  At first the game was literally a shooting gallery with limited AI.  After 6 months of development a new prototype was created with an emphasis on scoring rather than narrative.  The gameplay was designed before any setting and back story was created.  Many publishers declined to take on the title before [[Sega]] chose to back it.<ref>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-14-the-club-retrospective</ref>\n\nThe title was released globally on February 8, 2008. The demo was added to the PlayStation Network in the EU region on 27 December 2007, Xbox Live on the 23 January 2008, and on the North American PlayStation Network on the January 24, 2008.

The story of the game centres on The Club, an underground blood sport controlled by a wealthy elite who place their bets on who will survive the gladiatorial-style combat.<ref>A. Fitch, Tyler, and Gord, \"''The Club'': Stick with the guest pass,\" ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' 226 (March 2008): 83.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe player chooses from a roster of characters who are forced to compete in The Club, a modern form of gladiatorial combat. There are 8 characters to choose from: Renwick, Dragov, Nemo, Seager, Adjo, Kuro, Finn, and Killen.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''The Club'' is played from a third-person perspective. The player must make their way through a level as quickly as possible, or defend one location and survive attacks from [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawning]] enemies for a set amount of time. Gameplay is centred on a [[High score|score]] mechanic where each kill acts as a [[bonus multiplier]]. Various kill methods, such as [[ricochet]]s, head shots, and long range shots earn extra points. After each kill, the player has several seconds to get another kill before the bonus multiplier starts to reduce. This interval also reduces the higher the multiplier gets. Icons are scattered throughout each level, offering bonuses. Weapons, ammunition and health are present but the player is not rewarded for picking them up.  ''The Club'' incorporates elements from [[racing video game]]s, including [[time attack]] events.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nThe game includes eight multiplayer modes, with online leaderboards to compare scores. Online games can feature up to seven opponents on-line, or four-player local [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]].\n\n==Development==\nThe lead designer of the game was Matt Cavanagh who described the title as \"a racing game with guns.\"  At first the game was literally a shooting gallery with limited AI.  After 6 months of development a new prototype was created with an emphasis on scoring rather than narrative.  The gameplay was designed before any setting and back story was created.  Many publishers declined to take on the title before [[Sega]] chose to back it.<ref>http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-14-the-club-retrospective</ref>\n\nThe title was released globally on February 8, 2008. The demo was added to the PlayStation Network in the EU region on 27 December 2007, Xbox Live on the 23 January 2008, and on the North American PlayStation Network on the January 24, 2008.

Ratooning reduces the cost of cultivation by dispensing with additional seed material and some cultural practices such as land preparation and preparatory irrigation (''palewa''). It also results in early ripening of canes by at least a month or so, thus it adds to the effective crushing period. Sugarcane has a tremendous ratooning potential, and the oldest cultivated ratoon, being ratooned since 1757, in [[East China]], in [[Fujian|Fujian Province]], stands to its testimony. The number of ratoons in sugarcane production cycles varies throughout the world, ''i.e.,'' from one plant crop in [[Indonesia]] and some parts of [[China]], one plant crop and a ratoon crop in [[India]], [[Fiji]] and some parts of China, to six or more successive ratoons in [[Mauritius]], [[Cuba]], [[Venezuela]], clayey soils of [[Zimbabwe]], some parts of [[Puerto Rico]], etc. The later is also referred to as multiple ratooning. A decline in cane yield in successive ratoon crops, the so-called \"ratoon decline\", on the order of 20%, had been reported from many sugarcane-growing areas in India; the decline is more (up to 40% ) in subtropical India. Causes for this decline are: poor ratoon management, inherited differences in potential (ratoon) productivity, increasing incidence of diseases (like smut, grassy shoot disease, and red rot) which result in stands with gaps (studies conducted in India have shown that a gap over 10% significantly affects productivity of a ratoon crop), relatively less efficient enzyme systems (particularly nitrate reductase) activity, ''in vivo'' and prevalence of low temperatures during harvest, especially for early-ripening varieties and ratoon crop(s) in subtropical India which affects sprouting of stubble buds, etc. Insect pests also assume importance in a ratoon crop as: stubble acts as a 'carry-over' of the inocula of pests both for coming up ratoon and for the neighbouring sugarcane crop(s), improperly looked-after crop gets infested by a number of insect pests, emerging sprouts of a ratoon crop favour rapid development and multiplication of some of the insect pests, and insect associated with stubble affect sprouting causing gaps which ultimately affect productivity of the ratoon crop, ''per se''.\n\nIn Indian context, in subtropical India, ratoon initiated during spring (March) resulted in higher number of millable canes, cane yield and sucrose % juice in comparison to ratoon crops initiated either in winter (January) or summer (May). In peninsular India, however, as the sugarcane crop does not suffer extremes of weather conditions during summer and winters, differences in time of planting and harvest do not significantly influence the yield of succeeding ratoon crop.<ref name=Shrivastava-1982>{{cite book | first1 = A K | last1 = Shrivastava | first2 = A K | last2 = Ghosh | first3 = V P | last3 = Agnihotri | year = 1982 | title = Sugar Cane Ratoons | publisher = Oxford & IBH Publishing Co.

Ratooning reduces the cost of cultivation by dispensing with additional seed material and some cultural practices such as land preparation and preparatory irrigation (''palewa''). It also results in early ripening of canes by at least a month or so, thus it adds to the effective crushing period. Sugarcane has a tremendous ratooning potential, and the oldest cultivated ratoon, being ratooned since 1757, in [[East China]], in [[Fujian|Fujian Province]], stands to its testimony. The number of ratoons in sugarcane production cycles varies throughout the world, ''i.e.,'' from one plant crop in [[Indonesia]] and some parts of [[China]], one plant crop and a ratoon crop in [[India]], [[Fiji]] and some parts of China, to six or more successive ratoons in [[Mauritius]], [[Cuba]], [[Venezuela]], clayey soils of [[Zimbabwe]], some parts of [[Puerto Rico]], etc. The later is also referred to as multiple ratooning. A decline in cane yield in successive ratoon crops, the so-called \"ratoon decline\", on the order of 20%, had been reported from many sugarcane-growing areas in India; the decline is more (up to 40% ) in subtropical India. Causes for this decline are: poor ratoon management, inherited differences in potential (ratoon) productivity, increasing incidence of diseases (like smut, grassy shoot disease, and red rot) which result in stands with gaps (studies conducted in India have shown that a gap over 10% significantly affects productivity of a ratoon crop), relatively less efficient enzyme systems (particularly nitrate reductase) activity, ''in vivo'' and prevalence of low temperatures during harvest, especially for early-ripening varieties and ratoon crop(s) in subtropical India which affects sprouting of stubble buds, etc. Insect pests also assume importance in a ratoon crop as: stubble acts as a 'carry-over' of the inocula of pests both for coming up ratoon and for the neighbouring sugarcane crop(s), improperly looked-after crop gets infested by a number of insect pests, emerging sprouts of a ratoon crop favour rapid development and multiplication of some of the insect pests, and insect associated with stubble affect sprouting causing gaps which ultimately affect productivity of the ratoon crop, ''per se''.\n\nIn Indian context, in subtropical India, ratoon initiated during spring (March) resulted in higher number of millable canes, cane yield and sucrose % juice in comparison to ratoon crops initiated either in winter (January) or summer (May). In peninsular India, however, as the sugarcane crop does not suffer extremes of weather conditions during summer and winters, differences in time of planting and harvest do not significantly influence the yield of succeeding ratoon crop.<ref name=Shrivastava-1982>{{cite book | first1 = A K | last1 = Shrivastava | first2 = A K | last2 = Ghosh | first3 = V P | last3 = Agnihotri | year = 1982 | title = Sugar Cane Ratoons | publisher = Oxford & IBH Publishing Co.
