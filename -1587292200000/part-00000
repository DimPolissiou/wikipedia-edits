''A. Atratus'' are generally dark yellow with all four larval stages being black. Adult whiteflies are very small bugs with white wings. Females lay eggs on the underside directly onto plant leaves, and eventually, eggs become crawlers after 6 days. These [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] remain on the same leaf for the rest of their development until they emerge as winged adults. This cycle takes about 3 weeks in favorable conditions, however, the whiteflies are able to survive in freezing temperatures. \nIdentification of the species is best through mounted slides as most species of the whiteflies have very similar characteristics. The slides confirmed an elongated oval puparium with an entire dark cuticle, marginal teeth separated, rounded apices/ converging suntruncare, \n<ref name=RG/>\n\n===Range and habitat===\nOriginally ''Aleurotrachelus atratus'' was first reported in South America but new reports have been made in North America, Central America, the Caribbean, Africa and in the lower parts of Asia. They are able to travel short distances by flying most reports are due to infected plants being brought into areas where there are no natural predators for the whitefly. ''Aleurotrachelus atratus'' prefer tropical habitats where coconut palms are cultivated. Whiteflies also migrate towards agricultural land, managed forests, plantations and orchards.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/112108|title=Aleurotrachelus atratus (palm-infesting whitefly)|website=www.cabi.org}}</ref>\n\n===Life cycle===\nThe life cycle for ''Aleurotrachelus atratus'' lays anywhere between 50-400 eggs in its lifetime. From egg to crawler then through second, third, and fourth instar nymph, and finally, an adult ''Aleurotrachelus atratus'' the full life cycle takes around 48 days or 2 months.

Another alternative method consists of yellow sticky traps, because they can help monitor whitefly numbers as well as catch a majority of them. Vacuuming the whiteflies off the plants with a [[dust buster]] during mornings or cool evenings is another useful methodology because the insects are sluggish during these time periods. Using insecticidal soaps and Neem may reduce but will not completely eradicate a whitefly problem.

The [[Kingdom of New Spain]] was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire. The two pillars of Spanish rule were the State and the Roman Catholic Church, both under the authority of the Spanish crown. In 1493 the pope had granted [[Patronato real|sweeping powers]] to the Spanish crown, with the proviso that the crown spread Christianity in its new realms. In 1524, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] created the [[Council of the Indies]] based in Spain to oversee State power its overseas territories; in New Spain the crown established a high court in Mexico City, the ''[[Real Audiencia]],'' and then in 1535 created the viceroyalty. The viceroy was highest official of the State. In the religious sphere, the diocese of Mexico was created in 1530 and elevated to the [[Archdiocese of Mexico]] in 1546, with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, overseeing Roman Catholic clergy. Castilian Spanish was the language of rulers. The Catholic faith the only one permitted, with non-Catholics (Jews and Protestants) and Catholics (excluding Indians) holding unorthodox views being subject to the [[Mexican Inquisition]], established in 1571.<ref>Chuchiak, John F.

The capital Mexico City was and remains the premier city. Cities and towns were hubs of civil officials, ecclesiastics, business, Spanish elites, and mixed-race and indigenous artisans and workers. When deposits of silver were discovered in sparsely populated northern Mexico, far from the dense populations of central Mexico, the Spanish secured the region against fiercely resistant indigenous [[Chichimeca War|Chichimecas]].  The Viceroyalty at its greatest extent included the territories of modern Mexico, Central America as far south as Costa Rica, and the western United States. The Viceregal capital Mexico City also administrated the [[Spanish West Indies]] (the [[Caribbean]]), the [[Spanish East Indies]] (that is, the [[Philippines]]), and [[Spanish Florida]].

Emerging as a national hero in defending Mexico was creole army general, [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], who had participated in the overthrow of the emperor, fought the Spanish invasion, and came to dominate the politics for the next 25 years, until his own overthrow in 1855.\n\nMexico also contended with indigenous groups which controlled territory that Mexico claimed in the north.  The [[Comanche Wars|Comanche]] controlled a [[Comancher\u00eda|huge territory]] in the sparsely populated region of central and northern Texas.<ref>Weber, David J., ''The Mexican Frontier, 1821\u20131846: The American Southwest under Mexico,'' University of New Mexico Press, 1982</ref> Wanting to stabilize and develop the frontier, the Mexican government encouraged Anglo-American immigration into present-day Texas. The region bordered the United States, and was territory controlled by [[Comanches]]. There were few settlers from central Mexico moving to this remote and hostile territory. Mexico by law was a Catholic country; the Anglo Americans were primarily Protestant English speakers from the southern United States. Some brought their black slaves, which after 1829 was contrary to Mexican law. Santa Anna sought to centralize government rule, suspending the constitution and promulgating the [[Siete Leyes|Seven Laws]], which place power in his hands. When he suspended the 1824 Constitution, civil war spread across the country. Three new governments declared independence: the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] and the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]].<ref name=\"miranda\"/>{{rp|129\u2013137}}\n\nThe largest blow to Mexico was the U.S. invasion of Mexico in 1846 in the [[Mexican American War]]. Mexico lost much of its sparsely populated northern territory, sealed in the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].  Despite that disastrous loss, Conservative Santa Anna returned to the presidency yet again and then was ousted and exiled in the Liberal [[Revolution of Ayutla]].\n\n===Liberal Reform, French Intervention, and Restored Republic (1855\u20131876)===\n{{Main|Second Mexican Republic|La Reforma|Second Mexican Empire}}\n[[File:Benito Ju\u00e1rez, siglo XIX, \u00f3leo sobre tela.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], leader of the [[La Reforma|Liberal Reform]]]]\n[[File:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|thumb|''[[The Execution of Emperor Maximilian]]'', 19 June 1867.

Painting by [[\u00c9douard Manet]] 1868.]]\nThe overthrow of Santa Anna and the establishment of a civilian government by Liberals allowed them to enact laws that they considered vital for Mexico's economic development. It was a prelude to more civil wars and yet another foreign invasion. The [[La Reforma|Liberal Reform]] attempted to modernize Mexico's economy and institutions along liberal principles.  They promulgated a new [[constitution|Constitution of 1857]], separating Church and State, stripping the Conservative institutions of the Church and the military of their special privileges (''[[fueros]]''); mandating the sale of Church-owned property and sale of indigenous community lands, and secularizing education.<ref>Britton, John A. \"Liberalism\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, 739</ref> Conservatives revolted, touching off [[War of the Reform|civil war]] between rival Liberal and Conservative governments (1858\u201361). Liberals defeated the Conservative army on the battlefield, but Conservatives sought another solution to gain power via foreign intervention by the French. Mexican conservatives asked Emperor [[Napoleon III]] to place a European monarch as head of state in Mexico. The French Army defeated the Mexican Army and placed Maximilian Hapsburg on the [[Second Mexican Empire|newly-established throne]] of Mexico, supported by Mexican Conservatives and propped up by the French Army. The Liberal republic under [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] was basically a government in internal exile, but with the end of the Civil War in the U.S. in April 1865, that government began aiding the Mexican Republic. Two years later, the French Army withdrew its support, Maximilian remained in Mexico rather than return to Europe. Republican forces captured him and he was executed in Quer\u00e9taro, along with two Conservative Mexican generals.  The \"Restored Republic\" saw the return of Ju\u00e1rez, who was \"the personification of the embattled republic,\"<ref>Hamnett, Brian. \"Benito Ju\u00e1rez\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 719-20</ref> as president.\n\nThe Conservatives had been not only defeated militarily, but also discredited politically for their collaboration with the French invaders. Liberalism became synonymous with patriotism.<ref>Britton, \"Liberalism\" p. 740.</ref>  The Mexican Army that had its roots in the colonial royal army and then the army of the early republic was destroyed. New military leaders had emerged from the War of the Reform and the conflict with the French, most notably [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], a hero of the [[Battle of Puebla|Cinco de Mayo]], who now sought civilian power. Ju\u00e1rez won re-election in 1867, but was challenged by D\u00edaz, who criticized him for running for re-election. D\u00edaz then rebelled, crushed by Ju\u00e1rez.  Having won re-election, Ju\u00e1rez died in office of natural causes in July 1872, and Liberal [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada]] became president, declaring a \"religion of state\" for rule of law, peace, and order. When Lerdo ran for re-election, D\u00edaz rebelled against the civilian president, issuing the [[Plan of Tuxtepec]]. D\u00edaz had more support and waged guerrilla warfare against Lerdo.  On the verge of D\u00edaz's victory on the battlefield, Lerdo fled from office, going into exile.<ref>Sullivan, Paul. \"Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''.

D\u00edaz knew the potential for army rebellions, and systematically downsized the expenditure for the force, rather expanding the [[rurales|rural police force]] under direct control of the president. The government encouraged British and U.S. investment. Commercial agriculture developed in northern Mexico, with many investors from the U.S. acquiring vast ranching estates and expanding irrigated cultivation of crops. The Mexican government ordered a survey of land with the aim of selling it for development.  In this period, many indigenous communities lost their lands and the men became landless wage earners on large landed enterprises (''[[hacienda]]s'').<ref>Hart, John Mason. ''Empire and Revolution: The Americans in Mexico since the Civil War''. Berkeley: University of California Press Du 2002</ref> British and U.S. investors developed extractive mining of copper, lead, and other minerals, as well as petroleum on the Gulf Coast. Changes in Mexican law allowed for private enterprises to own the subsoil rights of land, rather than continuing the colonial law that gave all subsoil rights to the State.  An industrial manufacturing sector also developed, particularly in textiles.  At the same time, new enterprises gave rise to an industrial work force, which began organizing to gain labor rights and protections.\n\nD\u00edaz ruled with a group of advisors that became known as the ''[[cient\u00edfico]]s'' (\"scientists\").<ref>Buchenau, J\u00fcrgen. \"Cient\u00edficos\".

As an integral aspect of the liberal project was secular education.\n\nD\u00edaz's long success did not include planning for a political transition beyond his own presidency. He made no attempt, however, to establish a family dynasty, naming no relative as his successor.  As the centennial of independence approached, D\u00edaz gave an [[James Creelman|interview]] where he said he was not going to run in the 1910 elections, when he would be 80. Political opposition had been suppressed and there were few avenues for a new generation of leaders. But his announcement set off a frenzy of political activity, including the unlikely candidacy of the scion of a rich landowning family, [[Francisco I. Madero]]. Madero won a surprising amount of political support when D\u00edaz changed his mind an ran in the election, jailing Madero. The September centennial celebration of independence was the last celebration of the Porfiriato.

In [[Ten Tragic Days|February 1913]], a military coup d'\u00e9tat overthrew Madero's government, with the support of the U.S., resulted in Madero's murder by agents of [[Federal Army]] General [[Victoriano Huerta]]. A coalition of anti-Huerta forces in the North, the [[Constitutionalist Army]] overseen by [[Venustiano Carranza]], and a peasant army in the South under [[Emiliano Zapata]], defeated the Federal Army. In 1914 that army was dissolved as an institution. Following the revolutionaries' victory against Huerta, revolutionary armies sought to broker a peaceful political solution, but the coalition splintered, plunging Mexico into civil war again. Constitutionalist general [[Pancho Villa]], commander of the Division of the North, broke with Carranza and allied with Zapata. Carranza's best general, [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], defeated Villa, his former comrade-in-arms in the [[battle of Celaya]] in 1915, and Villa's forces melted away. Carranza became the de facto head of Mexico, and the U.S. recognized his government.

President Carranza's best general, Obreg\u00f3n, served briefly in Carranza's administration, but returned to his home state of Sonora to position himself to run in the 1920 presidential election. Carranza chose a political and revolutionary no-body to succeed him.  Obreg\u00f3n and two other Sonoran revolutionary generals drew up the [[Plan of Agua Prieta]], overthrowing Carranza, who died fleeing Mexico City in 1920.

In consolidating power, victorious eorthern revolutionary generals systematically worked to tame the military and bring it under civilian n control. [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] (1920\u201324); [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] (1924-28; and behind the scenes power until 1935); [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] (1934\u201340); and [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] (1940\u201346) succeeded in that endeavor, such that the modern Mexican military is under civilian rule and since 1946 no member of the military has been president of Mexico. The post-revolutionary project of the Mexican government sought to bring order to the country, end military intervention in politics, and create organizations of interest groups. Workers, peasants, urban office workers, and even the army for a short period were incorporated as sectors of the single party that dominated Mexican politics from its founding in 1929. Obreg\u00f3n instigated land reform and strengthened the power of organized labor. He gained recognition from the United States and took steps to [[American-Mexican Claims Commission|settle claims]] with companies and individuals that lost property during the Revolution. He imposed his fellow former Sonoran revolutionary general, Calles, as his successor, prompting an unsuccessful military revolt. As president Calles provoked a [[Cristero War|major conflict]] with the [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Catholic Church]] and Catholic guerrilla armies when he strictly enforced anticlerical articles of the 1917 Constitution. The Church-State conflict was mediated and ended with the aid of the [[Dwight W. Morrow|U.S. Ambassador to Mexico]]. Although the constitution prohibited reelection of the president, Obreg\u00f3n wished to run again and the constitution was amended to allow non-consecutive re-election.  Obreg\u00f3n won the 1928 elections, but was assassinated by a Catholic zealot, causing a political crisis of succession. Calles could not become president again, since he has just ended his term.  He sought to set up a structure to manage presidential succession, founding the party that was to dominate Mexico until the late twentieth century. Calles declared that the Revolution had moved from ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'' (rule by strongmen) to the ''era institucional'' (institutional era).<ref>{{cite web|website=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Historicos de las Revoluciones de Mexico |url=https://inehrm.gob.mx/es/inehrm/Articulo_85_aniversario_de_la_Fundacion_del_Partido_Nacional_Revolucionario_PNR|title=85\u00ba ANIVERSARIO DE LA FUNDACI\u00d3N DEL PARTIDO NACIONAL REVOLUCIONARIO (PNR)|accessdate=July 18, 2019|language=Spanish|trans-title=85th anniversary of the founding of the National Revolutionary Party (PRN)|author=Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez \u00c1ngeles}}</ref> Despite not holding the presidency, Calles remained the key political figure during the period known as the [[Maximato]] (1929-1934). The Maximato ended during the presidency of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], who expelled Calles from the country and implemented many economic and social reforms. This included the [[Mexican oil expropriation]] in March 1938, which nationalized the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[Netherlands|Dutch]] oil company known as the [[Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company]]. This movement would result in the creation of the state-owned Mexican oil company [[Pemex]]. This sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by C\u00e1rdenas's radical measure, but since then the company has played an important role in the economic development of Mexico. C\u00e1rdenas's successor, [[Manuel Avila Camacho|Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]] (1940-1946) was more moderate, and relations between the U.S. and Mexico vastly improved during [[World War II]], when Mexico was a significant ally, providing manpower and materiel to aid the war effort.\n\nFrom 1946 the election of [[Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s|Miguel Alem\u00e1n]], the first civilian president in the post-revolutionary period, Mexico embarked on an aggressive program of economic development, known as the [[Mexican miracle]], which was characterized by industrialization, urbanization, and the increase of inequality in Mexico between urban and rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mexican Miracle: 1940\u20131968|work=World History from 1500|publisher=Emayzine|url=http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/mex9.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403000322/http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/mex9.html|archivedate=April 3, 2007|accessdate=September 30, 2007}}</ref>  With robust economic growth, Mexico sought to showcase it to the world by hosting the [[1968 Summer Olympics]].

Economic problems worsened in his early term, then massive reserves of petroleum were located off Mexico's Gulf Coast. Pemex did not have the capacity to develop these reserves itself, and brought in foreign firms.  Oil prices had been high because of [[OPEC]]'s lock on oil production, and L\u00f3pez Portilla borrowed money from foreign banks for current spending to fund social programs.  Those foreign banks were happy to lend to Mexico because the oil reserves were enormous and future revenues were collateral for loans denominated in U.S. dollars.  When the [[1980s oil glut|price of oil]] dropped, Mexico's economy collapsed in the [[Latin American debt crisis|1982 Crisis]]. Interest rates soared, the peso devalued, and unable to pay loans, the government defaulted on its [[debt]]. [[Miguel de la Madrid|President Miguel de la Madrid]] (1982\u201388) resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation.\n\nIn the 1980s the first cracks emerged in the PRI's complete political dominance.

In order to do that, the Constitution of 1917 was amended in several important ways. Article 27, which allowed the government to expropriate natural resources and distribute land, was amended to end agrarian reform and to guarantee private owners' property rights.  The anti-clerical articles that muzzled religious institutions, especially the Catholic Church, were amended. Signing on to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) removed Mexico's autonomy over trade policy. The agreement came into effect on 1 January 1994; the same day, the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) started a two-week-long armed rebellion against the federal government, and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against [[neoliberalism]] and [[globalization]].\n\nIn 1994, following the assassination of the PRI's presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], Salinas was succeeded by substitute PRI candidate [[Ernesto Zedillo]].

This trend continued during the first two decades of the 20th century, and even in the 1921 census there was a loss of about 1 million inhabitants. The phenomenon can be explained because during the decade from 1910 to 1921 the Mexican Revolution took place.\n[[File:Mexicopop.svg|thumb|Population pyramid, 2017]]\nThe growth rate increased dramatically between the 1930s and the 1980s, when the country registered growth rates of over 3% (1950\u20131980). The Mexican population doubled in twenty years, and at that rate it was expected that by the year 2000 there would be 120 million Mexicans.

Catholic priest and insurgent for independence, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]], called for Roman Catholicism to be the exclusive faith in Mexico. A provision of the [[Plan of Iguala]] of [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] bringing about Mexican independence in 1821, also included Catholic exclusivity in the religious sphere. The [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]] declared that the official religion of the Republic would be Catholic. [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberals]] took power in the mid-nineteenth-century, determined to curtail the power of the Roman Catholic Church, and embedded anticlericalism in the [[Constitution of 1857]], touching off the civil war, the [[War of the Reform]] (1858\u201361), largely over religion. Conservatives were defeated on the battlefield and then sought a foreign ally for their cause of religion, aligning with the French, who placed Maximilian Hapsburg as monarch in the [[Second Mexican Empire]] (1862\u201367).  The Mexican republic defeated the Conservatives and executed Maximilian and two prominent Mexican generals, definitively ending the Conservative attempt to reassert the power of the Catholic Church. Liberal general and President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] (r. 1876\u201380; 1880-1911) did not provoke the Catholic Church, coming to a modus vivendi with it; but he did not remove the anticlerical articles from the 1857 Constitution. From the late nineteenth century [[Porfiriato]], Protestants began to make inroads in Mexico.  The [[Mexican Revolution]] had a large number of Protestants participating in northern Mexico. The [[Constitution of 1917]] strengthened the anticlerical provisions that were carried over from the 1857 Constitution.\n\nThe late 1920s was marked by a religious conflict known as the [[Cristero War]] (1926\u201329), when former revolutionary general, President [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] (1924\u201328), began stringently enforcing the anticlerical provisions of the [[Constitution of 1917]], it provoked a massive uprising in many parts of Mexico and resistance by the Roman Catholic Church. The war ended with an agreement between the parties in conflict ([[Catholic Church]] and State), by means of which the respective fields of action were defined. When President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] sought Mexico's inclusion in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], the constitution was changed in 1992 to eliminate the anticlerical articles long opposed by the Catholic Church and other religious institutions; the anticlerical articles were considered a violation of freedom of religion.<ref>Vargas, Jorge A., \"Freedom of Religion and Public Worship in Mexico: A Legal Commentary on the 1992 Federal Act on Religious Matters.\" ''BYU Law Review'' Vol. 1998, issue 2, article 6, p. 433.</ref><ref>Vargas, Jorge A., \"Mexico's Legal Revolution: An Appraisal of Its Recent Constitutional Changes, 1988\u20131995.\" 25 Georgia Journal of International and Comparative Law, 497-559 (1996).</ref> Mexico reestablished of diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See]], to which the Mexican State did not recognize as a political entity.\n\n[[File:Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Zapopan (Zapopan, Jalisco) - exterior and plaza.jpg|alt=Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan|thumb|[[Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan]] in Zapopan, Jalisco]]\nAccording to the figures of [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|INEGI]], most Mexicans declare themselves [[Christianity|Christian]] and most [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (almost 93 million adherents according to the census of 2010).<ref name=\"2010-census\" />\nThe second Christian group is the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], which totals more than 1&nbsp;million adherents, making the Mexican congregation of this Christian branch the second worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Thirdly find [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], whose members are known as [[Latter Day Saint movement|Mormons]], 2010 census reported 314,932 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,<ref name=\"2010-census\"/> though the church in 2009 claimed to have over one million registered members;<ref name=\"lds-Mexico\">{{cite web|title=Mexico, Country profile|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Days Saints Newsroom|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/mexico|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825063153/http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/mexico|archivedate=August 25, 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=March 4, 2011}}</ref> followed by [[La Luz del Mundo|Church of the La Luz del Mundo]], which has its center in \"[[La Hermosa Provincia]]\", a colony of [[Guadalajara]]. The denominations [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] also have an important presence, especially in the cities of the border and in the indigenous communities. In fact, Pentecostal churches together have more than 1.3 million adherents, which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico. The situation changes when the different Pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities. Other groups are growing, such as [[Iglesia apost\u00f3lica de la Fe en Cristo Jes\u00fas]], [[Mennonites in Mexico|Mennonites]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. Migratory phenomena have led to the spread of different aspects of Christianity, including branches [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nAccording to [[Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum]] (in texts edited by the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]), it is remarkable the survival of magic-religious rituals of the old [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups, not only in the current indigenous people but in the [[mestizo]]s and [[white people|whites]] that make up the Mexican rural and urban society. There is often a [[syncretism]] between [[shamanism]] and the Catholic tradition. Another religion of popular syncretism in Mexico (especially in recent years) is the [[Santer\u00eda]]. This is mainly due to the large number of Cubans who settled in the territory after the [[Cuban Revolution]] (mainly in states such as [[Veracruz]] and [[Yucat\u00e1n]]). Although Mexico was also a recipient of black slaves from [[Africa]] in the 16th century, the apogee of these cults is relatively new.<ref>{{Book cite| author = Jacobo Grinberg Zylberbaum | title = Los chamanes de M\u00e9xico | date = 1989 | publisher = UNAM School of Psychology | location = Mexico City | isbn = 9686022015 | edition = University of Texas | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1QVZAAAAMAAJ&q=chamanes+en+M%C3%A9xico&dq=chamanes+en+M%C3%A9xico&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMI_pTF3KvhxgIVAxSSCh3zuQx}}</ref>\n\nIn certain regions, the profession of a creed other than the Catholic is seen as a threat to community unity. It is argued that the Catholic religion is part of the ethnic identity, and that the Protestants are not willing to participate in the traditional customs and practices (the [[tequio]] or community work, participation in the festivities and similar issues). The refusal of the Protestants is because their religious beliefs do not allow them to participate in the cult of images. In extreme cases, tension between Catholics and Protestants has led to the expulsion or even murder of Protestants in several villages. The best known cases are those of [[San Juan Chamula]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/11/11/042n3est.php|title=En Chamula, cambiar religi\u00f3n se considera delito|date=June 16, 2009|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616041417/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/11/11/042n3est.php|archivedate=June 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2000/06/03/pol4.html|title=pol4|website=www.jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> in Chiapas, and San Nicol\u00e1s, in [[Ixmiquilpan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/07/22/mas-hilo.html|title=mas-hilo|website=www.jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].\n\n[[File:The Kid - Diego Rivera.jpg|thumb|Detail of the 1947 Rivera mural,  ''[[Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Central]]''. The mural includes a depiction of [[La Calavera Catrina|La Catrina]], a popular satirical character that has become associated with [[D\u00eda de Muertos]].]]\nA similar argument was presented by a committee of anthropologists to request the government of the Republic to expel the [[SIL International|Summer Linguistic Institute]] (SIL), in the year 1979, which was accused of promoting the division of indigenous peoples by translating the [[Bible]] into vernacular languages and evangelizing in a Protestant creed that threatened the integrity of popular cultures. The Mexican government paid attention to the call of the anthropologists and canceled the agreement that had held with the SIL. Conflicts have also occurred in other areas of social life. For example, given that Jehovah's Witnesses are prohibited from surrendering honors to national symbols (something that is done every Monday in Mexican public schools), children who have been educated in that religion were expelled from public schools. This type of problem can only be solved with the intervention of the National Commission of [[Human Rights]], and not always with favorable results for children.\n\nThe impact of the Catholic religion in Mexico has also caused a fusion of elements. Beyond churches and religious denominations, a phenomenon persists in Mexico that some anthropologists and sociologists call \"popular religion\", that is, religion as the practice and understanding of the people. In Mexico, the main component is the Catholic religion, to which elements of other beliefs have been added, already of pre-Hispanic, African or Asian origin. In general, popular religiosity is viewed with bad eyes by institutionally structured religions. One of the most exemplary cases of popular religiosity is the cult of [[Santa Muerte|Holy Dead]] (Santa Muerte). The Catholic hierarchy insists on describing it as a satanic cult. However, most of the people who profess this cult declare themselves to be Catholic believers, and consider that there is no contradiction between the tributes they offer to the [[Christ Child]] and the adoration of God. Other examples are the representations of the [[Stations of the Cross|Passion of Christ]] and the celebration of [[Day of the Dead]], which take place within the framework of the Catholic Christian imaginary, but under a very particular reinterpretation of its protagonists.\n\nThe presence of [[History of the Jews in Mexico|Jews in Mexico]] dates back to 1521, when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s conquered the Aztecs, accompanied by several [[Converso]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Primack|first=Karen|title=Jews in places you never thought of|year=1998|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|page=305|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GhD0JZAOTHUC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=jews+came+to+mexico+in+1521#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-0-88125-608-6}}</ref>  According to the 2010 census, there are 67,476 Jews in Mexico.<ref name=\"2010-census\"/> [[Islam in Mexico]] is practiced mostly by [[Arab Mexican]]s.

Exogenous cultural elements have been incorporated into Mexican culture as time has passed.\n\nThe Porfirian era (''el [[Porfirio D\u00edaz|Porfiriato]]''), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President D\u00edaz himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the [[Mexican Revolution]], cultural identity has had its foundation in the ''mestizaje'', of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] in ''La Raza C\u00f3smica'' (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the ''mestizo'') not only biologically but culturally as well.<ref name=\"vasconcelos160\">{{Cite book|last=Vasconcelos|first=Jos\u00e9|others=Didier T.

Cave painting in Mexican territory is about 7500 years old and has been found in the caves of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. Pre-Hispanic Mexico is present in buildings and caves, in [[Aztec codices]], in [[ceramics]], in garments, etc. .; examples of this are the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] mural paintings of [[Bonampak]], or those of [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], those of [[Cacaxtla]] and those of [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]].\n\nMural painting with religious themes had an important flowering during the 16th century; the same in religious constructions as in houses of lineage; such is the case of the convents of [[Acolman]], [[Actopan, Hidalgo|Actopan]], [[Huejotzingo]], [[Tecamachalco, Puebla|Tecamachalco]] and [[Zinacantepec]]. These were also manifested in illustrated manuscripts such as the 1576 [[Florentine codex]] overseen by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]].  Most art in the colonial era was religious, but starting in the late seventeenth century and most prominently in the eighteenth century, secular portraits and [[casta|casta painting]] appeared. Important painters of the late colonial period were [[Juan Correa]], [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando]] and [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]].\n\nNineteenth-century painting had a marked romantic influence; landscapes and portraits were the greatest expressions of this era. [[Hermenegildo Bustos]] is one of the most appreciated painters of the [[historiography]] of Mexican art. Other painters include [[:es:Santiago Rebull|Santiago Rebull]], [[F\u00e9lix Parra]], [[Eugenio Landesio]], and his noted pupil, the landscape artist [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco G\u00f3mez|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco]].<ref>Widdiefield, Stacie G.

The Oaxacan School quickly gained fame and prestige, diffusion of ancestral and modern culture. Freedom of design is observed in relation to the color and texture of the canvases and murals as a period of transition between the 20th century and the 21st century. [[Federico Cant\u00fa Garza]], [[Juan O'Gorman]], and [[Rufino Tamayo]] are also important artists. Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure of [[Mexican muralism]], painted the [[Man at the Crossroads]] at the [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed by the Rockefellers the next year because of the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockefeller Controversy|publisher=Diego Rivera Prints|url=http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|accessdate=October 2, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011103154/http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref> Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Palace of Fine Arts]].\n \nSome of the most outstanding painters in the late 20th century and early 21st century: [[Francisco Toledo]] was a Mexican Zapotec painter, sculptor, and graphic artist. In a career that spanned seven decades, Toledo produced thousands of works of art and became widely regarded as one of Mexico's most important contemporary artists. [[Ver\u00f3nica Ruiz de Velasco]] is a [[neofigurative]] painter and muralist.  Both [[Ver\u00f3nica Ruiz de Velasco]] and [[Francisco Toledo]] were students of [[Rufino Tamayo]]. [[Gilberto Aceves Navarro]] is also considered an important contemporary artist.\n\nThroughout history several prominent painters of different nationalities have expressed in their works the face of Mexico. Among the most outstanding we can mention are [[Claudio Linati]], [[Daniel Thomas Egerton]], [[Carl Nebel]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[Leonora Carrington]].\n<gallery>\nFile:The Florentine Codex- Aztec Feather Painters IV.tiff| Many [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]] were made both during Pre-Hispanic and colonial eras. 1576 [[Florentine Codex]] of [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]]\nFile:Castas 01mestiza max.jpg|From Spaniard and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] woman, [[Mestizo|Mestiza]]. [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], 1763\n</gallery>\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n{{Main|Sculpture in Mexico}}\nSculpture was an integral part of pre-Hispanic [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations, ([[Maya civilization|Mayans]], [[Olmec]]s, [[Toltec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Aztec]]s), and others, usually religious in nature. From the Spanish conquest in 1521, civil and religious sculpture was created by indigenous artists, with guidance from Spaniards, so some pre-Hispanic features are evident. Since the 17th century, white and [[mestizo]] sculptors have created works with a marked influence of European classicism. After independence in 1821, sculpture was influenced by Romanticism, which tended to break the strict norms and models of classicism, while it pursued ideas influenced by realism and nationalism. Religious sculpture was reduced to a sporadic imagery, while the secular sculpture continued in portraits and monumental art of a civic nature. Between 1820 and 1880 the predominant themes were, successively: religious images, biblical scenes, allegories to the symbols of the independence insurgency, scenes and personages of pre-Hispanic history, and busts of the old aristocracy, of the nascent bourgeoisie and commanders of the pre-revolution. During the 20th century, some important exponents of Mexican sculpture are [[Juan Soriano (artist)|Juan Soriano]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas]], and [[Sebasti\u00e1n (sculptor)|Enrique Carbajal]] (also known as Sebasti\u00e1n).\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Architecture of Mexico}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width = \n | footer = \n | image1 = SSA41434.JPG\n | caption1 =[[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], [[State of Mexico]]\n | image2 = Catedral zacatecas.jpg\n | caption2 = [[Cathedral Basilica of Zacatecas]]\n}}\n[[Image:Ext 06Museo Soumaya FREE Fernando Romero EnterprisE photo by Adam Wiseman.jpg||thumb|[[Museo Soumaya]] in Mexico City building]] \nThe presence of the humans in the Mexican territory has left important archaeological findings of great importance for the explanation of the habitat of primitive man and contemporary man. The Mesoamerican civilizations managed to have great stylistic development and proportion on the human and urban scale, the form was evolving from simplicity to aesthetic complexity; in the north of the country the adobe and stone architecture is manifested, the multifamily housing as we can see in [[Casas Grandes]]; and the troglodyte dwelling in caves of the Sierra Madre Occidental.  Urbanism had a great development in pre-Hispanic cultures, where we can see the magnitude of the cities of [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tollan-Xicocotitlan]] and [[Tenochtitlan|M\u00e9xico-Tenochtitlan]], within the environmentalist urbanism highlight the Mayan cities to be incorporated into the monumentality of its buildings with the thickness of the jungle and complex networks of roads called ''sakb\u00e9s''. [[Mesoamerican architecture]] is noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of Ancient Egypt.\n\n[[Spanish Colonial architecture]] is marked by the contrast between the simple, solid construction demanded by the new environment and the Baroque ornamentation exported from Spain. Mexico, as the center of New Spain has some of the most renowned buildings built in this style.\nWith the arrival of the Spaniards, architectural theories of the Greco-Roman order with Arab influences were introduced. Due to the process of [[Evangelization in New Spain|evangelization]], when the first monastic temples and monasteries were built, their own models were projected, such as the [[mendicant monasteries in Mexico|mendicant monasteries]], unique in their type in architecture. The interaction between Spaniards and natives gave rise to artistic styles such as the so-called ''[[tequitqui]]'' (from [[Nahuatl]]: worker). Years later the baroque and mannerism were imposed in large cathedrals and civil buildings, while rural areas are built [[hacienda]]s or stately farms with Mozarabic tendencies.\n\nIn the 19th century the neoclassical movement arose as a response to the objectives of the republican nation, one of its examples are the [[Hospicio Caba\u00f1as]] where the strict plastic of the classical orders are represented in their architectural elements, new religious buildings also arise, civilian and military that demonstrate the presence of neoclassicism. Romanticists from a past seen through archeology show images of medieval Europe, Islamic and pre-Hispanic Mexico in the form of architectural elements in the construction of international exhibition pavilions looking for an identity typical of the national culture. The ''art nouveau'', and the ''art deco'' were styles introduced into the design of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] to mark the identity of the Mexican nation with Greek-Roman and pre-Hispanic symbols.\n\nModern architecture in Mexico has an important development in the plasticity of form and space, [[Jos\u00e9 Villagr\u00e1n Garc\u00eda]] develops a theory of form that sets the pattern of teaching in many schools of architecture in the country within functionalism. The emergence of the new [[Mexican architecture]] was born as a formal order of the policies of a nationalist state that sought modernity and the differentiation of other nations. The development of a Mexican modernist architecture was perhaps mostly fully manifested in the mid-1950s construction of the [[Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City|Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City]], the main campus of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. Designed by the most prestigious architects of the era, including [[Mario Pani]], [[Eugenio Peschard]], and [[Enrique del Moral]], the buildings feature murals by artists [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez Morado]]. It has since been recognized as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/364 |title=UNESCO |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>\n\n[[Juan O'Gorman]] was one of the first environmental architects in Mexico, developing the \"organic\" theory, trying to integrate the building with the landscape within the same approaches of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqhys.com/arquitectura-mexicana.html|title=Arquitectura mexicana|website=www.arqhys.com}}</ref> In the search for a new architecture that does not resemble the styles of the past, it achieves a joint manifestation with the mural painting and the [[landscaping]].\n\nThe Jalisco School was a proposal of those socio-political movements that the country demanded. [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]] combined the shape of the space with forms of rural vernacular architecture of Mexico and Mediterranean countries (Spain-Morocco), integrating an impressive color that handles light and shade in different tones and opens a look at the international [[minimalism]]. He  won the 1980 [[Pritzker Prize]], the highest award in architecture.\n\nMexican architecture is a cultural phenomenon born of the ideology of nationalist governments of the 20th century, which was shaping the identity image by its colorful and variegated ornamental elements inherited from ancestral cultures, classical and monumental forms and, subsequently, the incorporation of modernism and cutting-edge international trends.\n\n===Photography===\n{{See|Mexican art#Photography in Mexico}}\n[[File:David Alfaro Siqueiros (El Coronelazo).jpg|thumb|[[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] by [[H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Cobo]] at [[Palacio de Lecumberri|Lecumberri prison]], Mexico City, 1960.]]\nMexico has been photographed since the nineteenth century, when the technology was first developed. During the Porfiriato, D\u00edaz realized the importance of photography in shaping the understanding of his regime and its accomplishments.  The government hired [[Guillermo Kahlo]] (father of painter [[Frida Kahlo]]) to create photographic images of Mexico's new industrial structures as well as its pre-Hispanic and colonial past.  Photographer [[Hugo Brehme]] specialized in images of \"picturesque\" Mexico, with images of Mexican places and often rural people.  During the Mexican Revolution, photographers chronicled the conflict, usually in the aftermath of a battle, since large and heavy equipment did not permit action shots.

Poetry had a rich cultural tradition in prehispanic Mexico, being divided into two broad categories\u2014secular and religious. Aztec poetry was sung, chanted, or spoken, often to the accompanyment of a drum or a harp.

The [[Kingdom of New Spain]] was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire. The two pillars of Spanish rule were the State and the Roman Catholic Church, both under the authority of the Spanish crown. In 1493 the pope had granted [[Patronato real|sweeping powers]] to the Spanish crown, with the proviso that the crown spread Christianity in its new realms. In 1524, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] created the [[Council of the Indies]] based in Spain to oversee State power its overseas territories; in New Spain the crown established a high court in Mexico City, the ''[[Real Audiencia]],'' and then in 1535 created the viceroyalty. The viceroy was highest official of the State. In the religious sphere, the diocese of Mexico was created in 1530 and elevated to the [[Archdiocese of Mexico]] in 1546, with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, overseeing Roman Catholic clergy. Castilian Spanish was the language of rulers. The Catholic faith the only one permitted, with non-Catholics (Jews and Protestants) and Catholics (excluding Indians) holding unorthodox views being subject to the [[Mexican Inquisition]], established in 1571.<ref>Chuchiak, John F. IV, \"Inquisition\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 704-708</ref>\n\nIn the first half-century of Spanish rule, a network of Spanish cities was created, sometimes on pre-Hispanic sites. The capital Mexico City was and remains the premier city. Cities and towns were hubs of civil officials, ecclesiastics, business, Spanish elites, and mixed-race and indigenous artisans and workers. When deposits of silver were discovered in sparsely populated northern Mexico, far from the dense populations of central Mexico, the Spanish secured the region against fiercely resistant indigenous [[Chichimeca War|Chichimecas]].  The Viceroyalty at its greatest extent included the territories of modern Mexico, Central America as far south as Costa Rica, and the western United States. The Viceregal capital Mexico City also administrated the [[Spanish West Indies]] (the [[Caribbean]]), the [[Spanish East Indies]] (that is, the [[Philippines]]), and [[Spanish Florida]]. In 1819, the Spain signed the [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty]] with the United States, setting New Spain's northern boundary.<ref>Salvucci, Linda. \"Adams-On\u00eds Treaty (1819)\".

Also known as the Revillagigedo census. Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as German scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Europeans ranged from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos from 21% to 25%, Indians from 51% to 61% and Africans were between 6,000 and 10,000. The total population ranged from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded that the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%\u201317% per century mostly due the later having higher mortality rates for living in remote locations and being in constant war with the colonists.<ref>[http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf \"Consideraciones sobre la poblaci\u00f3n de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a (1793\u20131810)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731104825/http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf |date=July 31, 2017 }}, ''El Colegio de Mexico'', Mexico, Retrieved on July 24, 2017.</ref> Independent-era Mexico eliminated the legal basis of the [[castas|Colonial caste system]] which led to exclusion of racial classification in the censuses to come.\n\nColonial [[Law in Spain|law with Spanish roots]] was introduced and attached to native customs creating a hierarchy between local jurisdiction (the [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildos]]) and the Spanish Crown. Upper administrative offices were closed to native-born people, even those of pure Spanish blood ([[Criollo people|criollos]]). Administration was based on the [[racial separation]]. Society was organized in a racial hierarchy, with whites on top, mixed-race persons and blacks in the middle, and indigenous at the bottom. There were formal legal designations of racial categories. The Republic of Spaniards (''Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles'') comprised European- and American-born Spaniards, mixed-race [[casta]]s, and black Africans. The Republic of Indians (''Rep\u00fablica de Indios'') comprised the indigenous populations, which the Spanish lumped under the term Indian (''indio''), a Spanish colonial social construct which indigenous groups and individuals rejected as a category. Spaniards were exempt from paying tribute, Spanish men had access to higher education, could hold civil and ecclesiastical offices, were subject to the [[Mexican Inquisition|Inquisition]], and liable for military service when the standing military was established in the late eighteenth century. Indigenous paid tribute, but were exempt from the Inquisition, indigenous men were excluded from the priesthood; and exempt from military service. Although the racial system appears fixed and rigid, there was some fluidity within it, and racial domination of whites was not complete.<ref name=\"Cope, R. Douglas 1994\">Cope, R. Douglas.

Spain attempted to [[Spanish attempts to reconquer Mexico|reconquer]] its former colony during the 1820s, but eventually recognized its independence.   France attempted to recoup losses it claimed for its citizens during Mexico's unrest and blockaded the Gulf Coast during the so-called [[Pastry War]] of 1838\u201339.<ref>Costeloe, Michael P. \"Pastry War\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 4, p. 318. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref> Santa Anna lost a leg in combat during this conflict, which he used for political purposes. Emerging as a national hero in defending Mexico was creole army general, [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], who had participated in the overthrow of the emperor, fought the Spanish invasion, and came to dominate the politics for the next 25 years, until his own overthrow in 1855.\n\nMexico also contended with indigenous groups which controlled territory that Mexico claimed in the north.  The [[Comanche Wars|Comanche]] controlled a [[Comancher\u00eda|huge territory]] in the sparsely populated region of central and northern Texas.<ref>Weber, David J., ''The Mexican Frontier, 1821\u20131846: The American Southwest under Mexico,'' University of New Mexico Press, 1982</ref> Wanting to stabilize and develop the frontier, the Mexican government encouraged Anglo-American immigration into present-day Texas. The region bordered the United States, and was territory controlled by [[Comanches]]. There were few settlers from central Mexico moving to this remote and hostile territory. Mexico by law was a Catholic country; the Anglo Americans were primarily Protestant English speakers from the southern United States. Some brought their black slaves, which after 1829 was contrary to Mexican law. Santa Anna sought to centralize government rule, suspending the constitution and promulgating the [[Siete Leyes|Seven Laws]], which place power in his hands. When he suspended the 1824 Constitution, civil war spread across the country. Three new governments declared independence: the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] and the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]].<ref name=\"miranda\"/>{{rp|129\u2013137}}\n\nThe largest blow to Mexico was the U.S. invasion of Mexico in 1846 in the [[Mexican American War]]. Mexico lost much of its sparsely populated northern territory, sealed in the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].  Despite that disastrous loss, Conservative Santa Anna returned to the presidency yet again and then was ousted and exiled in the Liberal [[Revolution of Ayutla]].\n\n===Liberal Reform, French Intervention, and Restored Republic (1855\u20131876)===\n{{Main|Second Mexican Republic|La Reforma|Second Mexican Empire}}\n[[File:Benito Ju\u00e1rez, siglo XIX, \u00f3leo sobre tela.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], leader of the [[La Reforma|Liberal Reform]]]]\n[[File:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|thumb|''[[The Execution of Emperor Maximilian]]'', 19 June 1867.

Painting by [[\u00c9douard Manet]] 1868.]]\nThe overthrow of Santa Anna and the establishment of a civilian government by Liberals allowed them to enact laws that they considered vital for Mexico's economic development. It was a prelude to more civil wars and yet another foreign invasion. The [[La Reforma|Liberal Reform]] attempted to modernize Mexico's economy and institutions along liberal principles.  They promulgated a new [[constitution|Constitution of 1857]], separating Church and State, stripping the Conservative institutions of the Church and the military of their special privileges (''[[fueros]]''); mandating the sale of Church-owned property and sale of indigenous community lands, and secularizing education.<ref>Britton, John A. \"Liberalism\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, 739</ref> Conservatives revolted, touching off [[War of the Reform|civil war]] between rival Liberal and Conservative governments (1858\u201361). Liberals defeated the Conservative army on the battlefield, but Conservatives sought another solution to gain power via foreign intervention by the French. Mexican conservatives asked Emperor [[Napoleon III]] to place a European monarch as head of state in Mexico. The French Army defeated the Mexican Army and placed Maximilian Hapsburg on the [[Second Mexican Empire|newly-established throne]] of Mexico, supported by Mexican Conservatives and propped up by the French Army. The Liberal republic under [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] was basically a government in internal exile, but with the end of the Civil War in the U.S. in April 1865, that government began aiding the Mexican Republic. Two years later, the French Army withdrew its support, Maximilian remained in Mexico rather than return to Europe. Republican forces captured him and he was executed in Quer\u00e9taro, along with two Conservative Mexican generals.  The \"Restored Republic\" saw the return of Ju\u00e1rez, who was \"the personification of the embattled republic,\"<ref>Hamnett, Brian. \"Benito Ju\u00e1rez\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 719-20</ref> as president.\n\nThe Conservatives had been not only defeated militarily, but also discredited politically for their collaboration with the French invaders. Liberalism became synonymous with patriotism.<ref>Britton, \"Liberalism\" p. 740.</ref>  The Mexican Army that had its roots in the colonial royal army and then the army of the early republic was destroyed. New military leaders had emerged from the War of the Reform and the conflict with the French, most notably [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]], a hero of the [[Battle of Puebla|Cinco de Mayo]], who now sought civilian power. Ju\u00e1rez won re-election in 1867, but was challenged by D\u00edaz, who criticized him for running for re-election. D\u00edaz then rebelled, crushed by Ju\u00e1rez.  Having won re-election, Ju\u00e1rez died in office of natural causes in July 1872, and Liberal [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada]] became president, declaring a \"religion of state\" for rule of law, peace, and order. When Lerdo ran for re-election, D\u00edaz rebelled against the civilian president, issuing the [[Plan of Tuxtepec]]. D\u00edaz had more support and waged guerrilla warfare against Lerdo.  On the verge of D\u00edaz's victory on the battlefield, Lerdo fled from office, going into exile.<ref>Sullivan, Paul. \"Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''.

D\u00edaz knew the potential for army rebellions, and systematically downsized the expenditure for the force, rather expanding the [[rurales|rural police force]] under direct control of the president. The government encouraged British and U.S. investment. Commercial agriculture developed in northern Mexico, with many investors from the U.S. acquiring vast ranching estates and expanding irrigated cultivation of crops. The Mexican government ordered a survey of land with the aim of selling it for development.  In this period, many indigenous communities lost their lands and the men became landless wage earners on large landed enterprises (''[[hacienda]]s'').<ref>Hart, John Mason. ''Empire and Revolution: The Americans in Mexico since the Civil War''. Berkeley: University of California Press Du 2002</ref> British and U.S. investors developed extractive mining of copper, lead, and other minerals, as well as petroleum on the Gulf Coast. Changes in Mexican law allowed for private enterprises to own the subsoil rights of land, rather than continuing the colonial law that gave all subsoil rights to the State.  An industrial manufacturing sector also developed, particularly in textiles.  At the same time, new enterprises gave rise to an industrial work force, which began organizing to gain labor rights and protections.\n\nD\u00edaz ruled with a group of advisors that became known as the ''[[cient\u00edfico]]s'' (\"scientists\").<ref>Buchenau, J\u00fcrgen. \"Cient\u00edficos\".

As an integral aspect of the liberal project was secular education.\n\nD\u00edaz's long success did not include planning for a political transition beyond his own presidency. He made no attempt, however, to establish a family dynasty, naming no relative as his successor.  As the centennial of independence approached, D\u00edaz gave an [[James Creelman|interview]] where he said he was not going to run in the 1910 elections, when he would be 80. Political opposition had been suppressed and there were few avenues for a new generation of leaders. But his announcement set off a frenzy of political activity, including the unlikely candidacy of the scion of a rich landowning family, [[Francisco I. Madero]]. Madero won a surprising amount of political support when D\u00edaz changed his mind an ran in the election, jailing Madero. The September centennial celebration of independence was the last celebration of the Porfiriato.

Madero]] in 1911. In [[Ten Tragic Days|February 1913]], a military coup d'\u00e9tat overthrew Madero's government, with the support of the U.S., resulted in Madero's murder by agents of [[Federal Army]] General [[Victoriano Huerta]]. A coalition of anti-Huerta forces in the North, the [[Constitutionalist Army]] overseen by [[Venustiano Carranza]], and a peasant army in the South under [[Emiliano Zapata]], defeated the Federal Army. In 1914 that army was dissolved as an institution. Following the revolutionaries' victory against Huerta, revolutionary armies sought to broker a peaceful political solution, but the coalition splintered, plunging Mexico into civil war again. Constitutionalist general [[Pancho Villa]], commander of the Division of the North, broke with Carranza and allied with Zapata. Carranza's best general, [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], defeated Villa, his former comrade-in-arms in the [[battle of Celaya]] in 1915, and Villa's forces melted away. Carranza became the de facto head of Mexico, and the U.S. recognized his government. In 1916, the winners met at a constitutional convention to draft the [[Constitution of 1917]], which was ratified in February 1917.<ref>Matute, Alvaro. \"Mexican Revolution: May 1917 \u2013 December 1920\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''.

In consolidating power, victorious eorthern revolutionary generals systematically worked to tame the military and bring it under civilian n control. [[Alvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] (1920\u201324); [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] (1924-28; and behind the scenes power until 1935); [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] (1934\u201340); and [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] (1940\u201346) succeeded in that endeavor, such that the modern Mexican military is under civilian rule and since 1946 no member of the military has been president of Mexico. The post-revolutionary project of the Mexican government sought to bring order to the country, end military intervention in politics, and create organizations of interest groups. Workers, peasants, urban office workers, and even the army for a short period were incorporated as sectors of the single party that dominated Mexican politics from its founding in 1929. Obreg\u00f3n instigated land reform and strengthened the power of organized labor. He gained recognition from the United States and took steps to [[American-Mexican Claims Commission|settle claims]] with companies and individuals that lost property during the Revolution. He imposed his fellow former Sonoran revolutionary general, Calles, as his successor, prompting an unsuccessful military revolt. As president Calles provoked a [[Cristero War|major conflict]] with the [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Catholic Church]] and Catholic guerrilla armies when he strictly enforced anticlerical articles of the 1917 Constitution. The Church-State conflict was mediated and ended with the aid of the [[Dwight W. Morrow|U.S. Ambassador to Mexico]]. Although the constitution prohibited reelection of the president, Obreg\u00f3n wished to run again and the constitution was amended to allow non-consecutive re-election.  Obreg\u00f3n won the 1928 elections, but was assassinated by a Catholic zealot, causing a political crisis of succession. Calles could not become president again, since he has just ended his term.  He sought to set up a structure to manage presidential succession, founding the party that was to dominate Mexico until the late twentieth century. Calles declared that the Revolution had moved from ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'' (rule by strongmen) to the ''era institucional'' (institutional era).<ref>{{cite web|website=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Historicos de las Revoluciones de Mexico |url=https://inehrm.gob.mx/es/inehrm/Articulo_85_aniversario_de_la_Fundacion_del_Partido_Nacional_Revolucionario_PNR|title=85\u00ba ANIVERSARIO DE LA FUNDACI\u00d3N DEL PARTIDO NACIONAL REVOLUCIONARIO (PNR)|accessdate=July 18, 2019|language=Spanish|trans-title=85th anniversary of the founding of the National Revolutionary Party (PRN)|author=Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez \u00c1ngeles}}</ref> Despite not holding the presidency, Calles remained the key political figure during the period known as the [[Maximato]] (1929-1934). The Maximato ended during the presidency of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], who expelled Calles from the country and implemented many economic and social reforms. This included the [[Mexican oil expropriation]] in March 1938, which nationalized the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[Netherlands|Dutch]] oil company known as the [[Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company]]. This movement would result in the creation of the state-owned Mexican oil company [[Pemex]]. This sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by C\u00e1rdenas's radical measure, but since then the company has played an important role in the economic development of Mexico. C\u00e1rdenas's successor, [[Manuel Avila Camacho|Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]] (1940-1946) was more moderate, and relations between the U.S. and Mexico vastly improved during [[World War II]], when Mexico was a significant ally, providing manpower and materiel to aid the war effort.\n\nFrom 1946 the election of [[Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s|Miguel Alem\u00e1n]], the first civilian president in the post-revolutionary period, Mexico embarked on an aggressive program of economic development, known as the [[Mexican miracle]], which was characterized by industrialization, urbanization, and the increase of inequality in Mexico between urban and rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mexican Miracle: 1940\u20131968|work=World History from 1500|publisher=Emayzine|url=http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/mex9.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403000322/http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/mex9.html|archivedate=April 3, 2007|accessdate=September 30, 2007}}</ref>  With robust economic growth, Mexico sought to showcase it to the world by hosting the [[1968 Summer Olympics]].

Economic problems worsened in his early term, then massive reserves of petroleum were located off Mexico's Gulf Coast. Pemex did not have the capacity to develop these reserves itself, and brought in foreign firms.  Oil prices had been high because of [[OPEC]]'s lock on oil production, and L\u00f3pez Portilla borrowed money from foreign banks for current spending to fund social programs.  Those foreign banks were happy to lend to Mexico because the oil reserves were enormous and future revenues were collateral for loans denominated in U.S. dollars.  When the [[1980s oil glut|price of oil]] dropped, Mexico's economy collapsed in the [[Latin American debt crisis|1982 Crisis]]. Interest rates soared, the peso devalued, and unable to pay loans, the government defaulted on its [[debt]]. [[Miguel de la Madrid|President Miguel de la Madrid]] (1982\u201388) resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation.\n\nIn the 1980s the first cracks emerged in the PRI's complete political dominance. In [[Baja California]], the [[Ernesto Ruffo Appel|PAN candidate]] was elected as governor. When De la Madrid chose [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] as the candidate for the PRI, and therefore a foregone presidential victor, [[Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas]], son of former President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], broke with the PRI and challenged Salinas in the 1988 elections. In 1988 there was massive [[electoral fraud]], with results showing that Salinas had won the election by the narrowest percentage ever.  There were massive protests in Mexico City to the stolen election.

In order to do that, the Constitution of 1917 was amended in several important ways. Article 27, which allowed the government to expropriate natural resources and distribute land, was amended to end agrarian reform and to guarantee private owners' property rights.  The anti-clerical articles that muzzled religious institutions, especially the Catholic Church, were amended. Signing on to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) removed Mexico's autonomy over trade policy. The agreement came into effect on 1 January 1994; the same day, the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) started a two-week-long armed rebellion against the federal government, and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against [[neoliberalism]] and [[globalization]].\n\nIn 1994, following the assassination of the PRI's presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], Salinas was succeeded by substitute PRI candidate [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. Salinas left Zedillo's government to deal with the [[Mexican peso crisis]], requiring a $50 billion [[IMF]] bailout.

Both Mexican coasts, except for the south coast of the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja, are also vulnerable to serious [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] during the summer and fall. Although low-lying areas north of the 24th parallel are hot and humid during the summer, they generally have lower yearly temperature averages (from {{convert|20|to|24|C|F|1|disp=or}}) because of more moderate conditions during the winter.\n\nMany large cities in Mexico are located in the Valley of Mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. This gives them a year-round temperate climate with yearly temperature averages (from {{convert|16|to|18|C|F|1|disp=or}}) and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year.\n\nMany parts of Mexico, particularly the north, have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of annual precipitation.

To the south of Cancun is the coastal strip called [[Riviera Maya]] which includes the beach town of [[Playa del Carmen]] and the ecological parks of [[Xcaret]] and Xel-H\u00e1. A day trip to the south of Canc\u00fan is the historic port of [[Tulum]]. In addition to its beaches, the town of Tulum is notable for its cliff-side [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins.\n\nOn the [[Pacific]] coast is the notable tourist destination of [[Acapulco]]. Once the destination for the rich and famous, the beaches have become crowded and the shores are now home to many multi-story hotels and vendors. Acapulco is home to renowned cliff divers: trained divers who leap from the side of a vertical cliff into the surf below.\n\nAt the southern tip of the [[Baja California peninsula]] is the resort town of [[Cabo San Lucas]], a town noted for its beaches and [[marlin]] [[fishing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icabo.com/what-to-do/cabo-fishing.aspx |title=Cabo Fishing Information \u2013 Sport Fishing in Los Cabos |publisher=icabo.com |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502144017/http://icabo.com/what-to-do/cabo-fishing.aspx |archivedate=May 2, 2013}}</ref> Further north along the [[Sea of Cort\u00e9s]] is the [[Bah\u00eda Concepci\u00f3n, Baja California Sur|Bah\u00eda de La Concepci\u00f3n]], another beach town known for its sports fishing.

Additionally, a strong nationwide increase in access to [[improved sanitation]] (64% to 85%) was observed in the same period. Other achievements include the existence of a functioning national system to finance water and sanitation infrastructure with a National Water Commission as its apex institution; and the existence of a few well-performing utilities such as Aguas y Drenaje de Monterrey.\n\nThe challenges include water scarcity in the northern and central parts of the country; inadequate water service quality (drinking water quality; 11% of Mexicans receiving water only intermittently as of 2014);<ref>[http://www.milenio.com/estados/acceso-agua-potable-millones-mexicanos_0_235776434.html \"Sin acceso a agua potable 22 millones de Mexicanos Grupo Milenio\"], ''Grupo Milenio'', Retrieved on August 28, 2017.</ref> poor technical and commercial efficiency of most utilities (with an average level of [[non-revenue water]] of 43.2% in 2010);<ref>[https://agua.org.mx/en-mexico-se-desperdicia-el-432-de-agua/ \"En M\u00e9xico se desperdic\u00eda el 43.2% de agua\"], Retrieved on August 28, 2017.</ref> an insufficient share of wastewater receiving treatment (36% in 2006); and still inadequate access in rural areas.

This trend continued during the first two decades of the 20th century, and even in the 1921 census there was a loss of about 1 million inhabitants. The phenomenon can be explained because during the decade from 1910 to 1921 the Mexican Revolution took place.\n[[File:Mexicopop.svg|thumb|Population pyramid, 2017]]\nThe growth rate increased dramatically between the 1930s and the 1980s, when the country registered growth rates of over 3% (1950\u20131980). The Mexican population doubled in twenty years, and at that rate it was expected that by the year 2000 there would be 120 million Mexicans. Life expectancy went from 36 years (in 1895) to 72 years (in the year 2000).\n\nAccording to estimations made by Mexico's [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda|National Geography and Statistics Institute]], as of 2017 Mexico has 123.5 million inhabitants<ref>[http://eleconomista.com.mx/sociedad/2017/07/10/mexico-cuenta-1235-millones-habitantes \"Mexico cuenta con 123.5 millones de habitantes\"], Retrieved on July 26, 2017.</ref> making it the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world.<ref name=Spanishhistory>{{cite web|title=Spanish Language History|publisher=Today Translations|url=http://www.todaytranslations.com/index.asp-Q-Page-E-Spanish-Language-History--13053095|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050417234656/http://www.todaytranslations.com/index.asp-Q-Page-E-Spanish-Language-History--13053095|archivedate=April 17, 2005|accessdate=October 1, 2007}}</ref> Between 2005 and 2010, the Mexican population grew at an average of 1.70% per year, up from 1.16% per year between 2000 and 2005.\n\nEven though Mexico is a very ethnically diverse country, research about ethnicity has largely been a forgotten field, in consequence of the post-revolutionary efforts of Mexico's government to unify all non-indigenous Mexicans under a single ethnic identity (that of the \"Mestizo\").

Catholic priest and insurgent for independence, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]], called for Roman Catholicism to be the exclusive faith in Mexico. A provision of the [[Plan of Iguala]] of [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] bringing about Mexican independence in 1821, also included Catholic exclusivity in the religious sphere. The [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]] declared that the official religion of the Republic would be Catholic. [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberals]] took power in the mid-nineteenth-century, determined to curtail the power of the Roman Catholic Church, and embedded anticlericalism in the [[Constitution of 1857]], touching off the civil war, the [[War of the Reform]] (1858\u201361), largely over religion. Conservatives were defeated on the battlefield and then sought a foreign ally for their cause of religion, aligning with the French, who placed Maximilian Hapsburg as monarch in the [[Second Mexican Empire]] (1862\u201367).  The Mexican republic defeated the Conservatives and executed Maximilian and two prominent Mexican generals, definitively ending the Conservative attempt to reassert the power of the Catholic Church. Liberal general and President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] (r. 1876\u201380; 1880-1911) did not provoke the Catholic Church, coming to a modus vivendi with it; but he did not remove the anticlerical articles from the 1857 Constitution. From the late nineteenth century [[Porfiriato]], Protestants began to make inroads in Mexico.  The [[Mexican Revolution]] had a large number of Protestants participating in northern Mexico. The [[Constitution of 1917]] strengthened the anticlerical provisions that were carried over from the 1857 Constitution.\n\nThe late 1920s was marked by a religious conflict known as the [[Cristero War]] (1926\u201329), when former revolutionary general, President [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] (1924\u201328), began stringently enforcing the anticlerical provisions of the [[Constitution of 1917]], it provoked a massive uprising in many parts of Mexico and resistance by the Roman Catholic Church. The war ended with an agreement between the parties in conflict ([[Catholic Church]] and State), by means of which the respective fields of action were defined. When President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] sought Mexico's inclusion in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], the constitution was changed in 1992 to eliminate the anticlerical articles long opposed by the Catholic Church and other religious institutions; the anticlerical articles were considered a violation of freedom of religion.<ref>Vargas, Jorge A., \"Freedom of Religion and Public Worship in Mexico: A Legal Commentary on the 1992 Federal Act on Religious Matters.\" ''BYU Law Review'' Vol. 1998, issue 2, article 6, p. 433.</ref><ref>Vargas, Jorge A., \"Mexico's Legal Revolution: An Appraisal of Its Recent Constitutional Changes, 1988\u20131995.\" 25 Georgia Journal of International and Comparative Law, 497-559 (1996).</ref> Mexico reestablished of diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See]], to which the Mexican State did not recognize as a political entity.\n\n[[File:Bas\u00edlica de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Zapopan (Zapopan, Jalisco) - exterior and plaza.jpg|alt=Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan|thumb|[[Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan]] in Zapopan, Jalisco]]\nAccording to the figures of [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|INEGI]], most Mexicans declare themselves [[Christianity|Christian]] and most [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (almost 93 million adherents according to the census of 2010).<ref name=\"2010-census\" />\nThe second Christian group is the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], which totals more than 1&nbsp;million adherents, making the Mexican congregation of this Christian branch the second worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Thirdly find [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], whose members are known as [[Latter Day Saint movement|Mormons]], 2010 census reported 314,932 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,<ref name=\"2010-census\"/> though the church in 2009 claimed to have over one million registered members;<ref name=\"lds-Mexico\">{{cite web|title=Mexico, Country profile|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Days Saints Newsroom|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/mexico|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825063153/http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/mexico|archivedate=August 25, 2010|url-status=dead|accessdate=March 4, 2011}}</ref> followed by [[La Luz del Mundo|Church of the La Luz del Mundo]], which has its center in \"[[La Hermosa Provincia]]\", a colony of [[Guadalajara]]. The denominations [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] also have an important presence, especially in the cities of the border and in the indigenous communities. In fact, Pentecostal churches together have more than 1.3 million adherents, which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico. The situation changes when the different Pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities. Other groups are growing, such as [[Iglesia apost\u00f3lica de la Fe en Cristo Jes\u00fas]], [[Mennonites in Mexico|Mennonites]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. Migratory phenomena have led to the spread of different aspects of Christianity, including branches [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nAccording to [[Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum]] (in texts edited by the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]), it is remarkable the survival of magic-religious rituals of the old [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups, not only in the current indigenous people but in the [[mestizo]]s and [[white people|whites]] that make up the Mexican rural and urban society. There is often a [[syncretism]] between [[shamanism]] and the Catholic tradition. Another religion of popular syncretism in Mexico (especially in recent years) is the [[Santer\u00eda]]. This is mainly due to the large number of Cubans who settled in the territory after the [[Cuban Revolution]] (mainly in states such as [[Veracruz]] and [[Yucat\u00e1n]]). Although Mexico was also a recipient of black slaves from [[Africa]] in the 16th century, the apogee of these cults is relatively new.<ref>{{Book cite| author = Jacobo Grinberg Zylberbaum | title = Los chamanes de M\u00e9xico | date = 1989 | publisher = UNAM School of Psychology | location = Mexico City | isbn = 9686022015 | edition = University of Texas | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1QVZAAAAMAAJ&q=chamanes+en+M%C3%A9xico&dq=chamanes+en+M%C3%A9xico&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMI_pTF3KvhxgIVAxSSCh3zuQx}}</ref>\n\nIn certain regions, the profession of a creed other than the Catholic is seen as a threat to community unity. It is argued that the Catholic religion is part of the ethnic identity, and that the Protestants are not willing to participate in the traditional customs and practices (the [[tequio]] or community work, participation in the festivities and similar issues). The refusal of the Protestants is because their religious beliefs do not allow them to participate in the cult of images. In extreme cases, tension between Catholics and Protestants has led to the expulsion or even murder of Protestants in several villages. The best known cases are those of [[San Juan Chamula]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/11/11/042n3est.php|title=En Chamula, cambiar religi\u00f3n se considera delito|date=June 16, 2009|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616041417/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/11/11/042n3est.php|archivedate=June 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2000/06/03/pol4.html|title=pol4|website=www.jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> in Chiapas, and San Nicol\u00e1s, in [[Ixmiquilpan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/07/22/mas-hilo.html|title=mas-hilo|website=www.jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].\n\n[[File:The Kid - Diego Rivera.jpg|thumb|Detail of the 1947 Rivera mural,  ''[[Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Central]]''. The mural includes a depiction of [[La Calavera Catrina|La Catrina]], a popular satirical character that has become associated with [[D\u00eda de Muertos]].]]\nA similar argument was presented by a committee of anthropologists to request the government of the Republic to expel the [[SIL International|Summer Linguistic Institute]] (SIL), in the year 1979, which was accused of promoting the division of indigenous peoples by translating the [[Bible]] into vernacular languages and evangelizing in a Protestant creed that threatened the integrity of popular cultures. The Mexican government paid attention to the call of the anthropologists and canceled the agreement that had held with the SIL. Conflicts have also occurred in other areas of social life. For example, given that Jehovah's Witnesses are prohibited from surrendering honors to national symbols (something that is done every Monday in Mexican public schools), children who have been educated in that religion were expelled from public schools. This type of problem can only be solved with the intervention of the National Commission of [[Human Rights]], and not always with favorable results for children.\n\nThe impact of the Catholic religion in Mexico has also caused a fusion of elements. Beyond churches and religious denominations, a phenomenon persists in Mexico that some anthropologists and sociologists call \"popular religion\", that is, religion as the practice and understanding of the people. In Mexico, the main component is the Catholic religion, to which elements of other beliefs have been added, already of pre-Hispanic, African or Asian origin. In general, popular religiosity is viewed with bad eyes by institutionally structured religions. One of the most exemplary cases of popular religiosity is the cult of [[Santa Muerte|Holy Dead]] (Santa Muerte). The Catholic hierarchy insists on describing it as a satanic cult. However, most of the people who profess this cult declare themselves to be Catholic believers, and consider that there is no contradiction between the tributes they offer to the [[Christ Child]] and the adoration of God. Other examples are the representations of the [[Stations of the Cross|Passion of Christ]] and the celebration of [[Day of the Dead]], which take place within the framework of the Catholic Christian imaginary, but under a very particular reinterpretation of its protagonists.\n\nThe presence of [[History of the Jews in Mexico|Jews in Mexico]] dates back to 1521, when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s conquered the Aztecs, accompanied by several [[Converso]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Primack|first=Karen|title=Jews in places you never thought of|year=1998|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|page=305|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GhD0JZAOTHUC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=jews+came+to+mexico+in+1521#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-0-88125-608-6}}</ref>  According to the 2010 census, there are 67,476 Jews in Mexico.<ref name=\"2010-census\"/> [[Islam in Mexico]] is practiced mostly by [[Arab Mexican]]s.

Exogenous cultural elements have been incorporated into Mexican culture as time has passed.\n\nThe Porfirian era (''el [[Porfirio D\u00edaz|Porfiriato]]''), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President D\u00edaz himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the [[Mexican Revolution]], cultural identity has had its foundation in the ''mestizaje'', of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] in ''La Raza C\u00f3smica'' (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the ''mestizo'') not only biologically but culturally as well.<ref name=\"vasconcelos160\">{{Cite book|last=Vasconcelos|first=Jos\u00e9|others=Didier T.

Cave painting in Mexican territory is about 7500 years old and has been found in the caves of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. Pre-Hispanic Mexico is present in buildings and caves, in [[Aztec codices]], in [[ceramics]], in garments, etc. .; examples of this are the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] mural paintings of [[Bonampak]], or those of [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], those of [[Cacaxtla]] and those of [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]].\n\nMural painting with religious themes had an important flowering during the 16th century; the same in religious constructions as in houses of lineage; such is the case of the convents of [[Acolman]], [[Actopan, Hidalgo|Actopan]], [[Huejotzingo]], [[Tecamachalco, Puebla|Tecamachalco]] and [[Zinacantepec]]. These were also manifested in illustrated manuscripts such as the 1576 [[Florentine codex]] overseen by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]].  Most art in the colonial era was religious, but starting in the late seventeenth century and most prominently in the eighteenth century, secular portraits and [[casta|casta painting]] appeared. Important painters of the late colonial period were [[Juan Correa]], [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando]] and [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]].\n\nNineteenth-century painting had a marked romantic influence; landscapes and portraits were the greatest expressions of this era. [[Hermenegildo Bustos]] is one of the most appreciated painters of the [[historiography]] of Mexican art. Other painters include [[:es:Santiago Rebull|Santiago Rebull]], [[F\u00e9lix Parra]], [[Eugenio Landesio]], and his noted pupil, the landscape artist [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco G\u00f3mez|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco]].<ref>Widdiefield, Stacie G.

The Oaxacan School quickly gained fame and prestige, diffusion of ancestral and modern culture. Freedom of design is observed in relation to the color and texture of the canvases and murals as a period of transition between the 20th century and the 21st century. [[Federico Cant\u00fa Garza]], [[Juan O'Gorman]], and [[Rufino Tamayo]] are also important artists. Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure of [[Mexican muralism]], painted the [[Man at the Crossroads]] at the [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed by the Rockefellers the next year because of the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockefeller Controversy|publisher=Diego Rivera Prints|url=http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|accessdate=October 2, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011103154/http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref> Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Palace of Fine Arts]].\n \nSome of the most outstanding painters in the late 20th century and early 21st century: [[Francisco Toledo]] was a Mexican Zapotec painter, sculptor, and graphic artist. In a career that spanned seven decades, Toledo produced thousands of works of art and became widely regarded as one of Mexico's most important contemporary artists. [[Ver\u00f3nica Ruiz de Velasco]] is a [[neofigurative]] painter and muralist.  Both [[Ver\u00f3nica Ruiz de Velasco]] and [[Francisco Toledo]] were students of [[Rufino Tamayo]]. [[Gilberto Aceves Navarro]] is also considered an important contemporary artist.\n\nThroughout history several prominent painters of different nationalities have expressed in their works the face of Mexico. Among the most outstanding we can mention are [[Claudio Linati]], [[Daniel Thomas Egerton]], [[Carl Nebel]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[Leonora Carrington]].\n<gallery>\nFile:The Florentine Codex- Aztec Feather Painters IV.tiff| Many [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]] were made both during Pre-Hispanic and colonial eras. 1576 [[Florentine Codex]] of [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]]\nFile:Castas 01mestiza max.jpg|From Spaniard and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] woman, [[Mestizo|Mestiza]]. [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], 1763\n</gallery>\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n{{Main|Sculpture in Mexico}}\nSculpture was an integral part of pre-Hispanic [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations, ([[Maya civilization|Mayans]], [[Olmec]]s, [[Toltec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Aztec]]s), and others, usually religious in nature. From the Spanish conquest in 1521, civil and religious sculpture was created by indigenous artists, with guidance from Spaniards, so some pre-Hispanic features are evident. Since the 17th century, white and [[mestizo]] sculptors have created works with a marked influence of European classicism. After independence in 1821, sculpture was influenced by Romanticism, which tended to break the strict norms and models of classicism, while it pursued ideas influenced by realism and nationalism. Religious sculpture was reduced to a sporadic imagery, while the secular sculpture continued in portraits and monumental art of a civic nature. Between 1820 and 1880 the predominant themes were, successively: religious images, biblical scenes, allegories to the symbols of the independence insurgency, scenes and personages of pre-Hispanic history, and busts of the old aristocracy, of the nascent bourgeoisie and commanders of the pre-revolution. During the 20th century, some important exponents of Mexican sculpture are [[Juan Soriano (artist)|Juan Soriano]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas]], and [[Sebasti\u00e1n (sculptor)|Enrique Carbajal]] (also known as Sebasti\u00e1n).\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Architecture of Mexico}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width = \n | footer = \n | image1 = SSA41434.JPG\n | caption1 =[[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], [[State of Mexico]]\n | image2 = Catedral zacatecas.jpg\n | caption2 = [[Cathedral Basilica of Zacatecas]]\n}}\n[[Image:Ext 06Museo Soumaya FREE Fernando Romero EnterprisE photo by Adam Wiseman.jpg||thumb|[[Museo Soumaya]] in Mexico City building]] \nThe presence of the humans in the Mexican territory has left important archaeological findings of great importance for the explanation of the habitat of primitive man and contemporary man. The Mesoamerican civilizations managed to have great stylistic development and proportion on the human and urban scale, the form was evolving from simplicity to aesthetic complexity; in the north of the country the adobe and stone architecture is manifested, the multifamily housing as we can see in [[Casas Grandes]]; and the troglodyte dwelling in caves of the Sierra Madre Occidental.  Urbanism had a great development in pre-Hispanic cultures, where we can see the magnitude of the cities of [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tollan-Xicocotitlan]] and [[Tenochtitlan|M\u00e9xico-Tenochtitlan]], within the environmentalist urbanism highlight the Mayan cities to be incorporated into the monumentality of its buildings with the thickness of the jungle and complex networks of roads called ''sakb\u00e9s''. [[Mesoamerican architecture]] is noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of Ancient Egypt.\n\n[[Spanish Colonial architecture]] is marked by the contrast between the simple, solid construction demanded by the new environment and the Baroque ornamentation exported from Spain. Mexico, as the center of New Spain has some of the most renowned buildings built in this style.\nWith the arrival of the Spaniards, architectural theories of the Greco-Roman order with Arab influences were introduced. Due to the process of [[Evangelization in New Spain|evangelization]], when the first monastic temples and monasteries were built, their own models were projected, such as the [[mendicant monasteries in Mexico|mendicant monasteries]], unique in their type in architecture. The interaction between Spaniards and natives gave rise to artistic styles such as the so-called ''[[tequitqui]]'' (from [[Nahuatl]]: worker). Years later the baroque and mannerism were imposed in large cathedrals and civil buildings, while rural areas are built [[hacienda]]s or stately farms with Mozarabic tendencies.\n\nIn the 19th century the neoclassical movement arose as a response to the objectives of the republican nation, one of its examples are the [[Hospicio Caba\u00f1as]] where the strict plastic of the classical orders are represented in their architectural elements, new religious buildings also arise, civilian and military that demonstrate the presence of neoclassicism. Romanticists from a past seen through archeology show images of medieval Europe, Islamic and pre-Hispanic Mexico in the form of architectural elements in the construction of international exhibition pavilions looking for an identity typical of the national culture. The ''art nouveau'', and the ''art deco'' were styles introduced into the design of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] to mark the identity of the Mexican nation with Greek-Roman and pre-Hispanic symbols.\n\nModern architecture in Mexico has an important development in the plasticity of form and space, [[Jos\u00e9 Villagr\u00e1n Garc\u00eda]] develops a theory of form that sets the pattern of teaching in many schools of architecture in the country within functionalism. The emergence of the new [[Mexican architecture]] was born as a formal order of the policies of a nationalist state that sought modernity and the differentiation of other nations. The development of a Mexican modernist architecture was perhaps mostly fully manifested in the mid-1950s construction of the [[Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City|Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City]], the main campus of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. Designed by the most prestigious architects of the era, including [[Mario Pani]], [[Eugenio Peschard]], and [[Enrique del Moral]], the buildings feature murals by artists [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Ch\u00e1vez Morado]]. It has since been recognized as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/364 |title=UNESCO |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}</ref>\n\n[[Juan O'Gorman]] was one of the first environmental architects in Mexico, developing the \"organic\" theory, trying to integrate the building with the landscape within the same approaches of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqhys.com/arquitectura-mexicana.html|title=Arquitectura mexicana|website=www.arqhys.com}}</ref> In the search for a new architecture that does not resemble the styles of the past, it achieves a joint manifestation with the mural painting and the [[landscaping]].\n\nThe Jalisco School was a proposal of those socio-political movements that the country demanded. [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]] combined the shape of the space with forms of rural vernacular architecture of Mexico and Mediterranean countries (Spain-Morocco), integrating an impressive color that handles light and shade in different tones and opens a look at the international [[minimalism]]. He  won the 1980 [[Pritzker Prize]], the highest award in architecture.\n\nMexican architecture is a cultural phenomenon born of the ideology of nationalist governments of the 20th century, which was shaping the identity image by its colorful and variegated ornamental elements inherited from ancestral cultures, classical and monumental forms and, subsequently, the incorporation of modernism and cutting-edge international trends.\n\n===Photography===\n{{See|Mexican art#Photography in Mexico}}\n[[File:David Alfaro Siqueiros (El Coronelazo).jpg|thumb|[[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] by [[H\u00e9ctor Garc\u00eda Cobo]] at [[Palacio de Lecumberri|Lecumberri prison]], Mexico City, 1960.]]\nMexico has been photographed since the nineteenth century, when the technology was first developed. During the Porfiriato, D\u00edaz realized the importance of photography in shaping the understanding of his regime and its accomplishments.  The government hired [[Guillermo Kahlo]] (father of painter [[Frida Kahlo]]) to create photographic images of Mexico's new industrial structures as well as its pre-Hispanic and colonial past.  Photographer [[Hugo Brehme]] specialized in images of \"picturesque\" Mexico, with images of Mexican places and often rural people.  During the Mexican Revolution, photographers chronicled the conflict, usually in the aftermath of a battle, since large and heavy equipment did not permit action shots.

Poetry had a rich cultural tradition in prehispanic Mexico, being divided into two broad categories\u2014secular and religious. Aztec poetry was sung, chanted, or spoken, often to the accompanyment of a drum or a harp.

Recalled at his request in the Far East Expeditionary Force, he volunteered to participate in the reduction of one of the last [[Atlantic pockets|pockets of Third Reich resistance]] along the Atlantic coast of France, in Royan.

This strategy revealed unsuccessful ; it did not replace the preparation of the [[Influenza vaccine|influenza vaccine on eggs]].

During the winter of 1948, he and his collaborators isolated the first strains of [[influenza]] virus in France. \n\nHe was appointed in July 1949 director of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. The Second World War and the ensuing [[Greek Civil War]] left the Pasteur Institute in Athens in a sorry state. A the end of this mission he was appointed honorary director of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. He returned to the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1952 to work on the [[yellow fever]] virus. He set up research laboratories and the production of [[yellow fever vaccine]] according to the method of [[Max Theiler|Max Theiler,]] Nobel Prize in medicine in 1951.

He was demobilized in Marseille on February 28, 1947, and returned to the Pasteur Institute in Paris.\n\n== Post-war scientific activities and leadership functions ==\nHe then entered the influenza laboratory directed by [[Ren\u00e9 Dujarric de la Rivi\u00e8re]]. At the latter's request, he tried to apply the method used by Paul Giroud and Paul Durand to the typhus bacteria for the influenza virus. This strategy revealed unsuccessful ; it did not replace the preparation of the [[Influenza vaccine|influenza vaccine on eggs]]. He met Paule Descola who was preparing her M.D. thesis on polioviruses], in [[Jean Vieuchange]]'s laboratory at the Pasteur Institute<ref>Descola, P Etude exp\u00e9rimentale de la poliomy\u00e9lite sur la rongeur.

During the winter of 1948, he and his collaborators isolated the first strains of [[influenza]] virus in France. \n\nHe was appointed in July 1949 director of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. The Second World War and the ensuing [[Greek Civil War]] left the Pasteur Institute in Athens in a sorry state. A the end of this mission he was appointed honorary director of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute. He returned to the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1952 to work on the [[yellow fever]] virus. He set up research laboratories and the production of [[yellow fever vaccine]] according to the method of [[Max Theiler|Max Theiler,]] Nobel Prize in medicine in 1951. He developed in particular a method of titration of yellow fever antibodies by a neutralization test. He also ensured an increasing production of the influenza vaccine. \n\nIn 1962 he joined the Pasteur Institute in Guinea as director. The situation of this Pasteur Institute in [[Kindia]] was therefore difficult because of the political tensions between France and Guinea, which had just gained [[History of Guinea|independence]].

Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included ''buying'' 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades.

[[David Ray Griffin]] and [[Alex Jones]] have asserted that large parts of the plane, including the main body of the engine, landed miles away from the main wreckage site, too far away for an ordinary plane crash. Jones says that planes usually leave a small debris field when they crash, and that this is not compatible with reports of wreckage found farther away from the main crash site.

They join the movement for different reasons, loosely self-assemble to fill different roles and are united by their shared mistrust in experts and the establishment (government and reputable sources of knowledge), and conspiratorial stance. Through their engagement, they each find their own fulfillment and satisfaction. Together, they contribute to the persistence, resilience and exaggerated claims of acceptance (in general public) of the movement. These three groups are:<ref name=Bartlett>{{cite journal |last1=Bartlett |first1=Jamie |last2=Miller |first2=Carl |title=A Bestiary of the 9/11 Truth Movement: Notes from the Front Line |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=35.4 |issue=July/August |pages=43\u201346 |year=2011 |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_bestiary_of_the_9_11_truth_movement_notes_from_the_front_line |accessdate=May 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001051753/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_bestiary_of_the_9_11_truth_movement_notes_from_the_front_line |archive-date=October 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n* Hard Core: The organizers and active members of the various 9/11 Truth Movement organizations. They produce the information, spot the anomalies and technical inconsistencies, provide the technical base and form the theories. While they claim to be only interested in facts and to use [[scientific method]], they commit the logical fallacy of '[[confirmation bias]]' by pre-determining the outcome, then searching for corroborating evidence while ignoring the vast body of [[peer-review]]ed, independent, consensual research which contradict their theories. They supply the physical structure of the movement by organizing events, seminars, discussions, marches and distributing flyers and pamphlets. Their numbers are relatively small but they are tight-knit and highly connected. Their worldview favors 'super-conspiracy', a master plan that is behind conspiracies which they believe they are uncovering.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Critically turned: They are the young students and political activists whose affiliation with the 9/11 Truth Movement often is rooted from their dissatisfaction and anger at the established political and social order. Their sense of justice and [[idealism]] propels them to activism against perceived oppression and social injustice. Their penchant to use Internet, especially [[social media]], and tech savvy make them the propaganda machine for the movement. They produce [[YouTube]] videos and films with cool, countercultural content, make good use of pop culture parody and eye-catching graphics. The countercultural street cred of their productions buy them broad appeal and exposure to millions of people.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Illiterati: They are the movement's mass membership backbone, a large, diffuse group which give the movement exaggerated claims of popularity and influence. Participation in the 9/11 Truth Movement, to this group of people, is as much a social and recreational pursuit as the quest for truth. Their partaking is mostly through [[web 2.0]] social networking and YouTube. Their commentaries often are emotional and they make no pretense to be accurate, balanced or to show genuine intent to find truth. Involvement with the movement that fit their worldview gives them a sense of identity and belonging, which they find more appealing than the facts and evidences of the 9/11 terrorist attack itself.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n\n== Media reaction ==\nWhile discussion and coverage of these theories is mainly confined to Internet pages, books, documentary films, and conversation, a number of mainstream news outlets around the world have covered the issue.\n\nThe Norwegian version of the July 2006 ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' sparked interest when they ran, on their own initiative, a three-page main story on the 9/11 attacks and summarized the various types of 9/11 conspiracy theories (which were not specifically endorsed by the newspaper, only recensed).<ref>[http://www.lmd.no/index.php?article=947 11.September \u2013 en innsidejobb?], Norwegian edition of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', July 2006.

According to an international poll that same year, huge majorities in Muslim countries prefer to believe baseless conspiracy theories rather than listen to the mainstream facts of what happened on September 11, 2001, in New York City and Washington. Although al-Qaeda occasionally brags about its \"achievement,\" 75 percent of Egyptian citizens, for example, still deny that Arabs carried out the attacks, as a Pew study reported in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/getting-egypts-morsi-to-give-up-911-conspiracy-rhetoric/2012/09/11/4ca304ea-fb97-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html |title=Getting Egypt's Morsi to give up his 9/11 'truther' talk by Robert Satloff and Eric Trager of the Washington Post September 11, 2012 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== Legal cases ==\nArmy specialist April Gallop filed suit claiming that Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and other Bush administration officials orchestrated the 9/11 attacks and that the Pentagon was hit by an attack ordered by Cheney. The suit was dismissed in 2010 by Judge [[Denny Chin]], who said the claim was \"the product of cynical delusion and fantasy\". Her lawyers filed an appeal to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] which in April 2010 issued a [[show cause order]] why the lawyers and Gallop should not be sanctioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit. Her lawyers asked that the judges on the Court of Appeals recuse themselves because their emotions made them prejudge the case and abuse their power. On October 14, 2011, the judges sanctioned her lawyers $15,000 each for both the frivolous lawsuits and the accusations of prejudice. Gallop was not fined because of her unfamiliarity with the law.<ref>{{cite web|author=vicfedorov |url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202519035977&slreturn=1 |title=Circuit Levels $15,000 in Sanctions Against 9/11 Conspiracy Theorists New York Law Journal October 17, 2010 |publisher=Newyorklawjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Opinion polls about 9/11 conspiracy theories]]\n* [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory|1941 Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory]]\n* [[Controversies about the 2004 Madrid train bombings|2004 Madrid train bombings controversies]]\n* [[Conspiracy theories about the July 2005 London bombings|2005 London July bombings conspiracy theories]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Barkun|2003}} -->\n* {{cite book| last = Barkun | first = M. | year = 2003 | title = A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 978-0-520-23805-3 | ref = harv}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Dunbar|Reagan|2011}} -->\n* {{cite book | editor-last1 = Dunbar | editor-first1 = D. | editor-last2 = Reagan | editor-first2 = B. | title = Debunking 9/11 Myths: Why conspiracy theories can't stand up to the facts | publisher = Hearst | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-58816-855-9 | ref = harv}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Mol\u00e9|2006}} -->\n* {{cite journal | last = Mol\u00e9 | first = P. | title = 9/11 Conspiracy Theories: The 9/11 Truth Movement Perspective | journal = ESkeptic | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | year = 2006 | publisher = [[The Skeptics Society]] | location = Altadena, California | url = http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-09-11 | accessdate = 2 June 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090606001336/http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-09-11| archivedate=June 6, 2009 | url-status= live | issn = 1556-5696 | ref = harv}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Powell|2006}} -->\n* {{cite news | last = Powell | first = M. | title = 9/11 conspiracy theorists multiply | newspaper = The Seattle Times | date = September 9, 2006 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html | accessdate = September 21, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140308001143/http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html | archivedate = March 8, 2014 | url-status = dead | ref = harv | df = mdy-all }}\n<!-- NOT USED -->\n<!--\n* {{Cite book| last = Begin | first = Jeremy | year = 2007 | title = Fighting for G.O.D.

Thomas pointed out that when [[Jesse Ventura]] hired [[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology|New Mexico Tech]] to conduct a demonstration showing nanothermite slicing through a large steel beam, the nanothermite produced copious flame and smoke but no damage to the beam, even though it was in a horizontal, and therefore optimally positioned.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Thomas | first1=Dave | title=The 9/11 Truth Movement: The Top Conspiracy Theory, a Decade Later | journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | date=July\u2013August 2011 | pages=34\u201340 | volume=35 | issue=4 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_9_11_truth_movement_the_top_conspiracy_theory_a_decade_later/ | access-date=September 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923074425/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_9_11_truth_movement_the_top_conspiracy_theory_a_decade_later | archive-date=September 23, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) concluded the accepted version was more than sufficient to explain the collapse of the buildings.

Jones says that planes usually leave a small debris field when they crash, and that this is not compatible with reports of wreckage found farther away from the main crash site.

Most no-planes adherents, including [[Thierry Meyssan]] and Reynolds, assert that either CGI of a passenger plane was overlaid onto a winged cruise missile or military aircraft, or that computer-generated images of a passenger plane were inserted into the video footage and plane-shaped explosive cut-outs were planted in the buildings in order to create the impression of plane impact.<ref>[Weekend Live, Fox News, September 10, 2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reQZT9Hzvt8]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/01/september11.france|title=US invented air attack on Pentagon, claims French book|last=Henley|first=Jon|date=2002-04-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>The Great Derangement, Matt Taibbi, New York, 2009</ref> Some truth movement veterans have repeatedly refuted the \"no-plane\" claims.<ref name=\"women.timesonline.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"msnbc\">{{Cite news| url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html| title = WP: 9/11 conspiracy theories| author = Michael Powell| date = September 8, 2006| publisher = [[MSNBC]]| accessdate = June 13, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100723110251/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html| archivedate = July 23, 2010| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref> In fact, discussion of no-plane theories has been banned from certain conspiracy theory websites and advocates have sometimes been threatened with violence by posters at other conspiracy theory websites.<ref name=Yoda>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2007-08-09/news/the-yoda-of-9-11/5 |title=The Yoda of 9/11|page=5 |work=Phoenix News|publisher=Phoenixnewtimes.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Cover-up allegations ==\nPaul Zarembka, in his book, ''The Hidden History of 9/11'', states that the debris from ground zero was removed without a proper forensic investigation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/911thebigcoverup|title=9/11 \u2013 the big cover-up?|author=Peter Tatchell|publisher=Guardian News and Media, Ltd.|date=September 12, 2007|accessdate=January 12, 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100110223812/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/911thebigcoverup| archivedate=January 10, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o9jo_In37aEC&pg=PA95&dq=9/11+coverup+debris+removal|title=The hidden history of 9-11-2001|author=Paul Zermebka|publisher=Elsevier JAI|year=2006|pages=94, 95|isbn=978-0-7623-1305-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Cockpit recorders ===\n[[File:Flight 77 CVR.jpg|thumb|The [[cockpit voice recorder]] from [[American Airlines Flight 77|Flight 77]] was heavily damaged from the impact and resulting fire.]]\nAccording to the 9/11 Commission Report, both black boxes from Flight 77 and both black boxes from Flight 93 were recovered.

They produce the information, spot the anomalies and technical inconsistencies, provide the technical base and form the theories. While they claim to be only interested in facts and to use [[scientific method]], they commit the logical fallacy of '[[confirmation bias]]' by pre-determining the outcome, then searching for corroborating evidence while ignoring the vast body of [[peer-review]]ed, independent, consensual research which contradict their theories. They supply the physical structure of the movement by organizing events, seminars, discussions, marches and distributing flyers and pamphlets. Their numbers are relatively small but they are tight-knit and highly connected. Their worldview favors 'super-conspiracy', a master plan that is behind conspiracies which they believe they are uncovering.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Critically turned: They are the young students and political activists whose affiliation with the 9/11 Truth Movement often is rooted from their dissatisfaction and anger at the established political and social order. Their sense of justice and [[idealism]] propels them to activism against perceived oppression and social injustice. Their penchant to use Internet, especially [[social media]], and tech savvy make them the propaganda machine for the movement. They produce [[YouTube]] videos and films with cool, countercultural content, make good use of pop culture parody and eye-catching graphics. The countercultural street cred of their productions buy them broad appeal and exposure to millions of people.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Illiterati: They are the movement's mass membership backbone, a large, diffuse group which give the movement exaggerated claims of popularity and influence. Participation in the 9/11 Truth Movement, to this group of people, is as much a social and recreational pursuit as the quest for truth. Their partaking is mostly through [[web 2.0]] social networking and YouTube. Their commentaries often are emotional and they make no pretense to be accurate, balanced or to show genuine intent to find truth. Involvement with the movement that fit their worldview gives them a sense of identity and belonging, which they find more appealing than the facts and evidences of the 9/11 terrorist attack itself.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n\n== Media reaction ==\nWhile discussion and coverage of these theories is mainly confined to Internet pages, books, documentary films, and conversation, a number of mainstream news outlets around the world have covered the issue.\n\nThe Norwegian version of the July 2006 ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' sparked interest when they ran, on their own initiative, a three-page main story on the 9/11 attacks and summarized the various types of 9/11 conspiracy theories (which were not specifically endorsed by the newspaper, only recensed).<ref>[http://www.lmd.no/index.php?article=947 11.September \u2013 en innsidejobb?], Norwegian edition of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', July 2006.

the UN and was thereafter criticized in an article appearing in al-Qaeda's magazine, ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]]''.

According to an international poll that same year, huge majorities in Muslim countries prefer to believe baseless conspiracy theories rather than listen to the mainstream facts of what happened on September 11, 2001, in New York City and Washington. Although al-Qaeda occasionally brags about its \"achievement,\" 75 percent of Egyptian citizens, for example, still deny that Arabs carried out the attacks, as a Pew study reported in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/getting-egypts-morsi-to-give-up-911-conspiracy-rhetoric/2012/09/11/4ca304ea-fb97-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html |title=Getting Egypt's Morsi to give up his 9/11 'truther' talk by Robert Satloff and Eric Trager of the Washington Post September 11, 2012 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== Legal cases ==\nArmy specialist April Gallop filed suit claiming that Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and other Bush administration officials orchestrated the 9/11 attacks and that the Pentagon was hit by an attack ordered by Cheney. The suit was dismissed in 2010 by Judge [[Denny Chin]], who said the claim was \"the product of cynical delusion and fantasy\". Her lawyers filed an appeal to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] which in April 2010 issued a [[show cause order]] why the lawyers and Gallop should not be sanctioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit. Her lawyers asked that the judges on the Court of Appeals recuse themselves because their emotions made them prejudge the case and abuse their power. On October 14, 2011, the judges sanctioned her lawyers $15,000 each for both the frivolous lawsuits and the accusations of prejudice. Gallop was not fined because of her unfamiliarity with the law.<ref>{{cite web|author=vicfedorov |url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202519035977&slreturn=1 |title=Circuit Levels $15,000 in Sanctions Against 9/11 Conspiracy Theorists New York Law Journal October 17, 2010 |publisher=Newyorklawjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Opinion polls about 9/11 conspiracy theories]]\n* [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory|1941 Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory]]\n* [[Controversies about the 2004 Madrid train bombings|2004 Madrid train bombings controversies]]\n* [[Conspiracy theories about the July 2005 London bombings|2005 London July bombings conspiracy theories]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Barkun|2003}} -->\n* {{cite book| last = Barkun | first = M. | year = 2003 | title = A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 978-0-520-23805-3 | ref = harv}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Dunbar|Reagan|2011}} -->\n* {{cite book | editor-last1 = Dunbar | editor-first1 = D. | editor-last2 = Reagan | editor-first2 = B. | title = Debunking 9/11 Myths: Why conspiracy theories can't stand up to the facts | publisher = Hearst | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-58816-855-9 | ref = harv}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Mol\u00e9|2006}} -->\n* {{cite journal | last = Mol\u00e9 | first = P. | title = 9/11 Conspiracy Theories: The 9/11 Truth Movement Perspective | journal = ESkeptic | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | year = 2006 | publisher = [[The Skeptics Society]] | location = Altadena, California | url = http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-09-11 | accessdate = 2 June 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090606001336/http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-09-11| archivedate=June 6, 2009 | url-status= live | issn = 1556-5696 | ref = harv}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Powell|2006}} -->\n* {{cite news | last = Powell | first = M. | title = 9/11 conspiracy theorists multiply | newspaper = The Seattle Times | date = September 9, 2006 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html | accessdate = September 21, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140308001143/http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html | archivedate = March 8, 2014 | url-status = dead | ref = harv | df = mdy-all }}\n<!-- NOT USED -->\n<!--\n* {{Cite book| last = Begin | first = Jeremy | year = 2007 | title = Fighting for G.O.D.
