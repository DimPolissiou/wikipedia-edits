The national team is governed by [[Basketball Nederland]]. \n\nThe Dutch have reached the [[EuroBasket|European Basketball Championship]] on 15 occasions. Their best results at the event came in [[EuroBasket 1983|1983]], where they finished in fourth place. They have also qualified for the [[FIBA World Cup]] once, in [[1986 FIBA World Championship|1986]]. In recent years though, the national team has struggled to maintain consistency to reach major international tournaments.\n\nThe team represents itself as the '''Orange Lions'''.\n\n==History==\n===1946\u20131991: Early years===\n[[File:Basketbal Nederland tegen Luxemburg in Apollohal Amsterdam, Bestanddeelnr 910-8505.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Netherlands playing a match against [[Luxembourg national basketball team|Luxembourg]] in 1959]]\nThe Netherlands were one of the teams that played in the [[EuroBasket 1946|1946]], [[EuroBasket 1947|1947]], [[EuroBasket 1949|1949]] and [[EuroBasket 1951|1951]] EuroBasket tournaments. During this period, the 5th place finish in 1949 was the best performance by the national team.\n\n===1961\u20131991: EuroBasket success & World Cup debut===\nThe ''Oranje'' qualified for three [[European Basketball Championships]] in the 1960s ([[EuroBasket 1961|1961]], [[EuroBasket 1963|1963]], [[EuroBasket 1967|1967]]). After three consecutive missed tournaments, the Netherlands had another three EuroBasket appearance stretch from [[EuroBasket 1975|1975]], [[EuroBasket 1977|1977]], and [[EuroBasket 1979|1979]]. During the 1977 EuroBasket, the Netherlands' star player [[Kees Akerboom Sr.|Kees Akerboom]] shined during the tournament. He finished the competition as the top scorer, and earned a spot on the All-Tournament Team.\n\nAt [[EuroBasket 1983]], the Dutch had its biggest success in history under head coach Vladimir Heger. The national team achieved fourth place at the tournament. The Dutch wound up reaching the semi-finals, but eventually fell to [[Italy national basketball team|Italy]]. In the third-place game they would lose again, this time to the [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]].\n\nThree years after achieving success at the continental level, the Netherlands qualified to the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time in [[1986 FIBA World Championship|1986]]. The national team ultimately did not make it out of the group stage though, finishing the tournament with an (2-3) record to place 14th overall.\n\n===1991\u20132012: Long mediocre period===\n[[File:Francisco Elson.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Francisco Elson]] was the face of the team for a long time]]\nFrom 1991 until 2012, the Netherlands did not qualify for a EuroBasket tournament. Star player [[Francisco Elson]], former [[NBA]]-champion, represented the team on several occasions but the team never came close to qualifying. During this period, notable Dutch players like [[Dan Gadzuric]] were not willing to play for the national team. Home games were usually played at the [[Topsportcentrum (Almere)|Topsportcentrum]] in [[Almere]] and usually had little to no media attention or fan support in the Netherlands.\n\n===Rising from the ashes (2012\u20132015)===\n[[File:Toon van Helfteren.jpg|thumb|172px|[[Toon van Helfteren]] coached the national team to its first EuroBasket tournament in 26 years]]\nIn December 2012, it was announced that the Netherlands national team would be dissolved for 2 years, because the national federation NBB {Netherlands Basketball Bond} was not willing to invest money in to it. After an campaign by Dutch players who played in the [[Dutch Basketball League]], the national team was eventually saved. Sports broadcaster [[Sport1 (Netherlands)|Sport1]] became the main sponsor and DBL-teams invested in the team, which started playing again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2698/Sport/article/detail/3359327/2012/12/06/Nederlandse-basketballers-gered-door-Sport1.dhtml |title=Nederlandse basketballers gered door Sport1 | language = Dutch |work=Volkskrant.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref>\n\nDuring August 2013, the Netherlands was on its way to qualification for [[EuroBasket 2015]], but lost two games 20\u20130 because the team played with two players  \u2013 [[Mohamed Kherrazi]] and [[Sean Cunningham (basketball)|Sean Cunningham]] \u2013 who were identified as foreign players by [[FIBA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/coid_kFXfIOeXHlsnHUTnR72dF2.articleMode_on.html |title=Netherlands Incur Penalty |work=FIBA Europe |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref> The NBB believed that both were eligible players, and was upset that the attention came up after the Netherlands already won 2 games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/540247-nbb-niet-eens-met-straf.html |title=NBB niet eens met straf |work = NOS |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref>\n\n===\"Miracle of 2014\"===\n[[File:Netherlands basketball team logo.png|150px|thumb|left|Logo used from 2012\u20132019]]\nAt the start of the second 2015-qualification round, things looked bad for the ''Oranje''. The DBL-teams didn't have any more money to invest in the team and the NBB  wasn't ready to take the team back. Head coach [[Toon van Helfteren]], who worked as a volunteer, still did prepare for the qualifying games. He invited 42 players to play for the national team,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketballleague.nl/nieuws/552 |title=Eredivisie basketbal Nederland |publisher=Basketballleague.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-01-16}}</ref> but after most (notable) players rejected the offer, he started his first training camp with 7 players. The team eventually shocked the world, by beating heavy favorite [[Montenegro national basketball team|Montenegro]] to get the second place in their group. On 27 August 2014, the Dutch national team qualified for EuroBasket for the first time in 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/691692-basketballers-na-25-jaar-naar-ek.html |title=Basketballers na 25 jaar naar EK |publisher=Nos.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-01-16}}</ref>\n\n===Return to EuroBasket (2015\u2013present)===\nThe national team left the NBB and FEB, from 2015 the team was run by the NMT. Coach Van Helfteren then had his contract with the national team extended. In contrast to the summer of 2014, big name players from foreign leagues applied to play for the national team.\n\nIn the first game at [[EuroBasket 2015]], the Dutch beat [[Georgian national basketball team|Georgia]] 73\u201372 behind [[Charlon Kloof]]'s 22 and [[Worthy de Jong]]'s 16 points.<ref>[http://www.eurobasket2015.org/en/compID_qMRZdYCZI6EoANOrUf9le2.season_2015.roundID_9322.coid_1bM7BSWJHos6LdZ2wq4,A3.articleMode_on.1_1.html Dutch Win On Return]</ref> The Netherlands remaining four games though were all loses, but only by single digits to power houses such as [[Croatia men's national basketball team|Croatia]] and [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]].\n\nOn 22 July 2019, Italian coach [[Maurizio Buscaglia]] signed a contract to become the head coach of the Netherlands, ending in the summer of 2021.<ref>{{cite

During this period, the 5th place finish in 1949 was the best performance by the national team.\n\n===1961\u20131991: EuroBasket success & World Cup debut===\nThe ''Oranje'' qualified for three [[European Basketball Championships]] in the 1960s ([[EuroBasket 1961|1961]], [[EuroBasket 1963|1963]], [[EuroBasket 1967|1967]]). After three consecutive missed tournaments, the Netherlands had another three EuroBasket appearance stretch from [[EuroBasket 1975|1975]], [[EuroBasket 1977|1977]], and [[EuroBasket 1979|1979]]. During the 1977 EuroBasket, the Netherlands' star player [[Kees Akerboom Sr.|Kees Akerboom]] shined during the tournament. He finished the competition as the top scorer, and earned a spot on the All-Tournament Team.\n\nAt [[EuroBasket 1983]], the Dutch had its biggest success in history under head coach Vladimir Heger. The national team achieved fourth place at the tournament. The Dutch wound up reaching the semi-finals, but eventually fell to [[Italy national basketball team|Italy]]. In the third-place game they would lose again, this time to the [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]].\n\nThree years after achieving success at the continental level, the Netherlands qualified to the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time in [[1986 FIBA World Championship|1986]]. The national team ultimately did not make it out of the group stage though, finishing the tournament with an (2-3) record to place 14th overall.\n\n===1991\u20132012: Long mediocre period===\n[[File:Francisco Elson.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Francisco Elson]] was the face of the team for a long time]]\nFrom 1991 until 2012, the Netherlands did not qualify for a EuroBasket tournament. Star player [[Francisco Elson]], former [[NBA]]-champion, represented the team on several occasions but the team never came close to qualifying. During this period, notable Dutch players like [[Dan Gadzuric]] were not willing to play for the national team. Home games were usually played at the [[Topsportcentrum (Almere)|Topsportcentrum]] in [[Almere]] and usually had little to no media attention or fan support in the Netherlands.\n\n===Rising from the ashes (2012\u20132015)===\n[[File:Toon van Helfteren.jpg|thumb|172px|[[Toon van Helfteren]] coached the national team to its first EuroBasket tournament in 26 years]]\nIn December 2012, it was announced that the Netherlands national team would be dissolved for 2 years, because the national federation NBB {Netherlands Basketball Bond} was not willing to invest money in to it. After an campaign by Dutch players who played in the [[Dutch Basketball League]], the national team was eventually saved. Sports broadcaster [[Sport1 (Netherlands)|Sport1]] became the main sponsor and DBL-teams invested in the team, which started playing again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2698/Sport/article/detail/3359327/2012/12/06/Nederlandse-basketballers-gered-door-Sport1.dhtml |title=Nederlandse basketballers gered door Sport1 | language = Dutch |work=Volkskrant.nl |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref>\n\nDuring August 2013, the Netherlands was on its way to qualification for [[EuroBasket 2015]], but lost two games 20\u20130 because the team played with two players  \u2013 [[Mohamed Kherrazi]] and [[Sean Cunningham (basketball)|Sean Cunningham]] \u2013 who were identified as foreign players by [[FIBA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fibaeurope.com/coid_kFXfIOeXHlsnHUTnR72dF2.articleMode_on.html |title=Netherlands Incur Penalty |work=FIBA Europe |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref> The NBB believed that both were eligible players, and was upset that the attention came up after the Netherlands already won 2 games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/540247-nbb-niet-eens-met-straf.html |title=NBB niet eens met straf |work = NOS |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}</ref>\n\n===\"Miracle of 2014\"===\n[[File:Netherlands basketball team logo.png|150px|thumb|left|Logo used from 2012\u20132019]]\nAt the start of the second 2015-qualification round, things looked bad for the ''Oranje''. The DBL-teams didn't have any more money to invest in the team and the NBB  wasn't ready to take the team back. Head coach [[Toon van Helfteren]], who worked as a volunteer, still did prepare for the qualifying games. He invited 42 players to play for the national team,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketballleague.nl/nieuws/552 |title=Eredivisie basketbal Nederland |publisher=Basketballleague.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-01-16}}</ref> but after most (notable) players rejected the offer, he started his first training camp with 7 players. The team eventually shocked the world, by beating heavy favorite [[Montenegro national basketball team|Montenegro]] to get the second place in their group. On 27 August 2014, the Dutch national team qualified for EuroBasket for the first time in 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/691692-basketballers-na-25-jaar-naar-ek.html |title=Basketballers na 25 jaar naar EK |publisher=Nos.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-01-16}}</ref>\n\n===Return to EuroBasket (2015\u2013present)===\nThe national team left the NBB and FEB, from 2015 the team was run by the NMT. Coach Van Helfteren then had his contract with the national team extended. In contrast to the summer of 2014, big name players from foreign leagues applied to play for the national team.\n\nIn the first game at [[EuroBasket 2015]], the Dutch beat [[Georgian national basketball team|Georgia]] 73\u201372 behind [[Charlon Kloof]]'s 22 and [[Worthy de Jong]]'s 16 points.<ref>[http://www.eurobasket2015.org/en/compID_qMRZdYCZI6EoANOrUf9le2.season_2015.roundID_9322.coid_1bM7BSWJHos6LdZ2wq4,A3.articleMode_on.1_1.html Dutch Win On Return]</ref> The Netherlands remaining four games though were all loses, but only by single digits to power houses such as [[Croatia men's national basketball team|Croatia]] and [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]].\n\nOn 22 July 2019, Italian coach [[Maurizio Buscaglia]] signed a contract to become the head coach of the Netherlands, ending in the summer of 2021.<ref>{{cite

He came to prominence as the frontman of the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Smiths]], which was active from 1982 to 1987. Since then, he has pursued a commercially successful solo career. Morrissey's music is characterised by his [[baritone]] voice and distinctive lyrics with recurring themes of emotional isolation, sexual longing, self-deprecating and black humour, and anti-establishment stances.\n\nBorn to working-class Irish immigrants in [[Davyhulme|Davyhulme, Lancashire]], Morrissey grew up in nearby [[Manchester]]. As a child, he developed a love of literature, [[kitchen sink realism]], and [[pop music]]. In the late 1970s, he fronted [[punk rock]] band [[the Nosebleeds]] with little success before beginning a career in music journalism and writing several books on music and film in the early 1980s. He formed the Smiths with [[Johnny Marr]] in 1982 and the band soon attracted national recognition for [[The Smiths (album)|their eponymous debut album]]. As the band's frontman, Morrissey attracted attention for his trademark [[quiff]] and witty and sardonic lyrics. Deliberately avoiding rock machismo, he cultivated the image of a sexually ambiguous social outsider who embraced [[celibacy]]. The Smiths released three further studio albums\u2014''[[Meat Is Murder]]'', ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]'', and ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come (album)|Strangeways, Here We Come]]''\u2014and had a string of hit singles. The band were critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following. Personal differences between Morrissey and Marr resulted in the separation of the Smiths in 1987.\n\nIn 1988 Morrissey launched his solo career with ''[[Viva Hate]]''. This album and its follow-ups\u2014''[[Kill Uncle]]'', ''[[Your Arsenal]]'', and ''[[Vauxhall and I]]''\u2014all did well on the UK Albums Chart and spawned multiple hit singles. Replacing Marr, he took on [[Alain Whyte]] and [[Boz Boorer]] as his main co-writers. During this time, his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his albums ''[[Southpaw Grammar]]'' and ''[[Maladjusted]]'' also charted but were less well received. Relocating to [[Los Angeles]], he took a musical hiatus from 1998 to 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, ''[[You Are the Quarry]]'', in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums ''[[Ringleader of the Tormentors]]'', ''[[Years of Refusal]]'', ''[[World Peace Is None of Your Business]]'', ''[[Low in High School]]'', ''[[California Son (album)|California Son]]'', and ''[[I Am Not a Dog on a Chain]]'', as well as [[Autobiography (Morrissey)|his autobiography]] and his debut novel, ''[[List of the Lost]]''.\n\nHighly influential, Morrissey has been credited as a seminal figure in the emergence of [[indie rock]] and [[Britpop]]. He is regarded as one of the greatest lyricists in British history and his lyrics have been closely studied by academics.{{cn|date=March 2020}} He has been a controversial figure throughout his music career due to his forthright opinions and outspoken nature\u2014endorsing [[vegetarianism]] and [[animal rights]], [[Criticism of monarchy|criticising royalty]] and prominent politicians, defending a particular vision of [[English national identity]] while critiquing the impact of immigration on the UK. In a 2006 poll for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Culture Show|Culture Show]]'', Morrissey was voted the second-greatest living British [[List of cultural icons of England|cultural icon]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1959\u20131976===\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=I lost myself in music at a very early age, and I remained there&nbsp;...

rather, he sings about the anticipation, frustration, aversion, or final disappointment with sex.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=10\u2013101}} Stringer suggested that this deliberate avoidance of sex was a reflection of the band's 'Englishness' because it invoked English cultures' \"lack of emotional expression, the way in which feelings, and especially sexual feelings, cannot be expressed directly through casual touch, body contact and so on\".{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=22}}\nMale homoerotic elements can be found in many of the Smiths' lyrics,{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=106}} however these also included sexualised descriptions featuring women.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=107\u2013208}}\n\nMorrissey has described having \"a macabre fascination\" with violence.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=232}} Simpson opined that Morrissey's lyrics \"bleed and throb with violent imagery\", citing the references to bus crashes and suicide pacts in \"There is a Light that Never Goes Out\", smashed teeth in \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\", and [[nuclear apocalypse]] in both \"Ask\" and \"Everyday is Like Sunday\".{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=131}} More broadly, Morrissey had a longstanding interest in thuggery, whether that be murderers, gangsters, rough trade, or skinheads.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=226}}\n\n===Performance style===\n[[File:Morrissey and band at Zitadelle Spandau in Berlin 2011.jpg|thumb|right|As a solo performer, Morrissey typically featured older imagery as his stage backdrop, as seen here at a 2011 performance in Berlin]]\n\nMorrissey's vocals have been cited as having a particularly distinctive quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Stringer|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=48}} Simpson believed that Morrissey's work embodied and personified that of the \"Northern Women\", speaking in styles of vernacular language that would be common to many women living in [[northern England]].{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=49\u201350}} In this he was strongly influenced by the Northern singer [[Cilla Black]], who had a successful career as a pop music singer in the 1960s,{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=50}} as well as [[Viv Nicholson]], who similarly earned fame during that decade.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=50}} Other female singers from that decade who have been cited as an influence on Morrissey have been the Scottish [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]],{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=50}} and the Essexer [[Sandie Shaw]].{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=52\u201353}} However, Stringer noted that rather than expressly singing in a Mancunian working-class accent, Morrissey adopted a \"very clipped, precise enunciation\" and sang in \"clear English diction\".{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=19}} He is also noted for his unusual [[baritone]] vocal style (though he sometimes uses [[falsetto]]).<ref name=\"greatestsingers\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/morrissey-20101202 |title=The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time\u201492: Morrissey |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen performing onstage, he often whips his microphone cord about, particularly during his up-tempo tracks.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=131}} Simpson believed that Morrissey often gave \"slyly aggressive gestures\" while onstage;

He came to prominence as the frontman of the [[Rock music|rock]] band [[the Smiths]], which was active from 1982 to 1987. Since then, he has pursued a commercially successful solo career. Morrissey's music is characterised by his [[baritone]] voice and distinctive lyrics with recurring themes of emotional isolation, sexual longing, self-deprecating and black humour, and anti-establishment stances.\n\nBorn to working-class Irish immigrants in [[Davyhulme|Davyhulme, Lancashire]], Morrissey grew up in nearby [[Manchester]]. As a child, he developed a love of literature, [[kitchen sink realism]], and [[pop music]]. In the late 1970s, he fronted [[punk rock]] band [[the Nosebleeds]] with little success before beginning a career in music journalism and writing several books on music and film in the early 1980s. He formed the Smiths with [[Johnny Marr]] in 1982 and the band soon attracted national recognition for [[The Smiths (album)|their eponymous debut album]]. As the band's frontman, Morrissey attracted attention for his trademark [[quiff]] and witty and sardonic lyrics. Deliberately avoiding rock machismo, he cultivated the image of a sexually ambiguous social outsider who embraced [[celibacy]]. The Smiths released three further studio albums\u2014''[[Meat Is Murder]]'', ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]'', and ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come (album)|Strangeways, Here We Come]]''\u2014and had a string of hit singles. The band were critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following. Personal differences between Morrissey and Marr resulted in the separation of the Smiths in 1987.\n\nIn 1988 Morrissey launched his solo career with ''[[Viva Hate]]''. This album and its follow-ups\u2014''[[Kill Uncle]]'', ''[[Your Arsenal]]'', and ''[[Vauxhall and I]]''\u2014all did well on the UK Albums Chart and spawned multiple hit singles. Replacing Marr, he took on [[Alain Whyte]] and [[Boz Boorer]] as his main co-writers. During this time, his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his albums ''[[Southpaw Grammar]]'' and ''[[Maladjusted]]'' also charted but were less well received. Relocating to [[Los Angeles]], he took a musical hiatus from 1998 to 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, ''[[You Are the Quarry]]'', in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums ''[[Ringleader of the Tormentors]]'', ''[[Years of Refusal]]'', ''[[World Peace Is None of Your Business]]'', ''[[Low in High School]]'', ''[[California Son (album)|California Son]]'', and ''[[I Am Not a Dog on a Chain]]'', as well as [[Autobiography (Morrissey)|his autobiography]] and his debut novel, ''[[List of the Lost]]''.\n\nHighly influential, Morrissey has been credited as a seminal figure in the emergence of [[indie rock]] and [[Britpop]]. He is regarded as one of the greatest lyricists in British history and his lyrics have been closely studied by academics.{{cn|date=March 2020}} He has been a controversial figure throughout his music career due to his forthright opinions and outspoken nature\u2014endorsing [[vegetarianism]] and [[animal rights]], [[Criticism of monarchy|criticising royalty]] and prominent politicians, defending a particular vision of [[English national identity]] while critiquing the impact of immigration on the UK. In a 2006 poll for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Culture Show|Culture Show]]'', Morrissey was voted the second-greatest living British [[List of cultural icons of England|cultural icon]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1959\u20131976===\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=I lost myself in music at a very early age, and I remained there&nbsp;...

rather, he sings about the anticipation, frustration, aversion, or final disappointment with sex.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=10\u2013101}} Stringer suggested that this deliberate avoidance of sex was a reflection of the band's 'Englishness' because it invoked English cultures' \"lack of emotional expression, the way in which feelings, and especially sexual feelings, cannot be expressed directly through casual touch, body contact and so on\".{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=22}}\nMale homoerotic elements can be found in many of the Smiths' lyrics,{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=106}} however these also included sexualised descriptions featuring women.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=107\u2013208}}\n\nMorrissey has described having \"a macabre fascination\" with violence.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=232}} Simpson opined that Morrissey's lyrics \"bleed and throb with violent imagery\", citing the references to bus crashes and suicide pacts in \"There is a Light that Never Goes Out\", smashed teeth in \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\", and [[nuclear apocalypse]] in both \"Ask\" and \"Everyday is Like Sunday\".{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=131}} More broadly, Morrissey had a longstanding interest in thuggery, whether that be murderers, gangsters, rough trade, or skinheads.{{sfn|Bret|2004|p=226}}\n\n===Performance style===\n[[File:Morrissey and band at Zitadelle Spandau in Berlin 2011.jpg|thumb|right|As a solo performer, Morrissey typically featured older imagery as his stage backdrop, as seen here at a 2011 performance in Berlin]]\n\nMorrissey's vocals have been cited as having a particularly distinctive quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Stringer|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=48}} Simpson believed that Morrissey's work embodied and personified that of the \"Northern Women\", speaking in styles of vernacular language that would be common to many women living in [[northern England]].{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=49\u201350}} In this he was strongly influenced by the Northern singer [[Cilla Black]], who had a successful career as a pop music singer in the 1960s,{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=50}} as well as [[Viv Nicholson]], who similarly earned fame during that decade.{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=50}} Other female singers from that decade who have been cited as an influence on Morrissey have been the Scottish [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]],{{sfn|Simpson|2004|p=50}} and the Essexer [[Sandie Shaw]].{{sfn|Simpson|2004|pp=52\u201353}} However, Stringer noted that rather than expressly singing in a Mancunian working-class accent, Morrissey adopted a \"very clipped, precise enunciation\" and sang in \"clear English diction\".{{sfn|Stringer|1992|p=19}} He is also noted for his unusual [[baritone]] vocal style (though he sometimes uses [[falsetto]]).<ref name=\"greatestsingers\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/morrissey-20101202 |title=The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time\u201492: Morrissey |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen performing onstage, he often whips his microphone cord about, particularly during his up-tempo tracks.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=3|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=131}} Simpson believed that Morrissey often gave \"slyly aggressive gestures\" while onstage;
