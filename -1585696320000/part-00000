Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, ''bereavement'' refers to the state of loss, and ''grief'' is the reaction to that loss.\n\nThe grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship.<ref>America, H.

[[The Two-Track Model of Bereavement]], created by Simon Shimshon Rubin in 1981, is a grief theory that provided deeper focus on the grieving process. The model examines the long-term effects of bereavement by measuring how well the person is adapting to the loss of a significant person in their life. The main objective of the Two-Track Model of Bereavement is for the individual to \"manage and live in reality in which the deceased is absent\" as well as returning to normal biological functioning. (Malkinson, 2006)\n\nTrack One is focused on the biopsychosocial functioning of grief. This focuses on the [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], somatic concerns, traumatic responses, familial relationships, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, meaning structure, work, and investment in life tasks.  Rubin (2010) Points out, \u201cTrack 1, the range of aspects of the individuals functioning across affective, interpersonal, somatic and classical psychiatric indicators is considered\u201d(Shimshon 686). All of the terms listed above are noted for the importance they have in relation to people's responses to grief and loss.\n\nThe significance of the closeness between the bereaved and the deceased is important to Track 1 because this could determine the severity of the mourning and grief the bereaved will endure. This first track is the response to the extremely stressful life events and requires adaption along with change and integration. The second track focuses on the ongoing relationship between the griever and the deceased. Track two mainly focuses on how the bereaved was connected to the deceased and on what level of closeness was shared. The stronger the relationship to the deceased is will lead to a greater evaluation of the relationship with heightened shock. Track two brings up memories (both positive and negative) and emotional involvement shared with the decedent.\n\nAny memory could be a trigger for the bereaved, the way the bereaved chose to remember their loved ones, and how the bereaved integrate the memory of their loved ones into their daily lives.\n\nTen main attributes to this track include; imagery/memory, emotional distance, positive effect, negative effect, preoccupation with the loss, conflict, idealization, memorialization/transformation of the loss, impact on self-perception and loss process (shock, searching, disorganized) (Rubin, 1999). An outcome of this track is being able to recognize how transformation has occurred beyond grief and mourning (Rubin, 1999). By outlining the main aspects of the bereavement process into two interactive tracks, individuals can examine and understand how grief has affected their life following loss and begin to adapt to this post-loss life.The Model offers a better understanding with the duration of time in the wake of one's loss and the outcomes that evolve from death. By using this model, researchers can effectively examine the response to an individual's loss by assessing the behavioral-psychological functioning and the relationship with the deceased.\n<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/07481180802705668| pmid=19368062|title = The Two-Track Model of Bereavement Questionnaire (TTBQ): Development and Validation of a Relational Measure| journal=Death Studies| volume=33| issue=4| pages=305\u2013333|year = 2009|last1 = Rubin|first1 = Simon Shimshon| last2=Bar Nadav| first2=Ofri| last3=Malkinson| first3=Ruth| last4=Koren| first4=Dan| last5=Goffer-Shnarch| first5=Moran| last6=Michaeli| first6=Ella}}</ref>\n\nThe authors from ''[https://whatsyourgrief.com/rubin-two-track-model-of-bereavement/ Whats Your Grief?]'', Litza Williams and Eleanor Haley, state in their understanding of the clinical and therapeutic uses of the model:<blockquote>\u201cin terms of functioning, this model can help the bereaved identify which areas of his/her life has been impacted by the grief in a negative way as well as areas that the bereaved has already begun to adapt to after the loss.

Subjects of his studies number in the several thousand and include people who have suffered losses in the U.S. and cross-cultural studies in various countries around the world, such as Israel, [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], and China. His subjects suffered losses through war, [[terrorism]], deaths of children, premature deaths of spouses, [[sexual abuse]], childhood diagnoses of AIDS, and other potentially devastating loss events or potential trauma events.\n\nIn Bonanno's book, ''The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss'' ({{ISBN|978-0-465-01360-9}}), he summarizes his research.\nHis findings include that a natural resilience is the main component of grief and trauma reactions.<ref name=\"americanPsychologistpdf\"/>  The first researcher to use pre-loss data, he outlined four trajectories of grief.<ref name=\"americanPsychologistpdf\"/> Bonanno's work has also demonstrated that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome, rather than something to be feared as has been the thought and practice until his research.<ref name=\"SA_NTG\" /> Because grief responses can take many forms, including laughter, celebration, and bawdiness, in addition to sadness,<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giftofireland.com/Irishwakes.htm|title=The Irish Wake Tradition - Exploring Irish Wakes|publisher=|date=2012-02-13}}</ref> Bonanno coined the phrase \"coping ugly\" to describe the idea that some forms of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] may seem counter intuitive.<ref name=\"SA_NTG\" /> Bonanno has found that resilience is natural to humans, suggesting that it cannot be \"taught\" through specialized programs<ref name=\"SA_NTG\" /> and that there is virtually no existing research with which to design resilience training, nor is there existing research to support major investment in such things as military resilience training programs.<ref name=\"SA_NTG\" />\n\nThe four trajectories are as follows:\n\n* '''Resilience''': \"The ability of adults in otherwise normal circumstances who are exposed to an isolated and potentially highly disruptive event, such as the death of a close relation or a violent or life-threatening situation, to maintain relatively stable, healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning\" as well as \"the capacity for generative experiences and positive emotions.\"\n* '''Recovery''': When \"normal functioning temporarily gives way to threshold or sub-threshold [[psychopathology]] (e.g., symptoms of depression or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]], or PTSD), usually for a period of at least several months, and then gradually returns to pre-event levels.\"\n* '''Chronic dysfunction''': Prolonged suffering and inability to function, usually lasting several years or longer.\n* '''Delayed grief or trauma''': When adjustment seems normal but then distress and symptoms increase months later. Researchers have not found evidence of [[delayed grief]], but delayed trauma appears to be a genuine phenomenon.\n\n=== Five stages theory ===\n{{Main|K\u00fcbler-Ross model}}\n\nThe [[K\u00fcbler-Ross model]], commonly known as the five stages of grief, is a theory first introduced by [[Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross]] in her 1969 book, ''On Death and Dying''.<ref>Broom, Sarah M. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html \"Milestones: Aug. 30, 2004\"], ''TIME'' website</ref> Based on the uncredited earlier work of John Bowlby and Colin Murray-Parkes, K\u00fcbler-Ross actually applied the stages to persons who were dying, not persons who were grieving.  Her studies involved her work with the terminally ill. The popular but empirically unsupported model describes in five distinct stages how people deal with their impending death.\n\nThe five stages are:\n\n# denial\n# anger\n# bargaining\n# depression\n# acceptance\n\nThe theory holds that the stages are a part of the framework that helps people learn to live without what they have lost.\n\nThe stages model, which came about in the 1960s, is a theory based on observation of people who are dying, not people who experienced the death of a loved one. This model found limited empirical support in a study by Maciejewski et al.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.297.7.716 |title=An Empirical Examination of the Stage Theory of Grief |year=2007 |last1=MacIejewski |first1=P.

The research of [[George Bonanno]], however, is acknowledged as debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer-reviewed studies show that the vast majority of people who have experienced a loss are resilient and that there are multiple trajectories following loss.\n\n== Physiological and neurological processes ==\n\n[[File:El Greco Piet\u00e0.jpg|thumb|\"[[Piet\u00e0]]\" by [[El Greco]], 1571\u20131576. Philadelphia Museum of Art]]\n\nStudies of [[fMRI]] scans of women from whom grief was elicited about the death of a mother or a sister in the past 5 years resulted in the conclusion that grief produced a local inflammation response as measured by salivary concentrations of [[pro-inflammatory cytokine]]s. These responses were correlated with activation in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]]. This activation also correlated with the free recall of grief-related word stimuli. This suggests that grief can cause stress, and that this reaction is linked to the emotional processing parts of the [[frontal lobe]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.05.049 |title=When grief heats up: Pro-inflammatory cytokines predict regional brain activation |year=2009 |last1=O'Connor |first1=Mary-Frances |last2=Irwin |first2=Michael R. |last3=Wellisch |first3=David K. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=891\u20136 |pmid=19481155 |pmc=2760985}}</ref>  Activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and [[vagus nerve]] is similarly implicated in the experience of [[broken heart|heartbreak]] whether due to social rejection or bereavement.<!-- refs on linked article -->\n\nAmong those persons who have been bereaved within the previous three months of a given report, those who report many intrusive thoughts about the deceased show ventral [[amygdala]] and rostral [[anterior cingulate cortex]] hyperactivity to reminders of their loss. In the case of the amygdala, this links to their sadness intensity. In those individuals who avoid such thoughts, there is a related opposite type of pattern in which there is a decrease in the activation of the dorsal amygdala and the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]].\n\nIn those not so emotionally affected by reminders of their loss, studies of [[fMRI]] scans have been used to conclude that there is a high functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting that the former regulates activity in the latter. In those people who had greater intensity of sadness, there was a low functional connection between the rostal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting a lack of regulation of the former part of the brain upon the latter.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.01.019 |title=Neural Mechanisms of Grief Regulation |year=2009 |last1=Freed |first1=Peter J. |last2=Yanagihara |first2=Ted K. |last3=Hirsch |first3=Joy |last4=Mann |first4=J.

Several researchers have proposed functional explanations for grief, attempting to solve this puzzle. Sigmund Freud argued that grief is a process of libidinal reinvestment. The griever must, Freud argued, disinvest from the deceased, which is a painful process.<ref>Freud, S. (1957). Mourning and Melancholia. In J. Strachey (Ed. and Trans.), ''The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud'' (Vol. 14, pp. 152-170). London, England: Hogarth Press. (Original work published 1917)</ref> But this disinvestment allows the griever to use libidinal energies on other, possibly new attachments, so it provides a valuable function. John Archer, approaching grief from an attachment theory perspective, argued that grief is a byproduct of the human attachment system.<ref>Archer, J. (1999). ''The nature of grief: The evolution and psychology of reactions to loss''. London, England: Routledge.</ref>  Generally, a grief-type response is adaptive because it compels a social organism to search for a lost individual (e.g., a mother or a child). However, in the case of death, the response is maladaptive because the individual is not simply lost and the griever cannot reunite with the deceased. Grief, from this perspective, is a painful cost of the human capacity to form commitments.\n\nOther researchers such as Randolph Nesse have proposed that grief is a kind of psychological pain that orients the sufferer to a new existence without the deceased and creates a painful but instructive memory.<ref>Nesse, R. M. (2005). An evolutionary framework for understanding grief. In D. Carr, R. M. Nesse, & C. B. Wortman (Eds.), ''Late life widowhood in the United States: Spousal bereavement in late life'' (pp. 195-226). New York, New York: Springer.</ref> If, for example, leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole led to the offspring's death, grief creates an intensively painful memory of the event, dissuading a parent from ever again leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole.  More recently, [[Bo Winegard]] and colleagues argued that grief might be a socially selected signal of an individual's propensity for forming strong, committed relationships.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Winegard B.

That is, because grief signals a person's capacity to form strong and faithful social bonds, those who displayed prolonged grief responses were preferentially chosen by alliance partners. The authors argue that throughout human evolution, grief was therefore shaped and elaborated by the social decisions of selective alliance partners.\n\n== Risks ==\n\nBereavement, while a normal part of life, carries a degree of risk when severe. Severe reactions affect approximately 10% to 15% of people.<ref name=\"americanPsychologistpdf\"/> Severe reactions mainly occur in people with depression present before the loss event.<ref name=\"americanPsychologistpdf\"/> Severe grief reactions may carry over into family relations. Some researchers have found an increased risk of marital breakup following the death of a child, for example. Others have found no increase. John James, author of the Grief Recovery Handbook and founder of the Grief Recovery Institute, reported that his marriage broke up after the death of his infant son.\n\nMany studies have looked at the bereaved in terms of increased risks for stress-related illnesses. [[Colin Murray Parkes]] in the 1960s and 1970s in England noted increased doctor visits, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, breathing difficulties, and so forth in the first six months following a death. Others have noted increased mortality rates (Ward, A.W. 1976) and Bunch et al. found a five times greater risk of [[suicide]] in teens following the death of a parent.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00578368 |title=Suicide following bereavement of parents |year=1971 |last1=Bunch |first1=J. |last2=Barraclough |first2=B. |last3=Nelson |first3=B. |last4=Sainsbury |first4=P. |journal=Social Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=193}}</ref>\n\n=== Complicated grief ===\n\n[[Prolonged grief disorder|Prolonged grief disorder (PGD)]], formerly known as [[Complicated grief disorder|complicated grief disorder (CGD)]], is a pathological reaction to loss representing a cluster of empirically derived symptoms that have been associated with long-term physical and psycho-social dysfunction.

A factor is the manner in which the spouse died.  The survivor of a spouse who died of an illness has a different experience of such loss than a survivor of a spouse who died by an act of violence.  Often, the spouse who is \"left behind\" may suffer from depression and loneliness, and may feel it necessary to seek professional help in dealing with their new life.\n\nFurthermore, most couples have a division of 'tasks' or 'labor', e.g., the husband mows the yard, the wife pays the bills, etc. which, in addition to dealing with great grief and life changes, means added responsibilities for the bereaved. Planning and financing a funeral can be very difficult if pre-planning was not completed.  Changes in insurance, bank accounts, claiming of life insurance, securing childcare can also be intimidating to someone who is grieving.  Social isolation may also become imminent, as many groups composed of couples find it difficult to adjust to the new identity of the bereaved, and the bereaved themselves have great challenges in reconnecting with others. Widows of many cultures, for instance, wear black for the rest of their lives to signify the loss of their spouse and their grief. Only in more recent decades has this tradition been reduced to a period of two years, while some religions such as Christian Orthodox many widows will still continue to wear black for the remainder of their lives.<ref>See Gerald Rochelle, Goodbye: grief from beginning to end, Cambridge House, 2013.</ref>\n\n=== Death of a parent ===\n\nFor a child, the death of a parent, without support to manage the effects of the grief, may result in long-term psychological harm. This is more likely if the adult carers are struggling with their own grief and are psychologically unavailable to the child. There is a critical role of the surviving parent or caregiver in helping the children adapt to a parent's death. However, losing a parent at a young age also has some positive effects. Some children had an increased maturity, better coping skills and improved communication. Adolescents who lost a parent valued other people more than those who have not experienced such a close loss.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=J|author2=Lloyd-Williams, M|title=Perspectives on the impact of early parent loss in adulthood in the UK: narratives provide the way forward|journal=European Journal of Cancer Care|volume=17|issue=4|date=July 2008|pages=317\u2013318|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2354.2008.00963.x|pmid=18638179}}</ref>\n\nWhen an adult child loses a parent in later adulthood, it is considered to be \"timely\" and to be a normative life course event. This allows the adult children to feel a permitted level of grief. However, research shows that the death of a parent in an adult's midlife is not a normative event by any measure, but is a major life transition causing an evaluation of one's own life or mortality.

A very young child, under one or two, may be found to have no reaction if a carer dies, but other children may be affected by the loss.\n\nAt a time when trust and dependency are formed, even mere separation can cause problems in well-being. This is especially true if the loss is around critical periods such as 8\u201312 months, when attachment and separation are at their height and even a brief separation from a parent or other caregiver can cause distress.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Mary D. Salter |last1=Ainsworth |first2=Silvia M. |last2=Bell |title=Attachment, Exploration, and Separation: Illustrated by the Behavior of One-Year-Olds in a Strange Situation |journal=Child Development |jstor=1127388 |pmid=5490680 |pages=49\u201367 |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1970 |doi=10.2307/1127388}}</ref>\n\nEven as a child grows older, death is still difficult to fathom and this affects how a child responds. For example, younger children see death more as a separation, and may believe death is curable or temporary. Reactions can manifest themselves in \"acting out\" behaviors, a return to earlier behaviors such as thumb sucking, clinging to a toy or angry behavior. Though they do not have the maturity to mourn as an adult, they feel the same intensity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} As children enter pre-teen and teen years, there is a more mature understanding.\n\nAdolescents may respond by [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]], or oppositely become \"over-achievers\". Repetitive actions are not uncommon such as washing a car repeatedly or taking up repetitive tasks such as sewing, computer games, etc. It is an effort to stay above the grief.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Childhood loss can predispose a child not only to physical illness but to emotional problems and an increased risk for suicide, especially in the adolescent period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nChildren can experience grief as a result of losses due to causes other than death. For example, children who have been physically, psychologically or sexually abused often grieve over the damage to or the loss of their ability to trust.

It involved individuals trying to make meaning out of the loss through '''sense making''', (making sense of what happened and the cause of the death), or through [[benefit finding]] (consideration of the global significance of the loss of one's goals, and helping the family develop a greater appreciation of life).

(2014). How adults with intellectual disability experience bereavement and grief: a qualitative exploration. Death Studies, 38(3), 179-185.</ref> One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population.<ref>Gilrane-McGarry, U., Taggart, L. (2007). An exploration of the support received by people with intellectual disabilities who have been bereaved. Journal of Research in Nursing, 12(2), 129-144.</ref> It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo.<ref>McEvoy, J., Smith, E. (2005).\n\nFamilies perceptions of the grieving process and concept of death in individuals with intellectual disabilities. British Journal of Developmental Disabilities, 51(100, pt.1), 17-25.</ref> An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is family involvement where possible, which may take the form of a biological family or a family created in a group home or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a socio-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are acceptable and normal.<ref>Clute, M. (2010). Bereavement interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities: what works.

This can occur between bonded animals which are animals that attempt to survive together (i.e. a pack of wolves or mated prairie voles).\n\n=== Mammals ===\nMammals have demonstrated grief-like states, especially between a mother and her offspring. She will often stay close to her dead offspring for short periods of time and may investigate the reasons for the baby's non-response. For example, some [[deer]] will often sniff, poke, and look at its lifeless fawn before realising it is dead and leaving it to rejoin the herd shortly afterwards. Other animals, such as a [[lion]]ess, will pick up its cub in its mouth and place it somewhere else before abandoning it.\n\nWhen a baby [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] or [[gorilla]] dies, the mother will carry the body around for several days before it may finally be able to move on without it; this behavior has been observed in other [[primates]], as well. [[Jane Goodall]] has described chimpanzees as exhibiting mournful behavior toward the loss of a group member with silence and by showing more attention to it. And they will often continue grooming it and stay close to the carcass until the group must move on without it. Another notable example is [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], a gorilla who was taught [[sign language]], who expressed sadness and even described sadness about the death of her pet cat, All Ball.\n\n[[Elephant]]s, have shown unusual behavior upon encountering the remains of another deceased elephant. They will often investigate it by touching and grabbing it with their trunks and have the whole herd stand around it for long periods of time until they must leave it behind. It is unknown whether they are mourning over it and showing sympathy, or are just curious and investigating the dead body. Elephants are thought to be able to discern relatives even from their remains. An episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary [[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]] shows this in detail \u2013 the elephants, upon finding a dead herd member, pause for several minutes at a time, and carefully touch and hold the dead creature's bones.\n\n=== Birds ===\nSome birds seem to lack the perception of grief or quickly accept it; [[Mallard]] hens, although shocked for a moment when losing one of their young to a predator, will soon return to doing what they were doing before the predator attacked. However, some other waterbirds, such as [[mute swan]]s are known to grieve for the loss of a partner or cygnet, and are known to engage in pining for days, weeks or even months at a time.<ref>[http://www.theswansanctuary.org.uk/faq.php Frequently Asked Questions about Swans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929170937/http://www.theswansanctuary.org.uk/faq.php |date=September 29, 2015 }}, The Swan Sanctuary</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/animals-grieve-just-as-people-do/|title=Animals grieve just as people do|last=Wedderburn|first=Pete|website=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> Other species of swans such as the [[black swan]] have also been observed mourning the loss of a close relative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/male-swan-holds-vigil-at-nest-after-teens-kill-his-mate.html|title=Male Swan Holds Vigil at Nest After Teens Kill His Mate|website=TreeHugger|language=en|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Monogamous animals ===\nAnother form of grief in animals is when an individual loses its mate; this can be especially brutal when the species is [[monogamous]].

While the terms are often used interchangeably, ''bereavement'' refers to the state of loss, and ''grief'' is the reaction to that loss.\n\nThe grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship.<ref>America, H.

[[The Two-Track Model of Bereavement]], created by Simon Shimshon Rubin in 1981, is a grief theory that provided deeper focus on the grieving process. The model examines the long-term effects of bereavement by measuring how well the person is adapting to the loss of a significant person in their life. The main objective of the Two-Track Model of Bereavement is for the individual to \"manage and live in reality in which the deceased is absent\" as well as returning to normal biological functioning. (Malkinson, 2006)\n\nTrack One is focused on the biopsychosocial functioning of grief. This focuses on the [[anxiety]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], somatic concerns, traumatic responses, familial relationships, interpersonal relationships, self-esteem, meaning structure, work, and investment in life tasks.  Rubin (2010) Points out, \u201cTrack 1, the range of aspects of the individuals functioning across affective, interpersonal, somatic and classical psychiatric indicators is considered\u201d(Shimshon 686). All of the terms listed above are noted for the importance they have in relation to people's responses to grief and loss.\n\nThe significance of the closeness between the bereaved and the deceased is important to Track 1 because this could determine the severity of the mourning and grief the bereaved will endure. This first track is the response to the extremely stressful life events and requires adaption along with change and integration. The second track focuses on the ongoing relationship between the griever and the deceased. Track two mainly focuses on how the bereaved was connected to the deceased and on what level of closeness was shared. The stronger the relationship to the deceased is will lead to a greater evaluation of the relationship with heightened shock. Track two brings up memories (both positive and negative) and emotional involvement shared with the decedent.\n\nAny memory could be a trigger for the bereaved, the way the bereaved chose to remember their loved ones, and how the bereaved integrate the memory of their loved ones into their daily lives.\n\nTen main attributes to this track include; imagery/memory, emotional distance, positive effect, negative effect, preoccupation with the loss, conflict, idealization, memorialization/transformation of the loss, impact on self-perception and loss process (shock, searching, disorganized) (Rubin, 1999). An outcome of this track is being able to recognize how transformation has occurred beyond grief and mourning (Rubin, 1999). By outlining the main aspects of the bereavement process into two interactive tracks, individuals can examine and understand how grief has affected their life following loss and begin to adapt to this post-loss life.The Model offers a better understanding with the duration of time in the wake of one's loss and the outcomes that evolve from death. By using this model, researchers can effectively examine the response to an individual's loss by assessing the behavioral-psychological functioning and the relationship with the deceased.\n<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/07481180802705668| pmid=19368062|title = The Two-Track Model of Bereavement Questionnaire (TTBQ): Development and Validation of a Relational Measure| journal=Death Studies| volume=33| issue=4| pages=305\u2013333|year = 2009|last1 = Rubin|first1 = Simon Shimshon| last2=Bar Nadav| first2=Ofri| last3=Malkinson| first3=Ruth| last4=Koren| first4=Dan| last5=Goffer-Shnarch| first5=Moran| last6=Michaeli| first6=Ella}}</ref>\n\nThe authors from ''[https://whatsyourgrief.com/rubin-two-track-model-of-bereavement/ Whats Your Grief?]'', Litza Williams and Eleanor Haley, state in their understanding of the clinical and therapeutic uses of the model:<blockquote>\u201cin terms of functioning, this model can help the bereaved identify which areas of his/her life has been impacted by the grief in a negative way as well as areas that the bereaved has already begun to adapt to after the loss.

Subjects of his studies number in the several thousand and include people who have suffered losses in the U.S. and cross-cultural studies in various countries around the world, such as Israel, [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], and China. His subjects suffered losses through war, [[terrorism]], deaths of children, premature deaths of spouses, [[sexual abuse]], childhood diagnoses of AIDS, and other potentially devastating loss events or potential trauma events.\n\nIn Bonanno's book, ''The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After a Loss'' ({{ISBN|978-0-465-01360-9}}), he summarizes his research.\nHis findings include that a natural resilience is the main component of grief and trauma reactions.<ref name=\"americanPsychologistpdf\"/>  The first researcher to use pre-loss data, he outlined four trajectories of grief.<ref name=\"americanPsychologistpdf\"/> Bonanno's work has also demonstrated that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome, rather than something to be feared as has been the thought and practice until his research.<ref name=\"SA_NTG\" /> Because grief responses can take many forms, including laughter, celebration, and bawdiness, in addition to sadness,<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giftofireland.com/Irishwakes.htm|title=The Irish Wake Tradition - Exploring Irish Wakes|publisher=|date=2012-02-13}}</ref> Bonanno coined the phrase \"coping ugly\" to describe the idea that some forms of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] may seem counter intuitive.<ref name=\"SA_NTG\" /> Bonanno has found that resilience is natural to humans, suggesting that it cannot be \"taught\" through specialized programs<ref name=\"SA_NTG\" /> and that there is virtually no existing research with which to design resilience training, nor is there existing research to support major investment in such things as military resilience training programs.<ref name=\"SA_NTG\" />\n\nThe four trajectories are as follows:\n\n* '''Resilience''': \"The ability of adults in otherwise normal circumstances who are exposed to an isolated and potentially highly disruptive event, such as the death of a close relation or a violent or life-threatening situation, to maintain relatively stable, healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning\" as well as \"the capacity for generative experiences and positive emotions.\"\n* '''Recovery''': When \"normal functioning temporarily gives way to threshold or sub-threshold [[psychopathology]] (e.g., symptoms of depression or [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]], or PTSD), usually for a period of at least several months, and then gradually returns to pre-event levels.\"\n* '''Chronic dysfunction''': Prolonged suffering and inability to function, usually lasting several years or longer.\n* '''Delayed grief or trauma''': When adjustment seems normal but then distress and symptoms increase months later. Researchers have not found evidence of [[delayed grief]], but delayed trauma appears to be a genuine phenomenon.\n\n=== Five stages theory ===\n{{Main|K\u00fcbler-Ross model}}\n\nThe [[K\u00fcbler-Ross model]], commonly known as the five stages of grief, is a theory first introduced by [[Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross]] in her 1969 book, ''On Death and Dying''.<ref>Broom, Sarah M. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html \"Milestones: Aug. 30, 2004\"], ''TIME'' website</ref> Based on the uncredited earlier work of John Bowlby and Colin Murray-Parkes, K\u00fcbler-Ross actually applied the stages to persons who were dying, not persons who were grieving.  Her studies involved her work with the terminally ill. The popular but empirically unsupported model describes in five distinct stages how people deal with their impending death.\n\nThe five stages are:\n\n# denial\n# anger\n# bargaining\n# depression\n# acceptance\n\nThe theory holds that the stages are a part of the framework that helps people learn to live without what they have lost.\n\nThe stages model, which came about in the 1960s, is a theory based on observation of people who are dying, not people who experienced the death of a loved one. This model found limited empirical support in a study by Maciejewski et al.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.297.7.716 |title=An Empirical Examination of the Stage Theory of Grief |year=2007 |last1=MacIejewski |first1=P.

The research of [[George Bonanno]], however, is acknowledged as debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer-reviewed studies show that the vast majority of people who have experienced a loss are resilient and that there are multiple trajectories following loss.\n\n== Physiological and neurological processes ==\n\n[[File:El Greco Piet\u00e0.jpg|thumb|\"[[Piet\u00e0]]\" by [[El Greco]], 1571\u20131576. Philadelphia Museum of Art]]\n\nStudies of [[fMRI]] scans of women from whom grief was elicited about the death of a mother or a sister in the past 5 years resulted in the conclusion that grief produced a local inflammation response as measured by salivary concentrations of [[pro-inflammatory cytokine]]s. These responses were correlated with activation in the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]]. This activation also correlated with the free recall of grief-related word stimuli. This suggests that grief can cause stress, and that this reaction is linked to the emotional processing parts of the [[frontal lobe]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.05.049 |title=When grief heats up: Pro-inflammatory cytokines predict regional brain activation |year=2009 |last1=O'Connor |first1=Mary-Frances |last2=Irwin |first2=Michael R. |last3=Wellisch |first3=David K. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=891\u20136 |pmid=19481155 |pmc=2760985}}</ref>  Activation of the anterior cingulate cortex and [[vagus nerve]] is similarly implicated in the experience of [[broken heart|heartbreak]] whether due to social rejection or bereavement.<!-- refs on linked article -->\n\nAmong those persons who have been bereaved within the previous three months of a given report, those who report many intrusive thoughts about the deceased show ventral [[amygdala]] and rostral [[anterior cingulate cortex]] hyperactivity to reminders of their loss. In the case of the amygdala, this links to their sadness intensity. In those individuals who avoid such thoughts, there is a related opposite type of pattern in which there is a decrease in the activation of the dorsal amygdala and the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]].\n\nIn those not so emotionally affected by reminders of their loss, studies of [[fMRI]] scans have been used to conclude that there is a high functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting that the former regulates activity in the latter. In those people who had greater intensity of sadness, there was a low functional connection between the rostal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting a lack of regulation of the former part of the brain upon the latter.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.01.019 |title=Neural Mechanisms of Grief Regulation |year=2009 |last1=Freed |first1=Peter J. |last2=Yanagihara |first2=Ted K. |last3=Hirsch |first3=Joy |last4=Mann |first4=J.

Several researchers have proposed functional explanations for grief, attempting to solve this puzzle. Sigmund Freud argued that grief is a process of libidinal reinvestment. The griever must, Freud argued, disinvest from the deceased, which is a painful process.<ref>Freud, S. (1957). Mourning and Melancholia. In J. Strachey (Ed. and Trans.), ''The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud'' (Vol. 14, pp. 152-170). London, England: Hogarth Press. (Original work published 1917)</ref> But this disinvestment allows the griever to use libidinal energies on other, possibly new attachments, so it provides a valuable function. John Archer, approaching grief from an attachment theory perspective, argued that grief is a byproduct of the human attachment system.<ref>Archer, J. (1999). ''The nature of grief: The evolution and psychology of reactions to loss''. London, England: Routledge.</ref>  Generally, a grief-type response is adaptive because it compels a social organism to search for a lost individual (e.g., a mother or a child). However, in the case of death, the response is maladaptive because the individual is not simply lost and the griever cannot reunite with the deceased. Grief, from this perspective, is a painful cost of the human capacity to form commitments.\n\nOther researchers such as Randolph Nesse have proposed that grief is a kind of psychological pain that orients the sufferer to a new existence without the deceased and creates a painful but instructive memory.<ref>Nesse, R. M. (2005). An evolutionary framework for understanding grief. In D. Carr, R. M. Nesse, & C. B. Wortman (Eds.), ''Late life widowhood in the United States: Spousal bereavement in late life'' (pp. 195-226). New York, New York: Springer.</ref> If, for example, leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole led to the offspring's death, grief creates an intensively painful memory of the event, dissuading a parent from ever again leaving an offspring alone at a watering hole.  More recently, [[Bo Winegard]] and colleagues argued that grief might be a socially selected signal of an individual's propensity for forming strong, committed relationships.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Winegard B.

That is, because grief signals a person's capacity to form strong and faithful social bonds, those who displayed prolonged grief responses were preferentially chosen by alliance partners. The authors argue that throughout human evolution, grief was therefore shaped and elaborated by the social decisions of selective alliance partners.\n\n== Risks ==\n\nBereavement, while a normal part of life, carries a degree of risk when severe. Severe reactions affect approximately 10% to 15% of people.<ref name=\"americanPsychologistpdf\"/> Severe reactions mainly occur in people with depression present before the loss event.<ref name=\"americanPsychologistpdf\"/> Severe grief reactions may carry over into family relations. Some researchers have found an increased risk of marital breakup following the death of a child, for example. Others have found no increase. John James, author of the Grief Recovery Handbook and founder of the Grief Recovery Institute, reported that his marriage broke up after the death of his infant son.\n\nMany studies have looked at the bereaved in terms of increased risks for stress-related illnesses. [[Colin Murray Parkes]] in the 1960s and 1970s in England noted increased doctor visits, with symptoms such as abdominal pain, breathing difficulties, and so forth in the first six months following a death. Others have noted increased mortality rates (Ward, A.W. 1976) and Bunch et al. found a five times greater risk of [[suicide]] in teens following the death of a parent.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00578368 |title=Suicide following bereavement of parents |year=1971 |last1=Bunch |first1=J. |last2=Barraclough |first2=B. |last3=Nelson |first3=B. |last4=Sainsbury |first4=P. |journal=Social Psychiatry |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=193}}</ref>\n\n=== Complicated grief ===\n\n[[Prolonged grief disorder|Prolonged grief disorder (PGD)]], formerly known as [[Complicated grief disorder|complicated grief disorder (CGD)]], is a pathological reaction to loss representing a cluster of empirically derived symptoms that have been associated with long-term physical and psycho-social dysfunction.

A factor is the manner in which the spouse died.  The survivor of a spouse who died of an illness has a different experience of such loss than a survivor of a spouse who died by an act of violence.  Often, the spouse who is \"left behind\" may suffer from depression and loneliness, and may feel it necessary to seek professional help in dealing with their new life.\n\nFurthermore, most couples have a division of 'tasks' or 'labor', e.g., the husband mows the yard, the wife pays the bills, etc. which, in addition to dealing with great grief and life changes, means added responsibilities for the bereaved. Planning and financing a funeral can be very difficult if pre-planning was not completed.  Changes in insurance, bank accounts, claiming of life insurance, securing childcare can also be intimidating to someone who is grieving.  Social isolation may also become imminent, as many groups composed of couples find it difficult to adjust to the new identity of the bereaved, and the bereaved themselves have great challenges in reconnecting with others. Widows of many cultures, for instance, wear black for the rest of their lives to signify the loss of their spouse and their grief. Only in more recent decades has this tradition been reduced to a period of two years, while some religions such as Christian Orthodox many widows will still continue to wear black for the remainder of their lives.<ref>See Gerald Rochelle, Goodbye: grief from beginning to end, Cambridge House, 2013.</ref>\n\n=== Death of a parent ===\n\nFor a child, the death of a parent, without support to manage the effects of the grief, may result in long-term psychological harm. This is more likely if the adult carers are struggling with their own grief and are psychologically unavailable to the child. There is a critical role of the surviving parent or caregiver in helping the children adapt to a parent's death. However, losing a parent at a young age also has some positive effects. Some children had an increased maturity, better coping skills and improved communication. Adolescents who lost a parent valued other people more than those who have not experienced such a close loss.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=J|author2=Lloyd-Williams, M|title=Perspectives on the impact of early parent loss in adulthood in the UK: narratives provide the way forward|journal=European Journal of Cancer Care|volume=17|issue=4|date=July 2008|pages=317\u2013318|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2354.2008.00963.x|pmid=18638179}}</ref>\n\nWhen an adult child loses a parent in later adulthood, it is considered to be \"timely\" and to be a normative life course event. This allows the adult children to feel a permitted level of grief. However, research shows that the death of a parent in an adult's midlife is not a normative event by any measure, but is a major life transition causing an evaluation of one's own life or mortality. Others may shut out friends and family in processing the loss of someone with whom they have had the longest relationship.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=H|title=Midlife loss of parents: The Transition from Adult Child to Orphan|journal=Ageing International|year=2004|volume=29|issue=4|pages=351\u2013367|doi=10.1007/s12126-004-1004-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Death of a sibling ===\n\nGrieving siblings are often referred to as the 'forgotten mourners' who are made to feel as if their grief is not as severe as their parents' grief (N.a., 2015).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.cancer.net/coping-with-cancer/managing-emotions/grief-and-loss/grieving-loss-sibling/1 | title=Grieving the Loss of a Sibling}}</ref> However, the sibling relationship tends to be the longest significant relationship of the lifespan and siblings who have been part of each other's lives since birth, such as twins, help form and sustain each other's identities; with the death of one sibling comes the loss of that part of the survivor's identity because \u201cyour identity is based on having them there.\u201d<ref>P.

A very young child, under one or two, may be found to have no reaction if a carer dies, but other children may be affected by the loss.\n\nAt a time when trust and dependency are formed, even mere separation can cause problems in well-being. This is especially true if the loss is around critical periods such as 8\u201312 months, when attachment and separation are at their height and even a brief separation from a parent or other caregiver can cause distress.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Mary D. Salter |last1=Ainsworth |first2=Silvia M. |last2=Bell |title=Attachment, Exploration, and Separation: Illustrated by the Behavior of One-Year-Olds in a Strange Situation |journal=Child Development |jstor=1127388 |pmid=5490680 |pages=49\u201367 |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1970 |doi=10.2307/1127388}}</ref>\n\nEven as a child grows older, death is still difficult to fathom and this affects how a child responds. For example, younger children see death more as a separation, and may believe death is curable or temporary. Reactions can manifest themselves in \"acting out\" behaviors, a return to earlier behaviors such as thumb sucking, clinging to a toy or angry behavior. Though they do not have the maturity to mourn as an adult, they feel the same intensity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} As children enter pre-teen and teen years, there is a more mature understanding.\n\nAdolescents may respond by [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquency]], or oppositely become \"over-achievers\".

However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a socio-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are acceptable and normal.<ref>Clute, M. (2010). Bereavement interventions for adults with intellectual disabilities: what works.

This can occur between bonded animals which are animals that attempt to survive together (i.e. a pack of wolves or mated prairie voles).\n\n=== Mammals ===\nMammals have demonstrated grief-like states, especially between a mother and her offspring. She will often stay close to her dead offspring for short periods of time and may investigate the reasons for the baby's non-response. For example, some [[deer]] will often sniff, poke, and look at its lifeless fawn before realising it is dead and leaving it to rejoin the herd shortly afterwards. Other animals, such as a [[lion]]ess, will pick up its cub in its mouth and place it somewhere else before abandoning it.\n\nWhen a baby [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] or [[gorilla]] dies, the mother will carry the body around for several days before it may finally be able to move on without it; this behavior has been observed in other [[primates]], as well. [[Jane Goodall]] has described chimpanzees as exhibiting mournful behavior toward the loss of a group member with silence and by showing more attention to it. And they will often continue grooming it and stay close to the carcass until the group must move on without it. Another notable example is [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], a gorilla who was taught [[sign language]], who expressed sadness and even described sadness about the death of her pet cat, All Ball.\n\n[[Elephant]]s, have shown unusual behavior upon encountering the remains of another deceased elephant. They will often investigate it by touching and grabbing it with their trunks and have the whole herd stand around it for long periods of time until they must leave it behind. It is unknown whether they are mourning over it and showing sympathy, or are just curious and investigating the dead body. Elephants are thought to be able to discern relatives even from their remains. An episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary [[Life on Earth (TV series)|Life on Earth]] shows this in detail \u2013 the elephants, upon finding a dead herd member, pause for several minutes at a time, and carefully touch and hold the dead creature's bones.\n\n=== Birds ===\nSome birds seem to lack the perception of grief or quickly accept it; [[Mallard]] hens, although shocked for a moment when losing one of their young to a predator, will soon return to doing what they were doing before the predator attacked. However, some other waterbirds, such as [[mute swan]]s are known to grieve for the loss of a partner or cygnet, and are known to engage in pining for days, weeks or even months at a time.<ref>[http://www.theswansanctuary.org.uk/faq.php Frequently Asked Questions about Swans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929170937/http://www.theswansanctuary.org.uk/faq.php |date=September 29, 2015 }}, The Swan Sanctuary</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/animals-grieve-just-as-people-do/|title=Animals grieve just as people do|last=Wedderburn|first=Pete|website=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref> Other species of swans such as the [[black swan]] have also been observed mourning the loss of a close relative.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/male-swan-holds-vigil-at-nest-after-teens-kill-his-mate.html|title=Male Swan Holds Vigil at Nest After Teens Kill His Mate|website=TreeHugger|language=en|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Monogamous animals ===\nAnother form of grief in animals is when an individual loses its mate; this can be especially brutal when the species is [[monogamous]]. So when a [[pair bonding]] species, such as a [[black-backed jackal]], loses its mate it can be very difficult for it to detach itself from its dead mate.\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Anomalous experiences]]\n* [[Anticipatory grief]]\n* [[Association for Death Education and Counseling]]\n* [[Coping (psychology)]]\n* [[Disenfranchised grief]]\n* [[Grief counseling]]\n* [[The Grief Recovery Institute]]\n* [[List of counseling topics]]\n* [[Major depressive disorder]]\n* [[Miscarriage and grief]]\n* [[Postponement of affect#Grief|Postponement of grief]]\n* [[Post traumatic stress disorder]]\n* [[Psychological trauma]]\n* [[Stress (biological)|Stress]]\n* [[Support group]]\n* [[Thanatosensitivity]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* {{cite journal |doi=10.1093/geront/gnr148 |pmid=22241808 |title=The Salience of Family Worldview in Mourning an Elderly Husband and Father |year=2012 |last1=Black |first1=H.

''American Dad!'' was originally intended to be [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s answer to the hordes of fans left behind from the original failure of MacFarlane's previous [[animation|animated]] venture.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" /> Just three short months after ''American Dad!''{{'}}s debut however, ''Family Guy'' was revived, leaving ''American Dad!'' with a formidable expectation: whether the series could distinguish itself from its counterpart and succeed on its own merits.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" /> Instead of taking over [[creative director|creative direction]] of the series, MacFarlane left the job largely in the hands of Barker and Weitzman so as to distinguish ''American Dad!''<ref name=\"doorly1\" />\n\nIn its early going, ''American Dad!'' brought in strong ratings but fought an uphill battle in gaining widespread acceptance and approval from viewers and critics alike.<ref name=\"autogenerated8\"/> The popularity of MacFarlane and his involvement with ''Family Guy'' have led to foregone conclusions and [[prejudice]]s against ''American Dad!'' as a [[ripoff#Overview|rip-off]] of the predecessor<ref name=\"autogenerated8\"/> and some critics had already written off ''American Dad!'' prior to its birth as nothing more than a pale imitation of ''Family Guy'' and MacFarlane's attempts to get his old show back on the air.<ref name=\"avclub7\" /> One example, prior to the ''American Dad!'' series debut, a writer of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a piece that reads \"But those same executives have also given MacFarlane a whole new animated half-hour to play with in the disappointing ''American Dad!''

This was to the extent that ''American Dad!'' was completely secondary to him, and he did not understand the show. Because he was not getting the show at the time, he was described as \"just going along for the ride\". Likewise, the rest of the show's creators Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman were also trying to figure out the show and where it was going.<ref name=\"avclub7\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated8\"/> [[File:Seth MacFarlane at Fox Fall Eco-Casino Party - 8 September 2008 crop.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Co-creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]]]\n\nAfter ''American Dad!''{{'}}s initial couple of seasons and as it progressed, the show began to increasingly develop its very own distinct approach and identity, becoming more and more distinguished from all other programs on the air. Standing out from its counterparts increasingly with each passing season, the series has been described as eventually becoming the weirdest show in network [[prime time]]. It has been characterized as serving up distinguishing blasts of surrealism.<ref name=\"avclub7\" /> As the series progressed, MacFarlane realized that Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman were on to something uniquely appealing; moreover, he realized they were on to something that sharply contrasted from ''Family Guy'', which audiences appreciated.<ref name=\"avclub7\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated8\"/>\n\nAfter the show's first several seasons, MacFarlane not only came to fully understand and appreciate ''American Dad!''{{'}}s value but also came to consider himself a huge fan of the series. Taking note of his [[Twitter]] followers increased [[fanaticism]] and excitement over ''American Dad!'' and the \"Roger\" character, MacFarlane began putting considerable amounts of his time and efforts into the series, more so in the last several seasons than ever before (this observation made in fall 2012).<ref name=\"avclub7\" /> In describing ''American Dad!'' comedy styles, Barker noted that it is not as reference-laden as ''Family Guy'' or ''[[South Park]]''. He added that ''American Dad!''{{'}}s humor more frequently derives from \"the human condition and emotions that everyone can relate to: ego, the feds, etc. And for that reason, I think our humor is a little more [[evergreen#Metaphorical use|evergreen]].\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Mushy |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-mike-barker-and-matt-weitzman-talk-american-dad/lists |title=EXCLUSIVE: Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman Talk American Dad |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Developing plot lines and scripts===\nOn developing scripts for ''American Dad!'' episodes, co-creator [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]] revealed that he and the rest of the show's staff never know when and from where plot line ideas will emerge. \"Just as an example,\" Barker explained, \"[[American Dad! (season 2)|All About Steve]]\" is an episode where Stan wants his son to be more of a jock and more like he was when he was his age. That whole episode came about from one of our writers Dave Hemingson coming into our office, telling us he just visited the dentist and he may need to get braces. And the idea of a grown man with braces appealed to us, and we just decided what if we put Stan in braces, and he understands for the first time what it's like to feel like a geek.\"<ref name=\"movieweb1\">{{cite web|author=Mushy |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-mike-barker-and-matt-weitzman-talk-american-dad |title=EXCLUSIVE: Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman Talk American Dad |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[American Dad! (season 9)|2012\u201313 season]], Barker revealed that much of his [[wikt: inspiration|inspiration]] for ''American Dad!'' plots has come through listening to music. Barker's revelation to use music as a muse for his ''American Dad!'' writing came from attending the 2008 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival]]. During that event, he watched the [[rock band]] [[My Morning Jacket]] perform a four-hour set in the rain and realized from the experience that he could generate ideas for ''American Dad!'' by tapping into music: \"From that point on, I realized that music should be playing a bigger role in my writing\", Barker told the ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier-Journal]]''. \"Writing is hard for me, and when you hear music that inspires good ideas, you're really grateful.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/the-new-now/150th-episode-american-dad-inspired-indie-rockers-wax-163730696.html |title=150th Episode of 'American Dad' Inspired by Indie Rockers Wax Fang &#124; The New Now (NEW) \u2013 Yahoo!

Said Barker, \"There's just something so inherently [[filmmaking|cinematic]] about Wax Fang's music. [Scott] Carney's voice is stunningly clear and dramatic. And his lyrics are specific enough to build stories around while staying flexible enough for different [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretations]].\" Barker added that through listening to the Wax Fang track ''Majestic'', he was able to come up with major plot elements for the episode \"[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]\" (this episode features the Wax Fang songs ''Majestic'' and ''At Sea'').<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/05/01/american-dad-wax-fang/2126243/ |title=Exclusive: Rockers Wax Fang inspire 'American Dad' |work=USA Today |date=May 1, 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBarker has stated that once he and the rest of the show's staff get the idea for the [[plot (narrative)|plot line]], they spend a couple of weeks in a room with all the [[screenwriter]]s. There, they break the story and make sure that each act of the two [[act structure|act breaks]] are strong. As another procedure, Barker stated that they make a point of twisting the story in such a way so as to make audiences come back for more after the commercial break.<ref name=\"movieweb1\" />\n\n\"The final process,\" Barker explained, \"is sending a screenwriter out to write the script. The screenwriter gets two weeks to write the script. The script then comes back.\" Barker explained that they then all edit and rewrite it, \"hopefully keeping as much of the first draft as we can and punching the jokes and making sure all the motivations are there, and then we take it to the table and read it.\"<ref name=\"movieweb1\" />\n\nIn February 2005, Barker stated that as creative directors, all decisions made about the plot line and direction of the series go through himself and Weitzman. He explained that the show had reflected their point of view since the beginning. Barker has also credited the program's other staff beyond himself, Weitzman, and MacFarlane, remarking \"We couldn't have made it all happen without them.\" At the time, it was noted that the series had a staff of 17 writers, which was described as \"a big undertaking\".<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite web|author=AWN |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/people/iamerican-dadi-touchdown/page/2%2C1 |title=American Dad Touchdown &#124; AWN &#124; Animation World Network |publisher=AWN |date=February 4, 2005 |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen Barker was asked what his favorite part was of the ''American Dad!'' pre-production process, he answered, \"I like the story breaking process, personally\u2014coming up with the stories. To me, that's the most gratifying.\"<ref name=\"movieweb1\" />\n\nBarker and Matt Weitzman have stated that they are accustomed to feeling scruples with adding certain material into the plots, but always follow this up by going ahead with incorporating the material anyway. They added that their goal is to create laughs combined with groans and going over the line.<ref name=\"youtube1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AHzYxnmAA8 |title='American Dad' Producers Talk Season Premiere |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Animated scenes===\nMacFarlane played a lead role in the animated character designs for ''American Dad!''.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nIn describing the characters' appearances, Weitzman remarked \"It's all very bright, very easy on the eyes.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated3a\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated3b\" />\n\nIn explaining the animated side of the job, Barker stated, \"Fifty or so animators from the Fox animation group are involved. A lot is done in-house: poses, models, props, all storyboards and timing.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nAlso as reported in February 2005, animation for ''American Dad!'' is colored and detailed overseas. [[Sunwoo Entertainment]] of Korea was said to handle that end of the pre-production process.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\n===Editing, completion, and deadlines===\nBarker has explained that because ''American Dad!'' creators are working in [[animation]] as opposed to [[live action]], they have the ability to redraw and rewrite up until the show is aired.\n\nHowever, Barker has also stated, \"It's really hard to accept anything less than perfect when you start to get wrapped up in this process of being able to constantly make changes. Eventually you have to kind of bring down the hammer at the color stage and live with what you've got.\"\n\nBarker has explained that, ultimately, the creation process of an ''American Dad!'' episode is completed upon the producers' say-so, not anyone else's.<ref name=\"movieweb1\" />\n\nWhen ''American Dad!'' co-creator Matt Weitzman was asked what his favorite part was of the show's pre-production process, he answered, \"I probably enjoy the [[film editing|editing]] process a lot. I think I like the fine tuning of things and making things happen just so. Making the episode just kind of pop in its own subtle ways.\"<ref name=\"movieweb1\" />\n\n''American Dad!'' creators have revealed to working significantly in advance of newly broadcast episodes. As many as 20 to 42 unaired episodes are typically ready for finishing touches. Barker explained that a key to this system is making sure that the writing is timeless, as opposed to topical and contemporary. He added that if any material within the script deals with contemporary issues, the creators have to hope that they're also contemporary issues two years down the line. When asked whether or not this method has ever brought on difficulties, Barker answered in the affirmative and explained:\n\n::[[Harriet Miers]] was, like, the [[White House Press Secretary]], I think, and we had a joke about her. (Miers was a former [[White House Counsel]], who was briefly nominated for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] by President [[George W. Bush]].) And I remember watching on air and having to [[Google]] who our own joke was, because it had been so long since the joke was pitched. But in terms of stories, we're less likely to be burned by a current-event issue no longer being current.<ref name=\"avclub7\" />\n\nIn discussing the creation of ''American Dad!'' and animated sitcoms in general, MacFarlane has stated:\n\n::It's an enormous amount of work. What goes into putting together an animated show, it's just staggering&nbsp;... I always knew there was a lot of work that went into making an animated show. Doing a traditional [[sitcom]], process-wise it feels like a breeze compared to doing an animated show. You can get it all done in a couple of months as opposed to a year. Doing an animated show, it's like putting together a little [[film|movie]] every week. Everything is [[storyboard]]ed with the intricacy of a [[feature film]] action sequence. You have to edit with a [[sheet music|musical score]] in mind. And of course, we use an [[orchestra]] for each episode. So it's really like putting together a little feature each week and I was just shocked at how much\u2014not to underplay all the work that goes into live-action sitcoms\u2014but my God, it's definitely a much more difficult medium to me.<ref name=\"doorly1\" />\n\nConversely, Barker has stated:\n\n::Working on animated shows like ''American Dad!'' is such a breath of fresh air. You don't have to worry about sets and such that you have to worry about for live-action. Animation can give you more freedom.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\n===Setting===\nThe Smith family and their two housemates reside on Cherry Street in the fictional [[suburb]] of Langley Falls, Virginia.<ref name=\"yahoo1\">{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/american-dad-gets-another-22-episodes-412027.html?cat=2 |title=American Dad Gets Another 22 Episodes \u2013 Yahoo!

This arises when the show's focus becomes sidetracked by entirely unknown and unrelated characters in circumstances that are irrelevant to the episode's main plot. Typically when this happens, it is after the show has maintained focus on its main characters for much of the episode; following this, the scenes randomly lose focus and become deeply wrapped up into the lives of never-before-seen characters who are non-central to the plot. A prime example of this is in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 1)|Homeland Insecurity]]\". As opposed to scenes focusing on main characters, attention is redirected deep into the lives of unknown characters who gain possession of Roger's transforming [[feces]] turned [[gold]] - this storyline of the dramas resulting from \u201cThe Golden Turd\u201d continues in later episodes. As another example, in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 9)|The Missing Kink]]\", the show's focus is sporadically sidetracked with brief scenes revolving around the life of a [[drug abuse|drug abusing]] bird and Francine's inexplicable ability to both understand and communicate with the bird's chirping.<ref name=\"avclub5\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lynnpatt.com/watch-american-dad-the-wrestler-season-7-episode-12.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927171615/http://lynnpatt.com/watch-american-dad-the-wrestler-season-7-episode-12.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 27, 2013 |title=Watch American Dad! \u2013 The Wrestler Season 7 Episode 12 \u2013 Online Business Blog &#124; Online Business Blog |publisher=Lynnpatt.com |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=April 1, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Plot twists and unexpected elements===\nThe series has abounded with random, unexpected occurrences and surprise [[plot twist]]s as result of the characters and the very makeup of the program.<ref name=\"avclub6\">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/the-full-cognitive-redaction-of-avery-bullock-by-t,96582/ |title=\"The Full Cognitive Redaction Of Avery Bullock By The Coward Stan Smith\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V.

(season 9)|The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith]]\", Steve refers to Roger for help in dealing with a school bully. Because Steve is able to correctly predict Roger's original game plan of handling the situation himself under an alter ego, Roger [[wikt: throw somebody a curve|throws him a curveball]]: he not only hires someone else, Stelio Kontos (from the episode \"[[Bully for Steve]]\"), to handle the matter but hires him to bully Steve in combination with Steve's original bully. As another example, in the episode \"[[The Vacation Goo]]\", Francine becomes frustrated that she cannot get the family together for Sunday night dinner. For family time, Stan suggests a vacation, and the Smiths have a great time in [[Maui]] as a family. This is up until Roger shuts down the mechanism Francine and the kids are all attached to so as to believe they are all on vacation. Francine and the kids then learn that Stan has been programming a pseudo-vacation every year in a contraption dubbed \"the goo chambers\". After learning of this, Francine demands they go on a real vacation. Twice they appear to do so, first [[skiing]], then to [[Italy]], until it is ultimately revealed that they are in the \"goo chambers\" all along, with Steve and then Hayley having programmed the vacations, respectively. In the episode \"[[Spelling Bee My Baby]]\", Steve deliberately misspells his words in a [[spelling bee]] so as to express his love for [[Barry Robinson (American Dad!)|Akiko]] (who is also competing), instead spelling random [[Tyler Perry]]/[[Madea (Mabel Simmons)|Madea]] films.<ref name=\"avclub6\" />\n\n===Story arc use===\nAnother technique used by ''American Dad!'' is the [[story arc]]. On several occasions, a circumstance expands and progresses across a collection of episodes.<ref name=\"avclub4\" /><ref name=autogenerated3b>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/spelling-bee-my-baby,93604/ |title=\"Spelling Bee My Baby\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref> As an example, one of Hayley's temporary breakups with Jeff expanded across a string of episodes, in which she instead temporarily dated a black man in a [[koala]] body, [[Reginald the Koala|Reginald Koala]]\u2014known for his very [[urban culture|urban]] mannerisms and behaviors. As another example, since the [[American Dad! (season 9)|9th season]] episode \"[[List of American Dad! episodes#Season 9: 2012\u201313|Naked to the Limit, One More Time]]\", Jeff Fischer has been absent from the Smith house and planet Earth altogether. In that episode, Jeff is [[wikt: blindside|blindsided]] when Roger hurls him into a spaceship. This spacecraft belongs to Roger's race of aliens and was intended to return him back to his birth planet; however, Roger remains behind after casting Jeff into the spaceship. The spaceship immediately takes off and Jeff is not seen until several episodes later, the episode \"[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]\". During episodes that aired between the two aforementioned episodes, allusions to the ongoing plot line are made. For example, in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 9)|Spelling Bee My Baby]]\", Hayley is shown holding out hope for Jeff's return. In the episode, Roger and Stan attempt to rush Hayley through her [[grieving process]] so she will be willing to be their [[Official (tennis)|tennis official]].<ref name=\"avclub4\" /><ref name=\"avclub1\">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/finger-lenting-good,90011/ |title=\"Finger Lenting Good\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=January 7, 2013 |accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref> In the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 10)#ep172|The Longest Distance Relationship]]\" Jeff gets in touch with Hayley via a radio and ultimately tells her not to wait for him and to move on with her life. This story arc is finally resolved in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 12)#ep188|Holy Shit, Jeff's Back!]]\", Jeff supposedly returns to Earth but it turns out to be an alien called Zebleer masquerading as Jeff and the real Jeff has been dissected, however Jeff's brain is transplanted into Zebleer's body allowing the real Jeff to live, after which Stan and Hayley's memories are wiped, leaving them unaware that Jeff is no longer entirely human. This plot point is continued at the end of \"[[American Dad! (season 14)#ep217|Bahama Mama]]\", where Roger mentions Jeff cannot get Hayley pregnant because he has an alien body, so he agrees to rebirth Jeff in \"[[American Dad! (season 14)#ep218|Roger's Baby]]\". By the end of the episode, Jeff is human again and with Hayley on Earth.\n\nIn discussing the cartoon's distinguishing story arc element, co-creator Mike Barker explained:\n\n::We just try to obey basic rules of continuity. We try to avoid stories where a character is taking a big step like marriage and then not going back to it. I think by doing that, then in the future when we have big changes, the audience knows that they're going to be living with those changes for a while. So it's not just a thrown-away bit. It kind of endows that story beat with more power because it's going to last. It's not just going to be a [[Reset button technique|reset button]].<ref name=\"avclub7\" />\n\n===Black comedy===\nMuch of the wit used in ''American Dad!'' has come in the form of [[black comedy]] as many of the predicaments and circumstances have made fun of the characters in life-threatening, disastrous, terrifying, and traumatic situations.<ref name=\"avclub2\">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/why-cant-we-be-friends,89173/ |title=\"Why Can't We Be Friends?\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref> As an example, the episode \"[[A Ward Show]]\" is chock full of [[suicide]] and [[murder]]: Roger became Steve's [[legal guardian]] and responded to him getting picked on at school by rigging the teachers' cars with [[explosive material|explosives]] and killing them all. Later on in the episode while [[Barry Robinson (American Dad!)|Principal Lewis]] was driving his vehicle with Steve as the passenger, he informed Steve that he was about to drive off the [[Grand Canyon]] in a [[murder-suicide]]. This culminated in Roger saving the day, his love supernaturally allowing the car to fly once Principal Lewis drove off the Canyon; however, another vehicle with a random white man and a black boy in it (opposite of Principal Lewis, a black man and Steve, a white boy) had also, coincidentally enough, driven off the opposite side of the Grand Canyon in a murder-suicide attempt. This resulted in a [[mid-air collision|midair collision]] between the car with Principal Lewis and Steve in it and the car with the white man and black boy in it.<ref name=\"avclub2\" /> Another example, in the episode \"[[Da Flippity Flop]]\", Roger leaves a long series of [[harassment|harassing]] [[answering machine]] messages for Steve, trying to get him to sign up for his gym. In these messages, Roger is also heard snapping on various people, killing three individuals from [[reckless driving]], landing himself in [[court]], and subsequently becoming irate and shooting up numerous people at the city courthouse for being scolded to turn off his [[mobile phone]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/da-flippity-flop,97154/ |title=\"Da Flippity Flop\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V.

The actual pilot is a 6-minute version of the first 6 minutes in the series premiere. This precursory pilot was used by MacFarlane, Barker and Weitzman to sell ''American Dad!'' to Fox and was never aired along with the rest of the series. While much of the [[dialogue]] and general [[scenery]] were simply redone between the precursory pilot and the following series premiere, there are sharp distinctions between the two. Differences also exist between the precursory pilot and the official series as a whole. Most of these are in [[image|pictorial]] technique. For example, scenes from the pilot are drawn in a rougher, more cursory fashion with weaker coloration than scenes from the official series. Most prominently, Steve's physical design and outfit in the predecessor greatly contrast from his official design and outfit. In addition, Steve is voiced by Ricky Blitt in the precursory pilot but by Scott Grimes in the official series. There are also variations in Steve's personality.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L-VkAAAAMAAJ&dq=American+Dad+unaired+pilot&q=American+Dad+unaired+pilot |title=Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television \u2013 Thomas Riggs \u2013 Google Boeken |date= August 2007|accessdate=September 17, 2013|isbn=9780787690502|last1=Riggs |first1=Thomas }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/american-dad/unaired-pilot-presentation-1125249/ |title=American Dad! \u2013 Season 1, Episode 0: Unaired Pilot Presentation |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Characterization===\nEarly episodes of the series featured political banter between the conservative Stan and liberal Hayley. However, the creators learned quickly that this had only \"a limited shelf life\" and did not provide them as much as they originally thought it would. Said co-creator Matt Weitzman, \"There are times when we still have that kind of dynamic between them, but not nearly what it was in the first season. And I think the show, honestly, has grown and benefited from it, because that would have gotten boring after a while.\"<ref name=\"avclub7\" />\n\nRoger was enhanced by being provided with a [[running gag]] of alternate disguises and freedom to exist outside of the Smith house. The show's original concept basically portrayed him as being similar to [[ALF (TV series)#ALF|ALF]], having him sit in the house all day while commenting on life. The creators, however, have stated that the character was far too much fun to keep restricted to the house, and having him interact with different people provided for lots of material. The creators have further appreciated the direction of Roger for the fact that he almost serves as a different [[guest appearance|guest star]] for each episode what with [[Roger (American Dad!)#Disguises and alter egos|his many alter egos]]. The show's staff believe this element of the show highlights MacFarlane's versatility as he voices Roger and his countless alter egos.<ref name=\"avclub7\" />\n\nThere have been three versions of the \"Steve\" character, the creators having twice made considerable adjustments to his design. Steve's initial design ended up being a one-off execution limited to the unaired precursory pilot (not to be confused with the series premiere, entitled \"Pilot\"). By the season premiere, [[Scott Grimes]] had begun voicing Steve, and his design was made taller, more filled out, and less geeky. After early seasons of the series, Steve was remodeled again. This time he was made softer, more emotional, cuter and more endearing, creating a sharper contrast to his father Stan's ruggedness and machismo.<ref>{{cite web|author=Animation |url=http://tv-facts.net/movie-review/american-dad/ |title=American Dad! |publisher=TV Facts |date=March 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923001639/http://tv-facts.net/movie-review/american-dad/ |archivedate=September 23, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBetween the eighth and ninth seasons there were significant changes in the show's writing staff.

(season 6)|Home Adrone]]\", \"[[My Morning Straitjacket]]\", and \"[[G-String Circus]]\" are not removed.\n* Volume 9 features all episodes from Season 9, but features the poster from Season 10's \"Poltergasm\".\n\n===Potential film adaptation===\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con 2013]] on July 20, Mike Barker revealed that an ''American Dad!'' movie\u2014centering on Roger and set on his birth planet\u2014may take place in the future. Barker did not announce any specifics as it relates to the nature and type of film he and the rest of the show's creators had in mind for the series; however, he strongly suggested that a movie is where the show's staff and creators would like to take things. Barker further hinted that an ''American Dad!'' movie may already even be in the works and partially written. No further information about the movie was released following Barker's exit from the series in November 2013.<ref name=\"zap2it1\" />\n\n===Crossovers with other animated sitcoms===\n''American Dad!'' characters have appeared on other animated sitcoms and vice versa. To date, all of ''American Dad!''{{'}}s [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]] have involved two other animated programs. The other two animated programs were also created by [[Seth MacFarlane]]: ''[[Family Guy]] ''(the crossover episode \"[[Bigfat]]\" also consisted of ''[[King of the Hill]]'' characters), and the cancelled series ''[[The Cleveland Show]].''\n\nOn December 8, 2013, [[Bart Simpson]] made a cameo appearance in the ''American Dad!'' season 10 episode, \"Faking Bad\". Though unofficial, this marked the first ever ''Simpsons/American Dad!'' crossover.<ref>{{cite

Because he was not getting the show at the time, he was described as \"just going along for the ride\". Likewise, the rest of the show's creators Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman were also trying to figure out the show and where it was going.<ref name=\"avclub7\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated8\"/> [[File:Seth MacFarlane at Fox Fall Eco-Casino Party - 8 September 2008 crop.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Co-creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]]]\n\nAfter ''American Dad!''{{'}}s initial couple of seasons and as it progressed, the show began to increasingly develop its very own distinct approach and identity, becoming more and more distinguished from all other programs on the air. Standing out from its counterparts increasingly with each passing season, the series has been described as eventually becoming the weirdest show in network [[prime time]]. It has been characterized as serving up distinguishing blasts of surrealism.<ref name=\"avclub7\" /> As the series progressed, MacFarlane realized that Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman were on to something uniquely appealing; moreover, he realized they were on to something that sharply contrasted from ''Family Guy'', which audiences appreciated.<ref name=\"avclub7\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated8\"/>\n\nAfter the show's first several seasons, MacFarlane not only came to fully understand and appreciate ''American Dad!''{{'}}s value but also came to consider himself a huge fan of the series. Taking note of his [[Twitter]] followers increased [[fanaticism]] and excitement over ''American Dad!'' and the \"Roger\" character, MacFarlane began putting considerable amounts of his time and efforts into the series, more so in the last several seasons than ever before (this observation made in fall 2012).<ref name=\"avclub7\" /> In describing ''American Dad!'' comedy styles, Barker noted that it is not as reference-laden as ''Family Guy'' or ''[[South Park]]''. He added that ''American Dad!''{{'}}s humor more frequently derives from \"the human condition and emotions that everyone can relate to: ego, the feds, etc. And for that reason, I think our humor is a little more [[evergreen#Metaphorical use|evergreen]].\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Mushy |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-mike-barker-and-matt-weitzman-talk-american-dad/lists |title=EXCLUSIVE: Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman Talk American Dad |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Developing plot lines and scripts===\nOn developing scripts for ''American Dad!'' episodes, co-creator [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]] revealed that he and the rest of the show's staff never know when and from where plot line ideas will emerge. \"Just as an example,\" Barker explained, \"[[American Dad! (season 2)|All About Steve]]\" is an episode where Stan wants his son to be more of a jock and more like he was when he was his age. That whole episode came about from one of our writers Dave Hemingson coming into our office, telling us he just visited the dentist and he may need to get braces. And the idea of a grown man with braces appealed to us, and we just decided what if we put Stan in braces, and he understands for the first time what it's like to feel like a geek.\"<ref name=\"movieweb1\">{{cite web|author=Mushy |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-mike-barker-and-matt-weitzman-talk-american-dad |title=EXCLUSIVE: Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman Talk American Dad |publisher=MovieWeb.com |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[American Dad! (season 9)|2012\u201313 season]], Barker revealed that much of his [[wikt: inspiration|inspiration]] for ''American Dad!'' plots has come through listening to music. Barker's revelation to use music as a muse for his ''American Dad!'' writing came from attending the 2008 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival]]. During that event, he watched the [[rock band]] [[My Morning Jacket]] perform a four-hour set in the rain and realized from the experience that he could generate ideas for ''American Dad!'' by tapping into music: \"From that point on, I realized that music should be playing a bigger role in my writing\", Barker told the ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier-Journal]]''. \"Writing is hard for me, and when you hear music that inspires good ideas, you're really grateful.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/the-new-now/150th-episode-american-dad-inspired-indie-rockers-wax-163730696.html |title=150th Episode of 'American Dad' Inspired by Indie Rockers Wax Fang &#124; The New Now (NEW) \u2013 Yahoo!

Said Barker, \"There's just something so inherently [[filmmaking|cinematic]] about Wax Fang's music. [Scott] Carney's voice is stunningly clear and dramatic. And his lyrics are specific enough to build stories around while staying flexible enough for different [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretations]].\" Barker added that through listening to the Wax Fang track ''Majestic'', he was able to come up with major plot elements for the episode \"[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]\" (this episode features the Wax Fang songs ''Majestic'' and ''At Sea'').<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/popcandy/2013/05/01/american-dad-wax-fang/2126243/ |title=Exclusive: Rockers Wax Fang inspire 'American Dad' |work=USA Today |date=May 1, 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBarker has stated that once he and the rest of the show's staff get the idea for the [[plot (narrative)|plot line]], they spend a couple of weeks in a room with all the [[screenwriter]]s. There, they break the story and make sure that each act of the two [[act structure|act breaks]] are strong. As another procedure, Barker stated that they make a point of twisting the story in such a way so as to make audiences come back for more after the commercial break.<ref name=\"movieweb1\" />\n\n\"The final process,\" Barker explained, \"is sending a screenwriter out to write the script. The screenwriter gets two weeks to write the script. The script then comes back.\" Barker explained that they then all edit and rewrite it, \"hopefully keeping as much of the first draft as we can and punching the jokes and making sure all the motivations are there, and then we take it to the table and read it.\"<ref name=\"movieweb1\" />\n\nIn February 2005, Barker stated that as creative directors, all decisions made about the plot line and direction of the series go through himself and Weitzman. He explained that the show had reflected their point of view since the beginning. Barker has also credited the program's other staff beyond himself, Weitzman, and MacFarlane, remarking \"We couldn't have made it all happen without them.\" At the time, it was noted that the series had a staff of 17 writers, which was described as \"a big undertaking\".<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite web|author=AWN |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/people/iamerican-dadi-touchdown/page/2%2C1 |title=American Dad Touchdown &#124; AWN &#124; Animation World Network |publisher=AWN |date=February 4, 2005 |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen Barker was asked what his favorite part was of the ''American Dad!'' pre-production process, he answered, \"I like the story breaking process, personally\u2014coming up with the stories. To me, that's the most gratifying.\"<ref name=\"movieweb1\" />\n\nBarker and Matt Weitzman have stated that they are accustomed to feeling scruples with adding certain material into the plots, but always follow this up by going ahead with incorporating the material anyway. They added that their goal is to create laughs combined with groans and going over the line.<ref name=\"youtube1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AHzYxnmAA8 |title='American Dad' Producers Talk Season Premiere |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Animated scenes===\nMacFarlane played a lead role in the animated character designs for ''American Dad!''.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nIn describing the characters' appearances, Weitzman remarked \"It's all very bright, very easy on the eyes.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated3a\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated3b\" />\n\nIn explaining the animated side of the job, Barker stated, \"Fifty or so animators from the Fox animation group are involved. A lot is done in-house: poses, models, props, all storyboards and timing.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nAlso as reported in February 2005, animation for ''American Dad!'' is colored and detailed overseas. [[Sunwoo Entertainment]] of Korea was said to handle that end of the pre-production process.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\n===Editing, completion, and deadlines===\nBarker has explained that because ''American Dad!'' creators are working in [[animation]] as opposed to [[live action]], they have the ability to redraw and rewrite up until the show is aired.\n\nHowever, Barker has also stated, \"It's really hard to accept anything less than perfect when you start to get wrapped up in this process of being able to constantly make changes. Eventually you have to kind of bring down the hammer at the color stage and live with what you've got.\"\n\nBarker has explained that, ultimately, the creation process of an ''American Dad!'' episode is completed upon the producers' say-so, not anyone else's.<ref name=\"movieweb1\" />\n\nWhen ''American Dad!'' co-creator Matt Weitzman was asked what his favorite part was of the show's pre-production process, he answered, \"I probably enjoy the [[film editing|editing]] process a lot. I think I like the fine tuning of things and making things happen just so. Making the episode just kind of pop in its own subtle ways.\"<ref name=\"movieweb1\" />\n\n''American Dad!'' creators have revealed to working significantly in advance of newly broadcast episodes. As many as 20 to 42 unaired episodes are typically ready for finishing touches. Barker explained that a key to this system is making sure that the writing is timeless, as opposed to topical and contemporary. He added that if any material within the script deals with contemporary issues, the creators have to hope that they're also contemporary issues two years down the line. When asked whether or not this method has ever brought on difficulties, Barker answered in the affirmative and explained:\n\n::[[Harriet Miers]] was, like, the [[White House Press Secretary]], I think, and we had a joke about her. (Miers was a former [[White House Counsel]], who was briefly nominated for the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] by President [[George W. Bush]].) And I remember watching on air and having to [[Google]] who our own joke was, because it had been so long since the joke was pitched. But in terms of stories, we're less likely to be burned by a current-event issue no longer being current.<ref name=\"avclub7\" />\n\nIn discussing the creation of ''American Dad!'' and animated sitcoms in general, MacFarlane has stated:\n\n::It's an enormous amount of work. What goes into putting together an animated show, it's just staggering&nbsp;... I always knew there was a lot of work that went into making an animated show. Doing a traditional [[sitcom]], process-wise it feels like a breeze compared to doing an animated show. You can get it all done in a couple of months as opposed to a year. Doing an animated show, it's like putting together a little [[film|movie]] every week. Everything is [[storyboard]]ed with the intricacy of a [[feature film]] action sequence. You have to edit with a [[sheet music|musical score]] in mind. And of course, we use an [[orchestra]] for each episode. So it's really like putting together a little feature each week and I was just shocked at how much\u2014not to underplay all the work that goes into live-action sitcoms\u2014but my God, it's definitely a much more difficult medium to me.<ref name=\"doorly1\" />\n\nConversely, Barker has stated:\n\n::Working on animated shows like ''American Dad!'' is such a breath of fresh air. You don't have to worry about sets and such that you have to worry about for live-action. Animation can give you more freedom.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\n===Setting===\nThe Smith family and their two housemates reside on Cherry Street in the fictional [[suburb]] of Langley Falls, Virginia.<ref name=\"yahoo1\">{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/american-dad-gets-another-22-episodes-412027.html?cat=2 |title=American Dad Gets Another 22 Episodes \u2013 Yahoo!

It gets to the point where they divide the house in two, each decorating their half of the house in their desired fashion. Not satisfied with this however, they both attempt to drive the other out of the home and eventually erect a colossal block wall, dividing the two halves of the house. The rest of the family members are forced to spend one holiday after the next alternating between Fran's and Stan's place (the sides of the house treated as distinct homes). As another example, in the episode \"[[Stan's Food Restaurant]]\", Stan asks for Roger's help in starting a restaurant. As things progress, Roger makes heavy changes in the layout, eventually kicking Stan out of the project. Stan retaliates by opening another restaurant next door, which becomes a smashing success.

Access to the control room is achieved through a handprint reading device that extends from the ground when Stan extends his arm/hand at it; etc.<ref name=\"avclub5\" /><ref name=\"putlockertvshows1\" />\n\n====Non sequitur====\nAmong one of the many forms of surreal humor and nonsense elements that have been used by ''American Dad!'' is the [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]. This arises when the show's focus becomes sidetracked by entirely unknown and unrelated characters in circumstances that are irrelevant to the episode's main plot. Typically when this happens, it is after the show has maintained focus on its main characters for much of the episode; following this, the scenes randomly lose focus and become deeply wrapped up into the lives of never-before-seen characters who are non-central to the plot. A prime example of this is in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 1)|Homeland Insecurity]]\". As opposed to scenes focusing on main characters, attention is redirected deep into the lives of unknown characters who gain possession of Roger's transforming [[feces]] turned [[gold]] - this storyline of the dramas resulting from \u201cThe Golden Turd\u201d continues in later episodes. As another example, in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 9)|The Missing Kink]]\", the show's focus is sporadically sidetracked with brief scenes revolving around the life of a [[drug abuse|drug abusing]] bird and Francine's inexplicable ability to both understand and communicate with the bird's chirping.<ref name=\"avclub5\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lynnpatt.com/watch-american-dad-the-wrestler-season-7-episode-12.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927171615/http://lynnpatt.com/watch-american-dad-the-wrestler-season-7-episode-12.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 27, 2013 |title=Watch American Dad! \u2013 The Wrestler Season 7 Episode 12 \u2013 Online Business Blog &#124; Online Business Blog |publisher=Lynnpatt.com |date=March 8, 2012 |accessdate=April 1, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Plot twists and unexpected elements===\nThe series has abounded with random, unexpected occurrences and surprise [[plot twist]]s as result of the characters and the very makeup of the program.<ref name=\"avclub6\">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/the-full-cognitive-redaction-of-avery-bullock-by-t,96582/ |title=\"The Full Cognitive Redaction Of Avery Bullock By The Coward Stan Smith\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V.

(season 9)|The Full Cognitive Redaction of Avery Bullock by the Coward Stan Smith]]\", Steve refers to Roger for help in dealing with a school bully. Because Steve is able to correctly predict Roger's original game plan of handling the situation himself under an alter ego, Roger [[wikt: throw somebody a curve|throws him a curveball]]: he not only hires someone else, Stelio Kontos (from the episode \"[[Bully for Steve]]\"), to handle the matter but hires him to bully Steve in combination with Steve's original bully. As another example, in the episode \"[[The Vacation Goo]]\", Francine becomes frustrated that she cannot get the family together for Sunday night dinner. For family time, Stan suggests a vacation, and the Smiths have a great time in [[Maui]] as a family. This is up until Roger shuts down the mechanism Francine and the kids are all attached to so as to believe they are all on vacation. Francine and the kids then learn that Stan has been programming a pseudo-vacation every year in a contraption dubbed \"the goo chambers\". After learning of this, Francine demands they go on a real vacation. Twice they appear to do so, first [[skiing]], then to [[Italy]], until it is ultimately revealed that they are in the \"goo chambers\" all along, with Steve and then Hayley having programmed the vacations, respectively. In the episode \"[[Spelling Bee My Baby]]\", Steve deliberately misspells his words in a [[spelling bee]] so as to express his love for [[Barry Robinson (American Dad!)|Akiko]] (who is also competing), instead spelling random [[Tyler Perry]]/[[Madea (Mabel Simmons)|Madea]] films.<ref name=\"avclub6\" />\n\n===Story arc use===\nAnother technique used by ''American Dad!'' is the [[story arc]]. On several occasions, a circumstance expands and progresses across a collection of episodes.<ref name=\"avclub4\" /><ref name=autogenerated3b>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/spelling-bee-my-baby,93604/ |title=\"Spelling Bee My Baby\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref> As an example, one of Hayley's temporary breakups with Jeff expanded across a string of episodes, in which she instead temporarily dated a black man in a [[koala]] body, [[Reginald the Koala|Reginald Koala]]\u2014known for his very [[urban culture|urban]] mannerisms and behaviors. As another example, since the [[American Dad! (season 9)|9th season]] episode \"[[List of American Dad! episodes#Season 9: 2012\u201313|Naked to the Limit, One More Time]]\", Jeff Fischer has been absent from the Smith house and planet Earth altogether. In that episode, Jeff is [[wikt: blindside|blindsided]] when Roger hurls him into a spaceship. This spacecraft belongs to Roger's race of aliens and was intended to return him back to his birth planet; however, Roger remains behind after casting Jeff into the spaceship. The spaceship immediately takes off and Jeff is not seen until several episodes later, the episode \"[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]\". During episodes that aired between the two aforementioned episodes, allusions to the ongoing plot line are made. For example, in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 9)|Spelling Bee My Baby]]\", Hayley is shown holding out hope for Jeff's return. In the episode, Roger and Stan attempt to rush Hayley through her [[grieving process]] so she will be willing to be their [[Official (tennis)|tennis official]].<ref name=\"avclub4\" /><ref name=\"avclub1\">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/finger-lenting-good,90011/ |title=\"Finger Lenting Good\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V.

(season 10)#ep172|The Longest Distance Relationship]]\" Jeff gets in touch with Hayley via a radio and ultimately tells her not to wait for him and to move on with her life. This story arc is finally resolved in the episode \"[[American Dad! (season 12)#ep188|Holy Shit, Jeff's Back!]]\", Jeff supposedly returns to Earth but it turns out to be an alien called Zebleer masquerading as Jeff and the real Jeff has been dissected, however Jeff's brain is transplanted into Zebleer's body allowing the real Jeff to live, after which Stan and Hayley's memories are wiped, leaving them unaware that Jeff is no longer entirely human. This plot point is continued at the end of \"[[American Dad! (season 14)#ep217|Bahama Mama]]\", where Roger mentions Jeff cannot get Hayley pregnant because he has an alien body, so he agrees to rebirth Jeff in \"[[American Dad! (season 14)#ep218|Roger's Baby]]\". By the end of the episode, Jeff is human again and with Hayley on Earth.\n\nIn discussing the cartoon's distinguishing story arc element, co-creator Mike Barker explained:\n\n::We just try to obey basic rules of continuity. We try to avoid stories where a character is taking a big step like marriage and then not going back to it. I think by doing that, then in the future when we have big changes, the audience knows that they're going to be living with those changes for a while. So it's not just a thrown-away bit. It kind of endows that story beat with more power because it's going to last. It's not just going to be a [[Reset button technique|reset button]].<ref name=\"avclub7\" />\n\n===Black comedy===\nMuch of the wit used in ''American Dad!'' has come in the form of [[black comedy]] as many of the predicaments and circumstances have made fun of the characters in life-threatening, disastrous, terrifying, and traumatic situations.<ref name=\"avclub2\">{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/why-cant-we-be-friends,89173/ |title=\"Why Can't We Be Friends?\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V.

Later on in the episode while [[Barry Robinson (American Dad!)|Principal Lewis]] was driving his vehicle with Steve as the passenger, he informed Steve that he was about to drive off the [[Grand Canyon]] in a [[murder-suicide]]. This culminated in Roger saving the day, his love supernaturally allowing the car to fly once Principal Lewis drove off the Canyon; however, another vehicle with a random white man and a black boy in it (opposite of Principal Lewis, a black man and Steve, a white boy) had also, coincidentally enough, driven off the opposite side of the Grand Canyon in a murder-suicide attempt. This resulted in a [[mid-air collision|midair collision]] between the car with Principal Lewis and Steve in it and the car with the white man and black boy in it.<ref name=\"avclub2\" /> Another example, in the episode \"[[Da Flippity Flop]]\", Roger leaves a long series of [[harassment|harassing]] [[answering machine]] messages for Steve, trying to get him to sign up for his gym. In these messages, Roger is also heard snapping on various people, killing three individuals from [[reckless driving]], landing himself in [[court]], and subsequently becoming irate and shooting up numerous people at the city courthouse for being scolded to turn off his [[mobile phone]].<ref>{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/da-flippity-flop,97154/ |title=\"Da Flippity Flop\" &#124; American Dad &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=The A.V.

The actual pilot is a 6-minute version of the first 6 minutes in the series premiere. This precursory pilot was used by MacFarlane, Barker and Weitzman to sell ''American Dad!'' to Fox and was never aired along with the rest of the series. While much of the [[dialogue]] and general [[scenery]] were simply redone between the precursory pilot and the following series premiere, there are sharp distinctions between the two. Differences also exist between the precursory pilot and the official series as a whole. Most of these are in [[image|pictorial]] technique. For example, scenes from the pilot are drawn in a rougher, more cursory fashion with weaker coloration than scenes from the official series. Most prominently, Steve's physical design and outfit in the predecessor greatly contrast from his official design and outfit. In addition, Steve is voiced by Ricky Blitt in the precursory pilot but by Scott Grimes in the official series. There are also variations in Steve's personality.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L-VkAAAAMAAJ&dq=American+Dad+unaired+pilot&q=American+Dad+unaired+pilot |title=Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television \u2013 Thomas Riggs \u2013 Google Boeken |date= August 2007|accessdate=September 17, 2013|isbn=9780787690502|last1=Riggs |first1=Thomas }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/american-dad/unaired-pilot-presentation-1125249/ |title=American Dad! \u2013 Season 1, Episode 0: Unaired Pilot Presentation |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Characterization===\nEarly episodes of the series featured political banter between the conservative Stan and liberal Hayley. However, the creators learned quickly that this had only \"a limited shelf life\" and did not provide them as much as they originally thought it would. Said co-creator Matt Weitzman, \"There are times when we still have that kind of dynamic between them, but not nearly what it was in the first season. And I think the show, honestly, has grown and benefited from it, because that would have gotten boring after a while.\"<ref name=\"avclub7\" />\n\nRoger was enhanced by being provided with a [[running gag]] of alternate disguises and freedom to exist outside of the Smith house. The show's original concept basically portrayed him as being similar to [[ALF (TV series)#ALF|ALF]], having him sit in the house all day while commenting on life. The creators, however, have stated that the character was far too much fun to keep restricted to the house, and having him interact with different people provided for lots of material. The creators have further appreciated the direction of Roger for the fact that he almost serves as a different [[guest appearance|guest star]] for each episode what with [[Roger (American Dad!)#Disguises and alter egos|his many alter egos]]. The show's staff believe this element of the show highlights MacFarlane's versatility as he voices Roger and his countless alter egos.<ref name=\"avclub7\" />\n\nThere have been three versions of the \"Steve\" character, the creators having twice made considerable adjustments to his design. Steve's initial design ended up being a one-off execution limited to the unaired precursory pilot (not to be confused with the series premiere, entitled \"Pilot\"). By the season premiere, [[Scott Grimes]] had begun voicing Steve, and his design was made taller, more filled out, and less geeky. After early seasons of the series, Steve was remodeled again. This time he was made softer, more emotional, cuter and more endearing, creating a sharper contrast to his father Stan's ruggedness and machismo.<ref>{{cite web|author=Animation |url=http://tv-facts.net/movie-review/american-dad/ |title=American Dad! |publisher=TV Facts |date=March 23, 2013 |accessdate=May 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923001639/http://tv-facts.net/movie-review/american-dad/ |archivedate=September 23, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBetween the eighth and ninth seasons there were significant changes in the show's writing staff.

(season 6)|Home Adrone]]\", \"[[My Morning Straitjacket]]\", and \"[[G-String Circus]]\" are not removed.\n* Volume 9 features all episodes from Season 9, but features the poster from Season 10's \"Poltergasm\".\n\n===Potential film adaptation===\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con 2013]] on July 20, Mike Barker revealed that an ''American Dad!'' movie\u2014centering on Roger and set on his birth planet\u2014may take place in the future. Barker did not announce any specifics as it relates to the nature and type of film he and the rest of the show's creators had in mind for the series; however, he strongly suggested that a movie is where the show's staff and creators would like to take things. Barker further hinted that an ''American Dad!'' movie may already even be in the works and partially written. No further information about the movie was released following Barker's exit from the series in November 2013.<ref name=\"zap2it1\" />\n\n===Crossovers with other animated sitcoms===\n''American Dad!'' characters have appeared on other animated sitcoms and vice versa. To date, all of ''American Dad!''{{'}}s [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]] have involved two other animated programs.

As a [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] [[defensive back]], he added 47 tackles and five [[interceptions]], and was also an excellent [[punter (football position)|punter]]. As a senior, he was named Parade All-American at quarterback and USA Today All-American at punter.\n\nHe finished second All-time in Michigan high school annals in passing yards (5,662) and touchdown passes (52). He also had the state's record in touchdowns passes for a single-season (26 in 1997) and a single-game (6). He averaged 45.7 yards-per-punt in his career.\n\nIn baseball, he was a four-time All-state selection. He finished as the national high school record holder in career home runs (70), RBIs (290) and runs scored (259). As a pitcher, he struck out 163 hitters in his junior season. He had a 14-1 record with a 0.86 ERA and 174 strikeouts in his senior season. He also was named the ''[[USA Today]]'' High School Player of the Year, Baseball America 1998  High School Player of the Year and the [[Gatorade]] High School Player of the Year.\n\n==College career==\nHenson, during the recruiting process, was originally planning to commit to [[Florida State University]], but decided against it when [[Chris Weinke]] decided to enroll at FSU after a brief stint in [[Minor League Baseball]].\n\nHenson instead accepted a football scholarship from the [[University of Michigan]]. As a freshman under head coach [[Lloyd Carr]], Henson battled for the starting quarterback job against [[Tom Brady]] and ultimately was named the backup for the [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998 season]]. He saw action in 8 games, accumulating 21 completions on 47 pass attempts, good for 254 yards, three touchdowns and one interception.<ref name=stats>{{cite web|url=http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/cmaster.php?pkey=32&sortby=s|title=Drew Henson|publisher=MGoBlue.com|accessdate=December 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310144510/http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/cmaster.php?pkey=32&sortby=s|archivedate=March 10, 2012}}</ref> He saw action in seven of Michigan's 13 games, including a win over #11 [[1998 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]] in the [[1999 Florida Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]].\n\nIn [[1999 Michigan Wolverines football team|1999]], Brady had to once again hold off Henson for the starting job. The two players platooned during the season's first seven games, with Brady playing the first quarter, Henson the second and Carr then deciding upon a quarterback for the second half. The team started off with a 5\u20130 record. Against [[1999 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]], Henson in the second quarter connected with [[Marcus Knight]] for the third longest passing play in school history (an 81-yard touchdown completion); so he was chosen to play in the second half; however, Brady was reinserted into the game in the fourth quarter with Michigan down by 17 points, and nearly led the team all the way back before losing 34\u201331.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mgoblue.com/news/1999/10/9/U_M_Win_Streak_Comes_to_End_at_Michigan_State_34_31.aspx?path=football |title=U-M Win Streak Comes to End at Michigan State, 34-31 - University of Michigan |website=University of Michigan Athletics |access-date=December 28, 2018}}</ref> After a 300-yard passing game the following week, Carr went exclusively with Brady for the remainder of the season.

He missed the first 3 contests after having surgery on his right foot just prior to the start of the season on August 24, with redshirt freshman [[John Navarre]] replacing him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Henson has foot surgery, will miss season opener|date=August 24, 2000|accessdate=December 7, 2018|url=https://mgoblue.com/news/2000/8/24/Henson_Has_Foot_Surgery_Will_Miss_Season_Opener.aspx}}</ref> Henson threw for a career-high 312 yards in a road defeat to #21 [[2000 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]], 54\u201351, but also tied a school record with four passing touchdowns. In the regular season finale, Henson led the #19 Wolverines to [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] to take on #12 [[2000 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] and threw again for over 300 yards en route to a 38\u201326 win. \nFor the third time in his career, Michigan and Henson faced a [[Southeastern Conference]] team when Michigan went on to play [[2000 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] in the [[2001 Florida Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]] and for the third time, Michigan again emerged victorious, winning 31\u201328. Henson recorded 294 yards passing on just 15 completions to go with two touchdowns and zero interceptions. Henson played in 9 out of 12 games, posting 146 completions in 237 attempts for 2,146 yards, along with 18 touchdowns and four interceptions.<ref name=stats/> His 159.4 passer rating was the fifth best in Michigan history and his 18 touchdown passes were the fourth most in a single-season in school history. He guided the team to a 9-3 record, a share of the Big Ten Conference title and a No. 11 ranking in the final [[Associated Press Poll]].\n\nHenson left prior to his senior season after signing a six-year, $17 million baseball-only deal with the [[New York Yankees]] on March 25, [[2001 Michigan Wolverines football team|2001]].

However, he struggled at the AAA level [[Columbus Clippers]]. He hit .234 over three seasons as the Clippers starting third baseman.

He was promoted to the backup position behind veteran [[Vinny Testaverde]] in the seventh game against the [[Detroit Lions]]. In the tenth game against the [[Baltimore Ravens]], he replaced an injured Testaverde in the fourth quarter, completing all of his 6 passes for 47 yards and one [[touchdown]]. On [[Thanksgiving Day]], Testaverde had previously missed practice and was limited with a sore right shoulder, so Henson was given the chance to start his first [[NFL]] game against the [[Chicago Bears]], making 4 out of 12 completions for 31 yards, driving the offense for a [[touchdown]] on the Cowboys first possession, but also had one interception that was returned 45 yards for a [[touchdown]] in the second quarter. With the score tied at 7, head coach [[Bill Parcells]] opted to insert Testaverde in the third quarter and the team went on to win the contest 21\u20137. Henson returned to third-string in the fifteenth game against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], finishing the season with 10 out of 18 completions for 78 yards, one [[touchdown]] and one interception.\n\nIn [[2005 NFL season|2005]], Henson had a poor training camp showing and landed third on the depth chart behind [[Drew Bledsoe]] and [[Tony Romo]]. He was declared inactive for all 16 games and at the end of the season, Parcells announced that Henson would be allocated to [[NFL Europe]] league to work on his skills.\n\nIn [[2006 NFL Europe season|2006]], he was assigned to the [[Rhein Fire]] of [[NFL Europe]], where he was named the starter at quarterback. Although he missed week 7 with a knee injury, he was the league's second rated signal caller (84.2 rating) behind [[Gibran Hamdan]], while finishing the season second in attempts (203), completions (109), passing yards (1,321), passing touchdowns (10) and second fewest interceptions (3).

He played [[college football]] at [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]].\n\nDuring his football career, Henson was a member of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], [[Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Detroit Lions]]. At the start of his baseball career, he was drafted by the [[New York Yankees]] in the third round of the [[1998 Major League Baseball Draft|1998 amateur draft]] and played for the organization during the 2002 and 2003 seasons until he retired from the sport in 2004.

As a [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]] [[defensive back]], he added 47 tackles and five [[interceptions]], and was also an excellent [[punter (football position)|punter]]. As a senior, he was named Parade All-American at quarterback and USA Today All-American at punter.\n\nHe finished second All-time in Michigan high school annals in passing yards (5,662) and touchdown passes (52). He also had the state's record in touchdowns passes for a single-season (26 in 1997) and a single-game (6). He averaged 45.7 yards-per-punt in his career.\n\nIn baseball, he was a four-time All-state selection. He finished as the national high school record holder in career home runs (70), RBIs (290) and runs scored (259). As a pitcher, he struck out 163 hitters in his junior season. He had a 14-1 record with a 0.86 ERA and 174 strikeouts in his senior season. He also was named the ''[[USA Today]]'' High School Player of the Year, Baseball America 1998  High School Player of the Year and the [[Gatorade]] High School Player of the Year.\n\n==College career==\nHenson, during the recruiting process, was originally planning to commit to [[Florida State University]], but decided against it when [[Chris Weinke]] decided to enroll at FSU after a brief stint in [[Minor League Baseball]].\n\nHenson instead accepted a football scholarship from the [[University of Michigan]]. As a freshman under head coach [[Lloyd Carr]], Henson battled for the starting quarterback job against [[Tom Brady]] and ultimately was named the backup for the [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998 season]]. He saw action in 8 games, accumulating 21 completions on 47 pass attempts, good for 254 yards, three touchdowns and one interception.<ref name=stats>{{cite web|url=http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/cmaster.php?pkey=32&sortby=s|title=Drew Henson|publisher=MGoBlue.com|accessdate=December 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310144510/http://stats.ath.umich.edu/football/cmaster.php?pkey=32&sortby=s|archivedate=March 10, 2012}}</ref> He saw action in seven of Michigan's 13 games, including a win over #11 [[1998 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]] in the [[1999 Florida Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]].\n\nIn [[1999 Michigan Wolverines football team|1999]], Brady had to once again hold off Henson for the starting job. The two players platooned during the season's first seven games, with Brady playing the first quarter, Henson the second and Carr then deciding upon a quarterback for the second half. The team started off with a 5\u20130 record. Against [[1999 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]], Henson in the second quarter connected with [[Marcus Knight]] for the third longest passing play in school history (an 81-yard touchdown completion); so he was chosen to play in the second half; however, Brady was reinserted into the game in the fourth quarter with Michigan down by 17 points, and nearly led the team all the way back before losing 34\u201331.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mgoblue.com/news/1999/10/9/U_M_Win_Streak_Comes_to_End_at_Michigan_State_34_31.aspx?path=football |title=U-M Win Streak Comes to End at Michigan State, 34-31 - University of Michigan |website=University of Michigan Athletics |access-date=December 28, 2018}}</ref> After a 300-yard passing game the following week, Carr went exclusively with Brady for the remainder of the season. Henson still saw his number of pass attempts nearly double, throwing 90 times and completing 47 passes. He recorded 546 passing yards, along with three touchdowns and two interceptions in nine appearances.<ref name=stats/> Henson again saw limited action when Michigan took on another bowl opponent with a higher ranking, #5 [[1999 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], in the [[2000 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]], and came out victorious with a 35\u201334 OT victory.\n\nIn [[2000 Michigan Wolverines football team|2000]], Brady graduated and Henson, now a junior, served as the Wolverines' starting quarterback for most of the season. He missed the first 3 contests after having surgery on his right foot just prior to the start of the season on August 24, with redshirt freshman [[John Navarre]] replacing him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Henson has foot surgery, will miss season opener|date=August 24, 2000|accessdate=December 7, 2018|url=https://mgoblue.com/news/2000/8/24/Henson_Has_Foot_Surgery_Will_Miss_Season_Opener.aspx}}</ref> Henson threw for a career-high 312 yards in a road defeat to #21 [[2000 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]], 54\u201351, but also tied a school record with four passing touchdowns. In the regular season finale, Henson led the #19 Wolverines to [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] to take on #12 [[2000 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] and threw again for over 300 yards en route to a 38\u201326 win. \nFor the third time in his career, Michigan and Henson faced a [[Southeastern Conference]] team when Michigan went on to play [[2000 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] in the [[2001 Florida Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]] and for the third time, Michigan again emerged victorious, winning 31\u201328. Henson recorded 294 yards passing on just 15 completions to go with two touchdowns and zero interceptions. Henson played in 9 out of 12 games, posting 146 completions in 237 attempts for 2,146 yards, along with 18 touchdowns and four interceptions.<ref name=stats/> His 159.4 passer rating was the fifth best in Michigan history and his 18 touchdown passes were the fourth most in a single-season in school history. He guided the team to a 9-3 record, a share of the Big Ten Conference title and a No. 11 ranking in the final [[Associated Press Poll]].\n\nHenson left prior to his senior season after signing a six-year, $17 million baseball-only deal with the [[New York Yankees]] on March 25, [[2001 Michigan Wolverines football team|2001]].

However, he struggled at the AAA level [[Columbus Clippers]]. He hit .234 over three seasons as the Clippers starting third baseman. Frustrated by his lack of progress and in need of a third baseman at the major league level, the Yankees acquired [[Aaron Boone]] at the 2003 trading deadline.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1588507 | title=Boone deal hasn't changed Henson's mind | accessdate=February 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBoone eventually hit a pennant-clinching home run against the [[Boston Red Sox]] in the 2003 postseason, but then injured his knee in a pickup basketball game during the offseason.

He was promoted to the backup position behind veteran [[Vinny Testaverde]] in the seventh game against the [[Detroit Lions]]. In the tenth game against the [[Baltimore Ravens]], he replaced an injured Testaverde in the fourth quarter, completing all of his 6 passes for 47 yards and one [[touchdown]]. On [[Thanksgiving Day]], Testaverde had previously missed practice and was limited with a sore right shoulder, so Henson was given the chance to start his first [[NFL]] game against the [[Chicago Bears]], making 4 out of 12 completions for 31 yards, driving the offense for a [[touchdown]] on the Cowboys first possession, but also had one interception that was returned 45 yards for a [[touchdown]] in the second quarter. With the score tied at 7, head coach [[Bill Parcells]] opted to insert Testaverde in the third quarter and the team went on to win the contest 21\u20137. Henson returned to third-string in the fifteenth game against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], finishing the season with 10 out of 18 completions for 78 yards, one [[touchdown]] and one interception.\n\nIn [[2005 NFL season|2005]], Henson had a poor training camp showing and landed third on the depth chart behind [[Drew Bledsoe]] and [[Tony Romo]]. He was declared inactive for all 16 games and at the end of the season, Parcells announced that Henson would be allocated to [[NFL Europe]] league to work on his skills.\n\nIn [[2006 NFL Europe season|2006]], he was assigned to the [[Rhein Fire]] of [[NFL Europe]], where he was named the starter at quarterback. Although he missed week 7 with a knee injury, he was the league's second rated signal caller (84.2 rating) behind [[Gibran Hamdan]], while finishing the season second in attempts (203), completions (109), passing yards (1,321), passing touchdowns (10) and second fewest interceptions (3).
