It was further threatened by the headstrong policies of ruling [[Friedrich Christian, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe|Count Friedrich Christian]]. To counter these threats, Friedrich's grandson [[Wilhelm, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe|Count Wilhelm]] (who reigned 1748\u20131777) retained a standing army of up to 1000 troops - quite a lot for such a small territory.\n\nWith Wilhelm's death in 1777 the junior [[Lippe-Alverdissen|Schaumburg-Lippe-Alverdissen]] inherited the County thereby reuniting Schaumburg-Lippe with Lippe-Alverdissen.\n[[File:Kleinstaaterei 1834.jpg|thumb|left|German cartoon from 1834 poking fun at the microscopic size of Schaumburg-Lippe]]\nSchaumburg-Lippe was a county until 1807 when it became a principality; from 1871 it was a state within the [[German Empire]].

{"title_page": "Perfect field", "text_new": "In [[abstract algebra|algebra]], a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'' is '''perfect''' if any one of the following equivalent conditions holds:\n* Every [[irreducible polynomial]] over ''k'' has distinct roots.\n* Every [[irreducible polynomial]] over ''k'' is [[separable polynomial|separable]].\n* Every [[finite extension]] of ''k'' is [[separable extension|separable]].\n* Every [[algebraic extension]] of ''k'' is separable.\n* Either ''k'' has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0, or, when ''k'' has characteristic ''p'' > 0, every element of ''k'' is a [[Power (mathematics)|''p''th power]].\n* Either ''k'' has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0, or, when ''k'' has characteristic ''p'' > 0, the [[Frobenius endomorphism]] ''x'' \u21a6 ''x''{{i sup|''p''}} is an [[automorphism]] of ''k''.\n* The [[separable closure]] of ''k'' is [[algebraically closed]].\n* Every [[reduced ring|reduced]] commutative [[Algebra (ring theory)|''k''-algebra]] ''A'' is a [[separable algebra]]; i.e., <math>A \\otimes_k F</math> is [[reduced ring|reduced]] for every [[field extension]] ''F''/''k''. (see below)\nOtherwise, ''k'' is called '''imperfect'''.\n\nIn particular, all fields of characteristic zero and all [[finite field]]s are perfect.\n\nPerfect fields are significant because [[Galois theory]] over these fields becomes simpler, since the general Galois assumption of field extensions being separable is automatically satisfied over these fields (see third condition above).\n\nAnother important property of perfect fields is that they admit [[Witt vector]]s.\n\nMore generally, a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of characteristic ''p'' (''p'' a [[prime number|prime]]) is called '''perfect''' if the [[Frobenius endomorphism]] is an [[automorphism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Serre|1979}}, Section II.4</ref> (This is equivalent to the above condition \"every element of ''k'' is a ''p''th power\" for [[integral domain]]s.)\n\n==Examples==\n\nExamples of perfect fields are: \n* every field of characteristic zero, e.g. the field of [[rational numbers]], the field of [[real numbers]] or the field of [[complex numbers]];\n* every [[finite field]], e.g. the field <math> \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} </math>, where ''p'' is a [[prime number]];\n* every [[algebraically closed field]];\n* the union of a set of perfect fields totally ordered by extension;\n* fields algebraic over a perfect field.\n\nIn fact, most fields that appear in practice are perfect. The imperfect case arises mainly in algebraic geometry in characteristic {{nowrap|''p'' > 0}}. Every imperfect field is necessarily [[Field_extension#Algebraic_and_transcendental_elements|transcendental]] over its [[prime subfield]] (the minimal subfield), because the latter is perfect.

Kennedy assassination}}\n[[John F. Kennedy]], the 35th President of the United States, was assassinated in [[Dallas]], Texas, on November 22, 1963. In the aftermath, several government agencies and panels investigated the circumstances surrounding the assassination, and all concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was the assassin. However, Oswald was murdered by a Mafia associated night club owner [[Jack Ruby]] before he could be tried in a court of law. The discrepancies between the official investigations and the extraordinary nature of the assassination have led to a variety of theories about how and why Kennedy was assassinated, as well as the possibility of a conspiracy. \nIn 1979, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, but that a second gunman besides Oswald probably also fired at Kennedy, and that a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] was probable.<ref name=\"HCSA-S\">{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=3 |chapter=Summary of Findings and Recommendations |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html}}</ref><ref name=\"HSCA_Report_0048a pp. 65-75\">[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0048a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], pp. 65\u201375.</ref> The Committee's conclusion of a conspiracy was based almost entirely on the results of a forensic analysis of a police [[dictabelt]] recording, which was later disputed.{{sfn|Bugliosi 2007|p=377}}\n\n==Origin==\nIn 1966, New Orleans [[District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] began an investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy.

Hunt won a libel judgment against the magazine in 1981, but this verdict was overturned on appeal. The magazine was found not liable when the case was retried in 1985. In 1985, Hunt was in court again in a libel suit against [[E. Howard Hunt#Later life|''Liberty Lobby'']].

Kennedy assassination}}\n[[John F. Kennedy]], the 35th President of the United States, was assassinated in [[Dallas]], Texas, on November 22, 1963. In the aftermath, several government agencies and panels investigated the circumstances surrounding the assassination, and all concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was the assassin. However, Oswald was murdered by a Mafia associated night club owner [[Jack Ruby]] before he could be tried in a court of law. The discrepancies between the official investigations and the extraordinary nature of the assassination have led to a variety of theories about how and why Kennedy was assassinated, as well as the possibility of a conspiracy. \nIn 1979, the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, but that a second gunman besides Oswald probably also fired at Kennedy, and that a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] was probable.<ref name=\"HCSA-S\">{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |type= |edition= |series= |year=1979 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=3 |chapter=Summary of Findings and Recommendations |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html}}</ref><ref name=\"HSCA_Report_0048a pp. 65-75\">[http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/hsca/report/html/HSCA_Report_0048a.htm House Select Committee on Assassinations Final Report], pp. 65\u201375.</ref> The Committee's conclusion of a conspiracy was based almost entirely on the results of a forensic analysis of a police [[dictabelt]] recording, which was later disputed.{{sfn|Bugliosi 2007|p=377}}\n\n==Origin==\nIn 1966, New Orleans [[District Attorney]] [[Jim Garrison]] began an investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy.

Hunt won a libel judgment against the magazine in 1981, but this verdict was overturned on appeal. The magazine was found not liable when the case was retried in 1985. In 1985, Hunt was in court again in a libel suit against [[E. Howard Hunt#Later life|''Liberty Lobby'']].

However, Hunt's health improved and he went on to live four more years. Shortly before Hunt's death in 2007, he authored an autobiography which implicated [[Lyndon B.

{"title_page": "Joint Attack Helicopter Instrumented Evaluation", "text_new": "[[File:Bell AH-1 Cobra flying head on.jpg|thumb|right|Masking their approach using trees, TOW-firing Cobras proved to be devastatingly effective anti-tank weapons.]] \n\nThe '''Joint Attack Helicopter Instrumented Evaluation''' was a series of [[military exercise]]s that tested the use of [[attack helicopter]]s against simulated [[Warsaw Pact]] formations. They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nThis result came just as the [[US Army]] was facing a crisis. Under the 1960s [[New Look (policy)|New Look policy]], the answer to any WTO attack would be to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, primarily from [[NATO]] [[strike aircraft]], to destroy WTO armor ''en masse''. Assuming this, conventional forces had been allowed to stagnate. By the early 1970s there was a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} With the [[Soviet Union]] reaching strategic parity in the early 1970s, a massive atomic attack was no longer viable, leaving NATO dangerously underpowered.\n\nThe Ansbach Tests suggested that this could be addressed by a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet. This sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these comments home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref> This resulted in a complex design and development dragged on for years before it was finally canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost.

That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate.

This was bolstered by the events in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) \"utterly defeated combined armies equal in strength to NATO Europe\" and suggested that it was \"obvious that armor is battlefield-decisive so long as it is used wisely.\"{{sfn|Brower|1974|p=15}}\n\n==THES==\nLooking to gain further clarity as the debate about the Ansbach results, the Army commissioned BDM International, now part of [[Vinnell]], to prepare a follow-up theoretical study.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nThis result came just as the [[US Army]] was facing a crisis. Under the 1960s [[New Look (policy)|New Look policy]], the answer to any WTO attack would be to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, primarily from [[NATO]] [[strike aircraft]], to destroy WTO armor ''en masse''. Assuming this, conventional forces had been allowed to stagnate. By the early 1970s there was a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} With the [[Soviet Union]] reaching strategic parity in the early 1970s, a massive atomic attack was no longer viable, leaving NATO dangerously underpowered.\n\nThe Ansbach Tests suggested that this could be addressed by a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet. This sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these comments home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref> This resulted in a complex design and development dragged on for years before it was finally canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other vehicles over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]].

That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate. For the protagonists, the attack helicopter represents a pipedream that will be quickly and devastatingly shattered by the reality of combat.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nThe tests had been carried out just as the new [[M1 Abrams|XM-1]] tank began its design cycle and was spearheading a renewed interest in tanks. This was bolstered by the events in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) \"utterly defeated combined armies equal in strength to NATO Europe\" and suggested that it was \"obvious that armor is battlefield-decisive so long as it is used wisely.\"{{sfn|Brower|1974|p=15}}\n\n==THES==\nLooking to gain further clarity as the debate about the Ansbach results, the Army commissioned BDM International, now part of [[Vinnell]], to prepare a follow-up theoretical study. The Tactical Helicopter Employment Study, or THES, was largely a literature search, an attempt to find and collect all useful information on the topic of attack helicopters to date.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=31}} Published in November 1973, THES made three broad conclusions:{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=32}}\n\n# previous experiments and operations generally supported each other's results\n# doctrines developed during these events appeared to be correct and well accepted\n# the attack helicopter could be used as a primary anti-armor weapon\n\nTHES also considered the issue of weather, and using data collected from sixteen sites over a ten-year span, they concluded that the Cobra could fly 91% of the time, even during the worst weather in November and December.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=https://archive.org/stream/DTIC_ADA147750/DTIC_ADA147750_djvu.txt |title=Determining the Optimum Aviation Organization for the Operational Level of War |first=Carlton |last=Hood |date=May 1984 |publisher=United States Army}}</ref>\n\n==Outcomes==\nIn 1976, as a direct result of the tests and the THEL results, the Army began updating all AH-1G, -1Q and -1R to the modernized AH-1S. The -1S retained the Cobra's direct-fire capabilities with rockets and guns, but shifted its primary mission to anti-tank, carrying eight TOW missiles. In March 1978, a further 100 new-build AH-1S's were ordered.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}}\n\nIn Canada, the tests were used to bolster arguments for the new mobile force structure. However, when the cost of the helicopters was considered, it appeared there was only enough money to equip one formation with the required number of aircraft. This would leave the forces in Canada both under-equipped and lacking training.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=59}} Having repeatedly suggested a ''status quo'' approach, updating the Centurions in both Europe and Canada, a wait and see approach developed. An additional factor in the Canadian decision was the advocacy of Major Norman Shackleton, who wrote a series of influential and widely quoted pro-tank articles throughout this period. Among these was a 1967 article that concluded: \"... the foremost antitank weapon is probably another tank sited in the defense.\"<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Military Review |volume=47 |date=July 1967 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qGU3r9LVwbsC&pg=PA58 |title=The Case for the Defense |first=Norman |last=Shackleton}}</ref> By the early 1980s, the helicopter contingent had not been purchased, while a new tank contingent of Leopards was purchased from Germany in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |website=The Drive |title=Canada Has Given Up Trying To Find A Good Home For Its Retired Leopard Tanks |date=9 July 2018 |url=https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/22044/canada-has-given-up-trying-to-find-a-good-home-for-its-retired-leopard-tanks}}</ref>\n\nOther NATO forces also began the process of integrating attack helicopters into their forces, initially with ''ad hoc'' conversions of existing utility designs like the [[Westland Scout]]<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Ferguson | first= James | title =Commando aviation |magazine= Flight International | date =6 February 1982 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%200314.html | accessdate =16 November 2014 |ref=harv}}</ref> and [[MBB Bo 105]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eads.com/1024/en/eads/history/airhist/1970_today/bo105_1971.html |title=B\u00f6lkow Bo 105 - History of EADS |publisher=EADS |accessdate=2007-03-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110626/http://www.eads.com/1024/en/eads/history/airhist/1970_today/bo105_1971.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Exercise Hell Tank]], a similar [[British Army]] test in 1966 that reached similar conclusions\n* [[J-CATCH]], testing attack helicopters against [[fighter aircraft]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite techreport\n |first=Curtis |last=Ebitz\n |title= The Tank-Attack Helicopter In The European Mid-Intensity Conflict Environment\n |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/b006705.pdf\n |date=6 June 1975\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=EklRAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA4-PA4\n |title=Armor in the October War\n |date=May-June 1974\n |journal=Armor\n |volume=83\n |first=Kenneth |last=Brower\n |pages=10-15\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=A National Force: The Evolution of Canada's Army, 1950-2000\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=VTIAAQAAQBAJ\n |first=Peter |last=Kasurak\n |publisher=UBC Press\n |date=2013\n |isbn=9780774826419\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=The Price of Alliance\n |first=Frank |last=Maas\n |date=2017\n |publisher=UBC Press\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qLo4DwAAQBAJ\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |title=Department of the Army Historical Summary, Fiscal Year 1973\n |first1=Willian |last1= Bell\n |first2=Karl |last2=Cocke\n |url=https://history.army.mil/books/DAHSUM/1973/chIII.htm\n |date=1974\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |first=Stanley |last=McGowen\n |title=Helicopters: An Illustrated History of Their Impact\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xLis8p7uLaUC&pg=PA158\n |publisher=ABC-CLIO\n |date=2005\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite journal\n |first=Norman |last=Shackleton\n |title=Will the Tank Go the Way of the Horse?\n |date=September-October 1968\n |pages=4-8\n |journal=Armor\n |volume=77 |number=5\n |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=eIJNAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA4-PA4\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |first=John |last=Burns\n |title= XM-26 TOW: Birth of the Helicopter as a Tank Buster\n |publisher=United States Army\n |date=1994\n |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ga2/vnhistory/2RAC.html\n}}\n\n[[Category:Military exercises involving the United States]]\n[[Category:Military exercises and wargames]]\n[[Category:Canadian military exercises\u200e]]\n[[Category:Military aviation exercises]]\n", "name_user": "Maury Markowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTests", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Attack_Helicopter_Instrumented_Evaluation"}

The Fanshawe family were committed [[Cavalier|Royalists]], and when the [[First English Civil War|Civil War]] broke out in 1642, Simon, his new wife and stepdaughter joined [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in [[Oxford]], his wartime capital. Her mother died that winter, leaving eight-year-old Katherine in the care of her stepfather. As the fighting continued, Fanshawe was at the [[Battle of Marston Moor]] in 1644, and was taken prisoner two years later.{{sfn|Buckledee|2004}} During this time Katherine was made a ward of the court by Simon Fanshawe's brother, [[Sir Richard Fanshawe, 1st Baronet|Richard]], and his wife [[Sir Richard Fanshawe, 1st Baronet|Ann]].{{sfn|White|2004}} She was then sent to live with Simon's sister, Alice, at [[Hamerton]] in [[Huntingdonshire]].{{sfn|Barber|2009}}\n\nIn 1643 the [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|Sequestration Committee]] placed estates of known Royalists in the hands of local commissioners, and their rents and other income were kept by [[Parliament]]. Unlike Parliament, the Royalist party was dependent on voluntary contributions, involuntary fines and any other means of raising funds, such as looting. The Fanshawes had contributed heavily to the Royalist cause, and now found their assets cut. The family then arranged for orphaned Katherine, heir to the Ferrers estates, to marry [[Thomas Fanshawe, 2nd Viscount Fanshawe|Thomas Fanshawe]], her stepfather's nephew, when she reached a marriageable age. In April 1648, when she was just shy of 14, the ceremony took place at Hamerton, whereupon her 16-year-old husband took control of her considerable fortune.{{sfn|White|2004}} Many of her inherited assets were quickly disposed of: the manor at Flamstead was sold in 1654; and Markyate Cell, which had been leased to tenants in the years after her father's death, and the farms around it, were disposed of the following year.{{sfn|Barber|2009}}\n\nAfter [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] death in 1658, [[The Protectorate]] did not endure and the monarchy was eventually restored to power. Thomas Fanshawe had become involved in [[George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer|Booth's uprising]], a [[Presbyterian]] rebellion in the north of England, and was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] in September 1659, although he was released in February 1660. [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] entered London in May; Katherine is known to have lodged in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] during the celebration.{{sfn|Loftis|1979}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}} She then died sometime in the first two weeks of June, at the age of 26. Described in the parish register as \u201cMistress Catherine Fanshawe\", she was buried at St Mary's church in [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], on 13 June 1660.{{sfn|Barber|2009}} She died childless; this could have been due to infertility, or to her husband's continued absence due to war and imprisonment.\n\nA family history written by Herbert Fanshawe in 1927, which draws heavily on the memoirs of Richard Fanshawe's wife, Ann,{{sfn|Loftis|1979}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}} suggested that: \"Possibly her death occurred at the birth of a child for the Register of Ayott St. Lawrence (no great distance from Ware), gives the burial, on 22 November in the same year, of \"Marie Fanshawe daughter of Sir Thomas Fanshaw\".\"{{sfn|Barber|2009}} If this was indeed Katherine's five-month-old child, its birth was not recorded, and its burial entry would have to have been inserted some time after its death, since Thomas was not knighted until well after 1660.  A later entry of this type would not have been unusual for the time, as many [[Parish register|parish registries]] were irregularly kept.  However, since Katherine's husband was imprisoned in 1659 following the Booth uprising in the north, and not released until February 1660, the issue then becomes one of paternity, since a pregnancy of four months duration, during those times, could not have produced a child that would have survived.{{sfn|Barber|2009}} While it is \"no great distance from Ware\" (some 13 miles), the child in question was not still buried in the same location as Katherine.\n\nWith Katherine's death the Ferrers line died out; in the following year Thomas Fanshawe, who had been created a [[Knights of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]] by Charles II, disposed of the bulk of the Ferrers' family property that had originally been granted to Katherine's ancestors by Edward VI.  Described by the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] as \"a witty but rascally fellow, without a penny in his purse\",<ref>Pepys, Samuel; ''The Diary of Samuel Pepys'', [http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1668/02/23/ Sunday 23 February 1667/68]</ref> Thomas did not marry again until 1665. He had four children by his second wife, Sarah, who was the daughter of [[John Evelyn (Parliamentarian)|Sir John Evelyn]] and widow of [[Sir John Wray, 3rd Baronet|Sir John Wray]];{{sfn|White|2004}} the eldest of whom, Evelyn, would become the 3rd Viscount Fanshawe.\n\n==Legend==\n[[Image:Ferrers Lane.jpg|thumb|left|The road bisecting [[Nomansland, Hertfordshire|Nomansland Common]], presumably named after \"Wicked\" Katherine Ferrers.]] \nAccording to the popular legend, often told with an emphasis on hauntings by her [[ghost]], Katherine came into [[highway robbery]] in her husband's absence in order to redress her fast-dwindling fortune. During this time many highwaymen were Royalist supporters bereft of home, estates or income, who were left to make a living as best they could, so any courteous highway robber was perceived to be one of these well-mannered gentlemen. Not all highwaymen were well-born like French aristocrat [[Claude Duval]] or [[James MacLaine]], who was the second son of a minister, but this romanticised portrayal extended to such working-class robbers as MacLaine's partner [[William Plunkett (highwayman)|William Plunkett]], as well as [[Richard Ferguson]], [[George Lyon (highwayman)|George Lyons]], [[Tom King (highwayman)|Tom King]], [[John Nevison]], and [[John Rann]].  However, while it is possible that Katherine Ferrers could have turned to highway robbery, there seems to be no historical proof that her accomplice \"Ralph Chaplin\", ever existed.{{sfn|Barber|2009}} He was supposedly caught and executed on [[Finchley Common]] either on the night of her death, or soon after, which conveniently serves the legend.\n\nThe unknown circumstances of Katherine's early death have fuelled speculation. The persistent rumour is that she was shot as a highwayman on [[Nomansland, Hertfordshire|Nomansland Common]] in [[Wheathampstead]], and died of her wounds while trying to ride back to a secret staircase entry at Markyate Cell. Her body was supposedly discovered wearing men's clothing before her servants recovered it and carried her home to be buried. Markyate Cell was built on the site of a 12th-century [[Benedictine]] [[Priory]] and takes its name from a [[Abbey|cell]], or smaller structure, that served the monastery. It was converted at great expense into a manor house in 1540, and then rebuilt in 1908 after a fire. When a secret chamber was discovered by workmen in the 1800s behind a false wall next to a chimney stack, it gave new life to the legend. However, there is a serious inconsistency in this story as there is no record of Katherine ever having lived in Markyate Cell, as it was leased to tenants after her father's death. The property, which is not especially close to Nomansland Common, had actually been sold five years earlier.{{sfn|Buckledee|2004}}{{sfn|White|2004}}\n\nApart from robbery, a catalogue of mayhem in the area was later attributed to Katherine that included burning houses, slaughtering livestock, even killing a [[constable]] or other officer of the law. Much of the supposed activity might be blamed on bands of brigands and the unrest relating to the Civil War, and there is no confirmation as to whether the mayhem and robberies in the area ceased with Katherine's death.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nJ.E. Cussens suggested in his ''History of Hertfordshire (1870\u201381)'' that the term \"wicked\" came to be linked with Katherine Ferrers long after her death not through any nefarious actions on her part, but through confusion with the [[Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers|\"Wicked\" Lord Ferrers]], who was not related to her.{{sfn|White|2004}}  The last member of the House of Lords hanged in England, the \"wicked\" Laurence Shirley, Earl Ferrers, was executed at [[Tyburn]] for the murder of his manservant in 1760, one hundred years after Katherine's death.{{sfn|Cussans|1881}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}  [[John Edwin Cussans|Cussans]] notes that there is no contemporary mention of her career and death as a highwayman in histories published before the 4th Earl Ferrers's execution, such as Alexander Smith's ''Complete History of the Lives of the most Notorious Highwaymen'' (1714), or even some 60 years after it, such as ''[[The Newgate Calendar]]'' and Richard Clutterbuck's ''The History and Antiquities of the County of Hertford'' (1815\u201327).\n\nWhile it has also been proposed that the term \"wicked\" could have been applied to Katherine solely because she allowed the family estates to fall into ruin, this is unlikely since many Royalist families suffered many of the same reverses without this nomenclature being applied to them. In addition, it was Katherine's husband who controlled, and sold off, most of the Ferrers family assets; as his wife she would have been powerless to stop him.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Literature and film==\nA popular novel by [[Magdalen King-Hall]], ''The Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton'' (1944), was loosely based on Katherine's life. A 1945 film version called ''[[The Wicked Lady]]'', with [[Margaret Lockwood]] in the lead role and [[James Mason]] as Ralph Chaplin's alter ego Jerry Jackson, broke all British box office records for the time.{{sfn|White|2004}} The film was [[The Wicked Lady (1983 film)|remade]] in 1983 with [[Faye Dunaway]] and [[Alan Bates]] in the respective roles.

[[Charles II of England|Charles II]] entered London in May; Katherine is known to have lodged in the [[Strand, London|Strand]] during the celebration.{{sfn|Loftis|1979}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}} She then died sometime in the first two weeks of June, at the age of 26. Described in the parish register as \u201cMistress Catherine Fanshawe\", she was buried at St Mary's church in [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], on 13 June 1660.{{sfn|Barber|2009}} She died childless; this could have been due to infertility, or to her husband's continued absence due to war and imprisonment.\n\nA family history written by Herbert Fanshawe in 1927, which draws heavily on the memoirs of Richard Fanshawe's wife, Ann,{{sfn|Loftis|1979}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}} suggested that: \"Possibly her death occurred at the birth of a child for the Register of Ayott St. Lawrence (no great distance from Ware), gives the burial, on 22 November in the same year, of \"Marie Fanshawe daughter of Sir Thomas Fanshaw\".\"{{sfn|Barber|2009}} If this was indeed Katherine's five-month-old child, its birth was not recorded, and its burial entry would have to have been inserted some time after its death, since Thomas was not knighted until well after 1660.  A later entry of this type would not have been unusual for the time, as many [[Parish register|parish registries]] were irregularly kept.  However, since Katherine's husband was imprisoned in 1659 following the Booth uprising in the north, and not released until February 1660, the issue then becomes one of paternity, since a pregnancy of four months duration, during those times, could not have produced a child that would have survived.{{sfn|Barber|2009}} While it is \"no great distance from Ware\" (some 13 miles), the child in question was not still buried in the same location as Katherine.\n\nWith Katherine's death the Ferrers line died out; in the following year Thomas Fanshawe, who had been created a [[Knights of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]] by Charles II, disposed of the bulk of the Ferrers' family property that had originally been granted to Katherine's ancestors by Edward VI.  Described by the diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] as \"a witty but rascally fellow, without a penny in his purse\",<ref>Pepys, Samuel; ''The Diary of Samuel Pepys'', [http://www.pepysdiary.com/diary/1668/02/23/ Sunday 23 February 1667/68]</ref> Thomas did not marry again until 1665. He had four children by his second wife, Sarah, who was the daughter of [[John Evelyn (Parliamentarian)|Sir John Evelyn]] and widow of [[Sir John Wray, 3rd Baronet|Sir John Wray]];{{sfn|White|2004}} the eldest of whom, Evelyn, would become the 3rd Viscount Fanshawe.\n\n==Legend==\n[[Image:Ferrers Lane.jpg|thumb|left|The road bisecting [[Nomansland, Hertfordshire|Nomansland Common]], presumably named after \"Wicked\" Katherine Ferrers.]] \nAccording to the popular legend, often told with an emphasis on hauntings by her [[ghost]], Katherine came into [[highway robbery]] in her husband's absence in order to redress her fast-dwindling fortune. During this time many highwaymen were Royalist supporters bereft of home, estates or income, who were left to make a living as best they could, so any courteous highway robber was perceived to be one of these well-mannered gentlemen. Not all highwaymen were well-born like French aristocrat [[Claude Duval]] or [[James MacLaine]], who was the second son of a minister, but this romanticised portrayal extended to such working-class robbers as MacLaine's partner [[William Plunkett (highwayman)|William Plunkett]], as well as [[Richard Ferguson]], [[George Lyon (highwayman)|George Lyons]], [[Tom King (highwayman)|Tom King]], [[John Nevison]], and [[John Rann]].  However, while it is possible that Katherine Ferrers could have turned to highway robbery, there seems to be no historical proof that her accomplice \"Ralph Chaplin\", ever existed.{{sfn|Barber|2009}} He was supposedly caught and executed on [[Finchley Common]] either on the night of her death, or soon after, which conveniently serves the legend.\n\nThe unknown circumstances of Katherine's early death have fuelled speculation. The persistent rumour is that she was shot as a highwayman on [[Nomansland, Hertfordshire|Nomansland Common]] in [[Wheathampstead]], and died of her wounds while trying to ride back to a secret staircase entry at Markyate Cell. Her body was supposedly discovered wearing men's clothing before her servants recovered it and carried her home to be buried. Markyate Cell was built on the site of a 12th-century [[Benedictine]] [[Priory]] and takes its name from a [[Abbey|cell]], or smaller structure, that served the monastery. It was converted at great expense into a manor house in 1540, and then rebuilt in 1908 after a fire. When a secret chamber was discovered by workmen in the 1800s behind a false wall next to a chimney stack, it gave new life to the legend. However, there is a serious inconsistency in this story as there is no record of Katherine ever having lived in Markyate Cell, as it was leased to tenants after her father's death. The property, which is not especially close to Nomansland Common, had actually been sold five years earlier.{{sfn|Buckledee|2004}}{{sfn|White|2004}}\n\nApart from robbery, a catalogue of mayhem in the area was later attributed to Katherine that included burning houses, slaughtering livestock, even killing a [[constable]] or other officer of the law. Much of the supposed activity might be blamed on bands of brigands and the unrest relating to the Civil War, and there is no confirmation as to whether the mayhem and robberies in the area ceased with Katherine's death.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nJ.E. Cussens suggested in his ''History of Hertfordshire (1870\u201381)'' that the term \"wicked\" came to be linked with Katherine Ferrers long after her death not through any nefarious actions on her part, but through confusion with the [[Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers|\"Wicked\" Lord Ferrers]], who was not related to her.{{sfn|White|2004}}  The last member of the House of Lords hanged in England, the \"wicked\" Laurence Shirley, Earl Ferrers, was executed at [[Tyburn]] for the murder of his manservant in 1760, one hundred years after Katherine's death.{{sfn|Cussans|1881}}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}  [[John Edwin Cussans|Cussans]] notes that there is no contemporary mention of her career and death as a highwayman in histories published before the 4th Earl Ferrers's execution, such as Alexander Smith's ''Complete History of the Lives of the most Notorious Highwaymen'' (1714), or even some 60 years after it, such as ''[[The Newgate Calendar]]'' and Richard Clutterbuck's ''The History and Antiquities of the County of Hertford'' (1815\u201327).\n\nWhile it has also been proposed that the term \"wicked\" could have been applied to Katherine solely because she allowed the family estates to fall into ruin, this is unlikely since many Royalist families suffered many of the same reverses without this nomenclature being applied to them. In addition, it was Katherine's husband who controlled, and sold off, most of the Ferrers family assets; as his wife she would have been powerless to stop him.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Literature and film==\nA popular novel by [[Magdalen King-Hall]], ''The Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton'' (1944), was loosely based on Katherine's life. A 1945 film version called [[The Wicked Lady]], with [[Margaret Lockwood]] in the lead role and [[James Mason]] as Ralph Chaplin's alter ego Jerry Jackson, broke all British box office records for the time.{{sfn|White|2004}} The film was [[The Wicked Lady (1983 film)|remade]] in 1983 with [[Faye Dunaway]] and [[Alan Bates]] in the respective roles. [[Deborah Swift]]'s [[young adult novel]] ''Shadow on the Highway'' (2014, {{ISBN|978-1500549831}}) is a retelling of Katherine's story.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shadow on the Highway|url=http://deborahswift.com/shadow-on-the-highway/|publisher=Deborah Swift|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref> Katherine Clements wrote ''The Silvered Heart'' (2015, {{ISBN|9781472204240}}) about Katherine Ferrers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://historicalnovelsociety.org/reviews/the-silvered-heart/ |title=The Silvered Heart by Katherine Clements |last=Redmond |first=Lisa |date=August 2015 |publisher=Historical Novels Review |language=en-US |access-date=2018-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.johnbarber.com/katherine-ferrers-the-wicked-lady/ |title=Katherine Ferrers the Wicked Lady |first=John |last=Barber |year=2009 |access-date=2018-05-02| df=dmy-all |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |url=https://www.dunstablehistory.co.uk/archives/VWX/Wicked_Lady.htm |last=Buckledee |first=John |title=The REAL Wicked Lady of Markyate |work=The Luton News/Dunstable Gazette |date=2004-11-03 |via=Dunstable & District Local History Society |df=dmy-all |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cussans|first=John Edwin|title=History of Hertfordshire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VR0qAQAAMAAJ|authorlink=John Edwin Cussans |accessdate=2 May 2018|year=1881|publisher=E.

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada's [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|third longest-serving]] Prime Minister, behind [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\nTrudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer, intellectual, and activist in [[Qu\u00e9bec]] politics. He joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the [[Canadian Parliament]] in 1965, quickly being appointed as Prime Minister [[Lester&nbsp;B. Pearson|Lester&nbsp;B. Pearson's]] [[Parliamentary Secretary]]. In 1967, he was appointed [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]]. Trudeau's outgoing personality caused a media sensation, inspiring \"[[Trudeaumania]]\", and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968, when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nFrom the late 1960s until the early 1980s, Trudeau's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life. After his appointment as Prime Minister, he won the [[1968 Canadian federal election|1968]], [[1972 Canadian federal election|1972]] and [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974]] elections, before narrowly losing in [[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]]. He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards, in [[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]], and eventually retired from politics shortly before the [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984 election]].\n\nDespite his personal motto, \"Reason before passion\",<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/> his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office. Admirers praised what they consider to be the force of Trudeau's intellect{{sfn| Mallick (2000-09-30)|p=P04}} and his political acumen, maintaining national unity over the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], suppressing a Qu\u00e9bec [[October Crisis|terrorist crisis]], fostering a pan-Canadian identity, and in achieving sweeping institutional reform, including the implementation of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]], [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], and the establishment of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.{{sfn|The Globe and Mail (2000-09-29)|p=A20}} Critics accused him of arrogance, of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Qu\u00e9bec and the economy of the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]].{{sfn|Fortin (2000-10-09)|p=A17}}\n\nHis eldest son, [[Justin Trudeau]], became the 23rd and current Prime Minister, following the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 election]] and [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 election]], and is the first prime minister of Canada to be a descendant of a former prime minister.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/election/trudeau-s-win-ushers-in-canada-s-first-political-dynasty-1.2618093|title=Trudeau's win ushers in Canada's first political dynasty|last=Coorsh|first=Karolyn|date=October 20, 2015|website=CTVNews|language=en|access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nThe Trudeau family can be traced to [[Marcillac-Lanville]] in [[France]] in the 16th century and to a Robert Truteau (1544\u20131589).{{sfn|G\u00e9n\u00e9alogie du Qu\u00e9bec (2012)}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/robert-truteau_20306861?geo_a=r&geo_s=us&geo_t=us&geo_v=2.0.0&o_xid=62916&o_lid=62916&o_sch=Partners |title = Robert Truteau |publisher = Ancestry.com |accessdate = November 4, 2015 }}</ref> In 1659, the first Trudeau to arrive in Canada was \u00c9tienne Trudeau or Truteau (1641\u20131712), a carpenter and home builder from [[La Rochelle]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nosorigines.qc.ca/GenealogieQuebec.aspx?genealogie=Etienne_Trudeau&pid=6568&lng=fr&partID=6569 |title = G\u00e9n\u00e9alogie Etienne Trudeau |publisher = Nosorigines.qc.ca |date = January 14, 2007 |accessdate = August 16, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nPierre Trudeau was born at home at 5779 Durocher Avenue, [[Outremont, Quebec|Outremont, Montreal]], [[Canada]], on October 18, 1919,<ref name=\"English_Just_2009\">{{cite book |last= English |first= John |title= Just Watch Me: The Life of Pierre Elliott Trudeau Volume Two: 1968\u20132000 |location   = Toronto |publisher  = [[Alfred A.

Five days later Qu\u00e9bec Labour Minister [[Pierre Laporte]] was also kidnapped. Trudeau, with the acquiescence of Premier of Quebec Robert Bourassa, responded by invoking the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' which gave the government sweeping powers of arrest and detention without trial.

He established Canadian diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, before the United States did, and went on an official visit to Beijing. He was known as a friend of [[Fidel Castro]], the leader of [[Cuba]].\n\nTrudeau was the first world leader to meet [[John Lennon]] and his wife [[Yoko Ono]] on their \"tour for [[world peace]]\".

Stanfield proposed the immediate introduction of [[wage and price controls]] to help end the increasing [[inflation]] Canada was currently facing.

The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted [[Reference re Anti-Inflation Act|a Supreme Court reference]] that only upheld the legislation as an [[Peace, Order, and Good Government|emergency requiring Federal intervention]] under the ''[[British North America Act]]''. During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] business leaders.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=290-94}}\n\nTrudeau continued his attempts at increasing Canada's international profile, including joining the [[G7]] group of major economic powers in 1976 at the behest of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford]].{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|p=?}} On July 14, 1976, after long and emotional debate, Bill C-84 was passed by the House of Commons by a vote of 130 to 124, abolishing the [[Capital punishment in Canada|death penalty]] completely and instituting a life sentence without parole for 25 years for first-degree murder.<ref name=\"Radio Canada\">{{cite web |title = Le grandes etapes de l'abolition |url = http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Dossiers/peinedemort/contenu_bas_03a.asp |publisher = [[Radio Canada]]|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nTrudeau faced increasing challenges in Qu\u00e9bec, starting with bitter relations with Bourassa and his [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] government in Qu\u00e9bec. After a rise in the polls after the rejection of the Victoria Charter, the Qu\u00e9bec Liberals had taken a more confrontational approach with the Federal government on the constitution, [[Bill 22|French language laws]], and the language of [[air traffic control]] in Qu\u00e9bec.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=302-306}} Trudeau responded with increasing anger at what he saw as nationalist provocations against the Federal government's bilingualism and constitutional initiatives, at times expressing his personal contempt for Bourassa.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=302-306}}\n\nPartially in an attempt to shore up his support, Bourassa called a [[1976 Quebec general election|surprise election in 1976]] that resulted in [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]] and the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] (PQ) winning a majority government. The PQ had chiefly campaigned on a \"good government\" platform, but promised a referendum on independence to be held within their first mandate. Trudeau and L\u00e9vesque had been personal rivals, with Trudeau's intellectualism contrasting with L\u00e9vesque's more working-class image. While Trudeau claimed to welcome the \"clarity\" provided by the PQ victory, the unexpected rise of the sovereignist movement became, in his view, his biggest challenge.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=308}}\n\nAs the PQ began to take power, Trudeau faced the prolonged failure of his marriage, which was covered in lurid detail on a day-by-day basis by the English language press.

They changed for the better when Trudeau and [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter (1977-81)]] found a better rapport. The late 1970s saw a more sympathetic American attitude toward Canadian political and economic needs, the pardoning of draft evaders who had moved to Canada, and the passing of old sore points such as Watergate and the Vietnam War. Canada more than ever welcomed American investments during the \"[[stagflation]]\" (high inflation and high unemployment at the same time) that hurt both nations in the 1970s.<ref>Lily Gardner Feldman, \"Canada and the United States in the 1970s: Rift and Reconciliation.\" ''The World Today'' 34.12 (1978): 484-492. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40395029 online]</ref>\n\n==Defeat and opposition, 1979\u201380==\nIn the election of 1979, Trudeau and the Liberals faced declining poll numbers and the [[Joe Clark]]\u2013led Progressive Conservatives focusing on \"pocketbook\" issues. Trudeau and his advisors, to contrast with the mild-mannered Clark, based their campaign on Trudeau's decisive personality and his grasp of the Constitution file, despite the general public's apparent wariness of both. The traditional Liberal rally at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] saw Trudeau stressing the importance of major constitutional reform to general ennui, and his campaign \"photo-ops\" were typically surrounded by picket lines and protesters. Though polls portended disaster, Clark's struggles justifying his party's populist platform and a strong Trudeau performance in the election debate helped bring the Liberals to the point of contention.{{sfn|English (2009)|loc=chpt. 13}}\n\nThough winning the popular vote by four points, the Liberal vote was concentrated in Qu\u00e9bec and faltered in industrial Ontario, allowing the PCs to win the seat-count handily and form a minority government. Trudeau soon announced his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and favoured Donald Macdonald to be his successor.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265}}\n\nHowever, before a [[leadership convention]] could be held, with Trudeau's blessing and [[Allan MacEachen]]'s manoeuvring in the house, the Liberals supported an NDP subamendment to Clark's budget stating that the House had no confidence in the budget. In Canada, as in most other countries with a [[Westminster system]], budget votes are indirectly considered to be votes of confidence in the government, and their [[loss of supply|failure]] automatically brings down the government. Liberal and NDP votes and Social Credit abstentions led to the subamendment passing 139\u2013133, thereby toppling Clark's government and triggering a new election for a House less than a year old. The Liberal caucus, along with friends and advisers persuaded Trudeau to stay on as leader and fight the election, with Trudeau's main impetus being the upcoming referendum on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265\u201366}}\n\nTrudeau and the Liberals engaged in a new strategy for the February 1980 election: facetiously called the \"low bridge\", it involved dramatically underplaying Trudeau's role and avoiding media appearances, to the point of refusing a televised debate.

He was succeeded by John Turner, a former [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet minister]] under both Trudeau and Lester Pearson.\n\nThe Liberal victory in 1980 highlighted a sharp geographical divide in the country: the party had won no seats west of [[Manitoba]]. Trudeau, in an attempt to represent Western interests, offered to form a coalition government with Ed Broadbent's NDP, which had won 22 seats in the west, but was rebuffed by Broadbent out of fear the party would have no influence in a majority government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=446-7}}\n\nThe first challenge Trudeau faced upon re-election was the May 20, [[1980 Quebec referendum]] on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty, called by the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government under Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque. Trudeau immediately initiated federal involvement in the referendum, reversing the Clark government's policy of leaving the issue to the Qu\u00e9bec Liberals and [[Claude Ryan]]. He appointed Jean Chr\u00e9tien as the nominal spokesman for the federal government, helping to push the \"Non\" cause to working-class voters who tuned out the intellectual Ryan and Trudeau.

The western provinces blamed the devastating oil bust of the 1980s on the NEB which led to what many termed \"[[Western alienation]]\".

He described his own decline in popularity as \"long walk in the snow\". On February 29, after what he described as a \"long walk in the snow\", Trudeau announced he would not lead the Liberals into the next election.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/>\n\nBefore handing power to Turner, Trudeau took the unusual step of appointing Liberal [[Senate of Canada|Senators]] from Western provinces to Cabinet, in the 22nd Canadian Ministry. He advised [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauv\u00e9]] to appoint over 200 Liberals to [[patronage]] positions.  He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments. The sheer volume of appointments, combined with questions about the appointees' qualifications, led to condemnation from across the political spectrum.<ref name=\"Mulroney 1991\">''Mulroney: The Politics of Ambition'', by [[John Sawatsky]], Toronto 1991, McFarlane, Walter, and Ross publishers.</ref> However, an apparent rebound in the polls prompted Turner to call an election for September 1984, almost a year before it was due.

Provincial premiers were united in their concerns regarding an amending formula, a court-enforced Charter of Rights, and a further devolution of powers to the provinces.

Trudeau was backed by the NDP, Ontario Premier [[Bill Davis]], and New Brunswick Premier [[Richard Hatfield]] and was opposed by the remaining premiers and PC leader Joe Clark. After numerous provincial governments challenged the legality of the decision using their [[Reference question|reference power]], conflicting decisions prompted a [[Patriation Reference|Supreme Court decision]] that stated unilateral patriation was legal, but was in contravention of a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the provinces be consulted and have general agreement to the changes.\n\nAfter the court decision, which prompted some reservations in the British parliament of accepting a unilateral request,<ref>\n{{Cite journal |first = Andrew |last = Heard |title = Canadian Independence |year = 1990 |place = Vancouver |publisher = Simon Fraser University |url = https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html |accessdate = August 25, 2010 }}</ref> Trudeau agreed to meet with the premiers one more time before proceeding. At the meeting, Trudeau reached an agreement with nine of the premiers on patriating the constitution and implementing the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, with the caveat that provincial legislatures would have the ability to use a [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] to protect some laws from judicial oversight. The notable exception was L\u00e9vesque, who, Trudeau believed, would never have signed an agreement. The objection of the Qu\u00e9bec government to the new constitution became a source of continued acrimony between the federal and Qu\u00e9bec governments, and would forever stain Trudeau's reputation amongst nationalists in the province.\n\nThe ''[[Canada Act]]'', which included the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' and the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', was proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, as [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]], on April 17, 1982.\n\n==Retirement==\nTrudeau joined the Montreal law firm [[Heenan Blaikie]] as counsel and settled in the historic [[Maison Cormier]] in Montreal following his retirement from politics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Annmarie|last2=Macdonell|first2=Cameron|title=Making Himself at Home: Cormier, Trudeau, and the Architecture of Domestic Masculinity|journal=Winterthur Portfolio|date=2016|volume=50|issue=2/3|pages=151\u2013189|doi=10.1086/689984}}</ref> Though he rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]] proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. His opposition to both Accords was considered one of the major factors leading to the defeat of the two proposals.\n\nHe also continued to speak against the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the sovereignty movement with less effect.\n\nTrudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the [[Club of Rome]].  He met with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and other leaders in 1985; shortly afterwards Gorbachev met President [[Ronald Reagan]] to discuss easing world tensions.\n\nHe published his memoirs in 1993.<ref name=\"Trudeau_Memoirs_1993\">{{cite book |title=Memoirs |location=Toronto |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |date=1993 |isbn=0-7710-8588-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirs00trud/page/n15/mode/2up |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> The book sold hundreds of thousands of copies in several editions, and became one of the most successful Canadian books ever published.\n\nIn his [[old age]], he was afflicted with [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[prostate cancer]], and became less active, although he continued to work at his law practice until a few months before his death at the age of 80.

While mostly private about his beliefs, he made it clear that he was a believer, stating, in an interview with the ''United Church Observer'' in 1971: \"I believe in life after death, I believe in God and I'm a Christian.\" Trudeau maintained, however, that he preferred to impose constraints on himself rather than have them imposed from the outside. In this sense, he believed he was more like a Protestant than a Catholic of the era in which he was schooled.{{sfn|Trudeau (1996)|pp=302\u2013303}}\n\nMichael W. Higgins, a former President of Catholic [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]], researched Trudeau's spirituality and finds that it incorporated elements of three Catholic traditions. The first of these was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who provided his education up to the college level. Trudeau frequently displayed the logic and love of argument consistent with that tradition. A second great spiritual influence in Trudeau's life was [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. According to Michel Gourgues, professor at [[Dominican University College]], Trudeau \"considered himself a lay Dominican\".{{attribution needed|date=May 2016}} He studied philosophy under Dominican Father [[Louis-Marie R\u00e9gis]] and remained close to him throughout his life, regarding R\u00e9gis as \"spiritual director and friend\". Another skein in Trudeau's spirituality was a [[Contemplation|contemplative]] aspect acquired from his association with the [[Benedictine]] tradition. According to Higgins, Trudeau was convinced of the centrality of [[Christian meditation|meditation]] in a life fully lived. Trudeau meditated regularly after being initiated into [[Transcendental Meditation]] by the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Maharishi : the biography of the man who gave transcendental meditation to the world|last=Mason, Paul, 1952-|isbn=1852305711|location=Shaftesbury, Dorset|oclc=31133549|year = 1994}}</ref> He took retreats at [[Saint-Beno\u00eet-du-Lac, Qu\u00e9bec]] and regularly attended [[Liturgy of the Hours|Hours]] and the [[Eucharist]] at Montreal's Benedictine community.{{sfn|Higgins, M.

Retrieved: September 24, 2015.</ref>\n\nTrudeau's most enduring legacy may lie in his contribution to [[Canadian nationalism]], and of pride in Canada in and for itself rather than as a derivative of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. His role in this effort, and his related battles with Qu\u00e9bec on behalf of Canadian unity, cemented his political position when in office despite the controversies he faced\u2014and remain the most remembered aspect of his tenure afterwards.\n\nSome consider Trudeau's economic policies to have been a weak point. Inflation and unemployment marred much of his tenure as prime minister. When Trudeau took office in 1968 Canada had a debt of $18&nbsp;billion (24% of GDP) which was largely left over from World War II, when he left office in 1984, that debt stood at $200&nbsp;billion (46% of GDP), an increase of 83% in real terms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csls.ca/data/ipt2006.pdf | title=GDP figures | publisher=Centre for the Study of Living Standards | date=2006 | accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> However, these trends were present in most western countries at the time, including the United States.\n\nMany politicians still use the term \"taking a walk in the snow\", the line Trudeau used to describe how he arrived at the decision to leave office in 1984. Other popular Trudeauisms frequently used are \"[[just watch me]]\", the \"[[Finger (gesture)|Trudeau Salute]]\", and \"[[Fuddle duddle|Fuddle Duddle]]\".\n\n[[Maclean's]] 1997 and 2011 scholarly surveys [[Historical rankings of Canadian prime ministers|ranked him twice]] as the fifth best Canadian prime minister.<ref>{{cite magazine |url = http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-best-prime-ministers/ |title = Canada's best prime ministers |magazine = [[Maclean's]] |date = June 10, 2011 |accessdate = August 25, 2015 |author = Hillmer. Norman and Stephen Azzi }}</ref>\n\n===Constitutional legacy===\nOne of Trudeau's most enduring legacies is the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution\u2014which replaced Canada's ties to Britain with its own constitution, the 1982 ''1982 Constitution Act''.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\">{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |title=Pierre Trudeau Is Dead at 80; Dashing Fighter for Canada |first=Michael T. |last=Kaufman |date=September 29, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/world/pierre-trudeau-is-dead-at-80-dashing-fighter-for-canada.html|access-date=February 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525032137/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/world/pierre-trudeau-is-dead-at-80-dashing-fighter-for-canada.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |archive-date=May 25, 2013}}</ref>\nThis included a domestic amending formula and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is seen as advancing [[civil rights]] and liberties and has become a cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians. It also represented the final step in Trudeau's liberal vision of a fully independent Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms as well as those of linguistic and cultural minorities. Court challenges based on the Charter of Rights have been used to advance the cause of women's equality, re-establish French school boards in provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, and to mandate the adoption of [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] all across Canada. [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Section 35]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', has clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of [[Metis (people)|M\u00e9tis]]. Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups. The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the override (notwithstanding clause) of the charter has been infrequently used.\n\n[[Canadian conservatism|Canadian conservatives]] claim the constitution has resulted in too much [[judicial activism]] on the part of the courts in Canada. It is also heavily criticized by [[Quebec nationalism|Qu\u00e9bec nationalists]], who resent that the 1982 amendments to the constitution were never ratified by any [[Politics of Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec government]] and the constitution does not recognize a constitutional veto for Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n===Bilingualism===\n{{See also|Bilingualism in Canada}}\nBilingualism is one of Trudeau's most lasting accomplishments, having been fully integrated into the Federal government's services, documents, and broadcasting (though not, however, in provincial governments, except for Ontario, New Brunswick, and Manitoba). While official bilingualism has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians would be able to function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were.\n\nHowever, Trudeau's ambitions in this arena have been overstated: Trudeau once said that he regretted the use of the term \"bilingualism\", because it appeared to demand that all Canadians speak two languages. In fact, Trudeau's vision was to see Canada as a bilingual confederation in which ''all'' cultures would have a place. In this way, his conception broadened beyond simply the relationship of Qu\u00e9bec to Canada.\n\n===Multiculturalism===\nOn October 8, 1971, Pierre Trudeau introduced the Multiculturalism Policy in the House of Commons.  It was the first of its kind in the world,{{sfn|English (2009)|p=142}} and was then emulated in several provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and other countries most notably Australia, which has had a similar history and immigration pattern.  Beyond the specifics of the policy itself, this action signalled an openness to the world and coincided with a more open immigration policy that had been brought in by Trudeau's predecessor Lester B. Pearson.\n\n===Cultural legacy===\nIn the last years of his tenure, he ensured both the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] had proper homes in the national capital region. The Trudeau government also implemented programs which mandated [[Canadian content]] in film, and broadcasting, and gave substantial subsidies to develop the Canadian media and cultural industries. Though the policies remain controversial, Canadian media industries have become stronger since Trudeau's arrival.\n\n===Legacy in western Canada===\nTrudeau's posthumous reputation in the Western Provinces is notably less favourable than in the rest of English-speaking Canada, and he is sometimes regarded as the \"father of Western alienation\".  To many westerners, Trudeau's policies seemed to favour other parts of the country, especially [[Ontario]] and Qu\u00e9bec, at their expense. Outstanding among such policies was the National Energy Program, which was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich [[Alberta]] where unemployment rose from 4% to 10% following passage of the NEP.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alberta|title=Alberta, section Alberta's economy|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref> Estimates have placed Alberta's losses between $50&nbsp;billion and $100&nbsp;billion because of the NEP.<ref>{{cite journal |first = Mary Elizabeth |last = Vicente |title = The National Energy Program |journal = Canada's Digital Collections |publisher = Heritage Community Foundation |year = 2005 |url = http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/issues_nep.html |accessdate = April 26, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first = Robert |last = Mansell |author2 = Schlenker, Ron |author3 = Anderson, John |title = Energy, Fiscal Balances and National Sharing |publisher = Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy/[[University of Calgary]] |year = 2005 |url = http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ISEEEResearchReportNov1805.pdf |accessdate = April 26, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626113516/http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ISEEEResearchReportNov1805.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nMore particularly, two incidents involving Trudeau are remembered as having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During a visit to [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met with a group of farmers who were protesting the [[Canadian Wheat Board]]. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with  \"Why should ''I'' sell your wheat?\"&nbsp;\u2013 however, he had asked the [[rhetorical question|question rhetorically]] and then proceeded to answer it himself.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/chretien-accused-of-lying|title=Chr\u00e9tien Accused of Lying|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 21, 2019}}, [[Maclean's]], December 23, 1996</ref> Years later, on a train trip through [[Salmon Arm, British Columbia]], he \"gave the finger\" to a group of protesters through the carriage window&nbsp;\u2013 less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.<ref>Anthony Westell, ''Paradox: Trudeau as Prime Minister''.</ref>\n\n===Legacy in Qu\u00e9bec===\nTrudeau's legacy in Qu\u00e9bec is mixed. Many credit his actions during the October Crisis as crucial in terminating the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) as a force in Qu\u00e9bec, and ensuring that the campaign for Qu\u00e9bec separatism took a democratic and peaceful route. However, his [[War Measures Act#The October Crisis|imposition of the ''War Measures Act'']]\u2014which received majority support at the time\u2014is remembered by some in Qu\u00e9bec and elsewhere as an attack on democracy. Trudeau is also credited by many for the defeat of the 1980 Quebec referendum.\n\nAt the federal level, Trudeau faced almost no strong political opposition in Qu\u00e9bec during his time as Prime Minister. For instance, his Liberal party captured 74 out of 75 Qu\u00e9bec seats in the [[List of Canadian federal general elections|1980 federal election]]. Provincially, though, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois twice elected the pro-sovereignty Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Moreover, there were not at that time any pro-sovereignty federal parties such as the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]. Since the signing of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' in 1982 and until 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada had not succeeded in winning a majority of seats in Qu\u00e9bec. He was disliked by the Quebecois nationalists.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213210244/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/trudeau.htm Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Quebec and the Constitution], marianopolis.edu; retrieved July 7, 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy with respect to indigenous peoples in Canada ===\nIn 1969, Trudeau along with his then Minister of Indian Affairs Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Trudeau proposed the [[1969 White Paper]] (officially entitled Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy). Under the legislation of the White Paper, Indian Status would be eliminated. First Nations Peoples would be incorporated fully into provincial government responsibilities as equal Canadian citizens, and reserve status would be removed imposing the laws of private property in indigenous communities. Any special programs or considerations that had been allowed to First Nations people under previous legislation would be terminated, as the special considerations were seen by the Government to act as a means to further separate Indian peoples from Canadian citizens. This proposal was seen by many as racist and an attack on Canada's aboriginal population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kerr|first=Elisabetta|date=September 2017|title=Pierre Trudeau's White Paper and the Struggle for Aboriginal Rights in Canada|url=https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=gljuh|journal=The Great Lakes Journal of Undergraduate History|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facinghistory.org/stolen-lives-indigenous-peoples-canada-and-indian-residential-schools/chapter-8/white-paper-red-paper|title=White Paper, Red Paper|website=Facing History and Ourselves|access-date=July 31, 2019}}</ref> The Paper proposed the general assimilation of First Nations into the Canadian body politic through the elimination of the ''[[Indian Act]]'' and Indian status, the parcelling of reserve land to private owners, and the elimination of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. The White Paper prompted the first major national mobilization of Indian and Aboriginal activists against the federal government's proposal, leading to Trudeau setting aside the legislation.\n\n===Intellectual contributions===\nTrudeau was a strong advocate for a [[federalism|federalist]] model of government in Canada, developing and promoting his ideas in response and contrast to strengthening Qu\u00e9bec nationalist movements, for instance the social and political atmosphere created during Maurice Duplessis' time in power.<ref>Gagnon (2000).</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nFederalism in this context can be defined as \"a particular way of sharing political power among different peoples within a state...Those who believe in federalism hold that different peoples do not need states of their own in order to enjoy self-determination. Peoples&nbsp;... may agree to share a single state while retaining substantial degrees of self-government over matters essential to their identity as peoples\".<ref>Ignatieff, quoted in Balthazar (1995), p. 6.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nAs a social democrat, Trudeau sought to combine and harmonize his theories on [[social democracy]] with those of federalism so that both could find effective expression in Canada. He noted the ostensible conflict between socialism, with its usually strong centralist government model, and federalism, which expounded a division and cooperation of power by both federal and provincial levels of government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p={{page needed|date=May 2016}}}} In particular, Trudeau stated the following about socialists:{{quote|[R]ather than water down&nbsp;... their socialism, must constantly seek ways of adapting it to a bicultural society governed under a federal constitution. And since the future of Canadian federalism lies clearly in the direction of co-operation, the wise socialist will turn his thoughts in that direction, keeping in mind the importance of establishing buffer zones of joint sovereignty and co-operative zones of joint administration between the two levels of government{{sfn|English (2009)|p=141}}}}\n\nTrudeau pointed out that in sociological terms, Canada is inherently a federalist society, forming unique regional identities and priorities, and therefore a federalist model of spending and jurisdictional powers is most appropriate. He argues, \"in the age of the mass society, it is no small advantage to foster the creation of quasi-sovereign communities at the provincial level, where power is that much less remote from the people.\"{{sfn|English (2009)|p=133}}\n\nTrudeau's idealistic plans for a cooperative Canadian federalist state were resisted and hindered as a result of his narrowness on ideas of identity and socio-cultural pluralism: \"While the idea of a 'nation' in the sociological sense is acknowledged by Trudeau, he considers the allegiance which it generates\u2014emotive and particularistic\u2014to be contrary to the idea of cohesion between humans, and as such creating fertile ground for the internal fragmentation of states and a permanent state of conflict\".<ref name=\"Gagnon2000pp16-17\">Gagnon (2000), 16\u201317.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis position garnered significant criticism for Trudeau, in particular from Qu\u00e9bec and First Nations peoples on the basis that his theories denied their rights to nationhood.<ref name=\"Gagnon2000pp16-17\"/>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}   First Nations communities raised particular concerns with the proposed 1969 White Paper, developed under Trudeau by Jean Chr\u00e9tien.\n\n==Supreme Court appointments==\nTrudeau chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] by the Governor General:\n\n* [[Bora Laskin]] (March 19, 1970 \u2013 March 17, 1984; as Chief Justice, December 27, 1973)\n* [[Joseph Honor\u00e9 G\u00e9rald Fauteux]] (as

His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada's [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|third longest-serving]] Prime Minister, behind [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and [[John A. Macdonald]].\n\nTrudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer, intellectual, and activist in [[Qu\u00e9bec]] politics. He joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the [[Canadian Parliament]] in 1965, quickly being appointed as Prime Minister [[Lester&nbsp;B. Pearson|Lester&nbsp;B. Pearson's]] [[Parliamentary Secretary]]. In 1967, he was appointed [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]]. Trudeau's outgoing personality caused a media sensation, inspiring \"[[Trudeaumania]]\", and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968, when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nFrom the late 1960s until the early 1980s, Trudeau's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life. After his appointment as Prime Minister, he won the [[1968 Canadian federal election|1968]], [[1972 Canadian federal election|1972]] and [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974]] elections, before narrowly losing in [[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]]. He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards, in [[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]], and eventually retired from politics shortly before the [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984 election]].\n\nDespite his personal motto, \"Reason before passion\",<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/> his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office.

He defended vigorously the newly implemented [[universal health care]] and [[regional development]] programmes, as well as the recent reforms found in the Omnibus bill.\n\nOn the eve of the election, during the annual [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]] parade in Montreal, rioting [[Quebec separatism|Qu\u00e9bec sovereignists]] threw rocks and bottles at the grandstand where Trudeau was seated, chanting \"Trudeau au poteau!\" (Trudeau \u2013 to the stake!).

Five days later Qu\u00e9bec Labour Minister [[Pierre Laporte]] was also kidnapped.

Stanfield proposed the immediate introduction of [[wage and price controls]] to help end the increasing [[inflation]] Canada was currently facing.

The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted [[Reference re Anti-Inflation Act|a Supreme Court reference]] that only upheld the legislation as an [[Peace, Order, and Good Government|emergency requiring Federal intervention]] under the ''[[British North America Act]]''. During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] business leaders.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=290-94}}\n\nTrudeau continued his attempts at increasing Canada's international profile, including joining the [[G7]] group of major economic powers in 1976 at the behest of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford]].{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|p=?}} On July 14, 1976, after long and emotional debate, Bill C-84 was passed by the House of Commons by a vote of 130 to 124, abolishing the [[Capital punishment in Canada|death penalty]] completely and instituting a life sentence without parole for 25 years for first-degree murder.<ref name=\"Radio Canada\">{{cite web |title = Le grandes etapes de l'abolition |url = http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Dossiers/peinedemort/contenu_bas_03a.asp |publisher = [[Radio Canada]]|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nTrudeau faced increasing challenges in Qu\u00e9bec, starting with bitter relations with Bourassa and his [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] government in Qu\u00e9bec. After a rise in the polls after the rejection of the Victoria Charter, the Qu\u00e9bec Liberals had taken a more confrontational approach with the Federal government on the constitution, [[Bill 22|French language laws]], and the language of [[air traffic control]] in Qu\u00e9bec.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=302-306}} Trudeau responded with increasing anger at what he saw as nationalist provocations against the Federal government's bilingualism and constitutional initiatives, at times expressing his personal contempt for Bourassa.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=302-306}}\n\nPartially in an attempt to shore up his support, Bourassa called a [[1976 Quebec general election|surprise election in 1976]] that resulted in [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]] and the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] (PQ) winning a majority government. The PQ had chiefly campaigned on a \"good government\" platform, but promised a referendum on independence to be held within their first mandate. Trudeau and L\u00e9vesque had been personal rivals, with Trudeau's intellectualism contrasting with L\u00e9vesque's more working-class image. While Trudeau claimed to welcome the \"clarity\" provided by the PQ victory, the unexpected rise of the sovereignist movement became, in his view, his biggest challenge.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=308}}\n\nAs the PQ began to take power, Trudeau faced the prolonged failure of his marriage, which was covered in lurid detail on a day-by-day basis by the English language press.

They changed for the better when Trudeau and [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter (1977-81)]] found a better rapport. The late 1970s saw a more sympathetic American attitude toward Canadian political and economic needs, the pardoning of draft evaders who had moved to Canada, and the passing of old sore points such as Watergate and the Vietnam War. Canada more than ever welcomed American investments during the \"[[stagflation]]\" (high inflation and high unemployment at the same time) that hurt both nations in the 1970s.<ref>Lily Gardner Feldman, \"Canada and the United States in the 1970s: Rift and Reconciliation.\" ''The World Today'' 34.12 (1978): 484-492.

Trudeau and his advisors, to contrast with the mild-mannered Clark, based their campaign on Trudeau's decisive personality and his grasp of the Constitution file, despite the general public's apparent wariness of both. The traditional Liberal rally at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] saw Trudeau stressing the importance of major constitutional reform to general ennui, and his campaign \"photo-ops\" were typically surrounded by picket lines and protesters. Though polls portended disaster, Clark's struggles justifying his party's populist platform and a strong Trudeau performance in the election debate helped bring the Liberals to the point of contention.{{sfn|English (2009)|loc=chpt. 13}}\n\nThough winning the popular vote by four points, the Liberal vote was concentrated in Qu\u00e9bec and faltered in industrial Ontario, allowing the PCs to win the seat-count handily and form a minority government. Trudeau soon announced his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and favoured Donald Macdonald to be his successor.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265}}\n\nHowever, before a [[leadership convention]] could be held, with Trudeau's blessing and [[Allan MacEachen]]'s manoeuvring in the house, the Liberals supported an NDP subamendment to Clark's budget stating that the House had no confidence in the budget. In Canada, as in most other countries with a [[Westminster system]], budget votes are indirectly considered to be votes of confidence in the government, and their [[loss of supply|failure]] automatically brings down the government. Liberal and NDP votes and Social Credit abstentions led to the subamendment passing 139-133, thereby toppling Clark's government and triggering a new election for a House less than a year old. The Liberal caucus, along with friends and advisers persuaded Trudeau to stay on as leader and fight the election, with Trudeau's main impetus being the upcoming referendum on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265\u201366}}\n\nTrudeau and the Liberals engaged in a new strategy for the February 1980 election: facetiously called the \"low bridge\", it involved dramatically underplaying Trudeau's role and avoiding media appearances, to the point of refusing a televised debate.

He was succeeded by John Turner, a former [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet minister]] under both Trudeau and Lester Pearson.\n\nThe Liberal victory in 1980 highlighted a sharp geographical divide in the country: the party had won no seats west of [[Manitoba]]. Trudeau, in an attempt to represent Western interests, offered to form a coalition government with Ed Broadbent's NDP, which had won 22 seats in the west, but was rebuffed by Broadbent out of fear the party would have no influence in a majority government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=446-7}}\n\nThe first challenge Trudeau faced upon re-election was the May 20, [[1980 Quebec referendum]] on Qu\u00e9bec sovereignty, called by the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government under Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque. Trudeau immediately initiated federal involvement in the referendum, reversing the Clark government's policy of leaving the issue to the Qu\u00e9bec Liberals and [[Claude Ryan]]. He appointed Jean Chr\u00e9tien as the nominal spokesman for the federal government, helping to push the \"Non\" cause to working-class voters who tuned out the intellectual Ryan and Trudeau.

He advised [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauv\u00e9]] to appoint over 200 Liberals to [[patronage]] positions.  He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments.

In the [[1993 Canadian federal election]], the Progressive Conservatives faced a larger defeat, when cut to two seats.\n\n===Patriation of the constitution===\n\nIn 1982 Trudeau succeeded in repatriating the Constitution.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/> The British Parliament passed an act ceding to the Canadian federal government, full responsibility for amending Canada's national charter.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\"/> Earlier in his tenure, he had met with opposition from the provincial governments, most notably with the Victoria Charter. Provincial premiers were united in their concerns regarding an amending formula, a court-enforced Charter of Rights, and a further devolution of powers to the provinces. In 1980, Chr\u00e9tien was tasked with creating a constitutional settlement following the Qu\u00e9bec referendum in which Quebecers voted to remain in Canada.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=459}}\n\nAfter chairing a series of increasingly acrimonious conferences with first ministers on the issue, Trudeau announced the intention of the federal government to proceed with a request to the British parliament to patriate the constitution, with additions to be approved by a referendum without input from provincial governments. Trudeau was backed by the NDP, Ontario Premier [[Bill Davis]], and New Brunswick Premier [[Richard Hatfield]] and was opposed by the remaining premiers and PC leader Joe Clark. After numerous provincial governments challenged the legality of the decision using their [[Reference question|reference power]], conflicting decisions prompted a [[Patriation Reference|Supreme Court decision]] that stated unilateral patriation was legal, but was in contravention of a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the provinces be consulted and have general agreement to the changes.\n\nAfter the court decision, which prompted some reservations in the British parliament of accepting a unilateral request,<ref>\n{{Cite journal |first = Andrew |last = Heard |title = Canadian Independence |year = 1990 |place = Vancouver |publisher = Simon Fraser University |url = https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html |accessdate = August 25, 2010 }}</ref> Trudeau agreed to meet with the premiers one more time before proceeding. At the meeting, Trudeau reached an agreement with nine of the premiers on patriating the constitution and implementing the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, with the caveat that provincial legislatures would have the ability to use a [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] to protect some laws from judicial oversight. The notable exception was L\u00e9vesque, who, Trudeau believed, would never have signed an agreement. The objection of the Qu\u00e9bec government to the new constitution became a source of continued acrimony between the federal and Qu\u00e9bec governments, and would forever stain Trudeau's reputation amongst nationalists in the province.\n\nThe ''[[Canada Act]]'', which included the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' and the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', was proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, as [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]], on April 17, 1982.\n\n==Retirement==\nTrudeau joined the Montreal law firm [[Heenan Blaikie]] as counsel and settled in the historic [[Maison Cormier]] in Montreal following his retirement from politics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Annmarie|last2=Macdonell|first2=Cameron|title=Making Himself at Home: Cormier, Trudeau, and the Architecture of Domestic Masculinity|journal=Winterthur Portfolio|date=2016|volume=50|issue=2/3|pages=151\u2013189|doi=10.1086/689984}}</ref> Though he rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]] proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. His opposition to both Accords was considered one of the major factors leading to the defeat of the two proposals.\n\nHe also continued to speak against the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and the sovereignty movement with less effect.\n\nTrudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the [[Club of Rome]].  He met with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and other leaders in 1985; shortly afterwards Gorbachev met President [[Ronald Reagan]] to discuss easing world tensions.\n\nHe published his memoirs in 1993.<ref name=\"Trudeau_Memoirs_1993\">{{cite book |title=Memoirs |location=Toronto |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |date=1993 |isbn=0-7710-8588-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirs00trud/page/n15/mode/2up |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> The book sold hundreds of thousands of copies in several editions, and became one of the most successful Canadian books ever published.\n\nIn his [[old age]], he was afflicted with [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[prostate cancer]], and became less active, although he continued to work at his law practice until a few months before his death at the age of 80.

While mostly private about his beliefs, he made it clear that he was a believer, stating, in an interview with the ''United Church Observer'' in 1971: \"I believe in life after death, I believe in God and I'm a Christian.\" Trudeau maintained, however, that he preferred to impose constraints on himself rather than have them imposed from the outside. In this sense, he believed he was more like a Protestant than a Catholic of the era in which he was schooled.{{sfn|Trudeau (1996)|pp=302\u2013303}}\n\nMichael W. Higgins, a former President of Catholic [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]], researched Trudeau's spirituality and finds that it incorporated elements of three Catholic traditions. The first of these was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who provided his education up to the college level. Trudeau frequently displayed the logic and love of argument consistent with that tradition. A second great spiritual influence in Trudeau's life was [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. According to Michel Gourgues, professor at [[Dominican University College]], Trudeau \"considered himself a lay Dominican\".{{attribution needed|date=May 2016}} He studied philosophy under Dominican Father [[Louis-Marie R\u00e9gis]] and remained close to him throughout his life, regarding R\u00e9gis as \"spiritual director and friend\". Another skein in Trudeau's spirituality was a [[Contemplation|contemplative]] aspect acquired from his association with the [[Benedictine]] tradition. According to Higgins, Trudeau was convinced of the centrality of [[Christian meditation|meditation]] in a life fully lived. Trudeau meditated regularly after being initiated into [[Transcendental Meditation]] by the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Maharishi : the biography of the man who gave transcendental meditation to the world|last=Mason, Paul, 1952-|isbn=1852305711|location=Shaftesbury, Dorset|oclc=31133549|year = 1994}}</ref> He took retreats at [[Saint-Beno\u00eet-du-Lac, Qu\u00e9bec]] and regularly attended [[Liturgy of the Hours|Hours]] and the [[Eucharist]] at Montreal's Benedictine community.{{sfn|Higgins, M.

Retrieved: September 24, 2015.</ref>\n\nTrudeau's most enduring legacy may lie in his contribution to [[Canadian nationalism]], and of pride in Canada in and for itself rather than as a derivative of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. His role in this effort, and his related battles with Qu\u00e9bec on behalf of Canadian unity, cemented his political position when in office despite the controversies he faced\u2014and remain the most remembered aspect of his tenure afterwards.\n\nSome consider Trudeau's economic policies to have been a weak point. Inflation and unemployment marred much of his tenure as prime minister. When Trudeau took office in 1968 Canada had a debt of $18&nbsp;billion (24% of GDP) which was largely left over from World War II, when he left office in 1984, that debt stood at $200&nbsp;billion (46% of GDP), an increase of 83% in real terms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csls.ca/data/ipt2006.pdf | title=GDP figures | publisher=Centre for the Study of Living Standards | date=2006 | accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> However, these trends were present in most western countries at the time, including the United States.\n\nMany politicians still use the term \"taking a walk in the snow\", the line Trudeau used to describe how he arrived at the decision to leave office in 1984. Other popular Trudeauisms frequently used are \"[[just watch me]]\", the \"[[Finger (gesture)|Trudeau Salute]]\", and \"[[Fuddle duddle|Fuddle Duddle]]\".\n\n[[Maclean's]] 1997 and 2011 scholarly surveys [[Historical rankings of Canadian prime ministers|ranked him twice]] as the fifth best Canadian prime minister.<ref>{{cite magazine |url = http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/canadas-best-prime-ministers/ |title = Canada's best prime ministers |magazine = [[Maclean's]] |date = June 10, 2011 |accessdate = August 25, 2015 |author = Hillmer. Norman and Stephen Azzi }}</ref>\n\n===Constitutional legacy===\nOne of Trudeau's most enduring legacies is the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution\u2014which replaced Canada's ties to Britain with its own constitution, the 1982 ''1982 Constitution Act''.<ref name=\"NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy\">{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |title=Pierre Trudeau Is Dead at 80; Dashing Fighter for Canada |first=Michael T. |last=Kaufman |date=September 29, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/world/pierre-trudeau-is-dead-at-80-dashing-fighter-for-canada.html|access-date=February 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525032137/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/world/pierre-trudeau-is-dead-at-80-dashing-fighter-for-canada.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |archive-date=May 25, 2013}}</ref>\nThis included a domestic amending formula and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is seen as advancing [[civil rights]] and liberties and has become a cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians. It also represented the final step in Trudeau's liberal vision of a fully independent Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms as well as those of linguistic and cultural minorities. Court challenges based on the Charter of Rights have been used to advance the cause of women's equality, re-establish French school boards in provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, and to mandate the adoption of [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] all across Canada. [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Section 35]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', has clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of [[Metis (people)|M\u00e9tis]]. Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups. The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the override (notwithstanding clause) of the charter has been infrequently used.\n\n[[Canadian conservatism|Canadian conservatives]] claim the constitution has resulted in too much [[judicial activism]] on the part of the courts in Canada. It is also heavily criticized by [[Quebec nationalism|Qu\u00e9bec nationalists]], who resent that the 1982 amendments to the constitution were never ratified by any [[Politics of Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec government]] and the constitution does not recognize a constitutional veto for Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n===Bilingualism===\n{{See also|Bilingualism in Canada}}\nBilingualism is one of Trudeau's most lasting accomplishments, having been fully integrated into the Federal government's services, documents, and broadcasting (though not, however, in provincial governments, except for Ontario, New Brunswick, and Manitoba). While official bilingualism has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians would be able to function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were.\n\nHowever, Trudeau's ambitions in this arena have been overstated: Trudeau once said that he regretted the use of the term \"bilingualism\", because it appeared to demand that all Canadians speak two languages. In fact, Trudeau's vision was to see Canada as a bilingual confederation in which ''all'' cultures would have a place. In this way, his conception broadened beyond simply the relationship of Qu\u00e9bec to Canada.\n\n===Multiculturalism===\nOn October 8, 1971, Pierre Trudeau introduced the Multiculturalism Policy in the House of Commons.  It was the first of its kind in the world,{{sfn|English (2009)|p=142}} and was then emulated in several provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and other countries most notably Australia, which has had a similar history and immigration pattern.  Beyond the specifics of the policy itself, this action signalled an openness to the world and coincided with a more open immigration policy that had been brought in by Trudeau's predecessor Lester B. Pearson.\n\n===Cultural legacy===\nIn the last years of his tenure, he ensured both the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] had proper homes in the national capital region. The Trudeau government also implemented programs which mandated [[Canadian content]] in film, and broadcasting, and gave substantial subsidies to develop the Canadian media and cultural industries. Though the policies remain controversial, Canadian media industries have become stronger since Trudeau's arrival.\n\n===Legacy in western Canada===\nTrudeau's posthumous reputation in the Western Provinces is notably less favourable than in the rest of English-speaking Canada, and he is sometimes regarded as the \"father of Western alienation\".  To many westerners, Trudeau's policies seemed to favour other parts of the country, especially [[Ontario]] and Qu\u00e9bec, at their expense. Outstanding among such policies was the National Energy Program, which was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country.

During a visit to [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met with a group of farmers who were protesting the [[Canadian Wheat Board]]. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with  \"Why should ''I'' sell your wheat?\"&nbsp;\u2013 however, he had asked the [[rhetorical question|question rhetorically]] and then proceeded to answer it himself.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/chretien-accused-of-lying|title=Chr\u00e9tien Accused of Lying|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 21, 2019}}, [[Maclean's]], December 23, 1996</ref> Years later, on a train trip through [[Salmon Arm, British Columbia]], he \"gave the finger\" to a group of protesters through the carriage window&nbsp;\u2013 less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.<ref>Anthony Westell, ''Paradox: Trudeau as Prime Minister''.</ref>\n\n===Legacy in Qu\u00e9bec===\nTrudeau's legacy in Qu\u00e9bec is mixed. Many credit his actions during the October Crisis as crucial in terminating the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) as a force in Qu\u00e9bec, and ensuring that the campaign for Qu\u00e9bec separatism took a democratic and peaceful route. However, his [[War Measures Act#The October Crisis|imposition of the ''War Measures Act'']]\u2014which received majority support at the time\u2014is remembered by some in Qu\u00e9bec and elsewhere as an attack on democracy. Trudeau is also credited by many for the defeat of the 1980 Quebec referendum.\n\nAt the federal level, Trudeau faced almost no strong political opposition in Qu\u00e9bec during his time as Prime Minister. For instance, his Liberal party captured 74 out of 75 Qu\u00e9bec seats in the [[List of Canadian federal general elections|1980 federal election]]. Provincially, though, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois twice elected the pro-sovereignty Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Moreover, there were not at that time any pro-sovereignty federal parties such as the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]. Since the signing of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' in 1982 and until 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada had not succeeded in winning a majority of seats in Qu\u00e9bec. He was disliked by the Quebecois nationalists.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213210244/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/trudeau.htm Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Quebec and the Constitution], marianopolis.edu; retrieved July 7, 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy with respect to indigenous peoples in Canada ===\nIn 1969, Trudeau along with his then Minister of Indian Affairs Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Trudeau proposed the [[1969 White Paper]] (officially entitled Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy). Under the legislation of the White Paper, Indian Status would be eliminated. First Nations Peoples would be incorporated fully into provincial government responsibilities as equal Canadian citizens, and reserve status would be removed imposing the laws of private property in indigenous communities. Any special programs or considerations that had been allowed to First Nations people under previous legislation would be terminated, as the special considerations were seen by the Government to act as a means to further separate Indian peoples from Canadian citizens. This proposal was seen by many as racist and an attack on Canada's aboriginal population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kerr|first=Elisabetta|date=September 2017|title=Pierre Trudeau's White Paper and the Struggle for Aboriginal Rights in Canada|url=https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=gljuh|journal=The Great Lakes Journal of Undergraduate History|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facinghistory.org/stolen-lives-indigenous-peoples-canada-and-indian-residential-schools/chapter-8/white-paper-red-paper|title=White Paper, Red Paper|website=Facing History and Ourselves|access-date=July 31, 2019}}</ref> The Paper proposed the general assimilation of First Nations into the Canadian body politic through the elimination of the ''[[Indian Act]]'' and Indian status, the parcelling of reserve land to private owners, and the elimination of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. The White Paper prompted the first major national mobilization of Indian and Aboriginal activists against the federal government's proposal, leading to Trudeau setting aside the legislation.\n\n===Intellectual contributions===\nTrudeau was a strong advocate for a [[federalism|federalist]] model of government in Canada, developing and promoting his ideas in response and contrast to strengthening Qu\u00e9bec nationalist movements, for instance the social and political atmosphere created during Maurice Duplessis' time in power.<ref>Gagnon (2000).</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nFederalism in this context can be defined as \"a particular way of sharing political power among different peoples within a state...Those who believe in federalism hold that different peoples do not need states of their own in order to enjoy self-determination. Peoples&nbsp;... may agree to share a single state while retaining substantial degrees of self-government over matters essential to their identity as peoples\".<ref>Ignatieff, quoted in Balthazar (1995), p. 6.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nAs a social democrat, Trudeau sought to combine and harmonize his theories on [[social democracy]] with those of federalism so that both could find effective expression in Canada. He noted the ostensible conflict between socialism, with its usually strong centralist government model, and federalism, which expounded a division and cooperation of power by both federal and provincial levels of government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p={{page needed|date=May 2016}}}} In particular, Trudeau stated the following about socialists:{{quote|[R]ather than water down&nbsp;... their socialism, must constantly seek ways of adapting it to a bicultural society governed under a federal constitution. And since the future of Canadian federalism lies clearly in the direction of co-operation, the wise socialist will turn his thoughts in that direction, keeping in mind the importance of establishing buffer zones of joint sovereignty and co-operative zones of joint administration between the two levels of government{{sfn|English (2009)|p=141}}}}\n\nTrudeau pointed out that in sociological terms, Canada is inherently a federalist society, forming unique regional identities and priorities, and therefore a federalist model of spending and jurisdictional powers is most appropriate. He argues, \"in the age of the mass society, it is no small advantage to foster the creation of quasi-sovereign communities at the provincial level, where power is that much less remote from the people.\"{{sfn|English (2009)|p=133}}\n\nTrudeau's idealistic plans for a cooperative Canadian federalist state were resisted and hindered as a result of his narrowness on ideas of identity and socio-cultural pluralism: \"While the idea of a 'nation' in the sociological sense is acknowledged by Trudeau, he considers the allegiance which it generates\u2014emotive and particularistic\u2014to be contrary to the idea of cohesion between humans, and as such creating fertile ground for the internal fragmentation of states and a permanent state of conflict\".<ref name=\"Gagnon2000pp16-17\">Gagnon (2000), 16\u201317.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}\n\nThis position garnered significant criticism for Trudeau, in particular from Qu\u00e9bec and First Nations peoples on the basis that his theories denied their rights to nationhood.<ref name=\"Gagnon2000pp16-17\"/>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}   First Nations communities raised particular concerns with the proposed 1969 White Paper, developed under Trudeau by Jean Chr\u00e9tien.\n\n==Supreme Court appointments==\nTrudeau chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] by the Governor General:\n\n* [[Bora Laskin]] (March 19, 1970 \u2013 March 17, 1984; as Chief Justice, December 27, 1973)\n* [[Joseph Honor\u00e9 G\u00e9rald Fauteux]] (as
