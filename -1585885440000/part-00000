SARS-CoV-2 is [[Contagious disease|contagious]] in humans, and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has designated [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|the ongoing pandemic]] of COVID-19 a <!--It is both a pandemic and a PHEIC.

via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up

[[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected people.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nWhether the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain.<ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" />\n\n===Reservoir===\n[[File:Rhinolophus rouxii.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A horseshoe bat|[[Horseshoe bat]]s are among the most likely [[natural

humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the [[Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CCDC) and other institutions;<ref name=\"gisaid\"/><ref name=\"VirologicalInitial\" /> the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a [[common ancestor]]\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> {{As of|2020|March|27|post=,}} 1,495 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled on six continents were publicly available.<ref name=\"NextstrainMarch\" />\n\nOn 11 February 2020, the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses on the basis of five [[conserved sequence]]s of [[nucleic acid]]s, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|virus strain from the 2003 SARS outbreak]] were insufficient to make them separate [[viral species]]. Therefore, they identified 2019-nCoV as a [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of ''[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus]]''.<ref name=\"CoronavirusStudyGroup\" />\n\n===Structural biology===\n[[File:Coronavirus virion structure.svg|alt=Figure of a spherical SARSr-CoV virion showing locations of structural proteins forming the viral envelope and the inner nucleocapsid|thumb|right|Structure of a SARSr-CoV virion]]\n\nEach SARS-CoV-2 [[virion]] is approximately 50\u2013200 [[nanometre]]s in diameter.<ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N ([[nucleocapsid]]) proteins; the N protein holds the RNA genome, and the S, E, and M proteins together create the [[viral envelope]].<ref name=\"WuStructure\" /> The spike protein, which has been imaged at the atomic level using [[cryogenic electron microscopy]],<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /><ref name=\"GZM-20200220\" /> is the protein responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the [[cell membrane|membrane]] of a host cell.<ref name=\"WuStructure\" />\n\n[[File:6VSB spike protein SARS-CoV-2 monomer in homotrimer.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=SARS-CoV-2 spike homotrimer with one protein subunit highlighted; ACE2 binding domain highlighted|SARS-CoV-2 spike [[homotrimer]] with one [[protein subunit]] highlighted; ACE2 binding domain in magenta]]\n\n[[Protein structure prediction|Protein modeling]] experiments on the spike protein of the virus soon suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has sufficient affinity to the [[angiotensin converting enzyme 2]] (ACE2) receptors of human cells to use them as a mechanism of [[Viral entry|cell entry]].<ref name=\"SCLSModeling\" /> By 22 January 2020, a group in China working with the full virus genome and a group in the United States using [[reverse genetics]] methods independently and experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 could act as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"Letko22Jan2020\" /><ref name=\"NatMicLetko\" /><ref name=\"ElSahly\" /><ref name=\"Gralinski2020\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity to human ACE2 than the original SARS virus strain.<ref name=\"SCI-20200219\" /> SARS-CoV-2 may also use [[basigin]] to gain cell entry.<ref name=\"CD147\" />\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | total_width = 400 | image1 = SARS-CoV-2 49531042877.jpg | alt1 = SARS-CoV-2 emerging from a human cell | image2 = SARS-CoV-2 scanning electron microscope image.jpg | alt2 = SARS-CoV-2 virions emerging from a human cell | footer_align = center | footer = Digitally colourised [[Micrograph|electron micrographs]] of SARS-CoV-2 virions (yellow) emerging from human cells [[Cell culture|cultured]] in a laboratory}}\n\nInitial spike protein priming by [[TMPRSS2|transmembrane protease, serine 2]] (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"HoffmanCell\" /> After a SARS-CoV-2 virion attaches to a target cell, the cell's [[protease]] TMPRSS2 cuts open the spike protein of the virus, exposing a [[fusion peptide]].

of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.

These are all found in humans, with the exception of the barrel cortex, but many species have counterparts similar to our own regions of neuropil. However, the degree of similarity depends upon the composition of neuropil being compared. The concentrations of neuropil within certain regions are important to determine because simply using the proportions of the different postsynaptic elements does not verify the necessary, conclusive evidence. Comparing the concentrations can determine whether or not proportions of different postsynaptic elements contacted a particular axonal pathway. Relative concentrations could signify a reflection of different postsynaptic elements in the neuropil or show that axons sought out and formed synapses only with specific postsynaptic elements.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book|last=White|first=Edward L.|title=Cortical Circuits Synaptic Organization of the Cerebral Cortex Structure, Function, and Theory|year=1989|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Boston|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3402-5|first2=Asaf|last2=Keller|author3=Introduction by Thomas A. Woolsey}}</ref>\n\n==Function==\nSince neuropils have a diverse role in the nervous system, it is difficult to define a certain overarching function for all neuropils. For instance, the olfactory glomeruli function as sorts of way-stations for the information flowing from the [[olfactory receptor neuron]]s to the olfactory cortex. The inner plexiform layer of the retina is a little more complex. The [[bipolar cell]]s post-synaptic to either rods or cones are either depolarized or hyperpolarized depending on whether the bipolar cells have sign-inverting synapses or a sign-conserving synapses.<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\n===Efficiency in the brain===\nNeurons are necessary for all connections made in the brain, and thus can be thought of as the \"wires\" of the brain. As in computing, an entity is most efficient when its wires are optimized; therefore, a brain which has undergone millions of years of natural selection would be expected to have optimized neural circuitry. To have an optimized neural system it must balance four variables\u2014it must \"minimize conduction delays in axons, passive cable attenuation in dendrites, and the length of 'wire' used to construct circuits\" as well as \"maximize the density of synapses\",<ref name=\"Dmitri\">{{cite journal|first1=Dmitri B.|last1=Chklovskii|first2=Thomas|last2=Schikorski|first3=Charles F.|last3=Stevens|title=Wiring Optimization in Cortical Circuits|journal=Neuron|date=25 April 2002|volume=34|issue=3|pages=341\u2013347<!--|accessdate=20 April 2012-->|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00679-7}}</ref> essentially optimizing the neuropil. Researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory formulated the optimal balance of the four variables and calculated the optimal ratio of axon plus dendrite volume (i.e. the \"wire\" volume or neuropil volume) to total volume of grey matter. The formula predicted an optimal brain with 3/5 (60%) of its volume occupied by neuropil. Experimental evidence taken from three mouse brains agrees with this result. The \"fraction of wire is 0.59 \u00b1 0.036 for layer IV of visual cortex, 0.62 \u00b1 0.055 for layer Ib of piriform cortex, and 0.54 \u00b1 0.035 for the stratum radiatum of hippocampal field CA1.

Abnormal walking behavior and flight behavior are controlled primarily by the central complex and genetic [[mutations]] that disrupt the structure support the hypothesis that the central complex neuropil is a site of behavioral control. However, only specific components of the behavior were affected with the genetic mutations. For example, basic leg coordination of walking was normal, whereas speed, activity, and turning were affected. These observations suggest that the central complex not only plays a role in locomotor behavior, but fine tuning as well.

The most prevalent anatomical region of neuropil is the [[brain]] which, although not completely composed of neuropil, does have the largest and highest synaptically-concentrated areas of neuropil in the body.

These are all found in humans, with the exception of the barrel cortex, but many species have counterparts similar to our own regions of neuropil. However, the degree of similarity depends upon the composition of neuropil being compared. The concentrations of neuropil within certain regions are important to determine because simply using the proportions of the different postsynaptic elements does not verify the necessary, conclusive evidence. Comparing the concentrations can determine whether or not proportions of different postsynaptic elements contacted a particular axonal pathway. Relative concentrations could signify a reflection of different postsynaptic elements in the neuropil or show that axons sought out and formed synapses only with specific postsynaptic elements.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book|last=White|first=Edward L.|title=Cortical Circuits Synaptic Organization of the Cerebral Cortex Structure, Function, and Theory|year=1989|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Boston|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3402-5|first2=Asaf|last2=Keller|author3=Introduction by Thomas A. Woolsey}}</ref>\n\n==Function==\nSince neuropils have a diverse role in the nervous system, it is difficult to define a certain overarching function for all neuropils. For instance, the olfactory glomeruli function as sorts of way-stations for the information flowing from the [[olfactory receptor neuron]]s to the olfactory cortex. The inner plexiform layer of the retina is a little more complex. The [[bipolar cell]]s post-synaptic to either rods or cones are either depolarized or hyperpolarized depending on whether the bipolar cells have sign-inverting synapses or a sign-conserving synapses.<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\n===Efficiency in the brain===\nNeurons are necessary for all connections made in the brain, and thus can be thought of as the \"wires\" of the brain. As in computing, an entity is most efficient when its wires are optimized; therefore, a brain which has undergone millions of years of natural selection would be expected to have optimized neural circuitry. To have an optimized neural system it must balance four variables\u2014it must \"minimize conduction delays in axons, passive cable attenuation in dendrites, and the length of 'wire' used to construct circuits\" as well as \"maximize the density of synapses\",<ref name=\"Dmitri\">{{cite journal|first1=Dmitri B.|last1=Chklovskii|first2=Thomas|last2=Schikorski|first3=Charles F.|last3=Stevens|title=Wiring Optimization in Cortical Circuits|journal=Neuron|date=25 April 2002|volume=34|issue=3|pages=341\u2013347<!--|accessdate=20 April 2012-->|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00679-7}}</ref> essentially optimizing the neuropil. Researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory formulated the optimal balance of the four variables and calculated the optimal ratio of axon plus dendrite volume (i.e. the \"wire\" volume or neuropil volume) to total volume of grey matter. The formula predicted an optimal brain with 3/5 (60%) of its volume occupied by neuropil. Experimental evidence taken from three mouse brains agrees with this result. The \"fraction of wire is 0.59 \u00b1 0.036 for layer IV of visual cortex, 0.62 \u00b1 0.055 for layer Ib of piriform cortex, and 0.54 \u00b1 0.035 for the stratum radiatum of hippocampal field CA1.

Researchers have tied the disease to a decrease in the expression of drebrin, a protein thought to play a role in [[long-term potentiation]], meaning the neurons would lose plasticity and have trouble forming new connections. This malfunction presents itself in the form of helical filaments that tangle together in the neuropil. This same phenomenon seems to occur in the elderly as well.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Braak|first=Heiko and Eva|title=Occurrence of neuropil threads in the senile human brain and in Alzheimer's disease: A third location of paired helical filaments outside of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques|journal=Neuroscience Letters|doi=10.1016/0304-3940(86)90288-0|volume=65|issue=3|pages=351\u2013355|year=1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Smythies|first=John|title=Disorders of Synaptic Plasticity and Schizophrenia|year=2004|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=San Diego, California|isbn=978-0-12-366860-8|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\n===Other mammals===\nA significant non-human area of neuropil is the barrel cortex found in mammals with whiskers (e.g. cats, dogs and rodents); each \"barrel\" in the cortex is a region of neuropil where the input from a single whisker terminates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wollsey |first=Thomas |title=Barrel Cortex |url=http://nslc.wustl.edu/courses/bio3411/woolsey/2010/Lecture11/WoolseyTA03.pdf |accessdate=21 April 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n====Significance of neuropil difference in chimpanzees and humans====\nNeuropil have been hypothesized to be a key factor in differentiating human cognitive capacity from that of other animals. In one study comparing chimpanzee and human [[frontopolar cortex]] and the frontoinsular cortex neuropil, it was found that humans exhibit a significantly higher neuropil fraction than the other areas of their brain. This suggests that as we evolved our prefrontal cortex developed denser neuropil which translates to more neural connections.

The neuropil in ''Drosophila'' Ellipsoid is composed of four substructures. Each section has been observed in several insects as well as the influence it has on [[behavior]], however the exact function of this neuropil has proven elusive. Abnormal walking behavior and flight behavior are controlled primarily by the central complex and genetic [[mutations]] that disrupt the structure support the hypothesis that the central complex neuropil is a site of behavioral control. However, only specific components of the behavior were affected with the genetic mutations. For example, basic leg coordination of walking was normal, whereas speed, activity, and turning were affected. These observations suggest that the central complex not only plays a role in locomotor behavior, but fine tuning as well. There is also additional evidence that the neuropil may function in [[olfaction|olfactory]] associative learning and [[memory]].<ref name=\"Renn\">{{cite journal|last=Renn|first=Susan C. P.|first2=J.
