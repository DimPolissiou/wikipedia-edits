It was the first major sea battle between [[Ironclad warship|ironclads]] and one of the last to involve deliberate [[ramming]].\n\nThe Italian navy fired roughly 1450 shots during the engagement, but failed to sink any Austrian ship while losing two ironclads. One of the main reasons for this poor performance was internal rivalry between the Italian fleet commanders: for example, Italian [[Vice admiral|Vice Admiral]] Albini, with his ships, did not engage the enemy during the battle.<ref name=\"splinder\">{{cite web|url=http://lastoriamilitare.splinder.com/post/21381582/1866-quel-brutto-pasticcio-di-lissa.|publisher=lastoriamilitare.splinder.com|title=The Italian \"mistakes\" in Lissa battle (in Italian)|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref> The engagement was made up of several small battles: the main battle was between seven Austrian and four Italian ironclads and showed the ability of Austrian commander Tegetthoff to divide his more numerous opponents and then destroy the isolated ironclads.\n\n==Historical situation==\nThe battle occurred as part of the [[Third War of Italian Independence]], in which Italy allied with [[Prussia]] in the course of its [[Austro-Prussian War|conflict]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. The major Italian objective was to capture [[Venice]] and at least part of [[Veneto|its surrounds]] from Austria.\n\nThe fleets were composed of a mix of unarmoured [[sailing ship]]s with [[steam engine]]s, and armoured [[ironclad]]s also combining sails and steam engines. The Italian fleet of 12 ironclads and 17 unarmoured ships outnumbered the Austrian fleet of 7 and 11 respectively. The Austrians were also severely outmatched in rifled guns (276 to 121) and total weight of metal (53,236 tons to 23,538 tons).<ref name=\"Stevens257\">[[#Stevens|Stevens (1942)]], p. 257</ref> A single [[turret ship]] took part in the action \u2014 the Italian ''[[Italian battleship Affondatore|Affondatore]]''.\n\nPiedmontese Count [[Carlo di Persano]] commanded the Italian fleet, while the Austrian fleet was commanded by ''Konteradmiral'' [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]].\n\nThe fort on the island of Lissa was under the command of ''Oberst'' David Urs de Margina, an ethnic Romanian from Transylvania.\n\n==Plans for the battle==\nThe Italian fleet under Persano was divided into three divisions: Persano commanded the main battle force with 9 ironclads; his deputy, Albini, commanded a \"support\" division (engaged mainly in landings); and Admiral Vacca commanded a third \"reserve\" division with minor wooden ships.\n\nThe attacking Austrian fleet was also split into three divisions. The 1st Division consisted of the armoured ships, while the 2nd consisted of the powerful but obsolete unarmoured wooden [[ship of the line]] {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|2}} and 5 frigates. The 3rd Division consisted of the smaller screw gunboats and armed merchantmen. The [[armed merchant cruiser]] ''Stadion'' was ahead of the fleet acting as a scout.\n\nThe three Austrian divisions were formed up into three consecutive arrowhead or \"V\" formations; the armoured 1st division under Tegetthoff was in the van, the weaker gunboats and paddle steamers of the 3rd division to the rear, while the powerful but unarmoured vessels of ''Kommodor'' [[Anton von Petz|Petz]]'s 2nd division were in the centre.\n\nThe Austrian plan, due to their weaker firepower, was to close quickly into a mel\u00e9e, and to use close range fire and ramming to sink a small portion of the Italian fleet, thereby breaking the Italian will to fight.\n\nThe Italians, despite their numerical superiority, were not prepared for battle. They were busy preparing for landings on the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa) when the news that the Austrian fleet was at sea and seeking battle reached them. Persano cancelled the landings, ordered the fleet into [[Line of battle|line abreast]] but having second thoughts, cancelled that order (creating confusion among the Italian commanders) and ordered the fleet into three divisions in a line ahead formation, the same formation as at battles in the age of sail.\n\nThe 1st division in the vanguard consisted of {{ship|Italian ironclad|Principe di Carignano||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Castelfidardo||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Ancona||2}} under Admiral Vacca, Captain 1st Class [[Emilio Fa\u00e0 di Bruno|Fa\u00e0 di Bruno]]'s 2nd division in the centre consisted of {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}}, {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Palestro||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|San Martino||2}}, and the 3rd division to the rear had the {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Regina Maria Pia||2}} and, at the extreme rear, ''Varese'' under Captain Augusto Riboty. In total, the Italians had 11 [[ironclad]]s in the battle line. The other (wooden) ships were dispersed into the battleline. The exception was {{ship|Italian battleship|Affondatore||2}}, which was on the far side of the 2nd squadron and out of the battleline. Persano may have intended this to be an uncommitted reserve.\n\nBefore the battle Persano caused more confusion by deciding to transfer his flag to the {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}} and the 2nd and 3rd Divisions slowed to allow ''Re d{{'}}Italia'' to lower her boats. However the signal to slow down never reached the 1st Division and they continued to steam on, allowing a gap to open in the Italian battle line. To compound the error Persano never signaled the change of flag, and throughout the action the Italians continued to look to the old flagship ''Re d{{'}}Italia'' for orders rather than ''Affondatore''.\n\n==Engagement==\n[[File:Battle of Lissa - 1866 - Initial Situation.svg|thumb|220px|Initial situation of the battle.  Austrian ships are in red and Italian ships are in blue]]\n\n{{Quote|In the Austrian fleet there was enthusiasm but also fear, because the Italian fleet was bigger: 12 ironclads and 19 wooden ships with 641 guns, while the Austrians had only 7 ironclads and 20 wooden ships with 532 guns....When the engagement began, the Italian division Vacca was on a long circuit of the north of Lissa, and so was at first away from the battle. And it is curious that the Albini ships with their 398 guns, though ordered by Persano to do so, did not fire a single shot all through the battle.<ref>Scotti, Giacomo. ''Lissa 1866. la grande battaglia per l'Adriatico'' First chapter: \"Nella flotta austriaca non mancava l\u2019entusiasmo ma erano presenti anche timori, la flotta italiana era pi\u00f9 numerosa:12 corazzate e 19 unit\u00e0 di legno con 641 cannoni.Gli austriaci avevano solo 7 corazzate e 20 unit\u00e0 di legno con 532 cannoni....La divisione Vacca intanto, ormai lontana, stava compiendo un larghissimo giro a nord che la allontanava dalla battaglia.

Tegetthoff, seeing a gap opening between the 1st and 2nd Divisions, forced his fleet into it and concentrated on [[Raking fire|raking]] the Italians and ramming. This meant that he allowed his [[Crossing the T|T to be crossed]]. While the Austrians were approaching, Vacca's 1st Italian Division threw a heavy weight of fire at them. The Austrians could only reply with their [[chase gun]]s. Because Persano was in the process of transferring his flag, no general order was given. The 2nd and 3rd Divisions did not join in and the Austrians crossed the killing area, suffering some serious damage but no ships were lost. ''Drache'' on the extreme right (starboard) wing of the Austrian 1st Division was hit 17 times by heavy shells, losing her mainmast and temporarily losing propulsion. Her captain, Heinrich von Moll,<ref name=\"wikisource\">{{cite web|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK\u00d6:Moll,_Heinrich_Freiherr_von|publisher=de.wikisource.org|title=BLK\u00d6:Moll, Heinrich Freiherr von \u2013 Wikisource|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref> was decapitated by a heavy shell, but his subordinate, [[Karl Weyprecht]], brought the ship back into the fight.\n\nBy 10:43&nbsp;am the Austrians had brought the Italian van to close action. {{SMS|Habsburg|1865|2}}, {{SMS|Salamander|1861|2}} and {{SMS|Kaiser Max|1862|2}} on the Austrian left wing had engaged the Italian 1st Division, while the right wing of {{SMS|Don Juan d'Austria|1875|2}}, {{SMS|Drache||2}} and {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1875|2}} engaged the Italian 2nd Division. Persano, now on the most powerful warship in either fleet, ''Affondatore'', stayed clear of the engagement.<ref>It has been pointed out the contradicting facts that the ''Affondatore'' was the most heavily hit Italian ship, and that even the Austrian battle report recognized that Persano exposed himself to the enemy fire (Storia Militare n. 215, Parma 2011, pp. 56\u201365)</ref>\n\nWith the confusion in the Italian van, ''Kommodor'' von Petz took the opportunity to take his 2nd Division to the Italian rear and fall on their 3rd Division. The unarmoured wooden ships of the Austrian 2nd Division were facing modern ironclads armed with heavy guns, yet despite suffering heavy fire they held together. The [[screw frigate]] {{SMS|Novara|1850|2}} was hit 47 times, and her captain, [[Erik af Klint (1816\u20131866)|Erik af Klint]], was killed. {{SMS|Erzherzog Friedrich|1857|2}} was hit by a heavy shell below the waterline but still remained afloat, while {{SMS|Schwarzenberg||2}} was disabled by heavy Italian fire and set adrift.\n\n==Ramming attacks==\nSeeing things going badly, Persano decided to ram the unarmoured screw battleship ''Kaiser'' rather than one of the armoured ships engaged with the Italian 2nd Division much nearer him. However, ''Kaiser'' managed to dodge ''Affondatore''. Taking heart from his admiral, the captain of ''Re di Portogallo'' laid heavy fire on  ''Kaiser'' with his rifled guns. At the last moment, von Petz turned into the ram, conducting a counter ram. The impact tore off ''Kaiser''{{'}}s stem and bowsprit, leaving her figurehead embedded in ''Re di Portogallo''. The Italian used the opportunity to rake ''Kaiser'' with fire, putting her mainmast and funnel into the sea. The smoke was so great that as they backed off for another ram they lost sight of each other and ended the duel.\n\n[[File:Anton Romako 001.jpg|thumb|widthpx|left|Tegetthoff (centre) at the Battle of Lissa, painting by [[Anton Romako]].]]\n\nAt roughly the same time, Tegetthoff threw his flagship ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'' (commanded by [[Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck]]) at first at the former Italian flagship, ''Re d'Italia'', and then at ''Palestro''. In both cases he scored only glancing blows, but these caused serious damage, especially to ''Palestro'', which was dismasted and set afire.\n\n''Palestro''{{'}}s captain, Cappellini, pulled his ship out of the line. His crew refused to abandon their captain and ''Palestro'' finally blew up and sank at 2.30pm, with only 19 survivors out of a complement of 230.\n\nMeanwhile, ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'' was circling [[Emilio Fa\u00e0 di Bruno|Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}}, pouring on fire before surging forward and achieving a good impact with her ram, aided by the Italian having reversed in a poorly thought-out attempt to avoid crossing the Austrian's bows at the crucial moment. This put an {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} hole below ''Re d'Italia''{{'}}s waterline, and she struck her colours and sank two minutes later. According to legend, her captain shot himself after giving the order to strike the colours.<ref>Some eyewitnesses told that the captain jumped overboard; however, he drowned, being unable to swim. ''Storia Militare'' N. 215, pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nAs ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'' limped away, damaged after conducting three ramming attacks, ''Ancona'' closed on her attempting to ram. The Italian gunners got a full broadside off at point blank range, but while they had remembered the gunpowder, in the excitement they had forgotten to load the shot.\n\nAfter his encounter with ''[[Italian battleship Re di Portogallo|Re di Portogallo]]'' earlier in the battle and having fought his way clear of ''Maria Pia'', ''Kommodor'' von Petz's ''Kaiser'' found itself at close range with ''Affondatore''. Despite being a perfect target for a ram, ''Kaiser'' survived when Persano ordered ''Affondatore'' to turn away.<ref>A participant to the battle explained this as being due to ''Affondatore''{{'}}s turret poorly arrayed viewports, which led Persano and her captain to give confusing orders. ''Storia Militare'' n. 215, p. 61.</ref>\n\nTegetthoff's victory was saluted by his mariners \u2013 mainly [[Croats]] and [[Triveneto|Venetians]], from [[Domini di Terraferma|Venetia]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 with the traditional [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] cry of victory: \"Viva San Marco!\" (\"Hurrah with Saint Mark!\").<ref>{{cite journal|title=La battaglia di Lissa|journal=Wars|date=May 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy 15:00, Tegetthoff had led his fleet into the harbour of Lissa, where the damaged ''Kaiser'' had already arrived, undisturbed by the Italian ships; despite Persano's orders to engage the Austrian vessels, both Albini and Vacca ignored the orders, as the latter candidly testified at Persano's trial.<ref>''Storia Militare'' N. 215, p. 62</ref> With his ships low on fuel and ammunition, and his crews spent, Persano led his fleet back towards his home port of Ancona.\n\n''Kaiser''{{'}}s encounter with ''Affondatore'' was the last major action of the battle. With two armoured ships sunk, the Italians withdrew, although there would be some exchange of long range fire for several hours.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Location map\n| Croatia\n| label=Lissa (Vis) | position=left\n| label_size = 90\n| caption =Location of the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa) on a map of [[Croatia]].\n| lat=43.04 | long=16.0\n| background =\n| float = right\n| width = 200\n| AlternativeMap = <!-- none (default)-->\n}}\nIn Italy, Persano announced a victory, causing much initial celebration until the real outcome of the battle was publicized. The outrage over the loss of two ironclads was huge and Persano after the battle was judged by the [[Italian Senate]], condemned for incompetence and stripped of his rank, while Admiral Albini was merely relieved of command, and Admiral Vacca had to retire soon after for age limits.<ref>''Storia Militare'' N. 215, pp. 63\u201365</ref><ref>Bertoldi, Silvio. ''Sangue Sul Mare''. (Mondadori 2006)<!--page?--></ref>\n\nTegetthoff returned home a hero, was promoted ''Vizeadmiral'', and is considered one of the greatest naval commanders in Austrian history.\n\nThe Italian defeat was overshadowed by the crushing Prussian victory over the Austrian Army at [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]. Austria, humbled by Prussia and bullied by [[Napoleon III of France]], agreed to cede Venetia to Italy despite the overall failure of the Italian war effort. Tegetthoff's efforts were instrumental in preventing the Italians from annexing some of the [[Dalmatia]]n islands, which were once part of the [[Republic of Venice]].\n\nThe importance of ramming in the battle led to naval designers, over the next 50 years, equipping future warships (especially battleships and cruisers) with ram bows. This aggravated a number of incidents of ships being sunk by their squadron-mates in accidental collisions. Ramming never featured as a viable battle tactic again. The fixation on ramming may also have inhibited the development of gunnery.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nModern commentators now take the view that Lissa occurred during a period of weapons development when armour was considerably stronger than the guns available to defeat it. This was compounded, on the Italian side, by poor gunnery and, on the Austrian side, by the fact that a number of their ships (including ''Ferdinand Max'') had been forced to go into battle without their full armament owing to the Prussian embargo.\n\n''Kaiser'', remarkably, reported herself fit for action the morning after the battle. Her feat, an unarmored, wooden ship willingly engaging four ironclads at short range, appears to be unprecedented and was never repeated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n==Order of battle==\nVessels are ranked by fighting power (most powerful first).\n\n===Austrian Empire===\n[[File:Kaiser (ship, 1859) - NH 87011.jpg|thumb|SMS ''Kaiser'' at Lissa in the aftermath of the battle, undergoing repairs]]\n\n====1st Division \u2014 Armoured ships====\n* {{SMS|Erzherzog Ferdinand Max|1865|2}} (fleet flag, 2nd class armoured frigate, launched 1865, 5130t, 16-48pdr SB, 4-8pdr SB, 2-3pdr SB. 123&nbsp;mm iron belt over the battery, 12.5kts)\n* {{SMS|Habsburg|1865|2}} (launched 1865, as ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'')\n* {{SMS|Kaiser Max|1862|2}} (3rd class armoured frigate, launched 1862, 3588t, 16-48pdr SB, 1-12pdr SB, 1-6pdr SB, 15-24pdr ML rifles. 110&nbsp;mm iron belt, 11.4kts)\n* {{SMS|Don Juan d'Austria|1862|2}} (launched 1862, as ''Kaiser Max'')\n* {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1862|2}} (launched 1862, as ''Kaiser Max'')\n* {{SMS|Drache||2}} (armoured corvette, launched 1861, 2750t, 10-48pdr SB, 18-24pdr MLR, 1-8pdr SB, 1-4pdr SB landing gun, 115&nbsp;mm iron belt, 11kts)\n* {{SMS|Salamander|1861|2}} (launched 1861, as ''Drache'')\n\n====2nd Division \u2014 Wooden steam warships====\n* {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|2}} (squadron flag, 2-decker screw ship of the line, launched 1858,<ref>{{Cite web |title=The history of Uljanik |url=http://www.uljanik.hr/index.php?id=8&L=0 |publisher=Uljanik d.d. |accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref> 5811t, 2-24pdr ML rifles, 16-40pdr SB, 74-30pdr SB, wooden and unarmoured, 11.5kts)\n* {{SMS|Novara|1850|2}} (screw frigate, launched 1850, 2615t, 4-60pdr shell, 28-30pdr SB, 2-24pdr BL rifles, 1-12pdr landing gun, 1-6pdr landing gun, 12kts)\n* {{SMS|Schwarzenberg||2}} (screw frigate, launched 1853, 2614t, 6-60pdr Paixhans shell guns, 26-30pdr Type 2 ML, 14-30pdr Type 4 ML, 4-24pdr BL rifles, 11kts)\n* {{SMS|Radetzky|1854|2}} (screw frigate, launched 1854, 2234t, 6-60pdr Paixhans shell guns, 40-24pdr SB, 4-24pdr BL rifles, 9kts)\n* {{SMS|Donau|1856|2}} (launched 1856, 2165t, otherwise as ''Radetzky'')\n* {{SMS|Adria|1856|2}} (launched 1856, 2165t, otherwise as ''Radetzky'')\n* {{SMS|Erzherzog Friedrich|1857|2}} (screw corvette, launched 1857, 1697t, 4-60pdr Paixhans shell guns, 16-30pdr SB, 2-24pdr BL rifles, 9kts)\n\n====3rd Division \u2014 Minor craft====\n* ''Narenta'' (screw gunboat, 2-48pdr SB, 2-24pdr BL rifles)\n* ''Kerka'' (as ''Narenta'')\n* ''Hum'' (2nd class gunboat, 2-48pdr SB, 2-24pdr BL rifles, 11?kts)\n* ''Vellebich'' (as ''Hum'')\n* ''Dalmat'' (as ''Hum'')\n* ''Seehund'' (2nd class gunboat, 2-48pdr SB, 2-24pdr BL rifles, 11kts)\n* ''Wal'' (as ''Seehund'')\n* ''Streiter'' (as ''Seehund'')\n* ''Reka'' (as ''Seehund'')\n* ''Andreas Hofer'' (screw tender, 3-30pdr SB)\n* {{SMS|Kaiserin Elizabeth||2}} (sidewheeler steamer (''radaviso''), launched 1854, 4-12pdr SB)\n* ''Greif'' (sidewheel steamer, 2-12pdr SB)\n* ''Stadion'' (unarmed merchant steamer.

It was the first major sea battle between [[Ironclad warship|ironclads]] and one of the last to involve deliberate [[ramming]].\n\nThe Italian navy fired roughly 1450 shots during the engagement, but failed to sink any Austrian ship while losing two ironclads. One of the main reasons for this poor performance was internal rivalry between the Italian fleet commanders: for example, Italian [[Vice admiral|Vice Admiral]] Albini, with his ships, did not engage the enemy during the battle.<ref name=\"splinder\">{{cite web|url=http://lastoriamilitare.splinder.com/post/21381582/1866-quel-brutto-pasticcio-di-lissa.|publisher=lastoriamilitare.splinder.com|title=The Italian \"mistakes\" in Lissa battle (in Italian)|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref> The engagement was made up of several small battles: the main battle was between seven Austrian and four Italian ironclads and showed the ability of Austrian commander Tegetthoff to divide his more numerous opponents and then destroy the isolated ironclads.\n\n==Historical situation==\nThe battle occurred as part of the [[Third War of Italian Independence]], in which Italy allied with [[Prussia]] in the course of its [[Austro-Prussian War|conflict]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. The major Italian objective was to capture [[Venice]] and at least part of [[Veneto|its surrounds]] from Austria.\n\nThe fleets were composed of a mix of unarmoured [[sailing ship]]s with [[steam engine]]s, and armoured [[ironclad]]s also combining sails and steam engines. The Italian fleet of 12 ironclads and 17 unarmoured ships outnumbered the Austrian fleet of 7 and 11 respectively. The Austrians were also severely outmatched in rifled guns (276 to 121) and total weight of metal (53,236 tons to 23,538 tons).<ref name=\"Stevens257\">[[#Stevens|Stevens (1942)]], p. 257</ref> A single [[turret ship]] took part in the action \u2014 the Italian ''[[Italian battleship Affondatore|Affondatore]]''.\n\nPiedmontese Count [[Carlo di Persano]] commanded the Italian fleet, while the Austrian fleet was commanded by ''Konteradmiral'' [[Wilhelm von Tegetthoff]].\n\nThe fort on the island of Lissa was under the command of ''Oberst'' David Urs de Margina, an ethnic Romanian from Transylvania.\n\n==Plans for the battle==\nThe Italian fleet under Persano was divided into three divisions: Persano commanded the main battle force with 9 ironclads; his deputy, Albini, commanded a \"support\" division (engaged mainly in landings); and Admiral Vacca commanded a third \"reserve\" division with minor wooden ships.\n\nThe attacking Austrian fleet was also split into three divisions. The 1st Division consisted of the armoured ships, while the 2nd consisted of the powerful but obsolete unarmoured wooden [[ship of the line]] {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|2}} and 5 frigates. The 3rd Division consisted of the smaller screw gunboats and armed merchantmen. The [[armed merchant cruiser]] ''Stadion'' was ahead of the fleet acting as a scout.\n\nThe three Austrian divisions were formed up into three consecutive arrowhead or \"V\" formations; the armoured 1st division under Tegetthoff was in the van, the weaker gunboats and paddle steamers of the 3rd division to the rear, while the powerful but unarmoured vessels of ''Kommodor'' [[Anton von Petz|Petz]]'s 2nd division were in the centre.\n\nThe Austrian plan, due to their weaker firepower, was to close quickly into a mel\u00e9e, and to use close range fire and ramming to sink a small portion of the Italian fleet, thereby breaking the Italian will to fight.\n\nThe Italians, despite their numerical superiority, were not prepared for battle. They were busy preparing for landings on the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa) when the news that the Austrian fleet was at sea and seeking battle reached them. Persano cancelled the landings, ordered the fleet into [[Line of battle|line abreast]] but having second thoughts, cancelled that order (creating confusion among the Italian commanders) and ordered the fleet into three divisions in a line ahead formation, the same formation as at battles in the age of sail.\n\nThe 1st division in the vanguard consisted of {{ship|Italian ironclad|Principe di Carignano||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Castelfidardo||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Ancona||2}} under Admiral Vacca, Captain 1st Class [[Emilio Fa\u00e0 di Bruno|Fa\u00e0 di Bruno]]'s 2nd division in the centre consisted of {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}}, {{ship|Italian coastal defense ship|Palestro||2}} and {{ship|Italian ironclad|San Martino||2}}, and the 3rd division to the rear had the {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}}, {{ship|Italian ironclad|Regina Maria Pia||2}} and, at the extreme rear, ''Varese'' under Captain Augusto Riboty. In total, the Italians had 11 [[ironclad]]s in the battle line. The other (wooden) ships were dispersed into the battleline. The exception was {{ship|Italian battleship|Affondatore||2}}, which was on the far side of the 2nd squadron and out of the battleline. Persano may have intended this to be an uncommitted reserve.\n\nBefore the battle Persano caused more confusion by deciding to transfer his flag to the {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}} and the 2nd and 3rd Divisions slowed to allow ''Re d{{'}}Italia'' to lower her boats. However the signal to slow down never reached the 1st Division and they continued to steam on, allowing a gap to open in the Italian battle line. To compound the error Persano never signaled the change of flag, and throughout the action the Italians continued to look to the old flagship ''Re d{{'}}Italia'' for orders rather than ''Affondatore''.\n\n==Engagement==\n[[File:Battle of Lissa - 1866 - Initial Situation.svg|thumb|220px|Initial situation of the battle.  Austrian ships are in red and Italian ships are in blue]]\n\n{{Quote|In the Austrian fleet there was enthusiasm but also fear, because the Italian fleet was bigger: 12 ironclads and 19 wooden ships with 641 guns, while the Austrians had only 7 ironclads and 20 wooden ships with 532 guns....When the engagement began, the Italian division Vacca was on a long circuit of the north of Lissa, and so was at first away from the battle. And it is curious that the Albini ships with their 398 guns, though ordered by Persano to do so, did not fire a single shot all through the battle.<ref>Scotti, Giacomo. ''Lissa 1866. la grande battaglia per l'Adriatico'' First chapter: \"Nella flotta austriaca non mancava l\u2019entusiasmo ma erano presenti anche timori, la flotta italiana era pi\u00f9 numerosa:12 corazzate e 19 unit\u00e0 di legno con 641 cannoni.Gli austriaci avevano solo 7 corazzate e 20 unit\u00e0 di legno con 532 cannoni....La divisione Vacca intanto, ormai lontana, stava compiendo un larghissimo giro a nord che la allontanava dalla battaglia. Per quanto sollecitate dal Persano le navi di Albini invece, forti di 398 cannoni, non intervenivano\"</ref>}}\n\nHaving ignored warnings from his pickets of suspicious ships in sight, Persano had effectively allowed the Austrians to ambush his force while it was still forming. Tegetthoff, seeing a gap opening between the 1st and 2nd Divisions, forced his fleet into it and concentrated on [[Raking fire|raking]] the Italians and ramming. This meant that he allowed his [[Crossing the T|T to be crossed]]. While the Austrians were approaching, Vacca's 1st Italian Division threw a heavy weight of fire at them. The Austrians could only reply with their [[chase gun]]s. Because Persano was in the process of transferring his flag, no general order was given. The 2nd and 3rd Divisions did not join in and the Austrians crossed the killing area, suffering some serious damage but no ships were lost. ''Drache'' on the extreme right (starboard) wing of the Austrian 1st Division was hit 17 times by heavy shells, losing her mainmast and temporarily losing propulsion. Her captain, Heinrich von Moll,<ref name=\"wikisource\">{{cite web|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK\u00d6:Moll,_Heinrich_Freiherr_von|publisher=de.wikisource.org|title=BLK\u00d6:Moll, Heinrich Freiherr von \u2013 Wikisource|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref> was decapitated by a heavy shell, but his subordinate, [[Karl Weyprecht]], brought the ship back into the fight.\n\nBy 10:43&nbsp;am the Austrians had brought the Italian van to close action. {{SMS|Habsburg|1865|2}}, {{SMS|Salamander|1861|2}} and {{SMS|Kaiser Max|1862|2}} on the Austrian left wing had engaged the Italian 1st Division, while the right wing of {{SMS|Don Juan d'Austria|1875|2}}, {{SMS|Drache||2}} and {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1875|2}} engaged the Italian 2nd Division. Persano, now on the most powerful warship in either fleet, ''Affondatore'', stayed clear of the engagement.<ref>It has been pointed out the contradicting facts that the ''Affondatore'' was the most heavily hit Italian ship, and that even the Austrian battle report recognized that Persano exposed himself to the enemy fire (Storia Militare n. 215, Parma 2011, pp. 56\u201365)</ref>\n\nWith the confusion in the Italian van, ''Kommodor'' von Petz took the opportunity to take his 2nd Division to the Italian rear and fall on their 3rd Division. The unarmoured wooden ships of the Austrian 2nd Division were facing modern ironclads armed with heavy guns, yet despite suffering heavy fire they held together. The [[screw frigate]] {{SMS|Novara|1850|2}} was hit 47 times, and her captain, [[Erik af Klint (1816\u20131866)|Erik af Klint]], was killed. {{SMS|Erzherzog Friedrich|1857|2}} was hit by a heavy shell below the waterline but still remained afloat, while {{SMS|Schwarzenberg||2}} was disabled by heavy Italian fire and set adrift.\n\n==Ramming attacks==\nSeeing things going badly, Persano decided to ram the unarmoured screw battleship ''Kaiser'' rather than one of the armoured ships engaged with the Italian 2nd Division much nearer him. However, ''Kaiser'' managed to dodge ''Affondatore''. Taking heart from his admiral, the captain of ''Re di Portogallo'' laid heavy fire on  ''Kaiser'' with his rifled guns. At the last moment, von Petz turned into the ram, conducting a counter ram. The impact tore off ''Kaiser''{{'}}s stem and bowsprit, leaving her figurehead embedded in ''Re di Portogallo''. The Italian used the opportunity to rake ''Kaiser'' with fire, putting her mainmast and funnel into the sea. The smoke was so great that as they backed off for another ram they lost sight of each other and ended the duel.\n\n[[File:Anton Romako 001.jpg|thumb|widthpx|left|Tegetthoff (centre) at the Battle of Lissa, painting by [[Anton Romako]].]]\n\nAt roughly the same time, Tegetthoff threw his flagship ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'' (commanded by [[Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck]]) at first at the former Italian flagship, ''Re d'Italia'', and then at ''Palestro''. In both cases he scored only glancing blows, but these caused serious damage, especially to ''Palestro'', which was dismasted and set afire.\n\n''Palestro''{{'}}s captain, Cappellini, pulled his ship out of the line. His crew refused to abandon their captain and ''Palestro'' finally blew up and sank at 2.30pm, with only 19 survivors out of a complement of 230.\n\nMeanwhile, ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'' was circling [[Emilio Fa\u00e0 di Bruno|Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re d'Italia||2}}, pouring on fire before surging forward and achieving a good impact with her ram, aided by the Italian having reversed in a poorly thought-out attempt to avoid crossing the Austrian's bows at the crucial moment. This put an {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} hole below ''Re d'Italia''{{'}}s waterline, and she struck her colours and sank two minutes later. According to legend, her captain shot himself after giving the order to strike the colours.<ref>Some eyewitnesses told that the captain jumped overboard; however, he drowned, being unable to swim. ''Storia Militare'' N. 215, pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nAs ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'' limped away, damaged after conducting three ramming attacks, ''Ancona'' closed on her attempting to ram. The Italian gunners got a full broadside off at point blank range, but while they had remembered the gunpowder, in the excitement they had forgotten to load the shot.\n\nAfter his encounter with ''[[Italian battleship Re di Portogallo|Re di Portogallo]]'' earlier in the battle and having fought his way clear of ''Maria Pia'', ''Kommodor'' von Petz's ''Kaiser'' found itself at close range with ''Affondatore''. Despite being a perfect target for a ram, ''Kaiser'' survived when Persano ordered ''Affondatore'' to turn away.<ref>A participant to the battle explained this as being due to ''Affondatore''{{'}}s turret poorly arrayed viewports, which led Persano and her captain to give confusing orders. ''Storia Militare'' n. 215, p. 61.</ref>\n\nTegetthoff's victory was saluted by his mariners \u2013 mainly [[Croats]] and [[Triveneto|Venetians]], from [[Domini di Terraferma|Venetia]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 with the traditional [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] cry of victory: \"Viva San Marco!\" (\"Hurrah with Saint Mark!\").<ref>{{cite journal|title=La battaglia di Lissa|journal=Wars|date=May 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy 15:00, Tegetthoff had led his fleet into the harbour of Lissa, where the damaged ''Kaiser'' had already arrived, undisturbed by the Italian ships; despite Persano's orders to engage the Austrian vessels, both Albini and Vacca ignored the orders, as the latter candidly testified at Persano's trial.<ref>''Storia Militare'' N. 215, p. 62</ref> With his ships low on fuel and ammunition, and his crews spent, Persano led his fleet back towards his home port of Ancona.\n\n''Kaiser''{{'}}s encounter with ''Affondatore'' was the last major action of the battle. With two armoured ships sunk, the Italians withdrew, although there would be some exchange of long range fire for several hours.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Location map\n| Croatia\n| label=Lissa (Vis) | position=left\n| label_size = 90\n| caption =Location of the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa) on a map of [[Croatia]].\n| lat=43.04 | long=16.0\n| background =\n| float = right\n| width = 200\n| AlternativeMap = <!-- none (default)-->\n}}\nIn Italy, Persano announced a victory, causing much initial celebration until the real outcome of the battle was publicized. The outrage over the loss of two ironclads was huge and Persano after the battle was judged by the [[Italian Senate]], condemned for incompetence and stripped of his rank, while Admiral Albini was merely relieved of command, and Admiral Vacca had to retire soon after for age limits.<ref>''Storia Militare'' N. 215, pp. 63\u201365</ref><ref>Bertoldi, Silvio. ''Sangue Sul Mare''. (Mondadori 2006)<!--page?--></ref>\n\nTegetthoff returned home a hero, was promoted ''Vizeadmiral'', and is considered one of the greatest naval commanders in Austrian history.\n\nThe Italian defeat was overshadowed by the crushing Prussian victory over the Austrian Army at [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]. Austria, humbled by Prussia and bullied by [[Napoleon III of France]], agreed to cede Venetia to Italy despite the overall failure of the Italian war effort. Tegetthoff's efforts were instrumental in preventing the Italians from annexing some of the [[Dalmatia]]n islands, which were once part of the [[Republic of Venice]].\n\nThe importance of ramming in the battle led to naval designers, over the next 50 years, equipping future warships (especially battleships and cruisers) with ram bows. This aggravated a number of incidents of ships being sunk by their squadron-mates in accidental collisions. Ramming never featured as a viable battle tactic again. The fixation on ramming may also have inhibited the development of gunnery.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nModern commentators now take the view that Lissa occurred during a period of weapons development when armour was considerably stronger than the guns available to defeat it. This was compounded, on the Italian side, by poor gunnery and, on the Austrian side, by the fact that a number of their ships (including ''Ferdinand Max'') had been forced to go into battle without their full armament owing to the Prussian embargo.\n\n''Kaiser'', remarkably, reported herself fit for action the morning after the battle. Her feat, an unarmored, wooden ship willingly engaging four ironclads at short range, appears to be unprecedented and was never repeated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n==Order of battle==\nVessels are ranked by fighting power (most powerful first).\n\n===Austrian Empire===\n[[File:Kaiser (ship, 1859) - NH 87011.jpg|thumb|SMS ''Kaiser'' at Lissa in the aftermath of the battle, undergoing repairs]]\n\n====1st Division \u2014 Armoured ships====\n* {{SMS|Erzherzog Ferdinand Max|1865|2}} (fleet flag, 2nd class armoured frigate, launched 1865, 5130t, 16-48pdr SB, 4-8pdr SB, 2-3pdr SB. 123&nbsp;mm iron belt over the battery, 12.5kts)\n* {{SMS|Habsburg|1865|2}} (launched 1865, as ''Erzherzog Ferdinand Max'')\n* {{SMS|Kaiser Max|1862|2}} (3rd class armoured frigate, launched 1862, 3588t, 16-48pdr SB, 1-12pdr SB, 1-6pdr SB, 15-24pdr ML rifles. 110&nbsp;mm iron belt, 11.4kts)\n* {{SMS|Don Juan d'Austria|1862|2}} (launched 1862, as ''Kaiser Max'')\n* {{SMS|Prinz Eugen|1862|2}} (launched 1862, as ''Kaiser Max'')\n* {{SMS|Drache||2}} (armoured corvette, launched 1861, 2750t, 10-48pdr SB, 18-24pdr MLR, 1-8pdr SB, 1-4pdr SB landing gun, 115&nbsp;mm iron belt, 11kts)\n* {{SMS|Salamander|1861|2}} (launched 1861, as ''Drache'')\n\n====2nd Division \u2014 Wooden steam warships====\n* {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|2}} (squadron flag, 2-decker screw ship of the line, launched 1858,<ref>{{Cite web |title=The history of Uljanik |url=http://www.uljanik.hr/index.php?id=8&L=0 |publisher=Uljanik d.d. |accessdate=2 September 2010}}</ref> 5811t, 2-24pdr ML rifles, 16-40pdr SB, 74-30pdr SB, wooden and unarmoured, 11.5kts)\n* {{SMS|Novara|1850|2}} (screw frigate, launched 1850, 2615t, 4-60pdr shell, 28-30pdr SB, 2-24pdr BL rifles, 1-12pdr landing gun, 1-6pdr landing gun, 12kts)\n* {{SMS|Schwarzenberg||2}} (screw frigate, launched 1853, 2614t, 6-60pdr Paixhans shell guns, 26-30pdr Type 2 ML, 14-30pdr Type 4 ML, 4-24pdr BL rifles, 11kts)\n* {{SMS|Radetzky|1854|2}} (screw frigate, launched 1854, 2234t, 6-60pdr Paixhans shell guns, 40-24pdr SB, 4-24pdr BL rifles, 9kts)\n* {{SMS|Donau|1856|2}} (launched 1856, 2165t, otherwise as ''Radetzky'')\n* {{SMS|Adria|1856|2}} (launched 1856, 2165t, otherwise as ''Radetzky'')\n* {{SMS|Erzherzog Friedrich|1857|2}} (screw corvette, launched 1857, 1697t, 4-60pdr Paixhans shell guns, 16-30pdr SB, 2-24pdr BL rifles, 9kts)\n\n====3rd Division \u2014 Minor craft====\n* ''Narenta'' (screw gunboat, 2-48pdr SB, 2-24pdr BL rifles)\n* ''Kerka'' (as ''Narenta'')\n* ''Hum'' (2nd class gunboat, 2-48pdr SB, 2-24pdr BL rifles, 11?kts)\n* ''Vellebich'' (as ''Hum'')\n* ''Dalmat'' (as ''Hum'')\n* ''Seehund'' (2nd class gunboat, 2-48pdr SB, 2-24pdr BL rifles, 11kts)\n* ''Wal'' (as ''Seehund'')\n* ''Streiter'' (as ''Seehund'')\n* ''Reka'' (as ''Seehund'')\n* ''Andreas Hofer'' (screw tender, 3-30pdr SB)\n* {{SMS|Kaiserin Elizabeth||2}} (sidewheeler steamer (''radaviso''), launched 1854, 4-12pdr SB)\n* ''Greif'' (sidewheel steamer, 2-12pdr SB)\n* ''Stadion'' (unarmed merchant steamer.

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though [[nyala]], whose males weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve.

Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran).

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

As such, the size of their home ranges depends on the distribution of prey in a region{{snds}}in central Namibia, where most prey species are sparsely distributed, home ranges average {{convert|554|\u2013|7063|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, whereas in the woodlands of the Phinda Game Reserve, that have plentiful prey, home ranges are {{convert|34|\u2013|157|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} large.<ref name=hunterwcw/> Cheetahs can travel long stretches of land in search of food; a study in the Kalahari Desert recorded an average displacement of nearly {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} everyday, and walking speeds ranged between {{convert|2.5|and|3.8|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=marker8/>\n\nMales are generally less nomadic than females; often males in coalitions (and sometimes solitary males staying far from coalitions) establish territories.<ref name=nowak/><ref name=wcw/> Whether males settle in territories or disperse over large areas forming home ranges depends primarily on the movements of females. Territoriality is preferred only if females tend to be more sedentary, which is more feasible in areas with plenty of prey. Floater males generally occupy huge home ranges, averaging {{convert|777|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in the Serengeti to {{convert|1464|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in central Namibia. Territories, on the other hand, are much smaller; in the Kruger National Park a coalition of three males occupied a territory measuring {{convert|126|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and the territory of a solitary male measured {{convert|195|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=hunterwcw/> When a female enters a territory, the males will surround her; if she tries to escape the males will bite or snap at her. Generally the female can not escape on her own; the males themselves leave after they lose interest in her. They may smell the spot she was sitting or lying in to determine if she was in oestrus.<ref name=marker9/>\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Acoustic-Structure-and-Contextual-Use-of-Calls-by-Captive-Male-and-Female-Cheetahs-(Acinonyx-pone.0158546.s001.oga|thumbnail|Calls of adult cheetahs: purr, hiss, growl, churr, meow, chirp, howl]]\n{{multiple image |align=right |direction=vertical\n |image1=Acinonyx jubatus -Southern Namibia-8.jpg |caption1=Male [[Urination#Felidae|marking]] his territory |width1=\n |image2=Cheetah Brothers AdF.jpg |caption2=Cheetahs grooming each other |width2=\n |image3=Cheetah with cubs (7513556524).jpg|caption3=Mother signaling her cubs by her tail to follow her\n}}\nThe cheetah is a vocal felid with a broad repertoire of calls and sounds; the [[Acoustics|acoustic]] features and usage of many of these have been studied in detail.<ref name=\"volodina\">{{cite journal |last1=Volodina |first1=E.

Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning of concealed or lost cubs by the mother, as a form of greeting or courtship between adults.<ref name=sh2003/> The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. <ref name=volodina/> A similar but louder call ('yelp') that can be heard from up to {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=\"kingdon\">{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=J. |authorlink=Jonathan Kingdon |title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals |chapter = Cheetah ''Acinonyx jubatus''|year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=978-1-4729-1236-7 |pages=403\u2013404 |edition=2nd |chapterurl = {{Google Books|id=gcrBDwAAQBAJ|pg=PT975|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to 2 seconds.

A bleat indicates distress, for instance when a cheetah confronts a predator that has stolen its kill.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though [[nyala]], whose males weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve.

The cheetah will stalk its prey, trying to conceal itself in cover, and try to approach as close as possible, often within {{convert|60|to|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey (or even farther for less alert prey). Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly. Cheetahs kill their prey by tripping it during the chase by hitting its rump with the forepaw or using the strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance, bringing it down with much force and sometimes even breaking one of its limbs.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs can decelerate extremely fast towards the end of the hunt, slowing down from {{convert|58|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} to {{convert|14|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} in just three strides, and can easily follow any twists and turns the prey makes as it tries to flee.<ref name=hunterwcw/> To kill medium- to large-sized prey the cheetah bites the prey's throat to suffocate it and lies down, maintaining the bite for around five minutes, within which the prey stops struggling. A bite on the nape of the neck or the snout (and sometimes on the skull) suffices to kill smaller prey.<ref name = wcw/><ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs have an average hunting success rate of 25\u201340%, higher for smaller and more vulnerable prey.<ref name = \"O'Brien\" /><ref name=hunterwcw/>\n\nOnce the hunt is over, the prey is taken near a bush or a tree; the cheetah, highly exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for five to 55 minutes.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran).

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

The 22 year-old Corfiot student of geology with an act of self-sacrifice and a spirit of dynamic protest, which could not bear to see Greece under the military regime, set himself on fire the first morning hours of 19th September 1970 in the Matteoti Sq. in the Italian city of Genoa. For security reasons his body was buried in Corfu four months later, his self-sacrifice though, a rare event for that time, caused international sensation and was considered as one of the most important resistance acts of that period. Later the Hellenic State and his homeland Corfu honoured the man, who with his life became a symbol of resistance and patriotism, herald of the students' sacrifice in Polytechnion in 1973''</ref><ref name=\"Rivera2012\">{{cite book|author=Annamaria Rivera|title=Il fuoco della rivolta.

Mashout is considered especially necessary if there is less than 3 liters of water per kilogram of grain (3 pints of water per pound of grain), or if the grain is more than 25% [[wheat]] or [[oat]]s.

This step is monitored by use of a [[Nephelometer|turbidimeter]] to measure solids in the wort liquid by their [[opacity (optics)|opacity]].<ref name=\"howtobrew\" />\n\n==Sparging==\nSparging is trickling water through the grain to extract sugars. This is a delicate step, as the wrong temperature or [[pH]] will extract [[tannin]]s from the ''chaff'' (grain husks) as well, resulting in a bitter brew.

When the wort reaches a desired level (typically about {{convert|1|in|abbr=in|order=flip|disp=or}}) above the grainbed, water is added at the same slow rate that wort is being drained.

Such a system has mostly been replaced either by a central wort-collection vessel or the arrangement of outlet ports into concentric zones, with each zone having a ring-shaped collection pipe. Brewhouses in plain public view, particularly those in [[brewpub]]s, often maintain the swan-neck valves and grant for their visual effect.\n\nA good quality lauter tun has rotating rake arms with a central drive unit. Depending on the size of the lauter tun, there can be between two and six rake arms. Cutting blades hang from these arms. The blade is usually wavy and has a plough-like foot.

Attached to each of these arms is a flap which can be raised and lowered for pushing the spent grains out of the tun.

Most systems have a ring of spray heads that ensure an even and gentle introduction of the sparge water. The watering system should not beat down on the grain bed and form a channel.\n\nLarge breweries have self-closing inlets on the bottom of the tun through which the mash is transferred to the lauter tun, and one outlet, also on the bottom of the tun, into which the spent grains fall after lautering is complete. Craft breweries often have manways on the side of the mash tun for spent grain removal, which then must be helped along to a large extent by the brewer.\n\nSome small breweries use a combination mash/lauter tun, in which the rake system cannot be implemented because the mixing mechanism for mashing is of higher importance.

As the demand in the New World grew, so did the knowledge on how to cultivate it. The two primary species used were [[Oryza glaberrima]] and [[Oryza sativa]], originating from West Africa and Southeast Asia respectively. Slaveholders in the New World relied upon the skills of enslaved Africans to further cultivate both species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carney|first=Judith A.|date=2001|title=African Rice in the Columbian Exchange|jstor=3647168|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=42|issue=3|pages=377\u2013396|doi=10.1017/s0021853701007940}}</ref> North and South Carolina were key places where rice was grown during the slave trade, and islands of the Caribbean like Puerto Rico and Cuba were equally great centers of production.

Tobacco, potatoes, [[chili peppers]], [[tomatillos]], and tomatoes are all members of the [[nightshade family]]. All of these plants bear some resemblance to the [[European nightshade]] that even an amateur could deduce just by simple observation of the flowers and berries. Similar to some European Nightshade varieties, tomatoes and potatoes can be harmful or even lethal, if the wrong part of the plant is consumed at the wrong quantity. Of all the New World plants introduced to Italy, only the potato took as long as the tomato to gain acceptance.  16th-century physicians, thus, had good reason to be wary that this native Mexican fruit was poisonous and the generator of \"melancholic humours\".  In 1544, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] physician and botanist, suggested that tomatoes might be edible, but no record exists of anyone consuming them at this time. On October 31, 1548, the tomato was given its first name anywhere in Europe when a house steward of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of Florence]], wrote to the De' Medici's private secretary that the basket of ''pomi d'oro'' \"had arrived safely\". At this time, the label ''pomi d'oro'' was also used to refer to figs, melons, and citrus fruits in treatises by scientists.<ref name=Gentilcore>''A History of the Tomato in Italy Pomodoro!'', [[David Gentilcore]] (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nIn the early years, tomatoes were mainly grown as ornamentals in Italy. For example, the [[Duchy of Florence|Florentine]] aristocrat [[Giovan Vettorio Soderini]] wrote how they \"were to be sought only for their beauty\" and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. Tomatoes were grown in elite town and country gardens in the fifty years or so following their arrival in Europe and were only occasionally depicted in works of art. However, in 1592 the head gardener at the botanical garden of [[Aranjuez]] near Madrid, under the patronage of [[Philip II of Spain]], wrote, \"it is said [tomatoes] are good for sauces\". Besides this account, tomatoes remained exotic plants grown for ornamental purposes, but rarely for culinary use. The combination of pasta with [[tomato sauce]] was developed only in the late nineteenth century. Today around {{convert|32000|acres|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of tomatoes are cultivated in Italy, although there are still areas where relatively few tomatoes are grown and consumed.<ref name=Gentilcore/>\n\n===Livestock===\n{{further|Plains Indians#The horse}}\nInitially at least, the Columbian exchange of animals largely went in one direction, from Europe to the New World, as the Eurasian regions had domesticated many more animals. [[Horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[pig]]s, [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[chicken]]s, large [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s and [[bee]]s were rapidly adopted by native peoples for transport, food, and other uses.<ref name=\"Francis2006-livestock\">{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Michael Francis, John|encyclopedia=Iberia and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History: a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|title=Columbian Exchange\u2014Livestock| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMNoS-g1h8cC&pg=PA303|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-421-9|pages=303\u2013308}}</ref> One of the first European exports to the Americas, the horse, changed the lives of many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes.

Many had migrated west across Eurasia [[natural reservoir|with animals]] or people, or were brought by traders from Asia, so diseases of two continents were suffered by all occupants. While Europeans and Asians were affected by the Eurasian diseases, their [[endemic]] status in those continents over centuries resulted in many people gaining [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].\n\nBy contrast, Old World diseases had a devastating effect when introduced via European carriers, as the native people in the Americas had no natural immunity to the new diseases.

For example, in the article \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\" Pieter Emmer makes the point that \"from 1500 onward, a 'clash of cultures' had begun in the Atlantic\".<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 45\u201346</ref> This clash of culture involved the transfer of European values to indigenous cultures. As an example, the emergence of the concept of private property in regions where property was often viewed as communal, concepts of monogamy (although many indigenous peoples were already monogomous,) the role of women and children in the social system, and the \"superiority of free labor,\"<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref> although slavery was already an well established practice among many indigenous people. Another example included the European deprecation of human sacrifice, an established religious practice among some indigenous populations. Another example of cultural clash occurred during the 1500s in North America. When these European colonizers first entered North America, they encountered fence-less lands. For these Europeans, seeking economic opportunity and homesteads, this indicated to them that the land was unimproved and available for the taking. When the English entered Virginia they encountered a fully established culture of people called the [[Powhatan]]. The Powhatan farmers in Virginia scattered their farm plots within larger cleared areas. These larger cleared areas were a communal place for growing useful plants. As the Europeans viewed fences as hallmarks of civilization they set about transforming \"the land into something more suitable for themselves\".<ref>Mann, Charles. 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. New York, New York: Vintage Books, 2011. loc. 1094 and 1050</ref> In implementing their practices, the Europeans enslaved, murdered, and exploited indigenous populations. \n\nTobacco was a New World agricultural product, originally a luxury good spread as part of the Columbian exchange. As is discussed in regard to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the tobacco trade increased demand for free labor and spread tobacco worldwide. In discussing the widespread uses of tobacco, the Spanish physician Nicolas Monardes (1493\u20131588) noted that \"The black people that have gone from these parts to the Indies, have taken up the same manner and use of tobacco that the Indians have\".<ref>Monardes, Nicholas. \"Of the Tabaco and of his Greate Vertues\".

Demand for tobacco grew in the course of these cultural exchanges among peoples.\n\nOne of the most clearly notable areas of cultural clash and exchange was that of religion, often the lead point of cultural conversion. In the Spanish and Portuguese dominions, the spread of Catholicism, steeped in a European value system, was a major objective of colonization. In English North America, missionaries converted many tribes and peoples to protestant faiths, while the French colonies had a more outright religious mandate, as some of the early explorers, such as [[Jacques Marquette]], were priests. In the course of time, given European technological superiority and science, which aided and succored their dominance, indigenous relgions eventually declined, although there was much conflict and uprising regarding defense of indigenous cultural practice over the centuries following the European settlement of the Americas. \n\nWhile [[Mapuche]] people did adopt the horse, sheep, and wheat, the over-all scant adoption of Spanish technology by Mapuche has been characterized as mean of [[Resistance through culture|cultural resistance]].<ref name=DilleMaterial2014/>\n\n==== Atlantic slave trade ====\n\n[[File:AfricanSlavesTransport.jpg|thumb|Enslaved Africans were chained and bound before taken on ships to the New World]]\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade]] was the transfer of Africans from primarily West Africa to parts of the Americas between the 16th and 19th century.<ref name=\"Black Rice\">{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Judith |title=Black Rice |url=https://archive.org/details/blackriceafrican00carn |url-access=registration |date=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackriceafrican00carn/page/2 2\u20138]}}</ref> About 10 million slaves arrived in the Americas from Africa.

Mintz and Price's book helped to publicize how integral the socialization aspects of plantation life were to the structures of black culture.\n\nThe treatment of enslaved Africans during the Atlantic slave trade became one of the most controversial topics in the history of the New World. Slavery was abolished in 1865 in the United States and [[Slavery_in_Brazil|was ended in Brazil]] in 1888, but has remained a key subject in politics, pop culture and media.\n\n==Organism examples==\n{{See also|New World crops|Agriculture in Mesoamerica|Muisca agriculture|List of food origins}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=70%\n|+ Post-Columbian transfers of native organisms with close ties to humans\n!

Tobacco, potatoes, [[chili peppers]], [[tomatillos]], and tomatoes are all members of the [[nightshade family]]. All of these plants bear some resemblance to the [[European nightshade]] that even an amateur could deduce just by simple observation of the flowers and berries. Similar to some European Nightshade varieties, tomatoes and potatoes can be harmful or even lethal, if the wrong part of the plant is consumed at the wrong quantity. Of all the New World plants introduced to Italy, only the potato took as long as the tomato to gain acceptance.  16th-century physicians, thus, had good reason to be wary that this native Mexican fruit was poisonous and the generator of \"melancholic humours\".  In 1544, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] physician and botanist, suggested that tomatoes might be edible, but no record exists of anyone consuming them at this time. On October 31, 1548, the tomato was given its first name anywhere in Europe when a house steward of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of Florence]], wrote to the De' Medici's private secretary that the basket of ''pomi d'oro'' \"had arrived safely\". At this time, the label ''pomi d'oro'' was also used to refer to figs, melons, and citrus fruits in treatises by scientists.<ref name=Gentilcore>''A History of the Tomato in Italy Pomodoro!'', [[David Gentilcore]] (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nIn the early years, tomatoes were mainly grown as ornamentals in Italy. For example, the [[Duchy of Florence|Florentine]] aristocrat [[Giovan Vettorio Soderini]] wrote how they \"were to be sought only for their beauty\" and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. Tomatoes were grown in elite town and country gardens in the fifty years or so following their arrival in Europe and were only occasionally depicted in works of art. However, in 1592 the head gardener at the botanical garden of [[Aranjuez]] near Madrid, under the patronage of [[Philip II of Spain]], wrote, \"it is said [tomatoes] are good for sauces\". Besides this account, tomatoes remained exotic plants grown for ornamental purposes, but rarely for culinary use. The combination of pasta with [[tomato sauce]] was developed only in the late nineteenth century. Today around {{convert|32000|acres|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of tomatoes are cultivated in Italy, although there are still areas where relatively few tomatoes are grown and consumed.<ref name=Gentilcore/>\n\n===Livestock===\n{{further|Plains Indians#The horse}}\nInitially at least, the Columbian exchange of animals largely went in one direction, from Europe to the New World, as the Eurasian regions had domesticated many more animals.

Many had migrated west across Eurasia [[natural reservoir|with animals]] or people, or were brought by traders from Asia, so diseases of two continents were suffered by all occupants. While Europeans and Asians were affected by the Eurasian diseases, their [[endemic]] status in those continents over centuries resulted in many people gaining [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].\n\nBy contrast, Old World diseases had a devastating effect when introduced via European carriers, as the native people in the Americas had no natural immunity to the new diseases.

For example, in the article \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\" Pieter Emmer makes the point that \"from 1500 onward, a 'clash of cultures' had begun in the Atlantic\".<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 45\u201346</ref> This clash of culture involved the transfer of European values to indigenous cultures. As an example, the emergence of the concept of private property in regions where property was often viewed as communal, concepts of monogamy (although many indigenous peoples were already monogomous,) the role of women and children in the social system, and the \"superiority of free labor,\"<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref> although slavery was already an well established practice among many indigenous people. Another example included the European deprecation of human sacrifice, an established religious practice among some indigenous populations. Another example of cultural clash occurred during the 1500s in North America. When these European colonizers first entered North America, they encountered fence-less lands. For these Europeans, seeking economic opportunity and homesteads, this indicated to them that the land was unimproved and available for the taking. When the English entered Virginia they encountered a fully established culture of people called the [[Powhatan]]. The Powhatan farmers in Virginia scattered their farm plots within larger cleared areas. These larger cleared areas were a communal place for growing useful plants. As the Europeans viewed fences as hallmarks of civilization they set about transforming \"the land into something more suitable for themselves\".<ref>Mann, Charles. 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. New York, New York: Vintage Books, 2011. loc. 1094 and 1050</ref> In implementing their practices, the Europeans enslaved, murdered, and exploited indigenous populations. \n\nTobacco was a New World agricultural product, originally a luxury good spread as part of the Columbian exchange. As is discussed in regard to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the tobacco trade increased demand for free labor and spread tobacco worldwide. In discussing the widespread uses of tobacco, the Spanish physician Nicolas Monardes (1493\u20131588) noted that \"The black people that have gone from these parts to the Indies, have taken up the same manner and use of tobacco that the Indians have\".<ref>Monardes, Nicholas. \"Of the Tabaco and of his Greate Vertues\". Frampton, John trans, Wolf, Michael, ed. Tobacco.org. Accessed June 1, 2017 http://archive.tobacco.org/History/monardes.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607233337/http://archive.tobacco.org/History/monardes.html|date=June 7, 2012}}</ref> As Europeans traveled the globe they took with them the practices related to tobacco. Demand for tobacco grew in the course of these cultural exchanges among peoples.\n\nOne of the most clearly notable areas of cultural clash and exchange was that of religion, often the lead point of cultural conversion. In the Spanish and Portuguese dominions, the spread of Catholicism, steeped in a European value system, was a major objective of colonization. In English North America, missionaries converted many tribes and peoples to protestant faiths, while the French colonies had a more outright religious mandate, as some of the early explorers, such as [[Jacques Marquette]], were priests. In the course of time, given European technological superiority and science, which aided and succored their dominance, indigenous relgions eventually declined, although there was much conflict and uprising regarding defense of indigenous cultural practice over the centuries following the European settlement of the Americas. \n\nWhile [[Mapuche]] people did adopt the horse, sheep, and wheat, the over-all scant adoption of Spanish technology by Mapuche has been characterized as mean of [[Resistance through culture|cultural resistance]].<ref name=DilleMaterial2014/>\n\n==== Atlantic slave trade ====\n\n[[File:AfricanSlavesTransport.jpg|thumb|Enslaved Africans were chained and bound before taken on ships to the New World]]\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade]] was the transfer of Africans from primarily West Africa to parts of the Americas between the 16th and 19th century.<ref name=\"Black Rice\">{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Judith |title=Black Rice |url=https://archive.org/details/blackriceafrican00carn |url-access=registration |date=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackriceafrican00carn/page/2 2\u20138]}}</ref> About 10 million slaves arrived in the Americas from Africa.

Mintz and Price's book helped to publicize how integral the socialization aspects of plantation life were to the structures of black culture.\n\nThe treatment of enslaved Africans during the Atlantic slave trade became one of the most controversial topics in the history of the New World. Slavery was abolished in 1865 in the United States and [[Slavery_in_Brazil|was ended in Brazil]] in 1888, but has remained a key subject in politics, pop culture and media.\n\n==Organism examples==\n{{See also|New World crops|Agriculture in Mesoamerica|Muisca agriculture|List of food origins}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=70%\n|+ Post-Columbian transfers of native organisms with close ties to humans\n!

[[Invasive species]] of [[plant]]s and [[pathogen]]s also were introduced by chance, including such weeds as [[Salsola|tumbleweeds]] (''Salsola'' spp.) and [[Avena fatua|wild oats]] (''Avena fatua''). Some plants introduced intentionally, such as the [[kudzu|kudzu vine]] introduced in 1894 from [[Japan]] to the United States to help control [[soil erosion]], have since been found to be invasive pests in the new environment.\n\nFungi have also been transported, such as the one responsible for [[Dutch elm disease]], killing [[Ulmus americana|American elms]] in North American forests and cities, where many had been planted as street trees. Some of the invasive species have become serious ecosystem and economic problems after establishing in the New World environments.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/biodiversity/simberloff.html | title=Introduced Species: The Threat to Biodiversity & What Can Be Done | author=Simberloff, Daniel | journal=American Institute of Biological Sciences: Bringing Biology to Informed Decision Making. | year=2000}}</ref><ref>Fern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez, Joaquin and Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez Tasc\u00f3n (eds.)

In the 1840s, ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' crossed the oceans, damaging the potato crop in several European nations. In Ireland, the potato crop was totally destroyed; the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] caused millions to starve to death or emigrate.\n\nIn addition to these, many animals were introduced to new habitats on the other side of the world either accidentally or incidentally. These include such animals as [[brown rat]]s, [[earthworm]]s (apparently absent from parts of the pre-Columbian New World), and [[zebra mussel]]s, which arrived on ships.<ref name = \"Hoddle\">{{cite web |first=M.

In the New World, populations of feral European cats, pigs, horses, and cattle are common, and the [[Burmese python]] and [[green iguana]] are considered problematic in Florida. In the Old World, the [[Eastern gray squirrel]] has been particularly successful in colonising [[Great Britain]], and populations of [[raccoon]]s can now be found in some regions of Germany, the Caucasus, and Japan.

It continued Morrison's departure from [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] at the time, instead favoring [[Celtic folk]] and American [[jazz]] in its music. As with many of Morrison's recordings, spirituality is a major theme and some of the songs are based on the teachings of [[Alice Bailey]]. Other songs show Morrison's Celtic heritage and reminiscence of his [[Belfast]] background.\n\n''Beautiful Vision'' received critical acclaim but garnered only modest chart success, peaking at number 31 on the [[UK album charts]] and number 44 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Recording==\nThe first recording session started in May 1981 at the [[Record Plant]] studios, [[Sausalito, California]], near the [[Golden Gate]], San Francisco.<ref name=\"Collis 1996 page=155\">{{harvnb|Collis|1996|page=155}}</ref> Although only \"[[Scandinavia (composition)|Scandinavia]]\" was released on ''Beautiful Vision'' from this session,<ref name=\"Heylin, p.523\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=523}}</ref> \"Cleaning Windows\" and \"Celtic Ray\" were re-recorded for ''Beautiful Vision'' later on.<ref name=\"Heylin, p.523-524\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|pages=523\u2013524}}</ref> All the other songs or instrumentals from the session were included on one of Morrison's later albums: the [[instrumental]]s \"All Saints Day\" and \"Daring Night\" appeared with lyrics on the albums ''[[Hymns to the Silence]]'' and ''[[Avalon Sunset]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Rogan|2006|pages=344\u2013345}}</ref><ref name=\"Heylin, p.371\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=371}}</ref> and \"Down the Road I Go\" was renamed \"Down the Road\" and used as the title track on ''[[Down the Road (Van Morrison album)|Down the Road]]''. \n\nOn 27 July Morrison entered the recording studio to record \"Cleaning Windows\" and \"Aryan Mist\".<ref name=\"Heylin, p.523\"/> Morrison brought in different musicians for this session, including his former drummer [[Gary Mallaber]] and guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]].<ref name=\"Heylin, p.372\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=372}}</ref>\n\nMorrison concluded recording in the summer, when he recorded the rest of the songs for the album. Four songs were not used from this session, including the future singles \"[[Real Real Gone]]\" and \"[[Tore Down a la Rimbaud]]\".<ref name=\"Heylin, p.523-524\"/> Neither Knopfler nor [[Herbie Armstrong]] were able to produce the guitar tone Morrison wanted, so engineer Jim Stern suggested [[Chris Michie]]: \"I got the call when I was doing a session in San Francisco. Van's producer Jim Stern said 'Can you get to the Plant [in Sausalito] in twenty minutes?' I said 'Yeah.' I walked into the studio with my gear as the band and Van were doing ... basic tracks. I was set up and playing before the end of the song 'She Gives Me Religion'\".  Michie later added lead guitar overdubs to \"Cleaning Windows\" and \"Aryan Mist\". Knopfler's contributions still featured on the final release, but are not as audible as Michie's.<ref name=\"Heylin, p.372\"/>\n\n==Composition==\nAccording to the liner notes, some of the lyrics derive from the book ''Glamour:  A World Problem'' by [[esotericism|esoteric]] writer [[Alice Bailey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Drury|1985|page=60}}</ref><ref name=\"Milward\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/beautiful-vision-19820304|title=Van Morrison: Beautiful Vision|magazine=Rolling Stone Magazine|author=Milward, John|date=1982-03-04|volume=RS 364|accessdate=2011-04-14}}</ref>  It is also said to have been strongly influenced by his new girlfriend, Ulla Munch, from [[Vanl\u00f8se]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.<ref name=\"Collis 1996 page=155\"/> The album also emphasised the distance Morrison had moved away from [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and was inspired by [[Irish people|Irish music]]. He commented at the time, \"It's important for people to get into the music of their own culture... I think it can be dangerous to not validate the music of where you're from, ''for anybody'', whether it's Bulgaria or whatever.\"<ref name=\"Rogan, p.338\"/>\n\nThe opening song, \"Celtic Ray\", was one of the first songs to be written for the album.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|pages=368\u2013369}}</ref>  It is concerned with the singer's connection to the ancient [[Celt]]ic culture. The song has the concept of messages coming through the ether from Mother [[Ireland]].  \"Northern Muse (Solid Ground)\" adds a young woman in [[County Down]] to a similar theme. Morrison commented in an interview with ''[[Hot Press]]'' in 1982 that \"Some of the material [on ''Beautiful Vision''], when it started, was more traditional. Some of the songs - like 'Solid Ground' and 'Celtic Ray' - they basically started out as folk-oriented stuff, and ... ended up being integrated as folk/R&B.\"<ref name=\"Hinton, p.234\">{{harvnb|Hinton|1997|page=234}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Dweller on the Threshold (song)|Dweller on the Threshold]]\" and \"Aryan Mist\" are credited to the religious writings of Alice Bailey.<ref>{{harvnb|Mills|2010|page=217}}</ref> Her book discusses the [[New Age]] ideas of \"glamours\" or \"mental illusions\", which formed a fog that covers the \"spiritual warrior\" and the \"Aryan race\" from the world. When the \"dweller on the threshold\" was covered with the light of the soul or \"Angel of Presence\" illumination came. Some of these ideas were quoted in the two Morrison compositions, both co-written with Hugh Murphy.<ref name=\"Rogan, pp.336-337\">{{harvnb|Rogan|2006|pages=336\u2013337}}</ref> In 1982 Morrison revealed in an interview: \"I've read ''Glamour'' four or five times, and I get different things out of it each time. [Alice Bailey]'s saying a lot of things. It's depth reading. You might read it on Wednesday and on Thursday you pick it up again and get an entirely different thing. I don't feel qualified to speak about what it's about - you really have to read it yourself ... because there's so much in there.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=370}}</ref>\n\n\"Beautiful Vision\" can be interpreted as either a vision of heaven or of his girlfriend, who also influences \"She Gives Me Religion\" and \"[[Vanlose Stairway]]\" (which  refers  to the stairway in the apartment where she lived). Biographer [[Clinton Heylin]] believes the songs \"'Vanlose Stairway' and 'She Gives Me Religion' [were] perhaps Morrison's most captivating love songs since the days of ''[[Veedon Fleece]]''.\"<ref name=\"Heylin, p.371\"/> \"[[Cleaning Windows]]\" is about Morrison's first full-time job and the last carefree days of his adolescence in the years 1961 to 1962, and is a metaphor for the idea that his music alters people's perceptions of life.<ref name=\"Milward\"/> Biographer [[Steve Turner (writer)|Steve Turner]] believes in this song Morrison \"captured the balance between his contentment at work and his aspirations to learn more about music. It conveyed the impression that his happiness with the mundane routine of smoking Woodbine cigarettes, eating Paris buns and drinking lemonade was made possible by the promise that at the end of the day he could enter the world of books and records ... \".<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|1993|page=31}}</ref> The melody is very upbeat and embellished with organ and guitar, reminiscent to the music of [[The Band]]. The song is written in a similar fashion to Morrison's 1970 song, \"[[And It Stoned Me]]\".<ref name=\"Milward\"/>\n\nIt is interpreted by three of Morrison's biographers that \"Across the Bridge Where Angels Dwell\" is literally about the bridge that separated Morrison's [[Mill Valley, California]]  home from the [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]] house where his daughter, [[Shana Morrison|Shana]] and ex-wife Janet Morrison Minto (n\u00e9e Rigsby) lived.  The interpretation originated with Irish musician [[Phil Coulter]] who, according to biographer Rogan \"...assumed there was [such] a subtext\".<ref name=\"Rogan, p.338\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Hinton|1997|pages=235\u2013236}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brooks|1999|page=95}}</ref>  There is no other evidence for this interpretation, however, and the song makes no reference to either Morrison's daughter or ex-wife. Further weakening Coulter's interpretation is the fact that the lyrics were co-written by [[Hugh Murphy]].  Murphy's two other songwriting contributions to the album are \"Dweller on the Threshold\" and \"Aryan Myst\", both explicitly influenced by Alice Bailey's work \"Glamour: A World Problem\", which contains direct references to angels. ''Beautiful Vision'' ends with the instrumental \"[[Scandinavia (composition)|Scandinavia]]\", with Morrison on [[piano]] and prominently features [[Mark Isham]]'s [[synthesizer]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hinton|1997|page=236}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Erlewine\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r13468|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic review|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n| rev2Score = A\u2013<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|year=1990|title=Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|isbn=067973015X|chapter=Van Morrison: Beautiful Vision|chapter-url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4101|page=[https://archive.org/details/christgausrecord00chri/page/280 280]|accessdate=26 May 2016|url=https://archive.org/details/christgausrecord00chri/page/280}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Milward\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Marsh\">{{cite book|last=Marsh|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Marsh|editor1-last=Marsh|editor1-first=Dave|editor2-last=Swenson|editor2-first=John|year=1983|title=The New Rolling Stone Record Guide|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstoner00mars/page/345 345-46]|chapter=Van Morrison|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0394721071|title-link=The New Rolling Stone Record Guide}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev5Score = A<ref name=\"Christgau\"/>\n}}\n''Beautiful Vision'' was released in February 1982 by [[Mercury Records]] in the United Kingdom and [[Warner Bros.

Before the album was released he performed three-quarters of it at shows in California in October 1981.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=373}}</ref> However his live performances at this point were increasingly confined to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].  His manager, [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], was concerned that Morrison was not promoting the album with a nationwide tour of the US. Morrison fired Graham on stage in [[San Francisco]]. Herbie Armstrong remembered \"He was taking Van in the wrong direction. He was trying to commercialize him.\" Warner Brothers persuaded Morrison to allow Tom Dowd to produce the album but after Morrison became suspicious of Warner's motives, Dowd's services were not used and Morrison took over production of the album.<ref name=\"Rogan, p.337\">{{harvnb|Rogan|2006|page=337}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dominion theatre.JPG|thumb|right|Morrison performed four shows at the [[Dominion Theatre]], London to promote the album.]]\nAfter the release of the album, Morrison performed a series of concerts at the [[Dominion Theatre]], London, opened by Herbie Armstrong with an [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] set.<ref name=\"Collis, p.156\"/> Paul Charles, who managed Morrison's business affairs at the time, commented that <blockquote>\"The idea [behind the Dominion residencies] was [to go against the] 'come into town, do one show, get all the press down, get the radio and TV and record-company people' [mentally]. My logic was, 'Look, with Van it's not just a rock & roll tour. It's not just here's the hits, here's the new record, please buy it, whatever.' It was a ''performance''. ... A certain number of people would come back every night, [knowing that] Van will not have a set-list that he adheres to religiously ... So I thought, 'Here's a way. Van is not having any singles. Van doesn't do TV. How can we get attention to him doing what he does?' Well, the best thing that he does is perform live. I think we did four [concerts] the first time. We ended up doing eleven [in 1984]. We got a lot of coverage, we got a lot of attention, without him having to do something he didn't like.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|pages=373\u2013374}}</ref></blockquote> Morrison's love of live performing was reignited by this set of concerts and he commented at the time that it was \"more like appearing in a play, going to the theatre and doing your job every day - which I prefer to touring because that's very fragmented and disorientating.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=374}}</ref> According to Johnny Rogan, these performances \"are still regarded by many as his most memorable since the glory days of the Caledonia Soul Orchestra.<ref name=\"Rogan, p.338\"/> A concert on 3 to 4 April 1982 at the [[Grugahalle]], [[Essen]], Germany, was broadcast in many European countries as a TV/radio [[simulcast]] in the ''[[Rockpalast]]'' TV series by German TV station [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]].

It continued Morrison's departure from [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] at the time, instead favoring [[Celtic folk]] and American [[jazz]] in its music. As with many of Morrison's recordings, spirituality is a major theme and some of the songs are based on the teachings of [[Alice Bailey]]. Other songs show Morrison's Celtic heritage and reminiscence of his [[Belfast]] background.\n\n''Beautiful Vision'' received critical acclaim but garnered only modest chart success, peaking at number 31 on the [[UK album charts]] and number 44 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Recording==\nThe first recording session started in May 1981 at the [[Record Plant]] studios, [[Sausalito, California]], near the [[Golden Gate]], San Francisco.<ref name=\"Collis 1996 page=155\">{{harvnb|Collis|1996|page=155}}</ref> Although only \"[[Scandinavia (composition)|Scandinavia]]\" was released on ''Beautiful Vision'' from this session,<ref name=\"Heylin, p.523\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=523}}</ref> \"Cleaning Windows\" and \"Celtic Ray\" were re-recorded for ''Beautiful Vision'' later on.<ref name=\"Heylin, p.523-524\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|pages=523\u2013524}}</ref> All the other songs or instrumentals from the session were included on one of Morrison's later albums: the [[instrumental]]s \"All Saints Day\" and \"Daring Night\" appeared with lyrics on the albums ''[[Hymns to the Silence]]'' and ''[[Avalon Sunset]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Rogan|2006|pages=344\u2013345}}</ref><ref name=\"Heylin, p.371\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=371}}</ref> and \"Down the Road I Go\" was renamed \"Down the Road\" and used as the title track on ''[[Down the Road (Van Morrison album)|Down the Road]]''. \n\nOn 27 July Morrison entered the recording studio to record \"Cleaning Windows\" and \"Aryan Mist\".<ref name=\"Heylin, p.523\"/> Morrison brought in different musicians for this session, including his former drummer [[Gary Mallaber]] and guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]].<ref name=\"Heylin, p.372\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=372}}</ref>\n\nMorrison concluded recording in the summer, when he recorded the rest of the songs for the album. Four songs were not used from this session, including the future singles \"[[Real Real Gone]]\" and \"[[Tore Down a la Rimbaud]]\".<ref name=\"Heylin, p.523-524\"/> Neither Knopfler nor Herbie Armstrong were able to produce the guitar tone Morrison wanted, so engineer Jim Stern suggested [[Chris Michie]]: \"I got the call when I was doing a session in San Francisco. Van's producer Jim Stern said 'Can you get to the Plant [in Sausalito] in twenty minutes?' I said 'Yeah.' I walked into the studio with my gear as the band and Van were doing ... basic tracks. I was set up and playing before the end of the song 'She Gives Me Religion'\".  Michie later added lead guitar overdubs to \"Cleaning Windows\" and \"Aryan Mist\". Knopfler's contributions still featured on the final release, but are not as audible as Michie's.<ref name=\"Heylin, p.372\"/>\n\n==Composition==\nAccording to the liner notes, some of the lyrics derive from the book ''Glamour:  A World Problem'' by [[esotericism|esoteric]] writer [[Alice Bailey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Drury|1985|page=60}}</ref><ref name=\"Milward\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/beautiful-vision-19820304|title=Van Morrison: Beautiful Vision|magazine=Rolling Stone Magazine|author=Milward, John|date=1982-03-04|volume=RS 364|accessdate=2011-04-14}}</ref>  It is also said to have been strongly influenced by his new girlfriend, Ulla Munch, from [[Vanl\u00f8se]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.<ref name=\"Collis 1996 page=155\"/> The album also emphasised the distance Morrison had moved away from [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and was inspired by [[Irish people|Irish music]]. He commented at the time, \"It's important for people to get into the music of their own culture... I think it can be dangerous to not validate the music of where you're from, ''for anybody'', whether it's Bulgaria or whatever.\"<ref name=\"Rogan, p.338\"/>\n\nThe opening song, \"Celtic Ray\", was one of the first songs to be written for the album.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|pages=368\u2013369}}</ref>  It is concerned with the singer's connection to the ancient [[Celt]]ic culture. The song has the concept of messages coming through the ether from Mother [[Ireland]].  \"Northern Muse (Solid Ground)\" adds a young woman in [[County Down]] to a similar theme. Morrison commented in an interview with ''[[Hot Press]]'' in 1982 that \"Some of the material [on ''Beautiful Vision''], when it started, was more traditional. Some of the songs - like 'Solid Ground' and 'Celtic Ray' - they basically started out as folk-oriented stuff, and ... ended up being integrated as folk/R&B.\"<ref name=\"Hinton, p.234\">{{harvnb|Hinton|1997|page=234}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Dweller on the Threshold (song)|Dweller on the Threshold]]\" and \"Aryan Mist\" are credited to the religious writings of Alice Bailey.<ref>{{harvnb|Mills|2010|page=217}}</ref> Her book discusses the [[New Age]] ideas of \"glamours\" or \"mental illusions\", which formed a fog that covers the \"spiritual warrior\" and the \"Aryan race\" from the world. When the \"dweller on the threshold\" was covered with the light of the soul or \"Angel of Presence\" illumination came. Some of these ideas were quoted in the two Morrison compositions, both co-written with Hugh Murphy.<ref name=\"Rogan, pp.336-337\">{{harvnb|Rogan|2006|pages=336\u2013337}}</ref> In 1982 Morrison revealed in an interview: \"I've read ''Glamour'' four or five times, and I get different things out of it each time. [Alice Bailey]'s saying a lot of things. It's depth reading. You might read it on Wednesday and on Thursday you pick it up again and get an entirely different thing. I don't feel qualified to speak about what it's about - you really have to read it yourself ... because there's so much in there.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=370}}</ref>\n\n\"Beautiful Vision\" can be interpreted as either a vision of heaven or of his girlfriend, who also influences \"She Gives Me Religion\" and \"[[Vanlose Stairway]]\" (which  refers  to the stairway in the apartment where she lived). Biographer [[Clinton Heylin]] believes the songs \"'Vanlose Stairway' and 'She Gives Me Religion' [were] perhaps Morrison's most captivating love songs since the days of ''[[Veedon Fleece]]''.\"<ref name=\"Heylin, p.371\"/> \"[[Cleaning Windows]]\" is about Morrison's first full-time job and the last carefree days of his adolescence in the years 1961 to 1962, and is a metaphor for the idea that his music alters people's perceptions of life.<ref name=\"Milward\"/> Biographer [[Steve Turner (writer)|Steve Turner]] believes in this song Morrison \"captured the balance between his contentment at work and his aspirations to learn more about music. It conveyed the impression that his happiness with the mundane routine of smoking Woodbine cigarettes, eating Paris buns and drinking lemonade was made possible by the promise that at the end of the day he could enter the world of books and records ... \".<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|1993|page=31}}</ref> The melody is very upbeat and embellished with organ and guitar, reminiscent to the music of [[The Band]]. The song is written in a similar fashion to Morrison's 1970 song, \"[[And It Stoned Me]]\".<ref name=\"Milward\"/>\n\nIt is interpreted by three of Morrison's biographers that \"Across the Bridge Where Angels Dwell\" is literally about the bridge that separated Morrison's [[Mill Valley, California]]  home from the [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]] house where his daughter, [[Shana Morrison|Shana]] and ex-wife Janet Morrison Minto (n\u00e9e Rigsby) lived.  The interpretation originated with Irish musician [[Phil Coulter]] who, according to biographer Rogan \"...assumed there was [such] a subtext\".<ref name=\"Rogan, p.338\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Hinton|1997|pages=235\u2013236}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brooks|1999|page=95}}</ref>  There is no other evidence for this interpretation, however, and the song makes no reference to either Morrison's daughter or ex-wife. Further weakening Coulter's interpretation is the fact that the lyrics were co-written by [[Hugh Murphy]].  Murphy's two other songwriting contributions to the album are \"Dweller on the Threshold\" and \"Aryan Myst\", both explicitly influenced by Alice Bailey's work \"Glamour: A World Problem\", which contains direct references to angels. ''Beautiful Vision'' ends with the instrumental \"[[Scandinavia (composition)|Scandinavia]]\", with Morrison on [[piano]] and prominently features [[Mark Isham]]'s [[synthesizer]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hinton|1997|page=236}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Erlewine\">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r13468|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic review|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|publisher=allmusic.com|accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s|Christgau's Record Guide]]''\n| rev2Score = A\u2013<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|year=1990|title=Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|isbn=067973015X|chapter=Van Morrison: Beautiful Vision|chapter-url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=4101|page=[https://archive.org/details/christgausrecord00chri/page/280 280]|accessdate=26 May 2016|url=https://archive.org/details/christgausrecord00chri/page/280}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Milward\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev4Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Marsh\">{{cite book|last=Marsh|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Marsh|editor1-last=Marsh|editor1-first=Dave|editor2-last=Swenson|editor2-first=John|year=1983|title=The New Rolling Stone Record Guide|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstoner00mars/page/345 345-46]|chapter=Van Morrison|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0394721071|title-link=The New Rolling Stone Record Guide}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev5Score = A<ref name=\"Christgau\"/>\n}}\n''Beautiful Vision'' was released in February 1982 by [[Mercury Records]] in the United Kingdom and [[Warner Bros.

Before the album was released he performed three-quarters of it at shows in California in October 1981.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=373}}</ref> However his live performances at this point were increasingly confined to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].  His manager, [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], was concerned that Morrison was not promoting the album with a nationwide tour of the US. Morrison fired Graham on stage in [[San Francisco]]. Herbie Armstrong remembered \"He was taking Van in the wrong direction. He was trying to commercialize him.\" Warner Brothers persuaded Morrison to allow Tom Dowd to produce the album but after Morrison became suspicious of Warner's motives, Dowd's services were not used and Morrison took over production of the album.<ref name=\"Rogan, p.337\">{{harvnb|Rogan|2006|page=337}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dominion theatre.JPG|thumb|right|Morrison performed four shows at the [[Dominion Theatre]], London to promote the album.]]\nAfter the release of the album, Morrison performed a series of concerts at the [[Dominion Theatre]], London, opened by Herbie Armstrong with an [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] set.<ref name=\"Collis, p.156\"/> Paul Charles, who managed Morrison's business affairs at the time, commented that <blockquote>\"The idea [behind the Dominion residencies] was [to go against the] 'come into town, do one show, get all the press down, get the radio and TV and record-company people' [mentally]. My logic was, 'Look, with Van it's not just a rock & roll tour. It's not just here's the hits, here's the new record, please buy it, whatever.' It was a ''performance''. ... A certain number of people would come back every night, [knowing that] Van will not have a set-list that he adheres to religiously ... So I thought, 'Here's a way. Van is not having any singles. Van doesn't do TV. How can we get attention to him doing what he does?' Well, the best thing that he does is perform live. I think we did four [concerts] the first time. We ended up doing eleven [in 1984]. We got a lot of coverage, we got a lot of attention, without him having to do something he didn't like.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|pages=373\u2013374}}</ref></blockquote> Morrison's love of live performing was reignited by this set of concerts and he commented at the time that it was \"more like appearing in a play, going to the theatre and doing your job every day - which I prefer to touring because that's very fragmented and disorientating.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|page=374}}</ref> According to Johnny Rogan, these performances \"are still regarded by many as his most memorable since the glory days of the Caledonia Soul Orchestra.<ref name=\"Rogan, p.338\"/> A concert on 3 to 4 April 1982 at the [[Grugahalle]], [[Essen]], Germany, was broadcast in many European countries as a TV/radio [[simulcast]] in the ''[[Rockpalast]]'' TV series by German TV station [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]].
