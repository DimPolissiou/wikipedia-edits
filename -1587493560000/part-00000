Hitler's view towards race and people can be found throughout ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' but more specifically in chapter 11 \"Nation and Race\". The standard-issue propaganda text issued to members of the Hitler Youth contained a chapter on \"the race of the German people\" that heavily cited the works of Hans F. K. G\u00fcnther.

Himmler, who possessed a great interest in, and was influenced by, the anthropology, philosophies and pantheistic religions of East Asia, mentioned how his friend [[Hiroshi \u014cshima]], the [[List of Japanese ministers, envoys and ambassadors to Germany|Japanese Ambassador to Germany]], believed that the noble castes in Japan, the [[Daimy\u014d]] and the [[Samurai]], were descended from gods of celestial origin, which was similar to Himmler's own belief that \"the Nordic race did not evolve, but came directly down from heaven to settle on the [[Atlantis|Atlantic continent]].\"<ref name=\"report\">''The Activities of Dr. Ernst Schaefer'', OI - Final Interrogation Report (OI-FIR) No. 32, Secret - United States Forces European Theater Military Intelligence Service Center APO 757, February 12, 1946, p. 4.</ref>\n\n[[Karl Haushofer]], a German general, geographer, and geopolitician, whose ideas may have influenced the development of Hitler's expansionist strategies, saw Japan as the brother nation of Germany.

The assignment changed the course of his life and marked the beginning of his love affair with the orient. During the next four years he traveled extensively in East Asia, adding Korean, Japanese, and Mandarin to his repertoire of Russian, French, and English languages. Karl Haushofer had been a devout student of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and during his stay in the Far East he was introduced to Oriental esoteric teachings.\"<ref>''The Swastika and the Nazi's'', Servando Gonz\u00e1lez, Chapter 2: The Haushofer Connection, 1997-1998.</ref> It was based on such teachings that he came to make similar bestowals of his own upon the Japanese people, calling them the \"Aryans of the East\", and even calling them the \"[[Herrenvolk]] of the Orient\" (i.e. the \"[[Master race]] of the Orient\").<ref>''The Spear of Destiny: The occult power behind the spear which pierced the side of Christ and how Hitler inverted the force in a bid to conquer the world'', Trevor Ravenscroft, p. 229, June 1982.</ref>\n\nThe Chinese and Japanese were still subject to Germany's [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial laws]], however, which &ndash; with the exception of the 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]], which specifically mentioned Jews &ndash; generally applied to all \"non-Aryans\" although since Japanese and Chinese were given \"Honorary Aryan\" status these racial laws were applied to them in a more lenient manner as compared to other \"non-Aryans\" who were not granted \"Honorary Aryan\" status by Adolf Hitler. Hitler's government began enacting the laws after taking power in 1933, and the Japanese government initially protested several racial incidents involving Japanese or Japanese-Germans that year which were then resolved by the Nazi high command by treating their Japanese allies leniently in these disputes. Especially after the collapse of Sino-German cooperation and Chinese declaration of war on Germany, [[Persecution of Chinese people in Nazi Germany|Chinese nationals faced prosecution in Germany]]. Influential Nazi anti-Semite [[Johann von Leers]] favored excluding Japanese from the laws due both to the alleged Japanese-Aryan racial link and to improve diplomatic relations with Japan. The [[German Foreign Ministry|Foreign Ministry]] agreed with von Leers and sought several times between 1934 and 1937 to change the laws, but other government agencies, including the [[Racial Policy Office]], opposed the change.{{r|furuya2000}}\n\nAn October 1933 statement by [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] [[Konstantin von Neurath]] which falsely claimed in response to the Japanese protests that Japanese were exempt, however, was widely publicized and caused many in Germany, Japan, and elsewhere to believe that such an exemption existed. Instead of a broad exemption, an April 1935 decree stated that racial discrimination cases involving non-Aryans that might jeopardize German diplomatic relations&mdash;i.e., Japanese&mdash;would be dealt with individually. Decisions on such cases often took years, with those affected unable to obtain jobs or interracially marry, primarily because the German government preferred as much as possible to avoid giving exemptions. The German government often exempted more German-Japanese than it preferred in order to avoid a repeat of the 1933 controversies, and in 1934 it [[Censorship in Nazi Germany|prohibited the German press]] from discussing the race laws when Japanese were involved.<ref name=\"furuya2000\">{{cite book | title=Japanese Prisoners of War | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |editor1=Towle, Philip|editorlink1 = Philip Towle |editor2=Kosuge, Margaret |editor3=Kibata, Y\u014dichi | author=Furuya, Harumi | chapter=Japan's Racial Identity in the Second World War: The Cultural Context of the Japanese Treatment of POWs | year=2000 | pages=123\u2013124, 126\u2013130, 132\u2013134 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktCv32ysz0AC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117#v=onepage&q&f=false | isbn=1-85285-192-9}}</ref>\n\n===Aryan: Finns===\n\nAs Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941]], Finland participated in the invasion primarily to recover the territories it was forced to cede to the USSR after the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] which ended the [[Winter War]] between the Finns and the Soviets.<ref name=\"rich\">Rich, Norman (1974).

Germany was said to be 55% Nordic, and the rest Alpine (particularly [[southern Germany]]), Dinaric, or East Baltic (particularly [[eastern Germany]]). On the British Isles, Gunther stated: \"we may adopt the following racial proportions for these islands: Nordic blood, 60 percent; Mediterranean, 30 percent; Alpine, 10 percent.\" He added that \"The Nordic strain in Germany seems to be rather more distributed over the whole people than in England, where it seems to belong far more to the upper classes.\"<ref>Gunther 1927, Chapter: Distribution of European Races in Europe: Britain, France, Germany, and Belgium.

He characterized the French as possessing the following racial proportions: Nordic, 25%; Alpine or Dinaric, 50%; Mediterranean, 25%. These types were said to be most prevalent in north, central, and southern France respectively.<ref>Gunther 1927, p. 65</ref>\n\nHitler planned to remove a large portion of the French population to make way for German settlement. The [[Zone interdite]] of eastern France was set aside and planned to be made part of the German Reich after the rest of France was fully subdued. The French residents of the zone, some 7 million people accounting for nearly 20% of the French population at the time, were to be deported, and the land then occupied by at least a million German settlers. The plan was either postponed or abandoned after Operation Barbarossa in favor of expediting the settlement of the east instead, and was never put into place owing to the German defeat in the Second World War.<ref>Kroener, Bernhard R.; M\u00fcller, Rolf-Dieter; Umbreit, Hans (2000). \"Germany and the Second World War: Organization and mobilization of the German sphere of power.

Despite classifying these populations as Aryans, and regarding them as superior in the arts compared to Nordics and Germans, the Nazis considered them to be less industrious than predominantly Nordic peoples like the Germans and English were, and in keeping with this view, the Nazis considered them to be marginally inferior to the Nordic race. In Nazi propaganda the \"Mediterranean\" race was described as brown-haired, brown-eyed, brownish-skinned, and short (average 162&nbsp;cm), with dolichocephalic or [[Cephalic index#Indices|mesocephalic]] skulls, and lean builds. People who fit this category were described as \"lively, even loquacious\" and \"excitable, even passionate\", but they were also described as being \"prone to act more on feeling than on reason\", and as a result, \"this race has produced only a few outstanding men.\"<ref>Harwood L. Childs (translator). \"The Nazi Primer.\" New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1938. Page 24-25.</ref>\n\nThe [[South Tyrol Option Agreement|question of the South Tyrol]] was largely and pragmatically dealt with by Hitler and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]: this region of Austria's Tyrol, which was annexed by Italy after 1919, would not become a constituent district of [[Ostmark (Austria)|Ostmark]] (present-day Austria). Ethnic Germans who lived in the South Tyrol were given the option of either migrating back to the German Reich or remaining in the South Tyrol where they would undergo forced [[Italianization]].\n\n===Iran, Turkey, and the Arab World===\nBeginning in 1933, the Nazi leadership in Germany made efforts to increase their influence in Iran, and they financed and managed a racist journal, ''Iran-e Bastan'', co-edited by a pro-Nazi Iranian, Sheikh Abdul-Rahman Seif. This and other [[chauvinistic]] publications in the 1930s were popular among Iranian elites; they \"highlighted the past and the pre-Islamic glories of the Persian nation and blamed the supposedly 'savage Arabs and Turks' for the backwardness of Iran.\"<ref name=\"Irani\">Asgharzadeh, Alireza.

K. G\u00fcnther]], on whom Hitler based much of his ideology, wrote extensively about the supposed racial origins of the Poles and other West Slavs. Originally, the West Slavs were supposed to be Nordic, but were diluted by mixture with inferior races starting in the 12th century. The dominant type among Poles in the modern day then became the [[East Baltic race]].<ref name=gunther171 /> However, some Poles were considered to have enough Nordic admixture to be assimilated, supposedly being descended from the Nordic ruling class of the old West Slavs. Others, especially in the southern regions of the country, had a strong amount of \"Inner Asiatic\" racial ancestry, and as East Baltic/Inner Asiatic mixes were the most inferior.<ref>G\u00fcnther (1927), p.74 (Chapter 6)</ref> Of the Poles and predominantly East Baltic people in general, G\u00fcnther said that they were mentally slow and incapable of long term planning, which influenced Nazi perception of the Poles: \"after weeks of dreary toil the East Baltic man will often heedlessly squander all that he has earned... 'Nihilism' lies deep in the East Baltic soul. He seldom knows how to keep the wealth he has earned; riches make him extravagant and fond of show. His mind is not capable of quick decision, but with all its slowness it is penetrating...  He has little cleanliness, whether personal or in the home.\"<ref>G\u00fcnther (1927), p.41 (Chapter 3)</ref> He also characterized Poles as predisposed to violence, and blamed crime in the German border regions on racemixing, saying: \"The East Baltic man inclines to brutality in his sexual relations, and, indeed, to brutality in general. The German districts with most East Baltic blood have a heavy proportion of crime.\"<ref>G\u00fcnther (1927), p.40 (Chapter 3)</ref>\n\n== Racialist ideology ==\n{{see also|Racial policy of Nazi Germany}}\n\n=== Ideology ===\nDifferent Nazis offered a range of arguments\u2014some pseudo-religious, others pseudoscientific\u2014as to why the Aryan or European people were racially superior to people of other races. But the central dogma of Aryan superiority was espoused by officials throughout the party.\n\n[[Richard Walther Darr\u00e9]], Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture from 1933 to 1942, popularized the expression ''\"[[Blut und Boden]]\"'' (\"Blood and Soil\"), one of the many terms in the [[Nazi glossary]] [[ideology|ideologically]] used to enforce popular [[racism]] in the German population.  There were many academic and administrative scholars of race who all had somewhat divergent views about the social misconception of racism, including [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Hans F. K. G\u00fcnther]] <ref>[[Michael Burleigh|Burleigh, Michael]] (1996) ''Confronting the Nazi Past: New Debates on Modern German History''.

The Nazi state used such ideas about the differences between European races as part of their various discriminatory and coercive policies which culminated in [[the Holocaust]]. \n\nIronically, the first (1916) edition of the American eugenicist [[Madison Grant]]'s {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} popular book ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} classified Germans as being primarily Nordic, but the second edition, published after the USA had entered WWI, reclassified the now-enemy power as being dominated by \"inferior\" Alpines, a tradition echoed in the work of Harvard Professor of Anthropology [[Carleton Coon]]'s work ''The Races of Europe'' (1939).\n\nG\u00fcnther's work stated that the Germans are definitely not a fully Nordic people, and divided them into Western (Mediterranean), Nordic, Eastern (Alpine), East Baltic and Dinaric races. Hitler himself was later to downplay the importance of Nordicism in public for this very reason. The simplistic tripartite model of Grant which divided Europeans into only Alpine, Mediterranean, and Nordic, G\u00fcnther did not use, and erroneously placed most of the population of Hitler's Germany in the Alpine category, especially after the [[Anschluss]]. This has been used to downplay the Nordic presence in Germany. Gunther considered Jews an \"Asiatic race inferior to all European races\".<ref>Anton Wendt, Eradicating Differences, p.63</ref>\n\nJ. Kaup led a movement opposed to G\u00fcnther. Kaup took the view that a German nation, all of whose citizens belonged to a \"German race\" in a populationist sense, offered a more convenient sociotechnical tool than G\u00fcnther's concept of an ideal Nordic type to which only a very few Germans could belong. Nazi legislation identifying the ethnic and \"racial\" affinities of the Jews reflects the populationist concept of race. Discrimination was not restricted to Jews who belonged to the \"Semitic-Oriental-Armenoid\" and/or \"Nubian-African/Negroid\" races, but was directed against all members of the Jewish ethnic population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiercinski|first=Andrzej|last2=Bielicki|first2=Tadeusz|author2-link=|title=The Racial Analysis of Human Populations in Relation to Their Ethnogenesis|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2, 9\u201346|date=February 1962|doi=10.1086/200244}}</ref>\n\nThe German Jewish journalist Kurt Caro (1905\u20131979) who emigrated to Paris in 1933 and served in the British army from 1943,<ref>{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Kurt Caro | publisher =[[German Federal Archives]] | url = https://www.bundesarchiv.de/aktenreichskanzlei/1919-1933/0001/adr/adrag/kap1_3/para2_16.html |accessdate=5 May 2008}}</ref> published a book under the pseudonym Manuel Humbert unmasking Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in which he stated the following racial composition of the Jewish population of Central Europe: 23.8% Lapponoid race, 21.5% Nordic race,\n20.3% Armenoid race, 18.4% Mediterranean race, 16.0% Oriental race.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\".

The relationship between [[Heidegger and Nazism]] has remained a controversial subject in the [[history of philosophy]], even today.

However, Heidegger did to a certain extent criticize racial science, particularly in his Nietzsche lectures, which reject biologism in general, while generally speaking even Heidegger's most German nationalist and pro-Nazi works of the early 30s, such as his infamous Rectorial address, lack any overtly racialized language. Thus it is problematic to connect Heidegger with any racial theory.  [[Carl Schmitt]] elaborated a [[philosophy of law]] praising the ''F\u00fchrerprinzip'' and the German people, while [[Alfred Baeumler]] instrumentalized [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's thought]], in particular his concept of the \"''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|Will to Power]]''\", in an attempt to justify Nazism.\n\n== Propaganda and implementation of racial theories ==\n[[File:Deutsches Historisches Museum Der St\u00fcrmerplakat.jpg|160px|left|thumb|Poster in the Nazi newspaper ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'' showing \"Rassenschande\" (lit.

The [[Hitler Youth]], founded in 1922, had among its basic motivations the training of future \"Aryan supermen\" and future soldiers who would faithfully fight for the Third Reich.\n\n[[Nazism and cinema|Cinema]] was also used to promote racist theories, under the direction of [[Joseph Goebbels]]' [[Propagandaministerium]]. The [[German Hygiene Museum]] in Dresden diffused racial theories.

Himmler, who possessed a great interest in, and was influenced by, the anthropology, philosophies and pantheistic religions of East Asia, mentioned how his friend [[Hiroshi \u014cshima]], the [[List of Japanese ministers, envoys and ambassadors to Germany|Japanese Ambassador to Germany]], believed that the noble castes in Japan, the [[Daimy\u014d]] and the [[Samurai]], were descended from gods of celestial origin, which was similar to Himmler's own belief that \"the Nordic race did not evolve, but came directly down from heaven to settle on the [[Atlantis|Atlantic continent]].\"<ref name=\"report\">''The Activities of Dr. Ernst Schaefer'', OI - Final Interrogation Report (OI-FIR) No. 32, Secret - United States Forces European Theater Military Intelligence Service Center APO 757, February 12, 1946, p. 4.</ref>\n\n[[Karl Haushofer]], a German general, geographer, and geopolitician, whose ideas may have influenced the development of Hitler's expansionist strategies, saw Japan as the brother nation of Germany.

The assignment changed the course of his life and marked the beginning of his love affair with the orient. During the next four years he traveled extensively in East Asia, adding Korean, Japanese, and Mandarin to his repertoire of Russian, French, and English languages. Karl Haushofer had been a devout student of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and during his stay in the Far East he was introduced to Oriental esoteric teachings.\"<ref>''The Swastika and the Nazi's'', Servando Gonz\u00e1lez, Chapter 2: The Haushofer Connection, 1997-1998.</ref> It was based on such teachings that he came to make similar bestowals of his own upon the Japanese people, calling them the \"Aryans of the East\", and even calling them the \"[[Herrenvolk]] of the Orient\" (i.e. the \"[[Master race]] of the Orient\").<ref>''The Spear of Destiny: The occult power behind the spear which pierced the side of Christ and how Hitler inverted the force in a bid to conquer the world'', Trevor Ravenscroft, p. 229, June 1982.</ref>\n\nThe Chinese and Japanese were still subject to Germany's [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial laws]], however, which &ndash; with the exception of the 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]], which specifically mentioned Jews &ndash; generally applied to all \"non-Aryans\" although since Japanese and Chinese were given \"Honorary Aryan\" status these racial laws were applied to them in a more lenient manner as compared to other \"non-Aryans\" who were not granted \"Honorary Aryan\" status by Adolf Hitler. Hitler's government began enacting the laws after taking power in 1933, and the Japanese government initially protested several racial incidents involving Japanese or Japanese-Germans that year which were then resolved by the Nazi high command by treating their Japanese allies leniently in these disputes. Especially after the collapse of Sino-German cooperation and Chinese declaration of war on Germany, [[Persecution of Chinese people in Nazi Germany|Chinese nationals faced prosecution in Germany]]. Influential Nazi anti-Semite [[Johann von Leers]] favored excluding Japanese from the laws due both to the alleged Japanese-Aryan racial link and to improve diplomatic relations with Japan. The [[German Foreign Ministry|Foreign Ministry]] agreed with von Leers and sought several times between 1934 and 1937 to change the laws, but other government agencies, including the [[Racial Policy Office]], opposed the change.{{r|furuya2000}}\n\nAn October 1933 statement by [[Foreign Minister of Germany|Foreign Minister]] [[Konstantin von Neurath]] which falsely claimed in response to the Japanese protests that Japanese were exempt, however, was widely publicized and caused many in Germany, Japan, and elsewhere to believe that such an exemption existed. Instead of a broad exemption, an April 1935 decree stated that racial discrimination cases involving non-Aryans that might jeopardize German diplomatic relations&mdash;i.e., Japanese&mdash;would be dealt with individually. Decisions on such cases often took years, with those affected unable to obtain jobs or interracially marry, primarily because the German government preferred as much as possible to avoid giving exemptions. The German government often exempted more German-Japanese than it preferred in order to avoid a repeat of the 1933 controversies, and in 1934 it [[Censorship in Nazi Germany|prohibited the German press]] from discussing the race laws when Japanese were involved.<ref name=\"furuya2000\">{{cite book | title=Japanese Prisoners of War | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |editor1=Towle, Philip|editorlink1 = Philip Towle |editor2=Kosuge, Margaret |editor3=Kibata, Y\u014dichi | author=Furuya, Harumi | chapter=Japan's Racial Identity in the Second World War: The Cultural Context of the Japanese Treatment of POWs | year=2000 | pages=123\u2013124, 126\u2013130, 132\u2013134 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktCv32ysz0AC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117#v=onepage&q&f=false | isbn=1-85285-192-9}}</ref>\n\n===Aryan: Finns===\n\nAs Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941]], Finland participated in the invasion primarily to recover the territories it was forced to cede to the USSR after the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] which ended the [[Winter War]] between the Finns and the Soviets.<ref name=\"rich\">Rich, Norman (1974).

Germany was said to be 55% Nordic, and the rest Alpine (particularly [[southern Germany]]), Dinaric, or East Baltic (particularly [[eastern Germany]]). On the British Isles, Gunther stated: \"we may adopt the following racial proportions for these islands: Nordic blood, 60 percent; Mediterranean, 30 percent; Alpine, 10 percent.\" He added that \"The Nordic strain in Germany seems to be rather more distributed over the whole people than in England, where it seems to belong far more to the upper classes.\"<ref>Gunther 1927, Chapter: Distribution of European Races in Europe: Britain, France, Germany, and Belgium.

He characterized the French as possessing the following racial proportions: Nordic, 25%; Alpine or Dinaric, 50%; Mediterranean, 25%. These types were said to be most prevalent in north, central, and southern France respectively.<ref>Gunther 1927, p. 65</ref>\n\nHitler planned to remove a large portion of the French population to make way for German settlement. The [[Zone interdite]] of eastern France was set aside and planned to be made part of the German Reich after the rest of France was fully subdued. The French residents of the zone, some 7 million people accounting for nearly 20% of the French population at the time, were to be deported, and the land then occupied by at least a million German settlers. The plan was either postponed or abandoned after Operation Barbarossa in favor of expediting the settlement of the east instead, and was never put into place owing to the German defeat in the Second World War.<ref>Kroener, Bernhard R.; M\u00fcller, Rolf-Dieter; Umbreit, Hans (2000). \"Germany and the Second World War: Organization and mobilization of the German sphere of power.

Despite classifying these populations as Aryans, and regarding them as superior in the arts compared to Nordics and Germans, the Nazis considered them to be less industrious than predominantly Nordic peoples like the Germans and English were, and in keeping with this view, the Nazis considered them to be marginally inferior to the Nordic race. In Nazi propaganda the \"Mediterranean\" race was described as brown-haired, brown-eyed, brownish-skinned, and short (average 162&nbsp;cm), with dolichocephalic or [[Cephalic index#Indices|mesocephalic]] skulls, and lean builds. People who fit this category were described as \"lively, even loquacious\" and \"excitable, even passionate\", but they were also described as being \"prone to act more on feeling than on reason\", and as a result, \"this race has produced only a few outstanding men.\"<ref>Harwood L. Childs (translator). \"The Nazi Primer.\" New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1938.

Ethnic Germans who lived in the South Tyrol were given the option of either migrating back to the German Reich or remaining in the South Tyrol where they would undergo forced [[Italianization]].\n\n===Iran, Turkey, and the Arab World===\nBeginning in 1933, the Nazi leadership in Germany made efforts to increase their influence in Iran, and they financed and managed a racist journal, ''Iran-e Bastan'', co-edited by a pro-Nazi Iranian, Sheikh Abdul-Rahman Seif. This and other [[chauvinistic]] publications in the 1930s were popular among Iranian elites; they \"highlighted the past and the pre-Islamic glories of the Persian nation and blamed the supposedly 'savage Arabs and Turks' for the backwardness of Iran.\"<ref name=\"Irani\">Asgharzadeh, Alireza.

K. G\u00fcnther]], on whom Hitler based much of his ideology, wrote extensively about the supposed racial origins of the Poles and other West Slavs. Originally, the West Slavs were supposed to be Nordic, but were diluted by mixture with inferior races starting in the 12th century. The dominant type among Poles in the modern day then became the [[East Baltic race]].<ref name=gunther171 /> However, some Poles were considered to have enough Nordic admixture to be assimilated, supposedly being descended from the Nordic ruling class of the old West Slavs. Others, especially in the southern regions of the country, had a strong amount of \"Inner Asiatic\" racial ancestry, and as East Baltic/Inner Asiatic mixes were the most inferior.<ref>G\u00fcnther (1927), p.74 (Chapter 6)</ref> Of the Poles and predominantly East Baltic people in general, G\u00fcnther said that they were mentally slow and incapable of long term planning, which influenced Nazi perception of the Poles: \"after weeks of dreary toil the East Baltic man will often heedlessly squander all that he has earned... 'Nihilism' lies deep in the East Baltic soul. He seldom knows how to keep the wealth he has earned; riches make him extravagant and fond of show. His mind is not capable of quick decision, but with all its slowness it is penetrating...  He has little cleanliness, whether personal or in the home.\"<ref>G\u00fcnther (1927), p.41 (Chapter 3)</ref> He also characterized Poles as predisposed to violence, and blamed crime in the German border regions on racemixing, saying: \"The East Baltic man inclines to brutality in his sexual relations, and, indeed, to brutality in general. The German districts with most East Baltic blood have a heavy proportion of crime.\"<ref>G\u00fcnther (1927), p.40 (Chapter 3)</ref>\n\n== Racialist ideology ==\n{{see also|Racial policy of Nazi Germany}}\n\n=== Ideology ===\nDifferent Nazis offered a range of arguments\u2014some pseudo-religious, others pseudoscientific\u2014as to why the Aryan or European people were racially superior to people of other races. But the central dogma of Aryan superiority was espoused by officials throughout the party.\n\n[[Richard Walther Darr\u00e9]], Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture from 1933 to 1942, popularized the expression ''\"[[Blut und Boden]]\"'' (\"Blood and Soil\"), one of the many terms in the [[Nazi glossary]] [[ideology|ideologically]] used to enforce popular [[racism]] in the German population.  There were many academic and administrative scholars of race who all had somewhat divergent views about the social misconception of racism, including [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Hans F. K. G\u00fcnther]] <ref>[[Michael Burleigh|Burleigh, Michael]] (1996) ''Confronting the Nazi Past: New Debates on Modern German History''.

The Nazi state used such ideas about the differences between European races as part of their various discriminatory and coercive policies which culminated in [[the Holocaust]]. \n\nIronically, the first (1916) edition of the American eugenicist [[Madison Grant]]'s {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} popular book ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} classified Germans as being primarily Nordic, but the second edition, published after the USA had entered WWI, reclassified the now-enemy power as being dominated by \"inferior\" Alpines, a tradition echoed in the work of Harvard Professor of Anthropology [[Carleton Coon]]'s work ''The Races of Europe'' (1939).\n\nG\u00fcnther's work stated that the Germans are definitely not a fully Nordic people, and divided them into Western (Mediterranean), Nordic, Eastern (Alpine), East Baltic and Dinaric races. Hitler himself was later to downplay the importance of Nordicism in public for this very reason. The simplistic tripartite model of Grant which divided Europeans into only Alpine, Mediterranean, and Nordic, G\u00fcnther did not use, and erroneously placed most of the population of Hitler's Germany in the Alpine category, especially after the [[Anschluss]]. This has been used to downplay the Nordic presence in Germany. Gunther considered Jews an \"Asiatic race inferior to all European races\".<ref>Anton Wendt, Eradicating Differences, p.63</ref>\n\nJ. Kaup led a movement opposed to G\u00fcnther. Kaup took the view that a German nation, all of whose citizens belonged to a \"German race\" in a populationist sense, offered a more convenient sociotechnical tool than G\u00fcnther's concept of an ideal Nordic type to which only a very few Germans could belong. Nazi legislation identifying the ethnic and \"racial\" affinities of the Jews reflects the populationist concept of race. Discrimination was not restricted to Jews who belonged to the \"Semitic-Oriental-Armenoid\" and/or \"Nubian-African/Negroid\" races, but was directed against all members of the Jewish ethnic population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wiercinski|first=Andrzej|last2=Bielicki|first2=Tadeusz|author2-link=|title=The Racial Analysis of Human Populations in Relation to Their Ethnogenesis|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2, 9\u201346|date=February 1962|doi=10.1086/200244}}</ref>\n\nThe German Jewish journalist Kurt Caro (1905\u20131979) who emigrated to Paris in 1933 and served in the British army from 1943,<ref>{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Kurt Caro | publisher =[[German Federal Archives]] | url = https://www.bundesarchiv.de/aktenreichskanzlei/1919-1933/0001/adr/adrag/kap1_3/para2_16.html |accessdate=5 May 2008}}</ref> published a book under the pseudonym Manuel Humbert unmasking Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in which he stated the following racial composition of the Jewish population of Central Europe: 23.8% Lapponoid race, 21.5% Nordic race,\n20.3% Armenoid race, 18.4% Mediterranean race, 16.0% Oriental race.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\".

The relationship between [[Heidegger and Nazism]] has remained a controversial subject in the [[history of philosophy]], even today.

However, Heidegger did to a certain extent criticize racial science, particularly in his Nietzsche lectures, which reject biologism in general, while generally speaking even Heidegger's most German nationalist and pro-Nazi works of the early 30s, such as his infamous Rectorial address, lack any overtly racialized language. Thus it is problematic to connect Heidegger with any racial theory.  [[Carl Schmitt]] elaborated a [[philosophy of law]] praising the ''F\u00fchrerprinzip'' and the German people, while [[Alfred Baeumler]] instrumentalized [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's thought]], in particular his concept of the \"''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|Will to Power]]''\", in an attempt to justify Nazism.\n\n== Propaganda and implementation of racial theories ==\n[[File:Deutsches Historisches Museum Der St\u00fcrmerplakat.jpg|160px|left|thumb|Poster in the Nazi newspaper ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'' showing \"Rassenschande\" (lit.

The [[Hitler Youth]], founded in 1922, had among its basic motivations the training of future \"Aryan supermen\" and future soldiers who would faithfully fight for the Third Reich.\n\n[[Nazism and cinema|Cinema]] was also used to promote racist theories, under the direction of [[Joseph Goebbels]]' [[Propagandaministerium]]. The [[German Hygiene Museum]] in Dresden diffused racial theories.

He was picked to play against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in July 1949, when he was 18&nbsp;years old. Close went on to play 22&nbsp;[[Test cricket|Test matches]] for England, [[captain (cricket)|captaining]] them seven times to six wins and one drawn test. Close also captained [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] to four [[county cricket|county championship]] titles \u2013 the main domestic trophy in English cricket. He later went on to captain [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]], where he is widely credited with developing the county into a hard-playing team, and helping to mould [[Viv Richards]] and [[Ian Botham]] into the successful players they became.\n\nThroughout his cricket career, which lasted from 1948 until the 1977 season, Close was one of the most charismatic and well-known cricketers. He scored almost 35,000&nbsp;[[run (cricket)|runs]] as a [[batsman (cricket)|batsman]], including 52&nbsp;[[century (cricket)|centuries]] with a highest [[innings (cricket)|innings]] score of 198. He also took 1,168&nbsp;[[wickets]] as a [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]], over 800&nbsp;[[caught (cricket)|catches]] as a [[fielding (cricket)|fielder]] and one [[stumping]], as a stand-in [[wicket-keeper]]. At just over six feet (1.83 m) tall he was a noticeable presence on the field, often fielding at the short leg position, close to the batsman. As cricketers did not use head or body protection in Close's day, he would often get hurt when a batsman struck a ball that hit him. Close was also noted, as a batsman, for standing up to intimidatory bowling, letting the ball hit his unprotected torso rather than flinching.\n\nClose was known as a cricketing gambler; he was prepared to take risks and to court controversy throughout his career. He was serving a \"confined to barracks\" punishment during his [[National Service|military service]] when selected for his first international cricket tour to Australia in 1950, was sacked as England captain for timewasting, and later sacked by Yorkshire for his lukewarm attitude to [[one-day cricket]]. He was also accused of not giving enough support to younger Yorkshire cricketers. He attracted further criticism by touring [[apartheid]] [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and white-minority-controlled [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Rhodesia]] with private teams. As chairman of Yorkshire's cricket subcommittee he had many run-ins with the then Yorkshire captain, [[Geoffrey Boycott]]. However, he continued to serve Yorkshire cricket, and in his seventies was coaching and occasionally captaining the county's Colts XI. He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9.<ref name=\"Presidents\">{{cite web|url=https://yorkshireccc.com/history/past-presidents |title=List Of Yorkshire County Cricket Club Presidents|publisher=Yorkshire County Cricket Club|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nClose was born into a [[working class]] family in [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], around {{convert|7|miles}} west of [[Leeds]], on 24 February 1931. His parents were Harry, a weaver, and Esther (''n\u00e9e'' Barrett). He was the second eldest of five boys and a girl. The family lived in a series of small [[council houses]] in Rawdon, [[Guiseley]] and [[Yeadon, West Yorkshire|Yeadon]]. Growing up, Close practised cricket with his father in the houses' back gardens; Harry Close was himself a keen cricketer, who [[wicket-keeper|kept wicket]] and was a big hitter in the [[Bradford Cricket League]], although he never attained the standard of the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire county team]].{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=12\u201314}} Rawdon had cricketing pedigree: [[Hedley Verity]]\u2014an [[England cricket team|England]] international in the period before the [[Second World War]]\u2014grew up there, and the Verity family continued to live in the village.{{sfn|Waters|2014|pp=16\u201318}} At Rawdon Littlemoor Primary School, Close was taught by Grace Verity, Hedley's sister, and he was friends with two of his children, Wilfred and Douglas.{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=14}}\n\nAt [[Aireborough Grammar School]], Close excelled both academically and athletically. The school went went unbeaten in the six cricketing summers while Close was there,{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=17}} and the school's sport's master arranged for him to receive coaching from [[George Hirst]], a former England international who coached Yorkshire.<ref name=\"coty\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154558.html |title=Cricketer of the Year 1964: Brian Close |work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |year=1964 |via=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref> Close dominated junior level cricket in the area; he joined Rawdon Cricket Club in 1942, when he was eleven years of age, and was almost immediately selected to play for both the under-18 side and the second team.{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=18\u201319}} Close was also proficient at [[association football|football]], and at the age of fourteen, he was signed as an [[amateur sports|amateur]] by [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. A natural inside forward, he became the first Leeds player to feature as a youth international, when in October 1948 he played with [[England national football team|England]] against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie Park]] in [[Aberdeen]].{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=22}}\n\nAfter passing his [[Higher School Certificate (England and Wales)|Higher School Certificate]], Close seriously considered becoming a doctor; his headmaster at Aireborough believed that he could have been accepted into [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] or [[Oxford University|Oxford]] university,{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=15}} but he was not allowed to start university until he had completed two years of [[national service]] with the military. With the enforced break from his studies he chose to try a career as a professional sportsman; he signed a professional contract with Leeds United and having already played for the Yorkshire Colts in second eleven cricket, he joined them for winter coaching. The coaches encouraged Close to switch from bowling [[Seam bowling|seam]] to being an [[off spin]]ner.<ref name=\"coty\"/>\n\n==Yorkshire and England==\n\n===Debut season===\nIn February 1949, Close underwent a medical examination with the [[British Army]], but due to an injury he had suffered playing football his call-up was delayed by a few months, allowing him to continue into pre-season training with Yorkshire.{{sfn|Close|Mosey|1979|p=13}} His performance in pre-season was such that he was given a trial for the county in the two [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford]] Universities. He made his debut on 11 May 1949, alongside [[Fred Trueman]] and [[Frank Lowson]] \u2013 all three went on to play for England.<ref name=\"tough-guy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/20573453/cricket-tough-guy |title=Cricket's Tough Guy |last=Hodgson |first=Derek |date=14 September 2015 |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref> Close impressed the Yorkshire hierarchy enough for his trial to be extended into the [[County Championship]] season;<ref name=\"coty\"/> [[Bill Bowes]], one of Yorkshire's coaches, declared that he was the \"natural successor to the veteran [[all-rounder]] [[Frank Smailes]]\".<ref name=\"tough-guy\"/> Close continued to perform well, particularly his bowling; in his fifth first-class game, against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]], Close took five for 58 in Essex's first innings, then top-scored with an [[Not out|undefeated]] 88 [[Run (cricket)|run]]s in the Yorkshire innings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yorkshire v Essex at Leeds, 25\u201327 May 1949 |website=ESPNcricinfo|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1940S/1949/ENG_LOCAL/CC/YORKS_ESSEX_CC_25-27MAY1949.html|accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref> His performances for Yorkshire earned him a place in the [[North v South]] match, which was also being used as a trial for selection for the upcoming [[Test cricket|Test matches]] against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]].

When he reached his half-century he was congratulated by the Gentlemen's wicket-keeper, [[Billy Griffith]], who said: \"Well played, Brian\", to which Close responded: \"Thank you, Billy\". Ten days later, he was called to see [[Brian Sellers]], a member of the Yorkshire committee, who reprimanded Close for his effrontery in not addressing an amateur player as \"Mister\".{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=7}} Despite this rebuke, the Yorkshire committee secured the assistance of the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Bradford Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford Central]], [[Maurice Webb (politician)|Maurice Webb]], who successfully requested that Close be allowed to complete the 1949 season for Yorkshire, before commencing his National Service.{{sfn|Close|Mosey|1979|p=13}}{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=23}}\n\nClose was then selected to play for England in the third Test match at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] against the [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 1949|touring New Zealanders]]; a decision praised by ''The Times'', who described him as \"a young all-round cricketer of such promise as to demand immediate encouragement.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS68897010/TTDA?u=wikipedia&sid=TTDA&xid=418c5806 |title=England's Test Team |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |issue=51436 |page=4 |date=18 July 1949 |via=Gale}}</ref> In the match, Close became, and to date remains, [[English cricket team|England's]] youngest-ever Test player, aged 18 years and 149 days.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/209994.html |title=Test matches: Youngest players |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref> He came in to bat when England needed quick runs, his instruction from [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]], the captain, being to \"have a look at a couple and then give it a go\".{{sfn|Close|Mosey|1979|p=11}} Close duly played two balls back to the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]], then hit out for the [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]], only to be caught in the outfield for a score of nought.

Once he was fit again, he was given weekend passes from the army to play football for Leeds.{{sfn|Close|Mosey|1979|p=15}} During one of these games he was badly injured again: playing against [[Newcastle United F. C.|Newcastle United]] he hurt his thigh in a collision with [[Ted Robledo]]. Showing the stubbornness that he later became famous for, Close played the rest of the game,{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=23\u201324}} but by the time he reported back for duty the next day, it was badly swollen and painful. He was excused from duties again, but not offered any treatment by the army. After around six weeks, he travelled home on leave and got some heat treatment from the Leeds United physiotherapist, but there was little progress until just before Christmas, when another examination by the army revealed [[ossification]] of the thigh.{{sfn|Close|Mosey|1979|p=16}} Two months of treatment and bed rest followed, which Close thinks saved his career, he said that otherwise: \"the injury would have finished me. I would never had bent my leg again.\"{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=24}}\n\nClose returned to fitness in time for the [[1950 English cricket season]],{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=24}} though little of it was first-class: he appeared for Yorkshire once, and made three first-class appearances for the [[Combined Services cricket team]].<ref name=\"fcmatches\">{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Players/0/858/First-Class_Matches.html |title=First-class matches played by Brian Close (786) |website=CricketArchive |accessdate=5 April 2020 |via=Yorkshire CCC}}</ref> He was playing plenty of other cricket; he played in inter-services matches during the week, and obtained weekend passes to play league cricket for Leeds on Saturdays and charity matches on Sundays. Between playing football and cricket, he had little time for anything else, so much so according to Close, he was never given a job in the army, as he would have no time in which to do it.{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=24\u201325}} His performances attracted the attention of the England cricket captain, Brown, who wanted Close to be included in the English party to tour [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] for the [[1950\u201351 Ashes series]]. Brown consulted Close's county coach, former England bowler [[Bill Bowes]], who pleaded with Brown not to select Close, arguing that such early promotion would damage him as a player.{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=1}} Brown ignored Bowes and selected Close.\n\nClose's call-up to the Australian touring party attracted considerable press interest, and a press conference was called at Catterick to give the press a chance to question him. However, his moment of glory also gave rise to controversy, when one pressman found out that Close was \"confined to barracks\" for disciplinary reasons at the time his call-up was announced: he had absented himself from an army cricket match.{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=28}} The pressman promised to stay silent, but a week later a clerk on the camp newspaper telephoned the ''Daily Express'' with the news. However, Close still toured; his National Service was suspended so that he could do so,<ref name=\"CA Profile\">{{cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Articles/0/344.html|title=A profile of Brian Close|last=Ward|first=John|publisher=Cricket Archive|year=2003|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref> as touring sportsmen were considered to be ambassadors for the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"coty\"/>\n\nClose was the youngest player on the tour, and had little in common with the rest of the party; by the end he was not even on talking terms with most of them.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} After a reasonable start, making a century on his First Class debut in Australia, Close faltered, and then became injured, with a badly pulled groin muscle. He was selected to play in the second Test, which England lost by 28&nbsp;runs. After Australia were dismissed for 194, England had collapsed to 54 for 4 when Close came in to bat, with only eight deliveries to go before the lunch interval on the second day. Misjudging the bounce on the [[Melbourne]] [[wicket#One end of the pitch|wicket]], which was somewhat different from the bounce of English wickets, he swept a ball from [[Jack Iverson]] only to get a top edge to [[Sam Loxton]], fielding behind square leg. [[E. W. Swanton]] called it the worst shot he had seen played by a first-class batsman.<ref>Swanton, E.W. (1975) ''Swanton in Australia with MCC 1946\u20131975''. Fontana/Collins. p. 80. {{ISBN|0002162369}}.</ref> The dressing room was silent when he returned. Brown, when advised that Close was a bit down and needed consolation, replied \"Let the blighter stew. He deserves it.\"{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=38}}\n\nLater in [[Tasmania]], Close was ordered to play despite doctor's advice to rest, and as he tried to nurse his injury he acquired a reputation for malingering and insubordination. He was made to play in six of the next seven games. When England won a Test match in Australia for the first time in 13&nbsp;years in the final Test, Close was not present. Nowadays, someone in Close's position would be carefully man-managed, and looked after by captain and team manager. But times were different then, and the Yorkshire stalwarts were proved right: he had been picked too early, and would never be a regular Test player.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Alan|title=Life of Brian|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/417532.html |website=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=17 February 2011|date=4 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Consolidation, 1951 to 1958===\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Brian Close.jpg|150|thumb|right|Close in action.]] -->\n\nThe years between 1951 and 1958 were a period of career consolidation for Close, who achieved 1,000&nbsp;runs in a season five times.<ref name=\"FC Batting\">{{cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/858/f_Batting_by_Season.html|title=First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Brian Close|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref> Immediately after the tour to Australia Close had a good season in 1951, playing for the Combined Services, including a century against the touring [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africans]].

It also threatened to end his cricket career\u2014Close played only two first-class matches in the 1953 cricket season.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\nIn 1954 Close scored his first first-class century for Yorkshire, an undefeated 123 against the touring [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistanis]]. In 1955 he scored his first county championship century. In that year he played one Test match against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], and at the end of the season was only 3&nbsp;wickets short of another 1,000 runs/100 wickets double. He was in the selectors' sights again, and was picked for the tour to Pakistan in 1955/56. This was not a full England tour, and no Test matches were played. Close returned to the full England side in 1957, playing in the first two Tests against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]], but did not perform well enough to secure a regular Test place.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nMeanwhile, in this period, Yorkshire had not won a single [[County Championship]]. At the beginning of 1958 a new captain, [[Ronnie Burnet]], was appointed. Burnet was 40&nbsp;years old, without first-class cricket experience, and seemed an unlikely choice to restore to Yorkshire's fortunes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} It was believed by the Yorkshire committee that Burnet would inject some discipline into the Yorkshire team, but initially the appointment caused problems. Several senior players left the club; [[Johnny Wardle]], Yorkshire's top bowler and Close's preferred choice of captain, was sacked for disciplinary reasons.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\n===Yorkshire as county champions===\nBurnet, aided by Close, was successful in 1959, when Yorkshire at last won the county championship. At the end of that season, as Close later heard, Burnet was told that, having just won the championship, he could have another season as captain, but, if he did, Close would then take over.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} If Burnet resigned immediately, [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] could take over as captain in preference to Close. Burnet chose to step down straight-away. Once Wilson took over, with Close as the senior professional Yorkshire enjoyed a period of almost unbroken success, winning the county championship again in 1960, taking second place in 1961, and winning again in 1962.\n\n===More controversy===\n\nDuring this period Close was called up for his seventh Test in 1961, against Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=4th Test: England v Australia at Manchester, 27 July-1 August 1961|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1961/AUS_IN_ENG/AUS_ENG_T4_27JUL-01AUG1961.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> This match, which at one point England appeared certain to win, turned to disaster, with Close bearing the main blame for England's defeat.\n\nEngland were chasing a total of 256 runs to win the match, with just under four hours left to play. Scoring rapidly, they reached 150 for 1 wicket. Then [[Ted Dexter]] and [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] got out in quick succession to Benaud, who was pitching his [[leg spin|leg breaks]] into the rough outside the right-handers' leg stump. This brought Close to the crease. May, the captain, was instructing his players to go for the runs and secure the victory. Close accordingly took a calculated risk, and chose to hit out. He took one [[six (cricket)|six]] off Benaud, but to the tenth ball he faced he played another unorthodox shot which [[Norm O'Neill|Norman O'Neill]] caught above his head with two hands. Purists were outraged, and as England collapsed to 201 all out and a 54 run defeat, Close took most of the blame, with some commentators saying that he should never play for England again.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\n==Captaincy==\n\n===Yorkshire captaincy===\nAt the end of 1962, Wilson retired, and the Yorkshire committee appointed Close captain. According to Bowes: \"almost overnight it seemed that Brian Close matured\". He wrote, \"Close's field placings were as intelligent and antagonistic as any seen in the county for 25&nbsp;years\".<ref name=\"Hill\" />\n\nClose's attitude, in his own words, was that \"I've always believed that the team is more important than the individual\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} and that credo stood Yorkshire in good stead. [[Ray Illingworth]] noted that when he left Yorkshire to play for  [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], the players there were surprised that, while Yorkshire were perennial Championship winners, the [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]]s of their leading batsmen tended to languish in the 20s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The answer was that Close had honed them to play the innings required at the right time: when quick runs were required, players did not play for their averages, they played for quick runs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose was recalled to the England Test squad in 1963, and played his first full series of five matches, against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=West Indies in England, 1963|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1963/WI_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> His innings in the second Test at [[Lord's]] remains his best known.<ref>{{cite web|title=2nd Test: England v West Indies at Lord's, 20\u201325 June 1963|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1963/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T2_20-25JUN1963.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> When England were pressing for a last-day victory, Close took the battle to the fastest West Indian fast bowlers, [[Wes Hall]] and [[Charlie Griffith]], daring to advance down the wicket to them. This was before body protection and helmets were in use, and time and again the ball struck Close firmly on his body. But he persevered. With no other England player but [[Ken Barrington]] scoring above 20, Close's innings of 70 saved the game for England, and came near to winning it. Set 234 to win, England ended on 228 for 9, with [[Colin Cowdrey]] famously coming in to bat (for two balls at the non-striker's end) with his broken arm in plaster.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Leslie|title=Beyond the call|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152801.html|publisher=Wisden|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nClose had been dismissed going for runs to win the game, and his courage earned him many plaudits. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} His shirtless torso, black and blue with bruises where he had been hit, made the front pages of the newspapers the next day. [[Len Hutton]] wrote him a congratulatory letter on his innings, and he returned to county cricket the hero. Overall, he made over 300 runs in the series, but was not selected for the next series.\n\nClose also had immediate success as Yorkshire captain, winning the County Championship in 1963. His successes saw him named as one of the five ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]] in 1964, acknowledging his impact on the 1963 season. Close went on to captain Yorkshire to the county championship in 1966, 1967 and 1968.\n\nHe first met his wife Vivien, an air stewardess with [[BOAC]], in [[Bermuda]] whilst touring there with Yorkshire in 1964, when she was engaged to someone else. He pursued her relentlessly, even though initially she considered him not to be her type. Brian gambled with his love life too: on New Year's Day 1965 he told her that if she didn't agree to marry him, he would never see her again. They married the following March. They went on to have one daughter, Lynn, and a son, Lance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===England captaincy===\nAfter the fourth Test of their five-Test series against the West Indies in 1966, England were 3\u20130 down and had lost the series. Needing someone to come in to revitalise the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, \"I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, and we are going to keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match.<ref>{{cite web|title=5th Test: England v West Indies at Kennington Oval, 18\u201322 August 1966|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1966/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T5_18-22AUG1966.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from [[Tom Graveney]] and [[John Murray (cricketer)|John Murray]], and half-centuries from [[Ken Higgs]] and [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]], saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain [[Gary Sobers]], who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122&nbsp;runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch \u2013 or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.\n\nThere was no overseas tour in 1966/67, so the next game Close captained was the first Test at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|title=India in England, 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/IND_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Of the 16 Tests India had previously played in England, England had won 12 and drawn 4, and there were no expectations that there would be anything other than an England victory in the three-match series. But they still needed to be beaten, and England, under Close, won each game convincingly.\n\n[[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] toured England in the second half of the summer of 1967.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pakistan In England, 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/PAK_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> The first match of that three-Test series was a rain-affected draw. The second Test was won comfortably by England by 10 wickets. It seemed certain that Close would be selected to captain England in their 1967/68 tour to the West Indies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThen on 16, 17 and 18 August, Yorkshire, captained by Close, played [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Warwickshire v Yorkshire at Birmingham, 16\u201318 August 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/ENG_LOCAL/CC/WARWICKS_YORKS_CC_16-18AUG1967.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Warwickshire had been set 142 to win in 100 minutes. When the match ended, Warwickshire were 133 for 5, nine runs short of victory, and the match was drawn. However, Yorkshire managed to bowl only 24 overs, with only two being bowled in the last 15 minutes. Whilst it was wet, and Yorkshire had to dry the ball often, this was seen as unacceptable time-wasting and [[gamesmanship]]. Close did not help himself as he personally berated a Warwickshire spectator who he thought had called out something inopportune, though in the event he picked on the wrong man. After the game, Close said to the Warwickshire captain, [[M.J.K. Smith]], \"Bad luck, Mike, you played better than we did. But I couldn't give you the game.\" Smith appeared to accept this when he replied, \"I quite understand.\" {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nBrian Sellers, chairman of Yorkshire and the one who had berated Close in 1949 for saying \"Thank you, Billy\", then made matters worse for Close by sending an apology to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In 1967 England touring sides were still MCC sides rather than \"England\" sides, and the MCC took the opportunity to overrule the selectors who picked Close as captain. Close, whose \"temperament had been shown lacking\",{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} did not go to the West Indies. On the Wednesday before the third and final Test against Pakistan, he was told he had been stripped of the captaincy; the replacement captain was Colin Cowdrey.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe third Test against Pakistan<ref>{{cite web|title=3rd Test: England v Pakistan at Kennington Oval, 24\u201328 August 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/PAK_IN_ENG/PAK_ENG_T3_24-28AUG1967.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> was Close's final Test as captain. He led England to a comprehensive 8-wicket victory, winning the series 2\u20130. His record as captain was played 7, won 6, drawn 1, the best record of any Englishman who captained in more than two Tests.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Last years at Yorkshire===\nIn 1969 Close played only 18 county championship games as he was plagued by a calf injury, although he did lead Yorkshire to victory in the [[one-day cricket|one-day]] [[Gillette Cup (England)|Gillette Cup]] for a second time, the first time being in 1965. A shoulder injury saw Close miss much of the 1970 season, and Yorkshire fell down the championship table, but once Close was fit again, they had an extraordinary run and finished fourth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nClose, however, always opposed one-day cricket, believing that it lessens players' abilities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[Mike Procter]] notes that when [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] played Yorkshire in the John Player 40-over League in 1970, with Yorkshire three wickets down and needing six an [[over (cricket)|over]], word came from Close in the dressing room: \"No chance of winning this one, lads \u2014 just get some batting practice.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nYorkshire had a policy of not offering contracts to its players,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but in return they would tell cricketers by the end of July if they did not require their services the next summer. When July 1970 came and went, Close must have thought he was safe. However, Close offended the [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's changing room to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]] to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, who may not have known who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose wrote a letter to Lister apologising, and gave a copy to a Yorkshire committeeman. But the letter was never presented to the committee as a whole, which voted to sack him as the first agenda item at their next meeting. In November 1970 Close was summoned to see Sellers, and given the choice of either resigning or being sacked. To begin with, he chose to resign. Later that day, and after speaking to his legal adviser, he retracted this, leaving Yorkshire to sack him. The reason, according to Yorkshire, was Close's dislike for the new 40-over one-day cricket league that was first played in 1969 (Close thought it led to bad habits and negative play), and because Close had supposedly not brought on the younger players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Later life and career==\n===Somerset===\nAfter being sacked by Yorkshire, the 39-year-old Close received offers from many other counties, including [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]], [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]], [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. But he turned all these down, preferring to accept a non-captain's role at [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe rest from the captaincy did Close good; he went through the 1971 season without injury, and scored 1,389 runs, including a century in his first game for Somerset,<ref>{{cite web|title=Leicestershire v Somerset at Leicester, 1\u20134 May 1971|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1971/ENG_LOCAL/CC/LEICS_SOMERSET_CC_01-04MAY1971.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> and a century in the game against Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite web|title=Somerset v Yorkshire at Taunton, 19\u201322 June 1971|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1971/ENG_LOCAL/CC/SOMERSET_YORKS_CC_19-22JUN1971.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> In 1972, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] for his services to [[cricket]]. Close was also promoted to Somerset captain. He soon gained the same respect and commitment from his players as he had at Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Hill\" /> He was also called up to the England one-day squad to captain them in a three-match [[One Day International]] series against Australia, which England won 2\u20131, when the regular England captain and his former Yorkshire teammate, [[Ray Illingworth]], injured his ankle in the last Test.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn 1972/73 Close led a two-match tour of the \"International Wanderers\" to [[Rhodesia]]. The next two winters he captained the [[Derrick Robins]]' XI tours to apartheid [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Robins' tours were the closest thing South Africa had to [[Test cricket|Test match]] cricket at that time, and for his efforts in the first of the tours to South Africa, Close was named as one of the four ''South African Cricket Annual'' Cricketers of the Year in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Players/Overall/South_African_Cricket_Annual_Cricketers_of_the_Year.html |title=''South African Cricket Annual'' Cricketers of the Year |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring his time at Somerset [[Viv Richards]] and [[Ian Botham]] joined the county squad, and Close's leadership and discipline helped them become great cricketers. Botham said of Close, \"There was a genuine enthusiasm for cricket which rubbed off on all those playing alongside him. You couldn't help but get excited by the game.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Final Test innings===\nIn 1976, the 45-year-old Brian Close was called up for the first three Tests in England's five-[[West Indian cricket team in England in 1976|Test series against the West Indies]],<ref>{{cite web|title=West Indies in England, 1976|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1976/WI_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> who were no less ferocious than when Close was battered by them in 1963. In the second innings of the third Test at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]],<ref>{{cite web|title=3rd Test: England v West Indies at Manchester, 8\u201313 July 1976|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1976/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T3_08-13JUL1976.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Close's final Test innings, Close opened with the 39-year-old [[John Edrich]]. [[Michael Holding]], [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] and [[Wayne Daniel]], a trio of fast bowlers, pounded them for two and a half hours. It was one of the most brutal displays of fast bowling ever seen. ''Wisden'' said, \"Close and Edrich defended their wickets and themselves against fast bowling, which was frequently too wild and hostile to be acceptable\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Wisden Almanack 1977|publisher=Wisden|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153009.html|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> Close himself said, \"It must have been the worst wicket I experienced in Test cricket. The faster the West Indians bowled the worse it got because the balls broke through the surface of the wicket. They exploded and flew at you.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} With this innings of 20 runs off 108 balls in 162 minutes Close completed his Test career, under a vicious barrage, standing tall and taking the damage as he had against the West Indies at Lord's 13 years earlier.\n\nAfter that, both Close and Edrich were dropped for the fourth Test. The interval between Close's first and last Test matches was 27 years, the second-longest after [[Wilfred Rhodes]]. Only one man, [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwean]] [[John Traicos]], has since played a Test match at a greater age.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===End of first-class career===\n[[File:Azeem rafiq and brian close.jpg|thumb|right|Brian Close presenting an award for Yorkshire in 2008.]]\nBy the time he retired from county cricket at the end of the 1977 season, Close had achieved folk hero status in Somerset. He went on to play for [[Todmorden]] in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]]. Close also had a stint as an England selector between 1979 and 1981 and in 1984 he was elected to the Yorkshire committee. He became chairman of the cricket sub-committee, which led him into more controversy and conflict with the captain, [[Geoffrey Boycott]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9.<ref name=\"Presidents\"/>\n\nAfter his retirement from Somerset, Close continued to play at the Scarborough Festival against the touring international teams, first for T.N. Pearce's XI in 1978 and then for his own XI from 1982 to 1986. In 1986, aged 55, and playing his last-ever first-class innings, Close needed 10 runs to achieve a career-total 35,000 runs. With his score on 4 he glanced a ball down leg-side to the [[wicket-keeper]] and walked. Afterwards, the New Zealanders said that if they'd known how near he was to the landmark, they would have let him stay,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but Close would have none of it \u2013 he was out, and that was that. When asked why he gave himself out he said: \"It's an honourable game and that's the way I was brought up.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Martin|title=Ripe old age|publisher=Cricinfo|date=2 August 2007|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/current/story/304620.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Close's 786 first-class matches leave him 10th on the all-time list. Only four outfielders have taken more catches. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose continued to turn out to help train Yorkshire youngsters, appearing for Yorkshire Colts XI in his seventies, sometimes captaining games and taking the short leg position without a helmet, a position he had taken so many times in the past. According to [[Imran Khan]], Close once stood his ground when fielding at short leg when a batsman played a pull shot, the ball hit him on the forehead, rebounded and was caught at cover. Khan commented: \"We are not all bullet-headed Yorkshiremen, however, and I don't recommend copying Close.\"<ref>Imran Khan's Cricket Skills, Publisher: Golden Books Publishing Company, Inc.

He was picked to play against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] in July 1949, when he was 18&nbsp;years old. Close went on to play 22&nbsp;[[Test cricket|Test matches]] for England, [[captain (cricket)|captaining]] them seven times to six wins and one drawn test. Close also captained [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] to four [[county cricket|county championship]] titles \u2013 the main domestic trophy in English cricket. He later went on to captain [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]], where he is widely credited with developing the county into a hard-playing team, and helping to mould [[Viv Richards]] and [[Ian Botham]] into the successful players they became.\n\nThroughout his cricket career, which lasted from 1948 until the 1977 season, Close was one of the most charismatic and well-known cricketers. He scored almost 35,000&nbsp;[[run (cricket)|runs]] as a [[batsman (cricket)|batsman]], including 52&nbsp;[[century (cricket)|centuries]] with a highest [[innings (cricket)|innings]] score of 198. He also took 1,168&nbsp;[[wickets]] as a [[bowler (cricket)|bowler]], over 800&nbsp;[[caught (cricket)|catches]] as a [[fielding (cricket)|fielder]] and one [[stumping]], as a stand-in [[wicket-keeper]]. At just over six feet (1.83 m) tall he was a noticeable presence on the field, often fielding at the short leg position, close to the batsman. As cricketers did not use head or body protection in Close's day, he would often get hurt when a batsman struck a ball that hit him. Close was also noted, as a batsman, for standing up to intimidatory bowling, letting the ball hit his unprotected torso rather than flinching.\n\nClose was known as a cricketing gambler; he was prepared to take risks and to court controversy throughout his career. He was serving a \"confined to barracks\" punishment during his [[National Service|military service]] when selected for his first international cricket tour to Australia in 1950, was sacked as England captain for timewasting, and later sacked by Yorkshire for his lukewarm attitude to [[one-day cricket]]. He was also accused of not giving enough support to younger Yorkshire cricketers. He attracted further criticism by touring [[apartheid]] [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and white-minority-controlled [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Rhodesia]] with private teams. As chairman of Yorkshire's cricket subcommittee he had many run-ins with the then Yorkshire captain, [[Geoffrey Boycott]]. However, he continued to serve Yorkshire cricket, and in his seventies was coaching and occasionally captaining the county's Colts XI. He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9.<ref name=\"Presidents\">{{cite web|url=https://yorkshireccc.com/history/past-presidents |title=List Of Yorkshire County Cricket Club Presidents|publisher=Yorkshire County Cricket Club|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nClose was born into a [[working class]] family in [[Rawdon, West Yorkshire|Rawdon]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], around {{convert|7|miles}} west of [[Leeds]], on 24 February 1931. His parents were Harry, a weaver, and Esther (''n\u00e9e'' Barrett). He was the second eldest of five boys and a girl. The family lived in a series of small [[council houses]] in Rawdon, [[Guiseley]] and [[Yeadon, West Yorkshire|Yeadon]]. Growing up, Close practised cricket with his father in the houses' back gardens; Harry Close was himself a keen cricketer, who [[wicket-keeper|kept wicket]] and was a big hitter in the [[Bradford Cricket League]], although he never attained the standard of the [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire county team]].{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=12\u201314}} Rawdon had cricketing pedigree: [[Hedley Verity]]\u2014an [[England cricket team|England]] international in the period before the [[Second World War]]\u2014grew up there, and the Verity family continued to live in the village.{{sfn|Waters|2014|pp=16\u201318}} At Rawdon Littlemoor Primary School, Close was taught by Grace Verity, Hedley's sister, and he was friends with two of his children, Wilfred and Douglas.{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=14}}\n\nAt [[Aireborough Grammar School]], Close excelled both academically and athletically. The school went went unbeaten in the six cricketing summers while Close was there,{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=17}} and the school's sport's master arranged for him to receive coaching from [[George Hirst]], a former England international who coached Yorkshire.<ref name=\"coty\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154558.html |title=Cricketer of the Year 1964: Brian Close |work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |year=1964 |via=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref> Close dominated junior level cricket in the area; he joined Rawdon Cricket Club in 1942, when he was eleven years of age, and was almost immediately selected to play for both the under-18 side and the second team.{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=18\u201319}} Close was also proficient at [[association football|football]], and at the age of fourteen, he was signed as an [[amateur sports|amateur]] by [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. A natural inside forward, he became the first Leeds player to feature as a youth international, when in October 1948 he played with [[England national football team|England]] against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie Park]] in [[Aberdeen]].{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=22}}\n\nAfter passing his [[Higher School Certificate (England and Wales)|Higher School Certificate]], Close seriously considered becoming a doctor; his headmaster at Aireborough believed that he could have been accepted into [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] or [[Oxford University|Oxford]] university,{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=15}} but he was not allowed to start university until he had completed two years of [[national service]] with the military. With the enforced break from his studies he chose to try a career as a professional sportsman; he signed a professional contract with Leeds United and having already played for the Yorkshire Colts in second eleven cricket, he joined them for winter coaching. The coaches encouraged Close to switch from bowling [[Seam bowling|seam]] to being an [[off spin]]ner.<ref name=\"coty\"/>\n\n==Yorkshire and England==\n\n===Debut season===\nIn February 1949, Close underwent a medical examination with the [[British Army]], but due to an injury he had suffered playing football his call-up was delayed by a few months, allowing him to continue into pre-season training with Yorkshire.{{sfn|Close|Mosey|1979|p=13}} His performance in pre-season was such that he was given a trial for the county in the two [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford]] Universities. He made his debut on 11 May 1949, alongside [[Fred Trueman]] and [[Frank Lowson]] \u2013 all three went on to play for England.<ref name=\"tough-guy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/20573453/cricket-tough-guy |title=Cricket's Tough Guy |last=Hodgson |first=Derek |date=14 September 2015 |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=25 February 2020}}</ref> Close impressed the Yorkshire hierarchy enough for his trial to be extended into the [[County Championship]] season;<ref name=\"coty\"/> [[Bill Bowes]], one of Yorkshire's coaches, declared that he was the \"natural successor to the veteran [[all-rounder]] [[Frank Smailes]]\".<ref name=\"tough-guy\"/> Close continued to perform well, particularly his bowling; in his fifth first-class game, against [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]], Close took five for 58 in Essex's first innings, then top-scored with an [[Not out|undefeated]] 88 [[Run (cricket)|run]]s in the Yorkshire innings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yorkshire v Essex at Leeds, 25\u201327 May 1949 |website=ESPNcricinfo|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1940S/1949/ENG_LOCAL/CC/YORKS_ESSEX_CC_25-27MAY1949.html|accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref> His performances for Yorkshire earned him a place in the [[North v South]] match, which was also being used as a trial for selection for the upcoming [[Test cricket|Test matches]] against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]].

Ten days later, he was called to see [[Brian Sellers]], a member of the Yorkshire committee, who reprimanded Close for his effrontery in not addressing an amateur player as \"Mister\".{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=7}} Despite this rebuke, the Yorkshire committee secured the assistance of the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Bradford Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford Central]], [[Maurice Webb (politician)|Maurice Webb]], who successfully requested that Close be allowed to complete the 1949 season for Yorkshire, before commencing his National Service.{{sfn|Close|Mosey|1979|p=13}}{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=23}}\n\nClose was then selected to play for England in the third Test match at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] against the [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 1949|touring New Zealanders]]; a decision praised by ''The Times'', who described him as \"a young all-round cricketer of such promise as to demand immediate encouragement.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/CS68897010/TTDA?u=wikipedia&sid=TTDA&xid=418c5806 |title=England's Test Team |work=[[The Times]] |location=London |issue=51436 |page=4 |date=18 July 1949 |via=Gale}}</ref> In the match, Close became, and to date remains, [[English cricket team|England's]] youngest-ever Test player, aged 18 years and 149 days.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/209994.html |title=Test matches: Youngest players |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref> He came in to bat when England needed quick runs, his instruction from [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]], the captain, being to \"have a look at a couple and then give it a go\".{{sfn|Close|Mosey|1979|p=11}} Close duly played two balls back to the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]], then hit out for the [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]], only to be caught in the outfield for a score of nought.

Once he was fit again, he was given weekend passes from the army to play football for Leeds.{{sfn|Close|Mosey|1979|p=15}} During one of these games he was badly injured again: playing against [[Newcastle United F.

Showing the stubbornness that he later became famous for, Close played the rest of the game,{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=23\u201324}} but by the time he reported back for duty the next day, it was badly swollen and painful. He was excused from duties again, but not offered any treatment by the army. After around six weeks, he travelled home on leave and got some heat treatment from the Leeds United physiotherapist, but there was little progress until just before Christmas, when another examination by the army revealed [[ossification]] of the thigh.{{sfn|Close|Mosey|1979|p=16}} Two months of treatment and bed rest followed, which Close thinks saved his career, he said that otherwise: \"the injury would have finished me.

Between playing football and cricket, he had little time for anything else, so much so according to Close, he was never given a job in the army, as he would have no time in which to do it.{{sfn|Hill|2003|pp=24\u201325}} His performances attracted the attention of the England cricket captain, Brown, who wanted Close to be included in the English party to tour [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] for the [[1950\u201351 Ashes series]]. Brown consulted Close's county coach, former England bowler [[Bill Bowes]], who pleaded with Brown not to select Close, arguing that such early promotion would damage him as a player.{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=1}} Brown ignored Bowes and selected Close.\n\nClose's call-up to the Australian touring party attracted considerable press interest, and a press conference was called at Catterick to give the press a chance to question him. However, his moment of glory also gave rise to controversy, when one pressman found out that Close was \"confined to barracks\" for disciplinary reasons at the time his call-up was announced: he had absented himself from an army cricket match.{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=28}} The pressman promised to stay silent, but a week later a clerk on the camp newspaper telephoned the ''Daily Express'' with the news.

He was selected to play in the second Test, which England lost by 28&nbsp;runs. After Australia were dismissed for 194, England had collapsed to 54 for 4 when Close came in to bat, with only eight deliveries to go before the lunch interval on the second day. Misjudging the bounce on the [[Melbourne]] [[wicket#One end of the pitch|wicket]], which was somewhat different from the bounce of English wickets, he swept a ball from [[Jack Iverson]] only to get a top edge to [[Sam Loxton]], fielding behind square leg. [[E. W. Swanton]] called it the worst shot he had seen played by a first-class batsman.<ref>Swanton, E.W. (1975) ''Swanton in Australia with MCC 1946\u20131975''. Fontana/Collins. p. 80. {{ISBN|0002162369}}.</ref> The dressing room was silent when he returned. Brown, when advised that Close was a bit down and needed consolation, replied \"Let the blighter stew. He deserves it.\"{{sfn|Hill|2003|p=38}}\n\nLater in [[Tasmania]], Close was ordered to play despite doctor's advice to rest, and as he tried to nurse his injury he acquired a reputation for malingering and insubordination. He was made to play in six of the next seven games. When England won a Test match in Australia for the first time in 13&nbsp;years in the final Test, Close was not present. Nowadays, someone in Close's position would be carefully man-managed, and looked after by captain and team manager. But times were different then, and the Yorkshire stalwarts were proved right: he had been picked too early, and would never be a regular Test player.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Alan|title=Life of Brian|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/417532.html |website=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=17 February 2011|date=4 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Consolidation, 1951 to 1958===\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Brian Close.jpg|150|thumb|right|Close in action.]] -->\n\nThe years between 1951 and 1958 were a period of career consolidation for Close, who achieved 1,000&nbsp;runs in a season five times.<ref name=\"FC Batting\">{{cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/858/f_Batting_by_Season.html|title=First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Brian Close|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=21 August 2009}}</ref> Immediately after the tour to Australia Close had a good season in 1951, playing for the Combined Services, including a century against the touring [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africans]]. At the end of his National Service in October 1951, he signed for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], and tried briefly to combine playing football with his cricket for Yorkshire. This proved impossible; although Close received permission from Yorkshire captain [[Norman Yardley]] to leave the first match of the 1952 cricket season early, to play football for Arsenal, this leave was rescinded by the match manager. Close arrived late at Arsenal and was sacked.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\nClose enjoyed a good 1952 season at Yorkshire, achieving another double, but played no Test cricket. He played football, for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] this time, and in doing so picked up a serious knee injury which ended his professional footballing career. It also threatened to end his cricket career\u2014Close played only two first-class matches in the 1953 cricket season.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\nIn 1954 Close scored his first first-class century for Yorkshire, an undefeated 123 against the touring [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistanis]]. In 1955 he scored his first county championship century. In that year he played one Test match against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], and at the end of the season was only 3&nbsp;wickets short of another 1,000 runs/100 wickets double. He was in the selectors' sights again, and was picked for the tour to Pakistan in 1955/56. This was not a full England tour, and no Test matches were played. Close returned to the full England side in 1957, playing in the first two Tests against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]], but did not perform well enough to secure a regular Test place.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nMeanwhile, in this period, Yorkshire had not won a single [[County Championship]]. At the beginning of 1958 a new captain, [[Ronnie Burnet]], was appointed. Burnet was 40&nbsp;years old, without first-class cricket experience, and seemed an unlikely choice to restore to Yorkshire's fortunes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} It was believed by the Yorkshire committee that Burnet would inject some discipline into the Yorkshire team, but initially the appointment caused problems. Several senior players left the club; [[Johnny Wardle]], Yorkshire's top bowler and Close's preferred choice of captain, was sacked for disciplinary reasons.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\n===Yorkshire as county champions===\nBurnet, aided by Close, was successful in 1959, when Yorkshire at last won the county championship. At the end of that season, as Close later heard, Burnet was told that, having just won the championship, he could have another season as captain, but, if he did, Close would then take over.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} If Burnet resigned immediately, [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] could take over as captain in preference to Close. Burnet chose to step down straight-away. Once Wilson took over, with Close as the senior professional Yorkshire enjoyed a period of almost unbroken success, winning the county championship again in 1960, taking second place in 1961, and winning again in 1962.\n\n===More controversy===\n\nDuring this period Close was called up for his seventh Test in 1961, against Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=4th Test: England v Australia at Manchester, 27 July-1 August 1961|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1961/AUS_IN_ENG/AUS_ENG_T4_27JUL-01AUG1961.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> This match, which at one point England appeared certain to win, turned to disaster, with Close bearing the main blame for England's defeat.\n\nEngland were chasing a total of 256 runs to win the match, with just under four hours left to play. Scoring rapidly, they reached 150 for 1 wicket. Then [[Ted Dexter]] and [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] got out in quick succession to Benaud, who was pitching his [[leg spin|leg breaks]] into the rough outside the right-handers' leg stump. This brought Close to the crease. May, the captain, was instructing his players to go for the runs and secure the victory. Close accordingly took a calculated risk, and chose to hit out. He took one [[six (cricket)|six]] off Benaud, but to the tenth ball he faced he played another unorthodox shot which [[Norm O'Neill|Norman O'Neill]] caught above his head with two hands. Purists were outraged, and as England collapsed to 201 all out and a 54 run defeat, Close took most of the blame, with some commentators saying that he should never play for England again.<ref name=\"CA Profile\"/>\n\n==Captaincy==\n\n===Yorkshire captaincy===\nAt the end of 1962, Wilson retired, and the Yorkshire committee appointed Close captain. According to Bowes: \"almost overnight it seemed that Brian Close matured\". He wrote, \"Close's field placings were as intelligent and antagonistic as any seen in the county for 25&nbsp;years\".<ref name=\"Hill\" />\n\nClose's attitude, in his own words, was that \"I've always believed that the team is more important than the individual\",{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} and that credo stood Yorkshire in good stead. [[Ray Illingworth]] noted that when he left Yorkshire to play for  [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], the players there were surprised that, while Yorkshire were perennial Championship winners, the [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]]s of their leading batsmen tended to languish in the 20s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The answer was that Close had honed them to play the innings required at the right time: when quick runs were required, players did not play for their averages, they played for quick runs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose was recalled to the England Test squad in 1963, and played his first full series of five matches, against the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=West Indies in England, 1963|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1963/WI_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> His innings in the second Test at [[Lord's]] remains his best known.<ref>{{cite web|title=2nd Test: England v West Indies at Lord's, 20\u201325 June 1963|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1963/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T2_20-25JUN1963.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> When England were pressing for a last-day victory, Close took the battle to the fastest West Indian fast bowlers, [[Wes Hall]] and [[Charlie Griffith]], daring to advance down the wicket to them. This was before body protection and helmets were in use, and time and again the ball struck Close firmly on his body. But he persevered. With no other England player but [[Ken Barrington]] scoring above 20, Close's innings of 70 saved the game for England, and came near to winning it. Set 234 to win, England ended on 228 for 9, with [[Colin Cowdrey]] famously coming in to bat (for two balls at the non-striker's end) with his broken arm in plaster.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Leslie|title=Beyond the call|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152801.html|publisher=Wisden|accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nClose had been dismissed going for runs to win the game, and his courage earned him many plaudits. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} His shirtless torso, black and blue with bruises where he had been hit, made the front pages of the newspapers the next day. [[Len Hutton]] wrote him a congratulatory letter on his innings, and he returned to county cricket the hero. Overall, he made over 300 runs in the series, but was not selected for the next series.\n\nClose also had immediate success as Yorkshire captain, winning the County Championship in 1963. His successes saw him named as one of the five ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]] in 1964, acknowledging his impact on the 1963 season. Close went on to captain Yorkshire to the county championship in 1966, 1967 and 1968.\n\nHe first met his wife Vivien, an air stewardess with [[BOAC]], in [[Bermuda]] whilst touring there with Yorkshire in 1964, when she was engaged to someone else. He pursued her relentlessly, even though initially she considered him not to be her type. Brian gambled with his love life too: on New Year's Day 1965 he told her that if she didn't agree to marry him, he would never see her again. They married the following March. They went on to have one daughter, Lynn, and a son, Lance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===England captaincy===\nAfter the fourth Test of their five-Test series against the West Indies in 1966, England were 3\u20130 down and had lost the series. Needing someone to come in to revitalise the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, \"I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, and we are going to keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match.<ref>{{cite web|title=5th Test: England v West Indies at Kennington Oval, 18\u201322 August 1966|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1966/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T5_18-22AUG1966.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from [[Tom Graveney]] and [[John Murray (cricketer)|John Murray]], and half-centuries from [[Ken Higgs]] and [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]], saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain [[Gary Sobers]], who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122&nbsp;runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch \u2013 or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.\n\nThere was no overseas tour in 1966/67, so the next game Close captained was the first Test at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] against [[India national cricket team|India]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|title=India in England, 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/IND_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Of the 16 Tests India had previously played in England, England had won 12 and drawn 4, and there were no expectations that there would be anything other than an England victory in the three-match series. But they still needed to be beaten, and England, under Close, won each game convincingly.\n\n[[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] toured England in the second half of the summer of 1967.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pakistan In England, 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/PAK_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> The first match of that three-Test series was a rain-affected draw. The second Test was won comfortably by England by 10 wickets. It seemed certain that Close would be selected to captain England in their 1967/68 tour to the West Indies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThen on 16, 17 and 18 August, Yorkshire, captained by Close, played [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Warwickshire v Yorkshire at Birmingham, 16\u201318 August 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/ENG_LOCAL/CC/WARWICKS_YORKS_CC_16-18AUG1967.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Warwickshire had been set 142 to win in 100 minutes. When the match ended, Warwickshire were 133 for 5, nine runs short of victory, and the match was drawn. However, Yorkshire managed to bowl only 24 overs, with only two being bowled in the last 15 minutes. Whilst it was wet, and Yorkshire had to dry the ball often, this was seen as unacceptable time-wasting and [[gamesmanship]]. Close did not help himself as he personally berated a Warwickshire spectator who he thought had called out something inopportune, though in the event he picked on the wrong man. After the game, Close said to the Warwickshire captain, [[M.J.K. Smith]], \"Bad luck, Mike, you played better than we did. But I couldn't give you the game.\" Smith appeared to accept this when he replied, \"I quite understand.\" {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nBrian Sellers, chairman of Yorkshire and the one who had berated Close in 1949 for saying \"Thank you, Billy\", then made matters worse for Close by sending an apology to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In 1967 England touring sides were still MCC sides rather than \"England\" sides, and the MCC took the opportunity to overrule the selectors who picked Close as captain. Close, whose \"temperament had been shown lacking\",{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} did not go to the West Indies. On the Wednesday before the third and final Test against Pakistan, he was told he had been stripped of the captaincy; the replacement captain was Colin Cowdrey.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe third Test against Pakistan<ref>{{cite web|title=3rd Test: England v Pakistan at Kennington Oval, 24\u201328 August 1967|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1967/PAK_IN_ENG/PAK_ENG_T3_24-28AUG1967.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> was Close's final Test as captain. He led England to a comprehensive 8-wicket victory, winning the series 2\u20130. His record as captain was played 7, won 6, drawn 1, the best record of any Englishman who captained in more than two Tests.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Last years at Yorkshire===\nIn 1969 Close played only 18 county championship games as he was plagued by a calf injury, although he did lead Yorkshire to victory in the [[one-day cricket|one-day]] [[Gillette Cup (England)|Gillette Cup]] for a second time, the first time being in 1965. A shoulder injury saw Close miss much of the 1970 season, and Yorkshire fell down the championship table, but once Close was fit again, they had an extraordinary run and finished fourth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nClose, however, always opposed one-day cricket, believing that it lessens players' abilities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} [[Mike Procter]] notes that when [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] played Yorkshire in the John Player 40-over League in 1970, with Yorkshire three wickets down and needing six an [[over (cricket)|over]], word came from Close in the dressing room: \"No chance of winning this one, lads \u2014 just get some batting practice.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nYorkshire had a policy of not offering contracts to its players,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but in return they would tell cricketers by the end of July if they did not require their services the next summer. When July 1970 came and went, Close must have thought he was safe. However, Close offended the [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's changing room to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]] to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, who may not have known who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose wrote a letter to Lister apologising, and gave a copy to a Yorkshire committeeman. But the letter was never presented to the committee as a whole, which voted to sack him as the first agenda item at their next meeting. In November 1970 Close was summoned to see Sellers, and given the choice of either resigning or being sacked. To begin with, he chose to resign. Later that day, and after speaking to his legal adviser, he retracted this, leaving Yorkshire to sack him. The reason, according to Yorkshire, was Close's dislike for the new 40-over one-day cricket league that was first played in 1969 (Close thought it led to bad habits and negative play), and because Close had supposedly not brought on the younger players.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n==Later life and career==\n===Somerset===\nAfter being sacked by Yorkshire, the 39-year-old Close received offers from many other counties, including [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]], [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]], [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] and [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. But he turned all these down, preferring to accept a non-captain's role at [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe rest from the captaincy did Close good; he went through the 1971 season without injury, and scored 1,389 runs, including a century in his first game for Somerset,<ref>{{cite web|title=Leicestershire v Somerset at Leicester, 1\u20134 May 1971|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1971/ENG_LOCAL/CC/LEICS_SOMERSET_CC_01-04MAY1971.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> and a century in the game against Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite web|title=Somerset v Yorkshire at Taunton, 19\u201322 June 1971|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1971/ENG_LOCAL/CC/SOMERSET_YORKS_CC_19-22JUN1971.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> In 1972, he was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] for his services to [[cricket]]. Close was also promoted to Somerset captain. He soon gained the same respect and commitment from his players as he had at Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Hill\" /> He was also called up to the England one-day squad to captain them in a three-match [[One Day International]] series against Australia, which England won 2\u20131, when the regular England captain and his former Yorkshire teammate, [[Ray Illingworth]], injured his ankle in the last Test.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nIn 1972/73 Close led a two-match tour of the \"International Wanderers\" to [[Rhodesia]]. The next two winters he captained the [[Derrick Robins]]' XI tours to apartheid [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Robins' tours were the closest thing South Africa had to [[Test cricket|Test match]] cricket at that time, and for his efforts in the first of the tours to South Africa, Close was named as one of the four ''South African Cricket Annual'' Cricketers of the Year in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url-access=subscription  |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Players/Overall/South_African_Cricket_Annual_Cricketers_of_the_Year.html |title=''South African Cricket Annual'' Cricketers of the Year |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring his time at Somerset [[Viv Richards]] and [[Ian Botham]] joined the county squad, and Close's leadership and discipline helped them become great cricketers. Botham said of Close, \"There was a genuine enthusiasm for cricket which rubbed off on all those playing alongside him. You couldn't help but get excited by the game.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Final Test innings===\nIn 1976, the 45-year-old Brian Close was called up for the first three Tests in England's five-[[West Indian cricket team in England in 1976|Test series against the West Indies]],<ref>{{cite web|title=West Indies in England, 1976|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1976/WI_IN_ENG/|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> who were no less ferocious than when Close was battered by them in 1963. In the second innings of the third Test at [[Old Trafford (cricket)|Old Trafford]],<ref>{{cite web|title=3rd Test: England v West Indies at Manchester, 8\u201313 July 1976|publisher=Cricinfo|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1976/WI_IN_ENG/WI_ENG_T3_08-13JUL1976.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Close's final Test innings, Close opened with the 39-year-old [[John Edrich]]. [[Michael Holding]], [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] and [[Wayne Daniel]], a trio of fast bowlers, pounded them for two and a half hours. It was one of the most brutal displays of fast bowling ever seen. ''Wisden'' said, \"Close and Edrich defended their wickets and themselves against fast bowling, which was frequently too wild and hostile to be acceptable\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Wisden Almanack 1977|publisher=Wisden|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153009.html|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> Close himself said, \"It must have been the worst wicket I experienced in Test cricket. The faster the West Indians bowled the worse it got because the balls broke through the surface of the wicket. They exploded and flew at you.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} With this innings of 20 runs off 108 balls in 162 minutes Close completed his Test career, under a vicious barrage, standing tall and taking the damage as he had against the West Indies at Lord's 13 years earlier.\n\nAfter that, both Close and Edrich were dropped for the fourth Test. The interval between Close's first and last Test matches was 27 years, the second-longest after [[Wilfred Rhodes]]. Only one man, [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwean]] [[John Traicos]], has since played a Test match at a greater age.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===End of first-class career===\n[[File:Azeem rafiq and brian close.jpg|thumb|right|Brian Close presenting an award for Yorkshire in 2008.]]\nBy the time he retired from county cricket at the end of the 1977 season, Close had achieved folk hero status in Somerset. He went on to play for [[Todmorden]] in the [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]]. Close also had a stint as an England selector between 1979 and 1981 and in 1984 he was elected to the Yorkshire committee. He became chairman of the cricket sub-committee, which led him into more controversy and conflict with the captain, [[Geoffrey Boycott]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9.<ref name=\"Presidents\"/>\n\nAfter his retirement from Somerset, Close continued to play at the Scarborough Festival against the touring international teams, first for T.N. Pearce's XI in 1978 and then for his own XI from 1982 to 1986. In 1986, aged 55, and playing his last-ever first-class innings, Close needed 10 runs to achieve a career-total 35,000 runs. With his score on 4 he glanced a ball down leg-side to the [[wicket-keeper]] and walked. Afterwards, the New Zealanders said that if they'd known how near he was to the landmark, they would have let him stay,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} but Close would have none of it \u2013 he was out, and that was that. When asked why he gave himself out he said: \"It's an honourable game and that's the way I was brought up.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Martin|title=Ripe old age|publisher=Cricinfo|date=2 August 2007|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/current/story/304620.html|accessdate=28 May 2008}}</ref> Close's 786 first-class matches leave him 10th on the all-time list. Only four outfielders have taken more catches. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nClose continued to turn out to help train Yorkshire youngsters, appearing for Yorkshire Colts XI in his seventies, sometimes captaining games and taking the short leg position without a helmet, a position he had taken so many times in the past.
