Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 February 1853 aged 96. Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871.{{r|LCC:Death}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of [[Tenterground]] at [[Spitalfields]], [[London]]. Furthermore, Cooke's father, Francis, is recorded in the 1762 [[English Land Tax|Land Tax Assessment]] Book for the Parish of Saint Mary, Whitechapel, as residing between [[Alie Street]] and [[Leman Street|Leman Street (West side)]], close to the corner of North and East Tenter Streets.{{r|\"Land Tax\"}}{{r|Location of Tenterground}}.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 February 1853 aged 96. Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871.{{r|LCC:Death}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of [[Tenterground]] at [[Spitalfields]], [[London]]. Furthermore, Cooke's father, Francis, is recorded in the 1762 [[English Land Tax|Land Tax Assessment]] Book for the Parish of Saint Mary, Whitechapel, as residing between [[Alie Street]] and [[Leman Street|Leman Street (West side)]], close to the corner of North and East Tenter Streets.{{r|\"Land Tax\"}}{{r|Location of Tenterground}}.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|last=Christe|first=Christopher R.

Roadrunner released a reissue of Focus in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording \"''The Portal Tapes\"'' demos. Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]], where he also began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. \n\n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|last=Christe|first=Christopher R.
