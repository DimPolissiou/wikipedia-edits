His music includes many genres of [[jazz]] combined with elements of rock, [[Indian classical music]], [[Classical music|Western classical music]], [[flamenco]], and [[blues]]. He is a pioneer of [[jazz fusion]].\n\nAfter contributing to several key British groups of the early 1960s, McLaughlin made ''[[Extrapolation (album)|Extrapolation]]'', his first album as a bandleader, in 1969. He then moved to the U.S., where he played with [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]]'s group [[The Tony Williams Lifetime|Lifetime]] and then with [[Miles Davis]] on his electric jazz-fusion albums ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', ''[[Jack Johnson (album)|Jack Johnson]]'', and ''[[On the Corner]]''. His 1970s electric band, the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], performed a technically virtuosic and complex style of music that fused electric jazz and rock with Indian influences.\n\nMcLaughlin's solo on \"Miles Beyond\" from his album ''Live at Ronnie Scott's'' won the 2018 [[Grammy Award]] for the [[Grammy Award for Best Improvised Jazz Solo|Best Improvised Jazz Solo]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 GRAMMY Awards: Complete Winners List|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2018-grammy-awards-complete-winners-list|publisher=Grammy.com|date=29 January 2018|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> He has been awarded multiple \"Guitarist of the Year\" and \"Best Jazz Guitarist\" awards from magazines such as ''[[DownBeat]]'' and ''[[Guitar Player]]'' based on reader polls.

McLaughlin studied violin and piano as a child and took up the guitar at the age of 11, exploring styles from flamenco to the jazz of [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[St\u00e9phane Grappelli]]. He moved to London from Yorkshire in the early 1960s, playing with [[Alexis Korner]]<ref>[http://www.jazzreview.com/articledetails.cfm?ID=159 Jazzreview.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620190307/http://www.jazzreview.com/articledetails.cfm?ID=159 |date=20 June 2009 }}</ref> and the Marzipan Twisters before moving on to [[Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames]], [[the Graham Bond Organisation]] (in 1963)<ref>Mo Foster, '17 Watts?

Also, he gave guitar lessons to [[Jimmy Page]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hit-channel.com/john-mclaughlin-solomahavishnu-orchestramiles-davis/18283|title=Interview:John McLaughlin (solo, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Miles Davis)|work=Hit Channel|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> In 1963, [[Jack Bruce]] formed the Graham Bond Quartet with Bond, [[Ginger Baker]] and John McLaughlin. They played an eclectic range of music genres, including bebop, blues and rhythm and blues.\n\nIn January 1969, McLaughlin recorded his debut album ''[[Extrapolation (album)|Extrapolation]]'' in London.  It prominently features [[John Surman]] on saxophone and [[Tony Oxley]] on drums.  McLaughlin composed the number '''Binky's Beam''' as a tribute to his friend, the innovative bass player [[Binky McKenzie]]. The album's [[post-bop]] style is quite different than McLaughlin's later fusion works, though it gradually developed a strong reputation among critics by the mid-1970s.\n\nMcLaughlin moved to the U.S. in 1969 to join [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]]' group [[The Tony Williams Lifetime|Lifetime]]. A recording from the [[Record Plant]], NYC, dated 25 March 1969, exists of McLaughlin jamming with [[Jimi Hendrix]]. McLaughlin recollects \"we played one night, just a jam session. And we played from 2 until 8, in the morning. I thought it was a wonderful experience! I was playing an acoustic guitar with a pick-up. Um, flat-top guitar, and Jimi was playing an electric. Yeah, what a lovely time! Had he lived today, you'd find that he would be employing everything he could get his hands on, and I mean acoustic guitar, synthesizers, orchestras, voices, anything he could get his hands on he'd use!\"\n\nHe played on Miles Davis' albums ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (which has a track named after him), ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'', ''[[On the Corner]]'', ''[[Big Fun (Miles Davis album)|Big Fun]]'' (where he is featured soloist on \"Go Ahead John\") and ''[[Jack Johnson (album)|A Tribute to Jack Johnson]]''. In the liner notes to ''Jack Johnson'', Davis called McLaughlin's playing \"far in\". McLaughlin returned to the Davis band for one night of a week-long club date, recorded and released as part of the album ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'' and of the ''[[The Cellar Door Sessions|Cellar Door]]'' boxed set. His reputation as a \"first-call\" [[Session musician|session player]] grew, resulting in recordings as a sideman with [[Miroslav Vitous]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[Joe Farrell]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Carla Bley]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and others.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:JohnMcLaughlin.jpg|thumb|left|180px|John McLaughlin, Cirkus Krone-Bau, Munich, West Germany, 9 June 1973]]\nHe recorded ''[[Devotion (John McLaughlin album)|Devotion]]'' in early 1970 on Douglas Records (run by [[Alan Douglas (record producer)|Alan Douglas]]), a high-energy, psychedelic fusion album that featured [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]] on organ (who had been part of Lifetime), [[Billy Rich]] on bass and the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] drummer [[Buddy Miles]]. ''Devotion'' was the first of two albums he released on Douglas. In 1971 he released ''[[My Goal's Beyond]]'' in the US, a collection of unamplified acoustic works. Side A (\"Peace One\" and \"Peace Two\") offers a fusion blend of jazz and Indian classical forms, while side B features melodic acoustic playing McLaughlin on such standards as \"[[Goodbye Pork Pie Hat]]\", by [[Charles Mingus]] whom McLaughlin considered an important influence. ''My Goal's Beyond'' was inspired by McLaughlin's decision to follow the Indian spiritual leader [[Sri Chinmoy]], to whom he had been introduced in 1970 by Larry Coryell's manager. The album was dedicated to Chinmoy, with one of the [[Guru]]'s poems printed on the [[liner notes]]. It was on this album that McLaughlin [[Name change#Name change on religious conversion|took the name]] \"Mahavishnu\".\n\nIn 1973 McLaughlin collaborated with [[Carlos Santana]], also a disciple of [[Sri Chinmoy]] at the time, on an album of devotional songs, ''[[Love Devotion Surrender]]'', which featured recordings of [[John Coltrane|Coltrane]] compositions including a movement of ''[[A Love Supreme]]''. McLaughlin has also worked with the jazz composers [[Carla Bley]] and [[Gil Evans]].\n\n[[File:John McLaughlin in 1978.jpg|thumb|180px|right|McLaughlin performing in The Netherlands, 1978]]\nIn 1979 he formed a short-lived funk fusion [[power trio]] named [[Trio of Doom]] with drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] and bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]]. Their only live performance was on 3 March 1979 at the [[Havana Jam]] Festival (2\u20134 March 1979) in [[Cuba]], part of a US State Department sponsored visit to Cuba. Later on 8 March 1979 the group recorded the songs they had written for the festival at Columbia Studios, New York, on 52nd Street. Recollections from this performance are captured on [[Ernesto Juan Castellanos]]'s documentary ''[[Havana Jam '79]]'' and cd [[Trio of Doom]].\n\n====The Mahavishnu Orchestra====\n{{Main|Mahavishnu Orchestra}}\nMcLaughlin's 1970s electric band, the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=22802 |title=Power, Passion and Beauty, The Story of the Legendary Mahavishnu-Orchestra |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> included violinist [[Jerry Goodman]], keyboardist [[Jan Hammer]], bassist [[Rick Laird]], and drummer [[Billy Cobham]]. They performed a technically difficult and complex style of music that fused electric jazz and rock with Eastern and Indian influences. This band helped establish fusion as a new and growing style. McLaughlin's playing at this time was distinguished by fast solos and non-western [[musical scales]].\n\nThe Mahavishnu Orchestra's personality clashes were as explosive as their performances, and consequently the first incarnation of the group split in late 1973 after two years and three albums, including a live recording entitled ''[[Between Nothingness & Eternity]]''. In 2001 the ''[[The Lost Trident Sessions|Lost Trident Sessions]]'' album was released; recorded in 1973 but shelved when the group disbanded. McLaughlin then reformed the group with [[Narada Michael Walden]] (drums), [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] (violin), Ralphe Armstrong (bass), and [[Gayle Moran]] (keyboards and vocals), and a string and horn section (McLaughlin referred to this as \"the real Mahavishnu Orchestra\"). This incarnation of the group recorded two more albums, ''[[Apocalypse (Mahavishnu Orchestra album)|Apocalypse]]'' with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and ''[[Visions of the Emerald Beyond]]''. A scaled-down quartet was formed with McLaughlin, Walden on drums, Armstrong on bass and [[Stu Goldberg]] on keyboards and synthesiser, which generated a third \"Mahavishnu 2\" recording in 1976 largely due to contractual obligations, ''[[Inner Worlds]]''.\n\n====Shakti====\nMcLaughlin then became absorbed in his acoustic playing with his [[Indian classical music]] based group [[Shakti (band)|Shakti]] (energy). McLaughlin had already been studying Indian classical music and playing the [[veena]] for several years. The group featured Lakshminarayanan [[L. Shankar]] (violin), [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]] ([[tabla]]), [[Thetakudi Harihara Vinayakram]] ([[ghatam]]) and earlier [[Ramnad Raghavan]] ([[mridangam]]). The group recorded three albums: ''[[Shakti (Shakti album)|Shakti with John McLaughlin]]'' (1975)\n''[[A Handful of Beauty]]'' (1976), and ''[[Natural Elements (Shakti album)|Natural Elements]]'' (1977). Based on both [[carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] styles, along with extended use of [[konnakol]], the band introduced ragas and Indian percussion to many jazz aficionados.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chembur.com/anecdotes/carnatic/lshankar/ |title=Chembur.com |publisher=Chembur.com |accessdate=18 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928044436/http://www.chembur.com/anecdotes/carnatic/lshankar/ |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn this group McLaughlin played a custom-made steel-string J-200 acoustic guitar made by [[Abraham Wechter|Abe Wechter]] and the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson guitar company]] that featured two tiers of strings over the soundhole: a conventional six-string configuration and seven strings strung underneath at a 45-degree angle \u2013 these were independently tuneable \"[[sympathetic strings]]\" much like those on a [[sitar]] or [[veena]]. The instrument's vina-like scalloped fretboard enabled McLaughlin to bend strings far beyond the reach of a conventional fretboard. McLaughlin grew so accustomed to the freedom it provided him that he had the fretboard scalloped on his [[Gibson Byrdland]] electric guitar.\n\n====Other activities====\n[[File:John McLaughlin 20010720.JPG|thumb|John McLaughlin, [[Remember Shakti]] Concert, Munich/Germany (2001)]]\nMcLaughlin also appeared on [[Stanley Clarke]]'s ''[[School Days (album)|School Days]]'' and numerous other fusion albums. They later recorded three tracks at [[CBS]] Studios in New York, 8 March 1979. The same year he teamed up with [[flamenco]] guitarist [[Paco de Luc\u00eda]] and jazz guitarist [[Larry Coryell]] (replaced by [[Al Di Meola]] in the early 1980s) as the Guitar Trio. For the tour of fall 1983 they were joined by [[Dixie Dregs]] guitarist [[Steve Morse]] who opened the show as a soloist and participated with The Trio in the closing numbers. The Trio reunited in 1996 for a second recording session and a world tour. Also in 1979 McLaughlin recorded the album ''[[Electric Guitarist|Johnny McLaughlin: Electric Guitarist]]'', the title on McLaughlin's first business cards as a teenager in [[Yorkshire]]. This was a return to more mainstream jazz/rock fusion and to the electric instrument after three years of playing acoustic guitars.\n[[File:Tres GUITARRISTAS (as\u00ed, con may\u00fasculas).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Left to right: [[Al Di Meola]], John McLaughlin and [[Paco de Luc\u00eda]] performing in [[Barcelona]], Spain in the 1980s]]\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:John McLaughlin 1980.jpg|thumb|left|John McLaughlin at Berkeley Jazz Festival  5/25/1980]]\nThe short-lived One Truth Band recorded one studio album, ''[[Electric Dreams (John McLaughlin album)|Electric Dreams]]'', with L. Shankar on violins, Stu Goldberg on keyboards, [[Fernando Saunders]] on electric bass and [[Tony Thunder Smith|Tony Smith]] on drums. After the dissolution of the One Truth Band, McLaughlin toured in a guitar duo with [[Christian Escoud\u00e9]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=6573|title=Christian Escoude \u2013 Jazz \u2013 Guitar|magazine=All About Jazz|accessdate=18 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205135843/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=6573|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWith the group [[Fuse One]], he released two albums in 1980 and 1982.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p10614/discography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Discography]</ref>\n\nIn 1981 and 1982, McLaughlin recorded two albums, ''[[Belo Horizonte (album)|Belo Horizonte]]'' and ''[[Music Spoken Here]]'' with The Translators, a band of French and American musicians who combined acoustic guitar, bass, drums, saxophone, and violin with synthesizers. The Translators included McLaughlin's future wife, classical keyboardist, [[Katia Lab\u00e8que]].\n\nFrom 1984 through to (circa) 1987, an electric five-piece operated under the name \"Mahavishnu\" (omitting the \"Orchestra\"). Two LPs were released, ''[[Mahavishnu (album)|Mahavishnu]]'' and ''[[Adventures in Radioland]]''. The former featured McLaughlin making extensive use of the [[Synclavier]] synthesizer, allied with a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Guitar synthesizer|guitar/controller]]. The first of the two albums was recorded with a line-up of McLaughlin, [[Bill Evans (saxophonist)|Bill Evans]] (saxophones), [[Jonas Hellborg]] (bass), [[Mitchel Forman]] (keyboards) and both [[Danny Gottlieb]] and Billy Cobham on drums. Initial advertising for concert dates in support of the album included Cobham's name, but by the time the tour started in earnest, Gottlieb was in the band. Forman left at some point between the albums, and was replaced on keyboards by [[Jim Beard]].\n\nIn tandem with Mahavishnu, McLaughlin worked in duo format (c. 1985\u201387) with bassist Jonas Hellborg, playing a number of concert dates, some of which were broadcast on radio and TV, but no commercial recordings were made.\n\nIn 1986 he appeared with [[Dexter Gordon]] in [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''.  He also composed The Mediterranean Concerto, orchestrated by [[Michael Gibbs (composer)|Michael Gibbs]]. The world premier featured McLaughlin and the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]].  It was recorded in 1988 with [[Michael Tilson Thomas]] conducting the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. Unlike what is typical practice in classical music, the concerto includes sections where McLaughlin [[Improvisation (music)|improvises]]. Also included on the recording were five duets between McLaughlin and his then-girlfriend Katia Lab\u00e8que.\n\nIn the late '80s McLaughlin began performing live and recording with a trio including percussionist [[Trilok Gurtu]], and three bassists at various times; firstly [[Jeff Berlin]], then [[Kai Eckhardt]] and finally [[Dominique Di Piazza]]. Berlin contributed to the trio's live work only in 1988/89, and didn't record with McLaughlin. The group recorded two albums: ''[[Live at the Royal Festival Hall (John McLaughlin Trio album)|Live at The Royal Festival Hall]]'' and ''[[Que Alegria]]'', the former with Eckhardt, and the latter with di Piazza for all but two tracks. These recordings saw a return to acoustic instruments for McLaughlin, performing on nylon-string guitar. On ''Live at the Royal Festival Hall'' McLaughlin used a unique guitar synth that enabled him to effectively [[tape loop|\"loop\"]] guitar parts and play over them live. The synth also featured a pedal that provided sustain. McLaughlin overdubbed parts to create lush soundscapes, aided by Gurtu's unique percussive sounds. He used this approach to great effect in the track ''Florianapolis'', among others.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the early 1990s he toured with his trio on the ''[[Que Alegria|Qu\u00e9 Alegr\u00eda]]'' album. By this time, Eckhardt had left, with McLaughlin and Gurtu joined by bass player Dominique Di Piazza. In the latter stages of this trio's life, they were joined on tour by Katia Lab\u00e8que alone, or by Katia and her sister Marielle, with footage of the latter configuration forming part of a documentary on the [[Katia and Marielle Lab\u00e8que|Lab\u00e8que Sisters]].  Following this period he recorded and toured with The Heart of Things featuring [[Gary Thomas (musician)|Gary Thomas]], [[Dennis Chambers]], [[Matt Garrison]], Jim Beard and [[Otmaro Ru\u00edz]]. In 1993 he released a [[Bill Evans]] tribute album entitled ''[[Time Remembered: John McLaughlin Plays Bill Evans]]'', with McLaughlin's acoustic guitar backed by the acoustic guitars of the Aighetta Quartet and the acoustic bass of Yan Maresz. In recent times McLaughlin has toured with [[Remember Shakti]].\n\nIn addition to original Shakti member [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]], this group has also featured eminent Indian musicians [[U. Srinivas]], [[V. Selvaganesh]], [[Shankar Mahadevan]], [[Shivkumar Sharma]], and [[Hariprasad Chaurasia]]. In 1996, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucia and Al Di Meola (known collectively as \"The Guitar Trio\") reunited for a world tour and recorded an album of the same name. They had previously released a studio album entitled ''[[Passion, Grace and Fire|Passion, Grace & Fire]]'' back in 1983. Meanwhile, in the same year of 1996 McLaughlin recorded ''[[The Promise (John McLaughlin album)|The Promise]]''. Also notable during the period were his performances with [[Elvin Jones]] and [[Joey DeFrancesco]].\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003 he recorded a ballet score, ''[[Thieves and Poets]]'', along with arrangements for classical guitar ensemble of favourite jazz standards and a three-DVD instructional video on improvisation entitled \"This is the Way I Do It\" (which contributed to the development of video lessons.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=All About Jazz |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=14486 |title=Walter Kolosky |magazine=All About Jazz |date=17 August 2004 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>) In June 2006 he released the [[post-bop]]/[[jazz fusion]] album ''[[Industrial Zen]]'', on which he experimented with the [[Godin (Guitar Manufacturer)|Godin]] Glissentar as well as continuing to expand his guitar-synth repertoire.\n\nIn 2007 he left [[Universal Records]] and joined Abstract Logix. Recording sessions for his first album on that label took place in April. That summer, he began touring with a new jazz fusion quartet, the 4th Dimension, consisting of keyboardist/drummer [[Gary Husband]], bassist Hadrian Feraud, and drummer [[Mark Mondesir]]. During the 4th Dimension's tour, an \"instant CD\" entitled ''Live USA 2007: Official Bootleg'' was made available comprising [[soundboard recording]]s of six pieces from the group's first performance. Following completion of the tour, McLaughlin sorted through recordings from each night to release a second MP3 download-only collection entitled, ''Official Pirate: Best of the American Tour 2007''. During this time, McLaughlin also released another instructional DVD, ''The Gateway to Rhythm'', featuring Indian percussionist and Remember Shakti bandmate Selva Ganesh Vinayakram (or V. Selvaganesh), focusing on the Indian rhythmic system of [[konnakol]]. McLaughlin also remastered and released the shelved 1979 Trio of Doom project with Jaco Pastorius and Tony Williams. The project had been aborted due to conflicts between Williams and Pastorius as well as what was at the time a mutual dissatisfaction with the results of their performance.\n\nOn 28 July 2007, McLaughlin performed at [[Eric Clapton]]'s [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]] in [[Bridgeview, Illinois]].\n[[File:JohnMcLaughinCrossroads2007.jpg|thumb|140px|right|McLaughlin, 2007 [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]]]]\n\nOn 28 April 2008 the recording sessions from the previous year surfaced on the album ''[[Floating Point]]'', featuring the rhythm section of keyboardist [[Louis Banks]], bassist [[Hadrien Feraud]], percussionist Sivamani and drummer [[Ranjit Barot]] bolstered on each track by a different Indian musician.  Coinciding with the release of the album was another DVD, ''Meeting of the Minds'', which offered behind the scenes studio footage of the ''Floating Point'' sessions as well as interviews with all of the musicians. He engaged in a late summer/fall 2008 tour with [[Chick Corea]], [[Vinnie Colaiuta]], [[Kenny Garrett]] and [[Christian McBride]] under the name [[Five Peace Band]], from which came an eponymous double-CD live album in early 2009.\n\nMcLaughlin performed with Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer Billy Cobham at the 44th [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], in Montreux, [[Switzerland]], on 2 July 2010, for the first time since the band split up. In November 2010, a new book was released by Abstract Logix Books entitled ''Follow Your Heart- John McLaughlin Song by Song'' by Walter Kolosky, who also wrote the book ''Power, Passion and Beauty \u2013 The Story of the Legendary Mahavishnu Orchestra''. The book discussed each song McLaughlin wrote and contained photographs never seen before.\n\n==Style==\nJohn McLaughlin is a leading guitarist in jazz and jazz fusion.

In an interview with ''Downbeat'', [[Chick Corea]] remarked that \"what John McLaughlin did with the electric guitar set the world on its ear. No one ever heard an electric guitar played like that before, and it certainly inspired me. John's band, more than my experience with Miles, led me to want to turn the volume up and write music that was more dramatic and made your hair stand on end.\"{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe musician and comedian [[Darryl Rhoades]] also paid tribute to McLaughlin's influence.

His music includes many genres of [[jazz]] combined with elements of rock, [[Indian classical music]], [[Classical music|Western classical music]], [[flamenco]], and [[blues]]. He is a pioneer of [[jazz fusion]].\n\nAfter contributing to several key British groups of the early 1960s, McLaughlin made ''[[Extrapolation (album)|Extrapolation]]'', his first album as a bandleader, in 1969. He then moved to the U.S., where he played with [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]]'s group [[The Tony Williams Lifetime|Lifetime]] and then with [[Miles Davis]] on his electric jazz-fusion albums ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', ''[[Jack Johnson (album)|Jack Johnson]]'', and ''[[On the Corner]]''. His 1970s electric band, the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], performed a technically virtuosic and complex style of music that fused electric jazz and rock with Indian influences.\n\nMcLaughlin's solo on \"Miles Beyond\" from his album ''Live at Ronnie Scott's'' won the 2018 [[Grammy Award]] for the [[Grammy Award for Best Improvised Jazz Solo|Best Improvised Jazz Solo]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 GRAMMY Awards: Complete Winners List|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2018-grammy-awards-complete-winners-list|publisher=Grammy.com|date=29 January 2018|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> He has been awarded multiple \"Guitarist of the Year\" and \"Best Jazz Guitarist\" awards from magazines such as ''[[DownBeat]]'' and ''[[Guitar Player]]'' based on reader polls.

Also, he gave guitar lessons to [[Jimmy Page]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hit-channel.com/john-mclaughlin-solomahavishnu-orchestramiles-davis/18283|title=Interview:John McLaughlin (solo, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Miles Davis)|work=Hit Channel|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> In 1963, [[Jack Bruce]] formed the Graham Bond Quartet with Bond, [[Ginger Baker]] and John McLaughlin. They played an eclectic range of music genres, including bebop, blues and rhythm and blues.\n\nIn January 1969, McLaughlin recorded his debut album ''[[Extrapolation (album)|Extrapolation]]'' in London.  It prominently features [[John Surman]] on saxophone and [[Tony Oxley]] on drums.  McLaughlin composed the number '''Binky's Beam''' as a tribute to his friend, the innovative bass player [[Binky McKenzie]]. The album's [[post-bop]] style is quite different than McLaughlin's later fusion works, though it gradually developed a strong reputation among critics by the mid-1970s.\n\nMcLaughlin moved to the U.S. in 1969 to join [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]]' group [[The Tony Williams Lifetime|Lifetime]]. A recording from the [[Record Plant]], NYC, dated 25 March 1969, exists of McLaughlin jamming with [[Jimi Hendrix]]. McLaughlin recollects \"we played one night, just a jam session. And we played from 2 until 8, in the morning. I thought it was a wonderful experience! I was playing an acoustic guitar with a pick-up. Um, flat-top guitar, and Jimi was playing an electric. Yeah, what a lovely time! Had he lived today, you'd find that he would be employing everything he could get his hands on, and I mean acoustic guitar, synthesizers, orchestras, voices, anything he could get his hands on he'd use!\"\n\nHe played on Miles Davis' albums ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (which has a track named after him), ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'', ''[[On the Corner]]'', ''[[Big Fun (Miles Davis album)|Big Fun]]'' (where he is featured soloist on \"Go Ahead John\") and ''[[Jack Johnson (album)|A Tribute to Jack Johnson]]''. In the liner notes to ''Jack Johnson'', Davis called McLaughlin's playing \"far in\". McLaughlin returned to the Davis band for one night of a week-long club date, recorded and released as part of the album ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'' and of the ''[[The Cellar Door Sessions|Cellar Door]]'' boxed set. His reputation as a \"first-call\" [[Session musician|session player]] grew, resulting in recordings as a sideman with [[Miroslav Vitous]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[Joe Farrell]], [[Wayne Shorter]], [[Carla Bley]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and others.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:JohnMcLaughlin.jpg|thumb|left|180px|John McLaughlin, Cirkus Krone-Bau, Munich, West Germany, 9 June 1973]]\nHe recorded ''[[Devotion (John McLaughlin album)|Devotion]]'' in early 1970 on Douglas Records (run by [[Alan Douglas (record producer)|Alan Douglas]]), a high-energy, psychedelic fusion album that featured [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]] on organ (who had been part of Lifetime), [[Billy Rich]] on bass and the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] drummer [[Buddy Miles]]. ''Devotion'' was the first of two albums he released on Douglas. In 1971 he released ''[[My Goal's Beyond]]'' in the US, a collection of unamplified acoustic works. Side A (\"Peace One\" and \"Peace Two\") offers a fusion blend of jazz and Indian classical forms, while side B features melodic acoustic playing McLaughlin on such standards as \"[[Goodbye Pork Pie Hat]]\", by [[Charles Mingus]] whom McLaughlin considered an important influence. ''My Goal's Beyond'' was inspired by McLaughlin's decision to follow the Indian spiritual leader [[Sri Chinmoy]], to whom he had been introduced in 1970 by Larry Coryell's manager. The album was dedicated to Chinmoy, with one of the [[Guru]]'s poems printed on the [[liner notes]]. It was on this album that McLaughlin [[Name change#Name change on religious conversion|took the name]] \"Mahavishnu\".\n\nIn 1973 McLaughlin collaborated with [[Carlos Santana]], also a disciple of [[Sri Chinmoy]] at the time, on an album of devotional songs, ''[[Love Devotion Surrender]]'', which featured recordings of [[John Coltrane|Coltrane]] compositions including a movement of ''[[A Love Supreme]]''. McLaughlin has also worked with the jazz composers [[Carla Bley]] and [[Gil Evans]].\n\n[[File:John McLaughlin in 1978.jpg|thumb|180px|right|McLaughlin performing in The Netherlands, 1978]]\nIn 1979 he formed a short-lived funk fusion [[power trio]] named [[Trio of Doom]] with drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] and bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]]. Their only live performance was on 3 March 1979 at the [[Havana Jam]] Festival (2\u20134 March 1979) in [[Cuba]], part of a US State Department sponsored visit to Cuba. Later on 8 March 1979 the group recorded the songs they had written for the festival at Columbia Studios, New York, on 52nd Street. Recollections from this performance are captured on [[Ernesto Juan Castellanos]]'s documentary ''[[Havana Jam '79]]'' and cd [[Trio of Doom]].\n\n====The Mahavishnu Orchestra====\n{{Main|Mahavishnu Orchestra}}\nMcLaughlin's 1970s electric band, the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=22802 |title=Power, Passion and Beauty, The Story of the Legendary Mahavishnu-Orchestra |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |accessdate=18 October 2011}}</ref> included violinist [[Jerry Goodman]], keyboardist [[Jan Hammer]], bassist [[Rick Laird]], and drummer [[Billy Cobham]]. They performed a technically difficult and complex style of music that fused electric jazz and rock with Eastern and Indian influences. This band helped establish fusion as a new and growing style. McLaughlin's playing at this time was distinguished by fast solos and non-western [[musical scales]].\n\nThe Mahavishnu Orchestra's personality clashes were as explosive as their performances, and consequently the first incarnation of the group split in late 1973 after two years and three albums, including a live recording entitled ''[[Between Nothingness & Eternity]]''. In 2001 the ''[[The Lost Trident Sessions|Lost Trident Sessions]]'' album was released; recorded in 1973 but shelved when the group disbanded. McLaughlin then reformed the group with [[Narada Michael Walden]] (drums), [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] (violin), Ralphe Armstrong (bass), and [[Gayle Moran]] (keyboards and vocals), and a string and horn section (McLaughlin referred to this as \"the real Mahavishnu Orchestra\"). This incarnation of the group recorded two more albums, ''[[Apocalypse (Mahavishnu Orchestra album)|Apocalypse]]'' with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and ''[[Visions of the Emerald Beyond]]''. A scaled-down quartet was formed with McLaughlin, Walden on drums, Armstrong on bass and [[Stu Goldberg]] on keyboards and synthesiser, which generated a third \"Mahavishnu 2\" recording in 1976 largely due to contractual obligations, ''[[Inner Worlds]]''.\n\n====Shakti====\nMcLaughlin then became absorbed in his acoustic playing with his [[Indian classical music]] based group [[Shakti (band)|Shakti]] (energy). McLaughlin had already been studying Indian classical music and playing the [[veena]] for several years. The group featured Lakshminarayanan [[L. Shankar]] (violin), [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]] ([[tabla]]), [[Thetakudi Harihara Vinayakram]] ([[ghatam]]) and earlier [[Ramnad Raghavan]] ([[mridangam]]). The group recorded three albums: ''[[Shakti (Shakti album)|Shakti with John McLaughlin]]'' (1975)\n''[[A Handful of Beauty]]'' (1976), and ''[[Natural Elements (Shakti album)|Natural Elements]]'' (1977). Based on both [[carnatic music|Carnatic]] and [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] styles, along with extended use of [[konnakol]], the band introduced ragas and Indian percussion to many jazz aficionados.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chembur.com/anecdotes/carnatic/lshankar/ |title=Chembur.com |publisher=Chembur.com |accessdate=18 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928044436/http://www.chembur.com/anecdotes/carnatic/lshankar/ |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn this group McLaughlin played a custom-made steel-string J-200 acoustic guitar made by [[Abraham Wechter|Abe Wechter]] and the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson guitar company]] that featured two tiers of strings over the soundhole: a conventional six-string configuration and seven strings strung underneath at a 45-degree angle \u2013 these were independently tuneable \"[[sympathetic strings]]\" much like those on a [[sitar]] or [[veena]]. The instrument's vina-like scalloped fretboard enabled McLaughlin to bend strings far beyond the reach of a conventional fretboard. McLaughlin grew so accustomed to the freedom it provided him that he had the fretboard scalloped on his [[Gibson Byrdland]] electric guitar.\n\n====Other activities====\n[[File:John McLaughlin 20010720.JPG|thumb|John McLaughlin, [[Remember Shakti]] Concert, Munich/Germany (2001)]]\nMcLaughlin also appeared on [[Stanley Clarke]]'s ''[[School Days (album)|School Days]]'' and numerous other fusion albums. They later recorded three tracks at [[CBS]] Studios in New York, 8 March 1979. The same year he teamed up with [[flamenco]] guitarist [[Paco de Luc\u00eda]] and jazz guitarist [[Larry Coryell]] (replaced by [[Al Di Meola]] in the early 1980s) as the Guitar Trio. For the tour of fall 1983 they were joined by [[Dixie Dregs]] guitarist [[Steve Morse]] who opened the show as a soloist and participated with The Trio in the closing numbers. The Trio reunited in 1996 for a second recording session and a world tour. Also in 1979 McLaughlin recorded the album ''[[Electric Guitarist|Johnny McLaughlin: Electric Guitarist]]'', the title on McLaughlin's first business cards as a teenager in [[Yorkshire]]. This was a return to more mainstream jazz/rock fusion and to the electric instrument after three years of playing acoustic guitars.\n[[File:Tres GUITARRISTAS (as\u00ed, con may\u00fasculas).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Left to right: [[Al Di Meola]], John McLaughlin and [[Paco de Luc\u00eda]] performing in [[Barcelona]], Spain in the 1980s]]\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:John McLaughlin 1980.jpg|thumb|left|John McLaughlin at Berkeley Jazz Festival  5/25/1980]]\nThe short-lived One Truth Band recorded one studio album, ''[[Electric Dreams (John McLaughlin album)|Electric Dreams]]'', with L. Shankar on violins, Stu Goldberg on keyboards, [[Fernando Saunders]] on electric bass and [[Tony Thunder Smith|Tony Smith]] on drums. After the dissolution of the One Truth Band, McLaughlin toured in a guitar duo with [[Christian Escoud\u00e9]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=6573|title=Christian Escoude \u2013 Jazz \u2013 Guitar|magazine=All About Jazz|accessdate=18 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205135843/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=6573|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWith the group [[Fuse One]], he released two albums in 1980 and 1982.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p10614/discography|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic Discography]</ref>\n\nIn 1981 and 1982, McLaughlin recorded two albums, ''[[Belo Horizonte (album)|Belo Horizonte]]'' and ''[[Music Spoken Here]]'' with The Translators, a band of French and American musicians who combined acoustic guitar, bass, drums, saxophone, and violin with synthesizers. The Translators included McLaughlin's future wife, classical keyboardist, [[Katia Lab\u00e8que]].\n\nFrom 1984 through to (circa) 1987, an electric five-piece operated under the name \"Mahavishnu\" (omitting the \"Orchestra\"). Two LPs were released, ''[[Mahavishnu (album)|Mahavishnu]]'' and ''[[Adventures in Radioland]]''. The former featured McLaughlin making extensive use of the [[Synclavier]] synthesizer, allied with a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Guitar synthesizer|guitar/controller]]. The first of the two albums was recorded with a line-up of McLaughlin, [[Bill Evans (saxophonist)|Bill Evans]] (saxophones), [[Jonas Hellborg]] (bass), [[Mitchel Forman]] (keyboards) and both [[Danny Gottlieb]] and Billy Cobham on drums. Initial advertising for concert dates in support of the album included Cobham's name, but by the time the tour started in earnest, Gottlieb was in the band. Forman left at some point between the albums, and was replaced on keyboards by [[Jim Beard]].\n\nIn tandem with Mahavishnu, McLaughlin worked in duo format (c. 1985\u201387) with bassist Jonas Hellborg, playing a number of concert dates, some of which were broadcast on radio and TV, but no commercial recordings were made.\n\nIn 1986 he appeared with [[Dexter Gordon]] in [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''.  He also composed The Mediterranean Concerto, orchestrated by [[Michael Gibbs (composer)|Michael Gibbs]]. The world premier featured McLaughlin and the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]].  It was recorded in 1988 with [[Michael Tilson Thomas]] conducting the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. Unlike what is typical practice in classical music, the concerto includes sections where McLaughlin [[Improvisation (music)|improvises]]. Also included on the recording were five duets between McLaughlin and his then-girlfriend Katia Lab\u00e8que.\n\nIn the late '80s McLaughlin began performing live and recording with a trio including percussionist [[Trilok Gurtu]], and three bassists at various times; firstly [[Jeff Berlin]], then [[Kai Eckhardt]] and finally [[Dominique Di Piazza]]. Berlin contributed to the trio's live work only in 1988/89, and didn't record with McLaughlin. The group recorded two albums: ''[[Live at the Royal Festival Hall (John McLaughlin Trio album)|Live at The Royal Festival Hall]]'' and ''[[Que Alegria]]'', the former with Eckhardt, and the latter with di Piazza for all but two tracks. These recordings saw a return to acoustic instruments for McLaughlin, performing on nylon-string guitar. On ''Live at the Royal Festival Hall'' McLaughlin used a unique guitar synth that enabled him to effectively [[tape loop|\"loop\"]] guitar parts and play over them live. The synth also featured a pedal that provided sustain. McLaughlin overdubbed parts to create lush soundscapes, aided by Gurtu's unique percussive sounds. He used this approach to great effect in the track ''Florianapolis'', among others.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the early 1990s he toured with his trio on the ''[[Que Alegria|Qu\u00e9 Alegr\u00eda]]'' album. By this time, Eckhardt had left, with McLaughlin and Gurtu joined by bass player Dominique Di Piazza. In the latter stages of this trio's life, they were joined on tour by Katia Lab\u00e8que alone, or by Katia and her sister Marielle, with footage of the latter configuration forming part of a documentary on the [[Katia and Marielle Lab\u00e8que|Lab\u00e8que Sisters]].  Following this period he recorded and toured with The Heart of Things featuring [[Gary Thomas (musician)|Gary Thomas]], [[Dennis Chambers]], [[Matt Garrison]], Jim Beard and [[Otmaro Ru\u00edz]]. In 1993 he released a [[Bill Evans]] tribute album entitled ''[[Time Remembered: John McLaughlin Plays Bill Evans]]'', with McLaughlin's acoustic guitar backed by the acoustic guitars of the Aighetta Quartet and the acoustic bass of Yan Maresz. In recent times McLaughlin has toured with [[Remember Shakti]].\n\nIn addition to original Shakti member [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]], this group has also featured eminent Indian musicians [[U. Srinivas]], [[V. Selvaganesh]], [[Shankar Mahadevan]], [[Shivkumar Sharma]], and [[Hariprasad Chaurasia]]. In 1996, John McLaughlin, Paco de Lucia and Al Di Meola (known collectively as \"The Guitar Trio\") reunited for a world tour and recorded an album of the same name. They had previously released a studio album entitled ''[[Passion, Grace and Fire|Passion, Grace & Fire]]'' back in 1983. Meanwhile, in the same year of 1996 McLaughlin recorded ''[[The Promise (John McLaughlin album)|The Promise]]''. Also notable during the period were his performances with [[Elvin Jones]] and [[Joey DeFrancesco]].\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003 he recorded a ballet score, ''[[Thieves and Poets]]'', along with arrangements for classical guitar ensemble of favourite jazz standards and a three-DVD instructional video on improvisation entitled \"This is the Way I Do It\" (which contributed to the development of video lessons.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=All About Jazz |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=14486 |title=Walter Kolosky |magazine=All About Jazz |date=17 August 2004 |accessdate=19 October 2011}}</ref>) In June 2006 he released the [[post-bop]]/[[jazz fusion]] album ''[[Industrial Zen]]'', on which he experimented with the [[Godin (Guitar Manufacturer)|Godin]] Glissentar as well as continuing to expand his guitar-synth repertoire.\n\nIn 2007 he left [[Universal Records]] and joined Abstract Logix. Recording sessions for his first album on that label took place in April. That summer, he began touring with a new jazz fusion quartet, the 4th Dimension, consisting of keyboardist/drummer [[Gary Husband]], bassist Hadrian Feraud, and drummer [[Mark Mondesir]]. During the 4th Dimension's tour, an \"instant CD\" entitled ''Live USA 2007: Official Bootleg'' was made available comprising [[soundboard recording]]s of six pieces from the group's first performance. Following completion of the tour, McLaughlin sorted through recordings from each night to release a second MP3 download-only collection entitled, ''Official Pirate: Best of the American Tour 2007''. During this time, McLaughlin also released another instructional DVD, ''The Gateway to Rhythm'', featuring Indian percussionist and Remember Shakti bandmate Selva Ganesh Vinayakram (or V. Selvaganesh), focusing on the Indian rhythmic system of [[konnakol]]. McLaughlin also remastered and released the shelved 1979 Trio of Doom project with Jaco Pastorius and Tony Williams. The project had been aborted due to conflicts between Williams and Pastorius as well as what was at the time a mutual dissatisfaction with the results of their performance.\n\nOn 28 July 2007, McLaughlin performed at [[Eric Clapton]]'s [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]] in [[Bridgeview, Illinois]].\n[[File:JohnMcLaughinCrossroads2007.jpg|thumb|140px|right|McLaughlin, 2007 [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]]]]\n\nOn 28 April 2008 the recording sessions from the previous year surfaced on the album ''[[Floating Point]]'', featuring the rhythm section of keyboardist [[Louis Banks]], bassist [[Hadrien Feraud]], percussionist Sivamani and drummer [[Ranjit Barot]] bolstered on each track by a different Indian musician.  Coinciding with the release of the album was another DVD, ''Meeting of the Minds'', which offered behind the scenes studio footage of the ''Floating Point'' sessions as well as interviews with all of the musicians. He engaged in a late summer/fall 2008 tour with [[Chick Corea]], [[Vinnie Colaiuta]], [[Kenny Garrett]] and [[Christian McBride]] under the name [[Five Peace Band]], from which came an eponymous double-CD live album in early 2009.\n\nMcLaughlin performed with Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer Billy Cobham at the 44th [[Montreux Jazz Festival]], in Montreux, [[Switzerland]], on 2 July 2010, for the first time since the band split up. In November 2010, a new book was released by Abstract Logix Books entitled ''Follow Your Heart- John McLaughlin Song by Song'' by Walter Kolosky, who also wrote the book ''Power, Passion and Beauty \u2013 The Story of the Legendary Mahavishnu Orchestra''. The book discussed each song McLaughlin wrote and contained photographs never seen before.\n\n==Style==\nJohn McLaughlin is a leading guitarist in jazz and jazz fusion. His style has been described as one that incorporates aggressive speed, technical precision, and harmonic sophistication.<ref>{{cite web|title=John McLaughlin|url=http://musicians.allaboutjazz.com/musician.php?id=9281#.UNlA1tHQTMY|website=Musicians.allaboutjazz.com|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> He is known for using non-Western scales and unconventional time signatures.

Speaking of himself, McLaughlin has stated that the guitar is simply \"part of his body,\" and he feels more comfortable when a guitar is present.\n\n==Influence==\n\n[[File:Al di Meola and John McLaughlin in 1979.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Al Di Meola]] and John McLaughlin in 1979]]\nIn 2010, [[Jeff Beck]] said: \"John McLaughlin has given us so many different facets of the guitar.

{"title_page": "Controversies surrounding Yasukuni Shrine", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2013}}\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Yasukuni_Shrine_2012.JPG|thumb|Yasukuni Shrine]]\nThere are major controversies surrounding [[Yasukuni Shrine]], a Japanese [[Shinto]] shrine to war dead who served the [[Emperor of Japan]] during wars from 1867\u20131951. The controversies involve civilians in service and government officials. Yasukuni is a shrine to house the actual souls of the dead as ''[[kami]]'', or \"spirits/souls\" as loosely defined in the English words. This activity is strictly a religious matter due to the religious separation of [[State Shinto]] and the Japanese Government. The priesthood at the shrine has complete religious autonomy to decide to whom and how enshrinement may occur. It is thought that enshrinement is permanent and irreversible by the current clergy. Due to the enshrinement of individuals found to be war criminals by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] and an approach to the war museum considered by some to be nationalist, China, [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]] have called the Yasukuni Shrine a microcosm of a revisionist and unapologetic approach to Japanese crimes of World War II.\n\nOf the 2,466,532 people contained in the shrine's ''Book of Souls'', 1,068 were convicted of [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] by a post-World War II court. Of those, 14 are convicted Class A [[war criminals]] (\"[[crime against peace]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2321.html |title=Yasukuni Shrine |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |work=japan-guide.com}}</ref> The war crimes tribunals were carried out by the IMTFE, which comprised the victors of World War II including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]], [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]], [[India]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Philippines]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDue to the nature of the crimes committed, visits to the shrine by [[Japanese Diet]] cabinet members in general and Prime Ministers in particular have been controversial. Former [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]] made annual personal (non-governmental) visits from 2001 to 2006. China, North Korea, and South Korea have protested various visits since 1985.\n\n==Release of documents==\nOn March 29, 2007, a book of documents was released by Japan's National Diet Library called \"A New Compilation of Materials on the Yasukuni Shrine Problems\"<ref>http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070329a5.html</ref> including declassified documents from the Occupational Government, the Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry and Yasukuni Shrine. The documents purportedly draw a connection between the Japanese Government and the war criminal enshrinement.<ref>http://www.korea.net/News/News/LangView.asp?serial_no=20070329019&lang_no=1&part=110&SearchDay={{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> According to Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] the government had no say in who is enshrined.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601101&sid=aRX1E8Q02OqM | work=Bloomberg | title=Japan Didn't Push for Yasukuni to Honor War Criminals (Update4) | date=March 29, 2007}}</ref> In addition, Vice Minister of Health, Labor, and Welfare Tsuji Tetsuo told reporters that the former ministry was \"in charge of keeping the personal records of soldiers and civilian employees of the military, and with presenting records as the need arose.\"<ref>http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/0702qjapan_china.pdf</ref>\n\n\"A New Compilation of Materials on the Yasukuni Shrine Problems\"<ref>http://lccn.loc.gov/2007553672{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> has been entered into the Library of Congress.\n\n==War criminals==\nThe shrine enshrines and, according to [[Shinto]] beliefs, provides a permanent residence for the spirits of those who have fought on behalf of the emperor, regardless of whether they died in combat. 1,068 of the enshrined [[kami]] were [[POW]]s convicted of some level of war crime after World War II. Enshrinement typically carries absolution of earthly deeds.\n\nOne of the criteria for enshrinement at Yasukuni is that a person be listed as having died of any cause while on duty in the war dead registry of the Japanese government. According to documents released on March 28, 2007, by the National Diet Library of Japan, Health and Welfare Ministry officials and Yasukuni representatives agreed during a meeting, on January 31, 1969, that Class-A war criminals judged at the [[Tokyo Trial]] were \"able to be honored\" as decided by the Shrine Priests and decided not to make this decision public.<ref>The Japan Times (March 29, 2007) [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070329a5.html Yasukuni, state in '69 OK'd war criminal inclusion] (June 1, 2007)</ref>\n\nOn October 17, 1978, these fourteen Class A war criminals were enshrined as {{nihongo|\"Martyrs of [[Sh\u014dwa period|Sh\u014dwa]]\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa junnansha}} because they were on the war dead registry:\n\n*Death by hanging:\n*:[[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]], [[Heitar\u014d Kimura]], [[Kenji Doihara]], [[Akira Mut\u014d]], [[K\u014dki Hirota]], [[Iwane Matsui]]\n*Lifetime imprisonment:\n*:[[Yoshijir\u014d Umezu]], [[Kuniaki Koiso]], [[Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d]], [[Toshio Shiratori]]\n*20-year imprisonment:\n*:[[Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d]]\n*Died before a judicial decision was reached (due to illness or disease):\n*:[[Osami Nagano]], [[Yosuke Matsuoka]]\n\nAll imprisoned war criminals either had their sentences commuted or were released by 1958. The enshrinement was revealed to the media on April 19, 1979, and a still-ongoing controversy started in 1985.\n\n==Y\u016bsh\u016bkan War Museum==\nYasukuni Shrine operates a war museum of the [[history of Japan]] (the [[Y\u016bsh\u016bkan]]), which some observers<ref>http://www.shanghaidaily.com/Opinion/foreign-perspectives/Yushukan-museum-whitewashes-wartime-atrocities/shdaily.shtml</ref> have criticized as presenting a [[historical revisionism (political)|revisionist]] interpretation. A documentary-style propaganda video shown to museum visitors portrays Japan's conquest of [[East Asia]] during the pre-World War II period as an effort to save the region from the imperial advances of colonial [[Western world|Western powers]]. Displays portray Japan as a victim of foreign influence, especially Western undermining of trade.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The museum has no mention of any of the atrocities committed by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]], including the [[Nanking massacre]].<ref>''Black museum of Japan's war crimes'', Sunday Times, http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article549954.ece</ref>\n\n==Izokukai==\nThe political overtones of Yasukuni Shrine are attributed to two factors. One is the ideology of State Shinto, which regarded any wars waged in the name of the emperor as just and anyone who died fighting for the emperor as an {{nihongo|''eirei''|\u82f1\u970a||hero spirit}}. But another more immediate factor is the influence of various support organizations, especially the [[Japan War-Bereaved Families Association]] ({{nihongo|Izokukai|\u907a\u65cf\u4f1a}}, the largest organization representing the families of war dead from World War II.\n\nYasukuni Shrine considers the Izokukai as its '''de facto'' lay organization. The Izokukai was formerly known as the {{nihongo|Izoku K\u014dsei Renmei|\u907a\u65cf\u539a\u751f\u9023\u76df||War-Dead-Family Welfare Union}}, established in 1947. The original purpose of the Izoku K\u014dsei Renmei was \"pursuing the end of warfare, establishing global peace and world prosperity and contributing to the welfare of the humanity.\" They sought \"to provide relief and assistance to the families of those who died in the (Asia Pacific) war \". The organization provided assistance to the widows, orphans and aging parents of deceased veterans as well as lobbying the government on behalf of those families' interests. However, in 1953 the organization became a trust foundation and changed its name to Izokukai. The organization changed its main purpose to pursue \"the establishment of a peaceful Japan, the cultivation of character, and the promotion of morality\" and to \"seek to praise ''eirei'', to promote the welfare of the families of the war dead, and to seek recognition and compensation for civilian auxiliary units.\" The change, which removed the mention of international pacifism and inserted of a reference to ''eirei'', is regarded as giving a nationalist slant to the character of the organization. Chairmen of the organization have usually been members of the governing Liberal Democratic party and the organization is regarded as the informal pipeline between the LDP and the Shrine. In 1962, [[Okinori Kaya]], a militant member of the LDP and a convicted class A war criminal, was appointed chairman.\n\n==Politicians' visits==\nJapanese politicians' visits to worship at Yasukuni Shrine have resulted in controversy.\n\nThis issue first surfaced when [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] refused to visit the shrine from 1978 until his death in 1989.<ref name=\"JT1\">{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20060820pb.html |title=Notes on Yasukuni and a week that will live in infamy |accessdate=April 13, 2008 |author=Brasor, Philip  |date=August 20, 2006 |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}</ref> According to a memorandum released in 2006 kept by [[Imperial Household Agency]] [[Grand Steward]] Tomohiko Tomita, Hirohito stated that the reason he stopped visiting the shrine was because of the decision to enshrine class A war criminals.<ref name=\"JT2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/07/21/national/hirohito-visits-to-yasukuni-stopped-over-war-criminals/ |title=Hirohito visits to Yasukuni stopped over war criminals |accessdate=January 5, 2020 |date=July 21, 2006 |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Junichiro Koizumi (cropped) during arrival ceremony on South Lawn of White House.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Former Japanese Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]]]]\n\nPrime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] was one of the most outspoken and controversial visitors. On October 17, 2005, Koizumi visited the shrine for the fifth time since taking office. Although he claimed that his visit was a private affair, it came only days before [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese Foreign Minister]] [[Nobutaka Machimura]] was scheduled to visit Chinese officials in [[Beijing]] to strengthen Sino-Japanese relations. The [[People's Republic of China]] responded by canceling the scheduled visit as they consider the shrine a glorification of Japan's past military aggression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20051019a1.htm |title=China cancels meeting with Machimura |accessdate=April 13, 2008 |date=October 19, 2005 |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}</ref>\n\nKoizumi's annual visits continued to draw criticism from around the world. During the 2005 [[APEC]] summit in [[Busan]], South Korea, Chinese Foreign Minister [[Li Zhaoxing]] blasted Koizumi's visits, asking, \"What would European people think if German leaders were to visit (memorials) related to Hitler and Nazis?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2005/11/16/national/china-playing-the-hitler-card/#.WIdO6_krLIU |title=China playing the Hitler card |accessdate=April 13, 2008 |date=November 16, 2005 |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}</ref> In 2006, [[Henry Hyde]], chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]], stated that Koizumi would embarrass the [[United States Congress]] and offend American veterans of World War II if he were to give a Congressional speech after making another visit to Yasukuni.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060517a1.html |title=Bid to address Congress has Yasukuni proviso |accessdate=April 13, 2008 |date=May 17, 2006 |work=[[The Japan Times]] |author=Nakata, Hiroko}}</ref>\n\nKoizumi's expected successor, [[Shinzo Abe]], visited the shrine in April 2006 before he took office.

The controversy has been reignited nearly every year since 1975, when [[prime minister]] [[Takeo Miki]] visited the shrine as a private individual on August 15, the day that Japan commemorates the end of World War II. The next year, his successor [[Fukuda Takeo]] visited as a private individual yet signed the visitors' book as prime minister. Several other Japanese [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]] have visited the shrine since 1979: [[Masayoshi Ohira]] in 1979; [[Zenko Suzuki]] in 1980, 1981 and 1982; [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] in 1983 and 1985 (on the latter occasion, he offered flowers which had been paid for with government money); [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] in 1992, this visit was kept secret until 1996 (he had paid a visit in 1980 before becoming Prime Minister); [[Ryutaro Hashimoto]] in 1996; and [[Junichiro Koizumi]], who visited six times (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006). Visits by Japanese prime ministers to the shrine have resulted in official condemnation by neighbouring countries since 1985, as they see it as an attempt to legitimize [[Japanese militarism|Japan's past militarism]].\n\nVisits to the shrine are also controversial in the domestic debate over the proper role of religion in Japanese government. Some [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)]] politicians insist that visits are protected by the constitutional right to freedom of religion and that it is appropriate for legislators to pay their respects to those fallen in war. However, proposals for the construction of a [[secular]] memorial, so that those wishing to honor Japan's military dead do not have to visit Yasukuni, have thus far failed, ostensibly for technical details rather than the rejection of a secular memorial. The Japanese government conducts yearly memorial services to commemorate the War in Budokan (a secular building) which is near Yasukuni shrine, so that the attendees can later visit Yasukuni Shrine privately if they so wish. The shrine itself objects to any proposal that a non-religious memorial be built, stating that \"Yasukuni Shrine must be the one and only memorial for Japan's military dead.\" Koizumi has claimed that his visits are to ensure that there will be no further wars involving Japan, causing some to interpret them as an act of remembrance rather than reverence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nOn his first visit to Japan since leaving office in February 2003, former [[President of South Korea|South Korean President]] [[Kim Dae Jung]] openly criticised Japanese politicians' visits to the shrine, and proposed that the 14 Class A war criminals be moved to a different location. He said, \"If that option is realized, I will not express opposition to visits to Yasukuni Shrine (by Koizumi or other Japanese leaders)\". Kim noted that Koizumi promised at a meeting in [[Shanghai]] in 2001 to consider building a new memorial facility that could replace Yasukuni Shrine and enable anyone to worship there without hesitation.\n\nThe government of the People's Republic of China has been the most vocal critic of the shrine and some Japanese observers have suggested that the issue of Yasukuni Shrine is just as heavily tied to China's internal politics as it is to the historical conduct of Japan's military and the perceived degree of its remorse for its actions. They state that tolerance on the part of [[Communist Party of China]] authorities for large-scale public protests in mainland China against the shrine contrasts strongly with the authority exercised against any kind of domestic political dissent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\n==Debate in Japan==\nOne controversy of political visits to the shrine is the constitutionality of visits by the Prime Minister. In the [[Constitution of Japan]], the [[Separation of church and state|separation of state and religion]] is explicit. Because the clause was written for the express purpose of preventing the return of State Shintoism, many question the constitutionality of the Prime Minister visiting Yasukuni Shrine. Often the first question Japanese Prime Ministers are asked by journalists after a visit is, \"Are you here as a private person or as Prime Minister?\" In addition, whether the Prime Minister has signed the visitors' book indicating the position of signatory as {{nihongo|''shijin''|\u79c1\u4eba||private person}} or {{nihongo|''shush\u014d''|\u9996\u76f8||Prime Minister}} is diligently reported. All Prime Ministers have so far stated that their visit was private. However, although some leave the signature section blank or sign it as ''shijin'', others sign it as ''shush\u014d''. The issue is somewhat different than that of visits by the German Chancellor to the Holocaust Memorial, which are explicitly made in the context of a state visit. Prime Minister Koizumi recently gave a somewhat cryptic answer, stating that he visited the shrine as Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister of Japan. Some consider such statement as a move towards making visits somewhat official; others consider that it is pointing out that the whole issue of ''shijin'' vs ''shush\u014d'' is somewhat meaningless. Some journals and news reports, such as one made by Kyodo News Agency on August 15, 2006, question whether in the case of Koizumi's visits, which are consistently claimed by Koizumi to be private, can be considered individual in nature when they are part of a campaign pledge, which in nature is political. Currently, most of the Japanese public and most jurists have agreed that there have been no constitutional violations yet.\n\nShinzo Abe, 15 of the 18 members of his cabinet, and 289 of 480 Diet members are affiliated to the openly [[historical revisionism|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]], which advocates the restoration of [[Monarchism|monarchy]] and [[State Shinto]], negates Japanese war crimes, and recommends the revision of the Constitution and school textbooks as well as visits by Prime Ministers to the Shrine.<ref name=\"2014 reshuffle\">\"[http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2994558 Abe\u2019s reshuffle promotes right-wingers]\" (Korea Joongang Daily \u2013 2014/09/05)</ref><ref name=kato>{{cite news |author=Norihiro Kato |title=Tea Party Politics in Japan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/opinion/tea-party-politics-in-japan.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 12, 2014}}</ref> The chief priest of the shrine, Yasuhisa Tokugawa (also the great-grandson of [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], the last sh\u014dgun), is a member of Nippon Kaigi's representative committee.<ref>Nippon Kaigi website</ref>\n\nThe views expressed by Yasukuni Shrine through its museum and website are also controversial. Both sites make it clear that Yasukuni Shrine does not regard the conduct of Japan during World War II as an act of aggression but rather matter of self-defence and a heroic effort to repel [[European imperialism]]. Defenders of (private) visits by the Prime Minister point out that, regardless, there is no other venue to pay respect to the fallen in Japan, so that Prime Minister as well as the large number of Japanese who visit the shrine have no choice. Moreover, most people (including the Prime Minister) who visit Yasukuni deliberately avoid entering the museum so that the visit remains religious rather than political.\n\nA number of proposals have been made to alleviate controversy. One is to somehow \"remove\" the controversial spirits and place them in a different location so that visits to Yasukuni Shrine would not be as politically charged. This proposal has been strongly pushed by China and Korea. The Japanese government cannot force Yasukuni Shrine to do so (due to the separation of church and state). Moreover, the shrine is adamant that once a kami has been housed at the shrine, it cannot be separated. The one method which is suggested as theologically valid is to abolish the entire enshrinement, then repeat the entire enshrinement rite of kami since the Boshin War without including the A class war criminals. Some argue that selective abolishment of enshrinement is technically possible, as there are several precedents of selective de-enshrinement in the Tokugawa era. The Shinto processes of ''[[bunrei]]'' and ''[[kanj\u014d]]'' exist specifically to remove a kami from its shrine and re-enshrine it elsewhere, but typically leave the kami at the originating shrine intact and unchanged.<ref>[[Karen Ann Smyers|Smyers, Karen Ann]].

Critics point out that groups representing families of the war dead express no interest in such a memorial, preferring Yasukuni Shrine. Furthermore, the Japanese government already conducts yearly secular commemoration services at the [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] for the families of soldiers killed in World War II. Afterwards, these families usually make private visits to Yasukuni Shrine, which is located within walking distance. Since the proposed memorial site is geographically distant, were the ceremony to be relocated to the proposed memorial site such visits would be made more difficult. A number of families of the names listed at the shrine have indicated that the controversy is disturbing the peaceful rest of their dead family members and that they wish to pay homage to them without controversy and media attention.\n\nThere is in fact a memorial to the Japanese (unidentified) war dead within walking distance of Yasukuni, called {{nihongo|[[Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery]]|\u5343\u9ce5\u30f6\u6df5\u6226\u6ca1\u8005\u5893\u82d1}}. This could be used as an alternative by Japanese politicians to pay their respects to those who died during the war.\n\n==Textbook controversy==\nIn May 2005, in the aftermath of [[2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations|anti-Japanese protests]] over the [[Japanese history textbooks controversy]], Chinese Vice-Premier [[Wu Yi (politician)|Wu Yi]] cut short her visit to Japan and flew home before a planned meeting with Japanese Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]]. This was widely interpreted as a reaction to a statement by Koizumi the day before Wu's arrival that foreign countries should not interfere in Japan's domestic affairs, including the Yasukuni issue. Wu's visit was meant to improve strained relations between the two countries following the textbook controversy, and she had planned to ask Koizumi to stop his visits to the shrine.\n\n==Removal of the names==\nIn June 2005, a senior LDP member proposed moving the 14 Class A war criminals to a separate site. Shinto priests refused this proposal, quoting Japan's [[freedom of religion]] laws under the [[Japanese Constitution]].\n\nAlso in the same month, a group claiming to represent [[Taiwanese aborigine]]s led by politician [[Kao Chin Su-mei]] attempted to visit Yasukuni Shrine with the sponsorship of the Japan Catholic Council for Justice and Peace. Their intention was to peacefully request the removal of their relatives from the shrine, and to pray for the return of their ancestors' souls. Request to perform religious rites within the Yasukuni property were refused and they were blocked from entering Yasukuni by Japanese protesters and police. A demonstration was organized by a group of more than one hundred Japanese [[nationalist]]s to block them from the shrine and prevent them from performing spirit-calling religious rituals within the property the Shrine objected. Japanese police allowed the protesters to remain on the grounds because their entrance to the shrine was not objected by the shrine however they blocked the Taiwanese from leaving their buses, citing measures to prevent clashes between the two groups. After about an hour and a half, the Taiwanese group gave up their attempt. Kao Chin Su-mei and her group reportedly received death threats related to their visit, prompting the Taiwanese government to request Japanese authorities ensure her safety while in Japan.<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/detail.asp?ID=63832&GRP=B Lawmaker and aborigines forbidden to visit Yasukuni]</ref>\n\n==Prime ministerial visits==\n\n===Junichiro Koizumi===\nPrime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] made widely publicized annual visits to the shrine while in office.

[[Henry Hyde]], a World War II veteran serving as the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on International Relations, wrote a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert in May 2006 urging that Koizumi only be allowed to speak at the U.S. Capitol if he agreed not to visit Yasukuni on the following anniversary of Japan's surrender.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nakata|first=Hiroko|title=Bid to address Congress has Yasukuni proviso|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/05/17/news/bid-to-address-congress-has-yasukuni-proviso/#.Ur2eQNxdUXE|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=May 17, 2006}}</ref> Hyde's Democratic counterpart [[Tom Lantos]] also pressed for an end to the visits, stating that \"paying one's respect to war criminals is morally bankrupt and unworthy of a great nation such as Japan.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Sheldrick|first=Aaron|title=U.S. Lawmakers Urge Next Japan PM to Avoid Yasukuni|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=arbbcpF0OhQA|accessdate=December 26, 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=September 15, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Shinzo Abe===\nKoizumi's successor [[Shinzo Abe]] visited the shrine several times before and after his first stint as prime minister, but did not visit at all during his first term as prime minister from September 2006 to September 2007.

His son, [[Emperor Akihito]], has not visited the shrine since becoming emperor (and has since continued after [[2019 Japanese imperial transition|abdication in 2019]]), instead choosing to send a lesser member of the royal household. It is unknown if [[Naruhito|Emperor Naruhito]] (Sh\u014dwa's grandson) will visit the shrine or not or as an alternative, would continue to send a lesser member in the household as his predecessor did. On July 20, 2006, ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]'' front-paged an article about the discovery of a memorandum detailing the reason Emperor [[Hirohito]] stopped visiting Yasukuni. The memorandum, kept by former chief of [[Imperial Household Agency]] Tomohiko Tomita, confirms for the first time the enshrinement of [[Class A War Criminal]]s such as [[Yosuke Matsuoka]] and [[Toshio Shiratori]] was the reason. Tomita wrote down the contents of his conversations with the emperor in his diaries and notebooks in detail. He left 12 diaries (1975\u20131986) and some 20 notebooks (1986\u20131997).\n\nAccording to the memorandum, the emperor expressed his strong displeasure in 1988 at the decision made by Yasukuni Shrine to include [[Class A war criminal]]s in the list of war dead honored there by saying, \"At some point, Class-A criminals became enshrined, including Matsuoka and Shiratori. I heard Tsukuba acted cautiously\", Tsukuba is believed to refer to Fujimaro Tsukuba, the former chief Yasukuni priest at the time, who decided not to enshrine the war criminals despite receiving in 1966, the list of war dead compiled by the government containing their names. \"What's on the mind of Matsudaira's son, who is the current head priest?\". \"Matsudaira had a strong wish for peace, but the child didn't know the parent's heart. That's why I have not visited the shrine since. This is my heart\", Matsudaira is believed to refer to Yoshitami Matsudaira, who was the grand steward of Imperial Household immediately after the end of World War II. His son, Nagayoshi, succeeded Fujimaro Tsukuba as the chief priest of Yasukuni and he decided to enshrine the war criminals in 1978.<ref>http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060721a1.html</ref> {{ill|Nagayoshi Matsudaira|ja|\u677e\u5e73\u6c38\u82b3}} died the previous year (July 10, 2005), which is speculated as a reason for the release of the memo.\n\nFor journalist Masanori Yamaguchi, who analyzed the \"memo\" and comments made by the emperor in his first-ever press conference in 1975, his evasive and opaque attitude about his own responsibility for the war and the fact he said that the bombing of Hiroshima \"[[shikata ga nai|could not be helped]]\",<ref>\"-Does your majesty feel responsibility for the war itself, including the opening of hostilities ? -I can't answer that kind of question because I haven't thoroughly studied the literature in this field, and so I don't really appreciate the nuances of your words.\" H.

Those on the right of Japanese politics had attributed the reason for the emperor's suspension of visits to the emergence of controversy over constitutional validity of the visit by the prime minister or the emperor in regard to the separation of state and religion. This claim is no longer valid in the light of the revelation. Secondly, Yasukuni and its lay organisation, Izokukai probably have to make alterations to their stance somewhat. Both organisations have clearly expressed their wish for a visit by the current emperor. Recent rulings by the Supreme Court have also indicated that visits by the prime minister or the emperor are constitutional. However, it is now clear that the controversy over the enshrinement of class A war criminals has to be resolved. Moreover, though the emperor is the highest authority of Shinto, he does not exercise direct control of any Shinto shrine including Yasukuni. However, Yasukuni ideology is clearly in favour of the pre-war arrangement in which the emperor was the official head of Shinto. Thirdly, the revelation clearly shifts the focus of the controversy to the enshrinement of class A war criminals, meaning that the issue of the separation between the state and the church is no longer the main focus. The public opinion is split between those on the left who advocate the removal and those on the right who nonetheless object to the removal.\n\n==New memorial==\nOn October 28, 2005, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)]] and the [[Democratic Party of Japan|Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)]] agreed to set up a cross-party \"group for pushing forward the establishment of a national memorial facility\" to bring about the foundation of a secular war memorial dedicated only to \"ordinary\" soldiers. This would replace Yasukuni Shrine as the home of Japan's war dead. The group was set to meet for the first time on November 9, 2005.\n\n==Yasukuni documentary controversy==\n{{Main article|Yasukuni (film)}}\n\nIn March 2008, a group of lawmakers from the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], featuring [[Tomomi Inada]], called for boycott of a [[Yasukuni (film)|documentary made on Yasukuni]] by Chinese-born director Ying Li about the links between the shrine and right-wing movements such as the [[Uyoku dantai]].

The controversies involve civilians in service and government officials. Yasukuni is a shrine to house the actual souls of the dead as ''[[kami]]'', or \"spirits/souls\" as loosely defined in the English words. This activity is strictly a religious matter due to the religious separation of [[State Shinto]] and the Japanese Government. The priesthood at the shrine has complete religious autonomy to decide to whom and how enshrinement may occur. It is thought that enshrinement is permanent and irreversible by the current clergy. Due to the enshrinement of individuals found to be war criminals by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] and an approach to the war museum considered by some to be nationalist, China, [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]] have called the Yasukuni Shrine a microcosm of a revisionist and unapologetic approach to Japanese crimes of World War II.\n\nOf the 2,466,532 people contained in the shrine's ''Book of Souls'', 1,068 were convicted of [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] by a post-World War II court. Of those, 14 are convicted Class A [[war criminals]] (\"[[crime against peace]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2321.html |title=Yasukuni Shrine |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |work=japan-guide.com}}</ref> The war crimes tribunals were carried out by the IMTFE, which comprised the victors of World War II including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]], [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]], [[India]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Philippines]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDue to the nature of the crimes committed, visits to the shrine by [[Japanese Diet]] cabinet members in general and Prime Ministers in particular have been controversial. Former [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]] made annual personal (non-governmental) visits from 2001 to 2006. China, North Korea, and South Korea have protested various visits since 1985.\n\n==Release of documents==\nOn March 29, 2007, a book of documents was released by Japan's National Diet Library called \"A New Compilation of Materials on the Yasukuni Shrine Problems\"<ref>http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070329a5.html</ref> including declassified documents from the Occupational Government, the Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry and Yasukuni Shrine.

Enshrinement typically carries absolution of earthly deeds.\n\nOne of the criteria for enshrinement at Yasukuni is that a person be listed as having died of any cause while on duty in the war dead registry of the Japanese government. According to documents released on March 28, 2007, by the National Diet Library of Japan, Health and Welfare Ministry officials and Yasukuni representatives agreed during a meeting, on January 31, 1969, that Class-A war criminals judged at the [[Tokyo Trial]] were \"able to be honored\" as decided by the Shrine Priests and decided not to make this decision public.<ref>The Japan Times (March 29, 2007) [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070329a5.html Yasukuni, state in '69 OK'd war criminal inclusion] (June 1, 2007)</ref>\n\nOn October 17, 1978, these fourteen Class A war criminals were enshrined as {{nihongo|\"Martyrs of [[Sh\u014dwa period|Sh\u014dwa]]\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa junnansha}} because they were on the war dead registry:\n\n*Death by hanging:\n*:[[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]], [[Heitar\u014d Kimura]], [[Kenji Doihara]], [[Akira Mut\u014d]], [[K\u014dki Hirota]], [[Iwane Matsui]]\n*Lifetime imprisonment:\n*:[[Yoshijir\u014d Umezu]], [[Kuniaki Koiso]], [[Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d]], [[Toshio Shiratori]]\n*20-year imprisonment:\n*:[[Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d]]\n*Died before a judicial decision was reached (due to illness or disease):\n*:[[Osami Nagano]], [[Yosuke Matsuoka]]\n\nAll imprisoned war criminals either had their sentences commuted or were released by 1958. The enshrinement was revealed to the media on April 19, 1979, and a still-ongoing controversy started in 1985.\n\n==Y\u016bsh\u016bkan War Museum==\nYasukuni Shrine operates a war museum of the [[history of Japan]] (the [[Y\u016bsh\u016bkan]]), which some observers<ref>http://www.shanghaidaily.com/Opinion/foreign-perspectives/Yushukan-museum-whitewashes-wartime-atrocities/shdaily.shtml</ref> have criticized as presenting a [[historical revisionism (political)|revisionist]] interpretation. A documentary-style propaganda video shown to museum visitors portrays Japan's conquest of [[East Asia]] during the pre-World War II period as an effort to save the region from the imperial advances of colonial [[Western world|Western powers]]. Displays portray Japan as a victim of foreign influence, especially Western undermining of trade.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The museum has no mention of any of the atrocities committed by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]], including the [[Nanking massacre]].<ref>''Black museum of Japan's war crimes'', Sunday Times, http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article549954.ece</ref>\n\n==Izokukai==\nThe political overtones of Yasukuni Shrine are attributed to two factors. One is the ideology of State Shinto, which regarded any wars waged in the name of the emperor as just and anyone who died fighting for the emperor as an {{nihongo|''eirei''|\u82f1\u970a||hero spirit}}. But another more immediate factor is the influence of various support organizations, especially the [[Japan War-Bereaved Families Association]] ({{nihongo|Izokukai|\u907a\u65cf\u4f1a}}, the largest organization representing the families of war dead from World War II.\n\nYasukuni Shrine considers the Izokukai as its '''de facto'' lay organization. The Izokukai was formerly known as the {{nihongo|Izoku K\u014dsei Renmei|\u907a\u65cf\u539a\u751f\u9023\u76df||War-Dead-Family Welfare Union}}, established in 1947. The original purpose of the Izoku K\u014dsei Renmei was \"pursuing the end of warfare, establishing global peace and world prosperity and contributing to the welfare of the humanity.\" They sought \"to provide relief and assistance to the families of those who died in the (Asia Pacific) war \". The organization provided assistance to the widows, orphans and aging parents of deceased veterans as well as lobbying the government on behalf of those families' interests. However, in 1953 the organization became a trust foundation and changed its name to Izokukai. The organization changed its main purpose to pursue \"the establishment of a peaceful Japan, the cultivation of character, and the promotion of morality\" and to \"seek to praise ''eirei'', to promote the welfare of the families of the war dead, and to seek recognition and compensation for civilian auxiliary units.\" The change, which removed the mention of international pacifism and inserted of a reference to ''eirei'', is regarded as giving a nationalist slant to the character of the organization. Chairmen of the organization have usually been members of the governing Liberal Democratic party and the organization is regarded as the informal pipeline between the LDP and the Shrine. In 1962, [[Okinori Kaya]], a militant member of the LDP and a convicted class A war criminal, was appointed chairman.\n\n==Politicians' visits==\nJapanese politicians' visits to worship at Yasukuni Shrine have resulted in controversy.\n\nThis issue first surfaced when [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] refused to visit the shrine from 1978 until his death in 1989.<ref name=\"JT1\">{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20060820pb.html |title=Notes on Yasukuni and a week that will live in infamy |accessdate=April 13, 2008 |author=Brasor, Philip  |date=August 20, 2006 |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}</ref> According to a memorandum released in 2006 kept by [[Imperial Household Agency]] [[Grand Steward]] Tomohiko Tomita, Hirohito stated that the reason he stopped visiting the shrine was because of the decision to enshrine class A war criminals.<ref name=\"JT2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/07/21/national/hirohito-visits-to-yasukuni-stopped-over-war-criminals/ |title=Hirohito visits to Yasukuni stopped over war criminals |accessdate=January 5, 2020 |date=July 21, 2006 |work=[[The Japan Times]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Junichiro Koizumi (cropped) during arrival ceremony on South Lawn of White House.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Former Japanese Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]]]]\n\nPrime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] was one of the most outspoken and controversial visitors.

The controversy has been reignited nearly every year since 1975, when [[prime minister]] [[Takeo Miki]] visited the shrine as a private individual on August 15, the day that Japan commemorates the end of World War II. The next year, his successor [[Fukuda Takeo]] visited as a private individual yet signed the visitors' book as prime minister. Several other Japanese [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]] have visited the shrine since 1979: [[Masayoshi Ohira]] in 1979; [[Zenko Suzuki]] in 1980, 1981 and 1982; [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] in 1983 and 1985 (on the latter occasion, he offered flowers which had been paid for with government money); [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] in 1992, this visit was kept secret until 1996 (he had paid a visit in 1980 before becoming Prime Minister); [[Ryutaro Hashimoto]] in 1996; and [[Junichiro Koizumi]], who visited six times (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006). Visits by Japanese prime ministers to the shrine have resulted in official condemnation by neighbouring countries since 1985, as they see it as an attempt to legitimize [[Japanese militarism|Japan's past militarism]].\n\nVisits to the shrine are also controversial in the domestic debate over the proper role of religion in Japanese government. Some [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)]] politicians insist that visits are protected by the constitutional right to freedom of religion and that it is appropriate for legislators to pay their respects to those fallen in war. However, proposals for the construction of a [[secular]] memorial, so that those wishing to honor Japan's military dead do not have to visit Yasukuni, have thus far failed, ostensibly for technical details rather than the rejection of a secular memorial. The Japanese government conducts yearly memorial services to commemorate the War in Budokan (a secular building) which is near Yasukuni shrine, so that the attendees can later visit Yasukuni Shrine privately if they so wish. The shrine itself objects to any proposal that a non-religious memorial be built, stating that \"Yasukuni Shrine must be the one and only memorial for Japan's military dead.\" Koizumi has claimed that his visits are to ensure that there will be no further wars involving Japan, causing some to interpret them as an act of remembrance rather than reverence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nOn his first visit to Japan since leaving office in February 2003, former [[President of South Korea|South Korean President]] [[Kim Dae Jung]] openly criticised Japanese politicians' visits to the shrine, and proposed that the 14 Class A war criminals be moved to a different location. He said, \"If that option is realized, I will not express opposition to visits to Yasukuni Shrine (by Koizumi or other Japanese leaders)\". Kim noted that Koizumi promised at a meeting in [[Shanghai]] in 2001 to consider building a new memorial facility that could replace Yasukuni Shrine and enable anyone to worship there without hesitation.\n\nThe government of the People's Republic of China has been the most vocal critic of the shrine and some Japanese observers have suggested that the issue of Yasukuni Shrine is just as heavily tied to China's internal politics as it is to the historical conduct of Japan's military and the perceived degree of its remorse for its actions. They state that tolerance on the part of [[Communist Party of China]] authorities for large-scale public protests in mainland China against the shrine contrasts strongly with the authority exercised against any kind of domestic political dissent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\n==Debate in Japan==\nOne controversy of political visits to the shrine is the constitutionality of visits by the Prime Minister. In the [[Constitution of Japan]], the [[Separation of church and state|separation of state and religion]] is explicit. Because the clause was written for the express purpose of preventing the return of State Shintoism, many question the constitutionality of the Prime Minister visiting Yasukuni Shrine. Often the first question Japanese Prime Ministers are asked by journalists after a visit is, \"Are you here as a private person or as Prime Minister?\" In addition, whether the Prime Minister has signed the visitors' book indicating the position of signatory as {{nihongo|''shijin''|\u79c1\u4eba||private person}} or {{nihongo|''shush\u014d''|\u9996\u76f8||Prime Minister}} is diligently reported. All Prime Ministers have so far stated that their visit was private. However, although some leave the signature section blank or sign it as ''shijin'', others sign it as ''shush\u014d''. The issue is somewhat different than that of visits by the German Chancellor to the Holocaust Memorial, which are explicitly made in the context of a state visit. Prime Minister Koizumi recently gave a somewhat cryptic answer, stating that he visited the shrine as Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister of Japan. Some consider such statement as a move towards making visits somewhat official; others consider that it is pointing out that the whole issue of ''shijin'' vs ''shush\u014d'' is somewhat meaningless. Some journals and news reports, such as one made by Kyodo News Agency on August 15, 2006, question whether in the case of Koizumi's visits, which are consistently claimed by Koizumi to be private, can be considered individual in nature when they are part of a campaign pledge, which in nature is political. Currently, most of the Japanese public and most jurists have agreed that there have been no constitutional violations yet.\n\nShinzo Abe, 15 of the 18 members of his cabinet, and 289 of 480 Diet members are affiliated to the openly [[historical revisionism|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]], which advocates the restoration of [[Monarchism|monarchy]] and [[State Shinto]], negates Japanese war crimes, and recommends the revision of the Constitution and school textbooks as well as visits by Prime Ministers to the Shrine.<ref name=\"2014 reshuffle\">\"[http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2994558 Abe\u2019s reshuffle promotes right-wingers]\" (Korea Joongang Daily \u2013 2014/09/05)</ref><ref name=kato>{{cite news |author=Norihiro Kato |title=Tea Party Politics in Japan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/opinion/tea-party-politics-in-japan.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 12, 2014}}</ref> The chief priest of the shrine, Yasuhisa Tokugawa (also the great-grandson of [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], the last sh\u014dgun), is a member of Nippon Kaigi's representative committee.<ref>Nippon Kaigi website</ref>\n\nThe views expressed by Yasukuni Shrine through its museum and website are also controversial. Both sites make it clear that Yasukuni Shrine does not regard the conduct of Japan during World War II as an act of aggression but rather matter of self-defence and a heroic effort to repel [[European Imperialism]]. Defenders of (private) visits by the Prime Minister point out that, regardless, there is no other venue to pay respect to the fallen in Japan, so that Prime Minister as well as the large number of Japanese who visit the shrine have no choice. Moreover, most people (including the Prime Minister) who visit Yasukuni deliberately avoid entering the museum so that the visit remains religious rather than political.\n\nA number of proposals have been made to alleviate controversy. One is to somehow \"remove\" the controversial spirits and place them in a different location so that visits to Yasukuni Shrine would not be as politically charged. This proposal has been strongly pushed by China and Korea. The Japanese government cannot force Yasukuni Shrine to do so (due to the separation of church and state). Moreover, the shrine is adamant that once a kami has been housed at the shrine, it cannot be separated. The one method which is suggested as theologically valid is to abolish the entire enshrinement, then repeat the entire enshrinement rite of kami since the Boshin War without including the A class war criminals. Some argue that selective abolishment of enshrinement is technically possible, as there are several precedents of selective de-enshrinement in the Tokugawa era. The Shinto processes of ''[[bunrei]]'' and ''[[kanj\u014d]]'' exist specifically to remove a kami from its shrine and re-enshrine it elsewhere, but typically leave the kami at the originating shrine intact and unchanged.<ref>[[Karen Ann Smyers|Smyers, Karen Ann]].

Critics point out that groups representing families of the war dead express no interest in such a memorial, preferring Yasukuni Shrine. Furthermore, the Japanese government already conducts yearly secular commemoration services at the [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] for the families of soldiers killed in World War II. Afterwards, these families usually make private visits to Yasukuni Shrine, which is located within walking distance. Since the proposed memorial site is geographically distant, were the ceremony to be relocated to the proposed memorial site such visits would be made more difficult. A number of families of the names listed at the shrine have indicated that the controversy is disturbing the peaceful rest of their dead family members and that they wish to pay homage to them without controversy and media attention.\n\nThere is in fact a memorial to the Japanese (unidentified) war dead within walking distance of Yasukuni, called {{nihongo|[[Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery]]|\u5343\u9ce5\u30f6\u6df5\u6226\u6ca1\u8005\u5893\u82d1}}. This could be used as an alternative by Japanese politicians to pay their respects to those who died during the war.\n\n==Textbook controversy==\nIn May 2005, in the aftermath of [[2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations|anti-Japanese protests]] over the [[Japanese history textbooks controversy]], Chinese Vice-Premier [[Wu Yi (politician)|Wu Yi]] cut short her visit to Japan and flew home before a planned meeting with Japanese Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]]. This was widely interpreted as a reaction to a statement by Koizumi the day before Wu's arrival that foreign countries should not interfere in Japan's domestic affairs, including the Yasukuni issue. Wu's visit was meant to improve strained relations between the two countries following the textbook controversy, and she had planned to ask Koizumi to stop his visits to the shrine.\n\n==Removal of the names==\nIn June 2005, a senior LDP member proposed moving the 14 Class A war criminals to a separate site. Shinto priests refused this proposal, quoting Japan's [[freedom of religion]] laws under the [[Japanese Constitution]].\n\nAlso in the same month, a group claiming to represent [[Taiwanese aborigine]]s led by politician [[Kao Chin Su-mei]] attempted to visit Yasukuni Shrine with the sponsorship of the Japan Catholic Council for Justice and Peace. Their intention was to peacefully request the removal of their relatives from the shrine, and to pray for the return of their ancestors' souls. Request to perform religious rites within the Yasukuni property were refused and they were blocked from entering Yasukuni by Japanese protesters and police. A demonstration was organized by a group of more than one hundred Japanese [[nationalist]]s to block them from the shrine and prevent them from performing spirit-calling religious rituals within the property the Shrine objected. Japanese police allowed the protesters to remain on the grounds because their entrance to the shrine was not objected by the shrine however they blocked the Taiwanese from leaving their buses, citing measures to prevent clashes between the two groups. After about an hour and a half, the Taiwanese group gave up their attempt. Kao Chin Su-mei and her group reportedly received death threats related to their visit, prompting the Taiwanese government to request Japanese authorities ensure her safety while in Japan.<ref>[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/detail.asp?ID=63832&GRP=B Lawmaker and aborigines forbidden to visit Yasukuni]</ref>\n\n==Prime ministerial visits==\n\n===Junichiro Koizumi===\nPrime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] made widely publicized annual visits to the shrine while in office. The official position of the Japanese government was that he visited as an individual citizen \"to express respect and gratitude to the many people who lost their lives in the war,\" and not for the sake of gratifying war criminals or to dispute the results of the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic Position of the Government of Japan Regarding Prime Minister Koizumi's Visits to Yasukuni Shrine|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/postwar/yasukuni/position.html|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|accessdate=December 26, 2013}}</ref> Koizumi made his final visit as prime minister on August 15, 2006, shortly before his retirement.<ref>[http://mdn.mainichi-msn.co.jp/national/news/20060815p2a00m0na001000c.html]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref>\n\nOfficials in the [[People's Republic of China]] responded to Koizumi's 2005 visit by canceling a scheduled visit to China by [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese Foreign Minister]] [[Nobutaka Machimura]] in protest.<ref>[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20051019a1.htm China cancels meeting with Machimura]</ref>\n\nKoizumi's visits also provoked negative reactions in the United States. [[Henry Hyde]], a World War II veteran serving as the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on International Relations, wrote a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert in May 2006 urging that Koizumi only be allowed to speak at the U.S. Capitol if he agreed not to visit Yasukuni on the following anniversary of Japan's surrender.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nakata|first=Hiroko|title=Bid to address Congress has Yasukuni proviso|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/05/17/news/bid-to-address-congress-has-yasukuni-proviso/#.Ur2eQNxdUXE|accessdate=December 27, 2013|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=May 17, 2006}}</ref> Hyde's Democratic counterpart [[Tom Lantos]] also pressed for an end to the visits, stating that \"paying one's respect to war criminals is morally bankrupt and unworthy of a great nation such as Japan.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Sheldrick|first=Aaron|title=U.S. Lawmakers Urge Next Japan PM to Avoid Yasukuni|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=arbbcpF0OhQA|accessdate=December 26, 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=September 15, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Shinzo Abe===\nKoizumi's successor [[Shinzo Abe]] visited the shrine several times before and after his first stint as prime minister, but did not visit at all during his first term as prime minister from September 2006 to September 2007.

His son, [[Emperor Akihito]], has not visited the shrine since becoming emperor (and has since continued after [[2019 Japanese imperial transition|abdication in 2019]]), instead choosing to send a lesser member of the royal household. It is unknown if [[Naruhito|Emperor Naruhito]] (Sh\u014dwa's grandson) will visit the shrine or not or as an alternative, would continue to send a lesser member in the household as his predecessor did. On July 20, 2006, ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]'' front-paged an article about the discovery of a memorandum detailing the reason Emperor [[Hirohito]] stopped visiting Yasukuni. The memorandum, kept by former chief of [[Imperial Household Agency]] Tomohiko Tomita, confirms for the first time the enshrinement of [[Class A War Criminal]]s such as [[Yosuke Matsuoka]] and [[Toshio Shiratori]] was the reason. Tomita wrote down the contents of his conversations with the emperor in his diaries and notebooks in detail. He left 12 diaries (1975\u20131986) and some 20 notebooks (1986\u20131997).\n\nAccording to the memorandum, the emperor expressed his strong displeasure in 1988 at the decision made by Yasukuni Shrine to include [[Class A war criminal]]s in the list of war dead honored there by saying, \"At some point, Class-A criminals became enshrined, including Matsuoka and Shiratori. I heard Tsukuba acted cautiously\", Tsukuba is believed to refer to Fujimaro Tsukuba, the former chief Yasukuni priest at the time, who decided not to enshrine the war criminals despite receiving in 1966, the list of war dead compiled by the government containing their names. \"What's on the mind of Matsudaira's son, who is the current head priest?\". \"Matsudaira had a strong wish for peace, but the child didn't know the parent's heart. That's why I have not visited the shrine since. This is my heart\", Matsudaira is believed to refer to Yoshitami Matsudaira, who was the grand steward of Imperial Household immediately after the end of World War II. His son, Nagayoshi, succeeded Fujimaro Tsukuba as the chief priest of Yasukuni and he decided to enshrine the war criminals in 1978.<ref>http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20060721a1.html</ref> {{ill|Nagayoshi Matsudaira|ja|\u677e\u5e73\u6c38\u82b3}} died the previous year (July 10, 2005), which is speculated as a reason for the release of the memo.\n\nFor journalist Masanori Yamaguchi, who analyzed the \"memo\" and comments made by the emperor in his first-ever press conference in 1975, his evasive and opaque attitude about his own responsibility for the war and the fact he said that the bombing of Hiroshima \"[[shikata ga nai|could not be helped]]\",<ref>\"-Does your majesty feel responsibility for the war itself, including the opening of hostilities ? -I can't answer that kind of question because I haven't thoroughly studied the literature in this field, and so I don't really appreciate the nuances of your words.\" H. Bix, ''Hirohito and the making of modern Japan'', 200, p.676</ref> could mean that he was afraid that the enshrinement would reignite the debate over his own responsibility for the war.<ref>''Yasukuni and a week that will live in infamy'', http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20060820pb.html</ref>\n\nAnother commentator stated that there are three immediate impacts of the memo.<ref>http://www.janjan.jp/government/0607/0607228359/1.php</ref> Firstly, the explanation of the suspension of the imperial visit offered by the right is no longer sustainable. Those on the right of Japanese politics had attributed the reason for the emperor's suspension of visits to the emergence of controversy over constitutional validity of the visit by the prime minister or the emperor in regard to the separation of state and religion. This claim is no longer valid in the light of the revelation. Secondly, Yasukuni and its lay organisation, Izokukai probably have to make alterations to their stance somewhat. Both organisations have clearly expressed their wish for a visit by the current emperor. Recent rulings by the Supreme Court have also indicated that visits by the prime minister or the emperor are constitutional. However, it is now clear that the controversy over the enshrinement of class A war criminals has to be resolved. Moreover, though the emperor is the highest authority of Shinto, he does not exercise direct control of any Shinto shrine including Yasukuni. However, Yasukuni ideology is clearly in favour of the pre-war arrangement in which the emperor was the official head of Shinto. Thirdly, the revelation clearly shifts the focus of the controversy to the enshrinement of class A war criminals, meaning that the issue of the separation between the state and the church is no longer the main focus. The public opinion is split between those on the left who advocate the removal and those on the right who nonetheless object to the removal.\n\n==New memorial==\nOn October 28, 2005, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)]] and the [[Democratic Party of Japan|Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)]] agreed to set up a cross-party \"group for pushing forward the establishment of a national memorial facility\" to bring about the foundation of a secular war memorial dedicated only to \"ordinary\" soldiers. This would replace Yasukuni Shrine as the home of Japan's war dead.

No breakdown of who owned this property exists.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=206, 209}}\n\nThe village had three public houses: The Butchers Arms (demolished 2009\u201310), The Ferryboat, and the Ring o' Bells which stood on the site of the present senior citizens' bungalows. A village hall makes use of the former school building. The [[St Peter's Church, Laneham|Parish Church of St. Peter]] remains open, and is a [[grade I listed]] building. Various parts were constructed in the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. It was restored in 1891, and the porch was renovated in 1932. The church is the focal point of [[Church Laneham]]; it is built on a small knoll above the river and contains a large, elaborate alabaster memorial to Ellis Markham and his son Jervase, which dates from 1636.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233511 |desc=Church of St Peter, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nA small, disused Methodist chapel still stands in the village. A Laneham Methodist congregation was first recorded in the Society Book of the Epworth Circuit in 1799.<ref>{{cite work |title=Proceedings of the Wesley Historical Society |volume=Vol 36|url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/whs/36-2.pdf |editor-first=Rev John C |editor-last=Bowmer |date=June 1967 |p=59}}</ref> The chapel was erected in 1834, and renovations to it were carried out in 1884.<ref>{{cite web |title=Suggested Laneham Heritage Trails |publisher=Nottinghamshire County Council |p=1 |url=http://laneham.org.uk/LanehamLeaflet2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nLaneham had a school in Tudor times since biographical records indicate that Gervase Markham attended it for four years before going to Cambridge. There was no school in the 1860s, when local children were having to go to Dunham, as is the case now.\n\n==Charities==\nInformation about village charities is displayed in the church and hall. The Laneham poor charity has existed since at least 1700. In that year four Laneham men \u2018surrendered\u2019 a close of about two acres, the revenues of this being used to feed the poor of the parish. Every three years this land was put up for rental on Easter Monday, yielding around \u00a311 6s a year in 1827. The money was paid to the Overseer of the Poor who then commissioned a village baker to provide two shillings worth of bread every Sunday, to be given out as penny and twopenny loaves at the Church. This only cost \u00a35-5-0d a year, so the rest was used to buy coal for the poor.{{sfn |Charities |1828 |p=447}}\n\nDuring the 1820s the Overseer was also receiving 13s from the occupier of three closes in Laneham which belonged to the Vicar of Applethorpe, but no one knew how this arose. More money came from the bequest of William Skelton, who had left \u00a320 for the poor of Laneham. Half of this had been \u2018vested\u2019 in a Rampton farmer, Elizabeth Draper, who paid 10 shillings a year interest; the other half was vested in John Popple, who paid nothing until his death in 1815 when Mrs Anne Warrener took the capital and started to pay out. A woman called Sarah Fillingham also left a close called Clay Half to provide 20 shillings a year for distribution to \u2018honest widows.\u2019{{sfn |Charities |1828 |pp=447-448}}\n\nThe population of the village in 1811 was 337, and in 1815, 25 of these were officially \"poor\", representing 7.42 percent of the population. This was slightly higher than the 6.96 percent average for Nottinghamshire at the time.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |p=277}}\n\n==Historical events==\nThe archbishops of Canterbury held Laneham Manor from an early date, certainly by the time of the Domesday book when 100 acres of pasture at Newton were said to belong to the Archbishop's manor. One who seems to have benefited was William of Laneham who was on the Archbishop's staff in the early 1200s and became Archdeacon of Durham by 1224. William was Prebendary of [[Bole]] by 1212 and Archdeacon of Durham by 1224 but in October 1243 'some men were imprisoned at York under suspicion of being concerned in his death.' <ref>Fast Ecclesiae Anglicanae, vol 6/26</ref>\n\nKing Henry III stayed at Laneham on 3 October 1255 <ref>Close Rolls, Henry III, 1255</ref> and King Edward III on 15-16 April 1303<ref>Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward I, vol 5, p.83-7</ref>.\n\nThomas de Corbridge, Archbishop of York, decided to spend the summer months in his residence at Laneham in July 1303 \u2013 to which he presumably travelled by water. However, while staying in the village he became ill and died on 22 September. He was known as a hard-working archbishop and was still handling his business until five days before his death. His body was taken to Southwell for burial, presumably again by water, with most of his final journey being via the Trent. The archdiocese of York properties of Laneham, Scrooby and Askham were leased to Samuel Sandys by his father, Archbishop Sandys, just before his death in 1588 and reputedly on advantageous terms. The family retained an interest in the Laneham manor for several generations and in 1663 it was held by John Sandys 'of Laneham' and Francis Sandys 'of Scrooby.'<ref>I. J. Gentles and W. J. Sheils, Confiscation and Restoration: The Archbishopric Estates and\nthe Civil War (York: Borthwick Institute of Historical Research, 1981), 2.</ref> There are old references to the remains of a moat from the palace, but these were apparently ploughed out in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1315 the people of Dunham on Trent were ordered to surrender those who had taken the Archbishop of York's swans from Laneham.<ref>A Calendar of the Register of Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York ..., Volume 11,p.87.</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Another known event in Laneham is one of the first legal cases involving a \u2018carrier\u2019, i.e. someone responsible for transporting another person or their goods. In 1346 William, a ferryman at Laneham, took a man named Richard, his horse and his goods across the river by ferry. However, he only took them part of the way, because William threw the horse and goods into the river. Possibly this might have been as the ferry was overloaded and they were all at risk of drowning (as in another case a couple of years later) but we know William\u2019s conduct \u2018inflicted other enormities to the grave damage and against the peace\u2019. Damages to Richard\u2019s property amounted to 40 marks.{{sfn |Palmer |1994 |p=174}}\n\nLittle is yet been found about Laneham having a role in civil administration, but it is known that at least one major 'trial' was held in the village. Thomas Hancock was the Puritan vicar of Headon from 1605 to 1623, arriving from Elkesley. In 1620 he was fined \"6d for riot\", at a special sessions in Laneham to try 26 people indicted for riotous assault. Hancock had something of a record for challenging the establishment, having also been one of the Puritan curates sheltered by the Brewsters at Scrooby in the 1690s when he had conducted the apparently illegal wedding of another cleric, Robert Southworth.\n\nAn old family history of the Markham family ('Markham Memorials vol 1' by Sir Clements Markham, 1913) sheds interesting light on the two Markhams who kneel facing the east in Laneham church, and have done so for hundreds of years.\n\nAt the front is Ellis Markham (c1515-1578) who was the grandson of a famous Lord Chief Justice. He had a career as an administrator, both with the Duchy of Lancaster-based around Ripon and in the household of the Archbishop of York. In 1536 he was working for Archbishop Lee and played a minor role in organising matters during the Lincolnshire Rebellion against the policies of Henry VIII. But by 1547 he was described as being in the household of Queen Catherine Parr which would indicate strong Protestant leanings. \nHe was elected an MP in 1555-7 but Markham achieved some notoriety when Mary I gave him the job of investigating the financial affairs of the disgraced Archbishop Holgate. He gathered in all sorts of treasure and finery at Cawood \u2013 to the extent that the next archbishop under Queen Elizabeth tried to sue him for damages.\n\nEllis Markham had two sons \u2013 Gervase and Jerome. The boys apparently went to school in Laneham, and then to Cambridge \u2013 Jerome arriving there at the age of 16 in 1576. However, by the 1590s the Markhams were embroiled in a bitter dispute with a ruffian named George Noel, and Noel called the Markhams out for a duel.\n\nThis was at Edward Stanhope's house, probably at Shelford east of Nottingham \u2013 the Stanhopes were earls of Chesterfield eventually. Jerome accepted the challenge although Edmund Elvois said, 'Alas, Jerome is a very young man and without experience in any fray.' They went out into the fields and Noel attacked Jerome, breaking his sword; with his opponent defenceless, Noel proceeded to kill him in an act which many saw as murder. He was buried in Nottingham. Edmund Elvois may well have been the Askham man whose name was usually spelt 'Helwys' \u2013 and father of [[Thomas Helwys]] the Baptist pioneer who paid for the 'Pilgrims' to go to Holland. Noel was a braggart and a bully, with a whole string of local quarrels including with George Lassells at Sturton. Soon afterwards someone spoke up for Noel at a meeting in the archbishop's palace at Southwell, nearly causing another quarrel as the Markhams reacted angrily.\n\nJerome's brother Gervase lived on but he lived anything but a good life \u2013 with a reputation for seducing wenches and stockpiling treasure. Gervase had some success as a soldier and returned home to live mainly at Dunham on Trent. He was known to be the 'gallant' of the Countess of Shrewsbury, a term that was clearly meant to imply more than knightly devotion. He was described as 'a proper handsome gentleman, and of great courage.\u2019\n\nIn 1616 Markham was involved in somewhat scandalous legal dispute with Lord Darcy, following an incident with the noble Lord's dog whilst they were both at a hunting event. After this he got involved in a dispute between Sir John Holles and the Stanhope family, as a result of which Holles accused him of 'lying like a villain.' Markham took this as a challenge to a duel, which he offered to fight in Worksop Park \u2013 territory of one of Holles' enemies, so Holles declined. Markham took this as a 'refusal'. However the two men met by chance in Sherwood Forect and Holles declared he would 'spoil' Markham; they duelled with rapiers, and Holles ran through Markham 'through the middle of the guts and up to the hilt, and out behind toward the small of the back.\u2019\n\nThis incident almost led to full-scale battle between Holles' men and those of Markham's friends, but Markham survived. Apparently he rashly swore to never eat supper or take the sacrament until he had gained revenge \u2013 but never did manage to! Despite his poor reputation, in 1625 Markham was Sheriff of Nottinghamshire with lands at Laneham and Dunham. While he was away from his home at Dunham one day, two youths who were reputed to be his 'bastards' robbed his house of property worth \u00a35000 \u2013 at least \u00a3800,000 today. Perhaps to evade capture, the youths buried their treasure in Gamston Woods. In 1627, when he was elderly and bedridden, one of the Holles family ordered his home to be searched for a fugitive catholic priest. This was widely interpreted as the action of someone denouncing Markham for reasons of a grudge, and the vicar of Dunham certified that he had routinely attended his parish church.\n\nHe cannot have been that ill in 1625 as he was still alive in 1636, though living the life of a miser. He was spending \u00a340 a year though his income from land was \u00a3800 and he had \u00a340,000 in money \u2013 so a substantial millionaire in today's values. Markham had no family and refused to acknowledge any of his extramarital offspring, so spent it on no-one. Despite this he refused to pay the king's new tax, Ship Money, and was ordered to be arrested.  The vicar had to certify that he was too ill to travel to London, reporting that he had taken communion in his bed for many years \u2013 so perhaps he had given up on his vengeance vow!\nHe died in 1637, old and crippled, and was buried in Laneham church beneath an effigy of himself as a young and handsome man that had been there many years already \u2013 having been presumably commissioned by his father.\n\nIn the Stuart era William Tirwhitt (or Tyrwhitt) was a landowner in the village. He died in 1642 and by 1648 his Laneham lands were sequestered due to his being 'a delinquent Papist' and a 'Papist in arms' but they were restored after the Restoration.<ref>Calendar: Committee for Compounding, Part 3 September 1648, published 1891</ref>\n\nThere also seem to have been a few Quakers in the village. In 1689 Gervase Harrison was prosecuted at the ecclesiastical court following an action by Richard Bradley, vicar of Laneham, for not paying the sum of 6d each for three communicants in his household. Harrison did not appear to answer the case and was committed to Nottingham Gaol for nine weeks, including two weeks in one of its nefarious dungeons. IN 1707 John Parker was prosecuted for non-payment of tithes, a typical Quaker offence.\n\nIn 1810 the church tower was rebuilt after being struck by lightning and four bells added at a cost of \u00a3800. According to a Church of England report at the time, efforts to raise funds for this locally failed 'as the parishioners are too poor.'\n\nAccording to the Notts Guardian in 1865 there was a grave in the churchyard for James Penant, a blacksmith, who died on 27 May 1763, with the inscription:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:My tongs and hammer I\u2019ve declined\n:My bellows they have lost their wind\n:My fires extinct my forge decayed\n:And in the dust my vice is laid\n:My coals are spent my iron gone\n:My nails are drove my work is done.\n{{Refend}}\nOnly a few parts of this text are still legible.\n\nThe poverty of Laneham\u2019s former curate was reported in the news in 1842 when an income tax return was sent back from the village with the following verse attached:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:There\u2019s nothing here but poverty,\n:Scottish rags and hunger;\n:If Sir Robert Peel has sent you here\n:Surely it was in anger.\n{{Refend}}\nThe writer was Rev. John Irvine, a Scottish man who had taken on the curacy of both Laneham and Rampton for the \u2018shamefully small\u2019 stipend of \u00a350 a year. At that time it was quite common for a parish to have a vicar or rector \u2013 usually well-connected \u2013 who drew most of the income and then paid a small portion to a less well-connected clergyman to act as curate and do most of the work. After a year or two Irvine had to give up the role at Rampton (we do not know why) and was reduced to just the Laneham role for which he was paid 10&nbsp;shillings (\u00a30.50) a week \u2013 so his pay was little more than that of an agricultural labourer. When Laneham\u2019s rector died, Irvine felt he had a strong claim on the senior position and petitioned the patron of the benefice, the Dean and Chapter of York, for the place \u2013 without success.\n\nTo make ends meet, Irvine was forced to open a parish school where he could charge parents for the education of their children, but clearly this produced only a small income for him.\n\nSome of the vicars of Laneham were also interesting. In 1764 John Welch was \"not able to do any duty, being a little insane\". In 1842 Edmund Wallis died, having been vicar for 60 years; this perhaps explains some aspects of Irvine's story.\n\nA few minor crimes have received press coverage giving an insight into Laneham life in the past. In 1839 two women \u2018had words\u2019 in the street and then took to blows in a \u2018desperate encounter\u2019, which ended with one at death\u2019s door apparently. In 1843 at harvest the locals mixed with Irish itinerant workers in one of the village inns, but hostility was bubbling under the surface; Charles Parr, Thomas Lane and other local \u2018ruffians\u2019 were found \u2018absolutely roasting\u2019 a young Irish reaper on the fire of the inn until its landlord intervened.\n\n==Local boys made good==\nLaneham boys George Warriner and Enoch Hodgkinson left the village in the later 1700s for a career in London, where they became successful retail drapers with a shop at 124 New Bond Street. In 1788 two women were transported to Australia for seven years after being caught \u2018shoplifting\u2019 from the \u2018expensive\u2019 shop they ran.\n\nGeorge (1745-1822) was born in Laneham to parents who married in the village in 1739. In London, he bought a nice house in Lisson Grove. Having made his fortune, Warriner then reinvented himself as a country gentleman. He married a lady named Elizabeth and bought a small estate at Bloxham in 1797, Oxfordshire. In 1812 the area was visited by the famous agricultural author Arthur Young, who was impressed by the modern farming techniques in use on the estate. Warriner had a son, named Enoch Hodgkinson Warriner after his friend, who went to Oxford and became a clergyman at Footscray in Kent; Mrs Warriner\u2019s letters to her son are preserved in the National Archives. Bloxham stayed in the Warriner family until 1915 but his great grandson Henry inherited the Weston Park estate of the Earl of Camperdown, for whom he had been gamekeeper. Perhaps George\u2019s most enduring memorial is actually the secondary school in Bloxham, which is called the Warriner School.\n\nEnoch is less easy to trace but he had an active business career as well as the drapery side. He was a director of the Hand in Hand Fire Office, an insurance company, and owned properties at Blackfriars Bridge and Child\u2019s Hill, Middlesex. He was living \u2018above the shop\u2019 in 1773 and later in Stamford Street. Both he and George were supporters of the Lock Charity Hospital in London. He died in May 1810 at Stamford Street, aged 77. Hodkinson seems to have been a noted supporter of various charities including for poor clergymen and imprisoned debtors.\n\n==Suspected murder case==\nLaneham hit the headlines in December 1845 with the death of farmer Robert Draper. Draper, the oldest son of a wealthy Rampton farmer, had been born in 1776 and moved to the village after the breakdown of his marriage. He married in 1812 but very soon split from his wife; his wife sued for restitution of conjugal rights in 1838 but lost the case - it having taken her a very long time to bring one! (The Jurist, Volume 1, p.&nbsp;872) Most of the farm was left to Draper\u2019s younger brother although he clearly had some independent means and eventually bought himself 70 acres, farmed with the help of a labourer named in The Times as Hood (also reported as 'Troop').\n\nDraper was an eccentric collector of old coins, swords, pistols and watches. \u201cFor anything that might take his fancy, he was not particular as to the price he might pay,\u201d The Times noted after his death. At 8pm every night he would lock himself into his sitting room with his chronometers and a book, staying up all night until the villagers got up at 6am; if he heard a noise outside, he would fire his pistols through an \u2018aperture\u2019 in the window.\n\nIn 1844 he took in a servant girl, Harriet Trevor. She it was who reported that she had got up one morning to find all the doors locked, but had spied him on his hands and knees in the sitting room. She and Hood lay him down, but took several days to summon Mr Oliver, the surgeon. Oliver could do little to stop his death, but did notice he had bumped his head.\n\nDraper was buried in Laneham church, after which the trustees of his will noticed property missing. By this time Harriet Trevor had gone home, but she was traced and her possessions searched \u2013 she had \u00a340, an enormous sum for a servant girl. A gold chain was found stitched 'inside her stays.' She confessed that she and Hood had robbed Draper, so Hood\u2019s cottage was searched and more property found hidden in a stocking. Then a witness recalled Draper\u2019s head had seemed \u2018soft and boggy\u2019 on one side. It was decided to exhume him.\n\nThe body was dug up and placed in \u2018an empty tenement\u2019 near the church while the coroner\u2019s inquest \u2013 with a jury \u2013 met at the Butcher\u2019s Arms. Viewing the corpse was unpleasant \u2013 \u201cthe stench was awful and the colour of the face as black as that of an Indian. The beard had grown considerably and was covered with a kind of blue mould,\u201d The Times noted. The surgeon told the inquest that marks to the head could have been made with a spade or the blunt end of an axe. Perhaps fearing to place an accusation that could lead to the gallows against people they knew, the jury recorded a view that \u2018there was no satisfactory evidence as to cause of death.\u2019 Hood and Trevor were remarkably lucky to escape with a charge of robbery.\n\n==Laneham drainage==\nIn December 1768, a group of landowners from this part of Nottinghamshire asked the civil engineer [[John Grundy, Jr.]] to investigate the possibility of draining some {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} of land on the west bank of the [[River Trent]], stretching from Laneham to [[West Burton, Nottinghamshire|West Burton]]. He was accompanied by Samuel Goodhand, his clerk, on the initial site visit, and proposed three components to a solution. The first was a catchwater drain, which would intercept the streams flowing into the area at its western edge, and discharge into the Trent at West Burton. To prevent high water levels in the river flooding the land, he proposed a {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} flood bank, which would run from Laneham to West Burton. Finally, rainwater would be collected by a Mother Drain and numerous side drains, which would discharge into the Trent through an outfall sluice at Sturton Cow Pasture.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |pp=281\u2013282}}</ref>\n\nThe landowners liked the plans, asking Grundy to produce detailed proposals, and to supervise the obtaining of an [[Act of Parliament]] to authorise the work. Assisted by the surveyor George Kelk and a colleague called David Buffery, who checked the levels, he spent six weeks producing his plans, which he presented in February 1769. He estimated that {{convert|5900|acre|ha}} would be improved by the scheme, which would cost \u00a32,700 for the catchwater drain, \u00a36,800 for the bank along the river from Laneham to West Burton, \u00a32,400 for the Mother Drain, with an additional \u00a31,200 for the side drains, and \u00a3900 for the sluice at Sturton, making a total of \u00a314,000. He spent most of March and April in London, to ensure the bill passed through Parliament, and received \u00a3329 for his work up to this point. A detailed plan of the area at a scale of 1:21,120 (3 miles to the inch) was published.<ref name=skempton282>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=282}}</ref>\n\nThe Act appointed Drainage Commissioners, who met for the first time on 29 May 1769. Grundy became the engineer for the scheme, Buffery was the surveyor of works, and Kelk was the land surveyor. Grundy's plans for Sturton Sluice show a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} waterway. Brickwork and masonry were erected by local contractors, while the major excavations were handled by Dyson and Pinkerton. Grundy changed the plans somewhat, as he decided that a drainage mill would be needed at Sturton. This had a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} [[scoop wheel]], and was completed in April 1770 by Henry Bennett from [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], at a cost of \u00a3458. The works were finished on time in May 1772, with the final cost amounting to around \u00a315,000. Grundy visited the works at least seven times to ensure that his specifications were being met.<ref name=skempton282/> The only known details of the scheme are preserved in Grundy's ''Report Books'', which he spent the last few years of his life preparing. Running to 12 volumes and 4,000 pages, they were lost, but were re-discovered in the library at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1988.

The eastern boundary is formed by the [[River Trent]]. Prior to 1884, the parish included {{convert|155|acre|ha}} of land used for parture on the eastern bank of the Trent, but most of this was transferred to the parish of [[Kettlethorpe, Lincolnshire|Kettlethorpe]].<ref>{{harvnb |Workgroup |2008 |p=23}}</ref> Communication to the east was once easier, as a ferry crossed the river here until 1922.<ref>{{harvnb |Workgroup |2008 |p=7}}</ref> The ferry had a very long history, since a list of stock held by the manor in 1388 included two gangways, which were used by passengers boarding the ferry.<ref>{{harvnb |Thirsk |1991 |p=68}}</ref> In earlier times the parish suffered some flooding from the Trent and the village beck, but the situation was improved by an Act of 1768\u20139 which set up drainage commissioners who were to protect Laneham and several other villages from flooding and improve the drainage of the land.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThere are a number of [[listed building]]s in the village, including Manor Farmhouse, with three bays and two storeys, built in the early nineteenth century,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1276573 |desc=Manor Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> and Binge Farmhouse, with five bays and two storeys, together with a basement and garret, built in the middle eighteenth century.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233547 |desc=Binge Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Willow Tree Cottage is a single-storeyed eighteenth-century building with three bays and an attic,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233548 |desc=Willow Tree Cottage, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> while Willow Tree Farmhouse is an L-shaped building, consisting of a seventeenth-century gable-ended wing and a nineteenth-century wing.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233549 |desc=Willow Tree Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> As a result of the influence of the [[enclosure movement]], the village prospered, and this is reflected in the substantial farmhouses and the well-ordered field system surrounding the village.{{sfn |Workgroup |2006 |p=7}} Laneham was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1772, the 12th year of [[George III of England|George III]]'s reign; the enclosure involved 1,073 of the parish's {{convert|1589|acre|km2}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Enclosure was first mentioned in October 1767, but it was another five years until an Act was obtained.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=142, 172}} There was local opposition to the idea of enclosure, but it is unclear how many people were involved, as the opposition is listed as property on which it was assessed, and consisted of 9 [[messuage]]s and cottages, 83 acres of enclosed ground, 129 acres of open arable and meadow, and 52 beastgates. No breakdown of who owned this property exists.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=206, 209}}\n\nThe village had three public houses: The Butchers Arms (demolished 2009\u201310), The Ferryboat, and the Ring o' Bells which stood on the site of the present senior citizens' bungalows. A village hall makes use of the former school building. The [[St Peter's Church, Laneham|Parish Church of St. Peter]] remains open, and is a [[grade I listed]] building. Various parts were constructed in the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. It was restored in 1891, and the porch was renovated in 1932. The church is the focal point of [[Church Laneham]]; it is built on a small knoll above the river and contains a large, elaborate alabaster memorial to Ellis Markham and his son Jervase, which dates from 1636.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233511 |desc=Church of St Peter, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nA small, disused Methodist chapel still stands in the village. A Laneham Methodist congregation was first recorded in the Society Book of the Epworth Circuit in 1799.<ref>{{cite work |title=Proceedings of the Wesley Historical Society |volume=Vol 36|url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/whs/36-2.pdf |editor-first=Rev John C |editor-last=Bowmer |date=June 1967 |p=59}}</ref> The chapel was erected in 1834, and renovations to it were carried out in 1884.<ref>{{cite web |title=Suggested Laneham Heritage Trails |publisher=Nottinghamshire County Council |p=1 |url=http://laneham.org.uk/LanehamLeaflet2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nLaneham had a school in Tudor times since biographical records indicate that Gervase Markham attended it for four years before going to Cambridge. There was no school in the 1860s, when local children were having to go to Dunham, as is the case now.\n\n==Charities==\nInformation about village charities is displayed in the church and hall. The Laneham poor charity has existed since at least 1700. In that year four Laneham men \u2018surrendered\u2019 a close of about two acres, the revenues of this being used to feed the poor of the parish. Every three years this land was put up for rental on Easter Monday, yielding around \u00a311 6s a year in 1827. The money was paid to the Overseer of the Poor who then commissioned a village baker to provide two shillings worth of bread every Sunday, to be given out as penny and twopenny loaves at the Church. This only cost \u00a35-5-0d a year, so the rest was used to buy coal for the poor.{{sfn |Charities |1828 |p=447}}\n\nDuring the 1820s the Overseer was also receiving 13s from the occupier of three closes in Laneham which belonged to the Vicar of Applethorpe, but no one knew how this arose. More money came from the bequest of William Skelton, who had left \u00a320 for the poor of Laneham. Half of this had been \u2018vested\u2019 in a Rampton farmer, Elizabeth Draper, who paid 10 shillings a year interest; the other half was vested in John Popple, who paid nothing until his death in 1815 when Mrs Anne Warrener took the capital and started to pay out. A woman called Sarah Fillingham also left a close called Clay Half to provide 20 shillings a year for distribution to \u2018honest widows.\u2019{{sfn |Charities |1828 |pp=447-448}}\n\nThe population of the village in 1811 was 337, and in 1815, 25 of these were officially \"poor\", representing 7.42 percent of the population. This was slightly higher than the 6.96 percent average for Nottinghamshire at the time.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |p=277}}\n\n==Historical events==\nThe archbishops of Canterbury held Laneham Manor from an early date, certainly by the time of the Domesday book when 100 acres of pasture at Newton were said to belong to the Archbishop's manor. One who seems to have benefited was William of Laneham who was on the Archbishop's staff in the early 1200s and became Archdeacon of Durham by 1224. King Henry III stayed at Laneham on 3 October 1255 <ref>Close Rolls, Henry III, 1255</ref> and King Edward III on 15-16 April 1303<ref>Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward I, vol 5, p.83-7</ref>.\n\nThomas de Corbridge, Archbishop of York, decided to spend the summer months in his residence at Laneham in July 1303 \u2013 to which he presumably travelled by water. However, while staying in the village he became ill and died on 22 September. He was known as a hard-working archbishop and was still handling his business until five days before his death. His body was taken to Southwell for burial, presumably again by water, with most of his final journey being via the Trent. The archdiocese of York properties of Laneham, Scrooby and Askham were leased to Samuel Sandys by his father, Archbishop Sandys, just before his death in 1588 and reputedly on advantageous terms. The family retained an interest in the Laneham manor for several generations and in 1663 it was held by John Sandys 'of Laneham' and Francis Sandys 'of Scrooby.'<ref>I. J. Gentles and W. J. Sheils, Confiscation and Restoration: The Archbishopric Estates and\nthe Civil War (York: Borthwick Institute of Historical Research, 1981), 2.</ref> There are old references to the remains of a moat from the palace, but these were apparently ploughed out in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1315 the people of Dunham on Trent were ordered to surrender those who had taken the Archbishop of York's swans from Laneham.<ref>A Calendar of the Register of Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York ..., Volume 11,p.87.</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Another known event in Laneham is one of the first legal cases involving a \u2018carrier\u2019, i.e. someone responsible for transporting another person or their goods. In 1346 William, a ferryman at Laneham, took a man named Richard, his horse and his goods across the river by ferry. However, he only took them part of the way, because William threw the horse and goods into the river. Possibly this might have been as the ferry was overloaded and they were all at risk of drowning (as in another case a couple of years later) but we know William\u2019s conduct \u2018inflicted other enormities to the grave damage and against the peace\u2019. Damages to Richard\u2019s property amounted to 40 marks.{{sfn |Palmer |1994 |p=174}}\n\nLittle is yet been found about Laneham having a role in civil administration, but it is known that at least one major 'trial' was held in the village. Thomas Hancock was the Puritan vicar of Headon from 1605 to 1623, arriving from Elkesley. In 1620 he was fined \"6d for riot\", at a special sessions in Laneham to try 26 people indicted for riotous assault. Hancock had something of a record for challenging the establishment, having also been one of the Puritan curates sheltered by the Brewsters at Scrooby in the 1690s when he had conducted the apparently illegal wedding of another cleric, Robert Southworth.\n\nAn old family history of the Markham family ('Markham Memorials vol 1' by Sir Clements Markham, 1913) sheds interesting light on the two Markhams who kneel facing the east in Laneham church, and have done so for hundreds of years.\n\nAt the front is Ellis Markham (c1515-1578) who was the grandson of a famous Lord Chief Justice. He had a career as an administrator, both with the Duchy of Lancaster-based around Ripon and in the household of the Archbishop of York. In 1536 he was working for Archbishop Lee and played a minor role in organising matters during the Lincolnshire Rebellion against the policies of Henry VIII. But by 1547 he was described as being in the household of Queen Catherine Parr which would indicate strong Protestant leanings. \nHe was elected an MP in 1555-7 but Markham achieved some notoriety when Mary I gave him the job of investigating the financial affairs of the disgraced Archbishop Holgate. He gathered in all sorts of treasure and finery at Cawood \u2013 to the extent that the next archbishop under Queen Elizabeth tried to sue him for damages.\n\nEllis Markham had two sons \u2013 Gervase and Jerome. The boys apparently went to school in Laneham, and then to Cambridge \u2013 Jerome arriving there at the age of 16 in 1576. However, by the 1590s the Markhams were embroiled in a bitter dispute with a ruffian named George Noel, and Noel called the Markhams out for a duel.\n\nThis was at Edward Stanhope's house, probably at Shelford east of Nottingham \u2013 the Stanhopes were earls of Chesterfield eventually. Jerome accepted the challenge although Edmund Elvois said, 'Alas, Jerome is a very young man and without experience in any fray.' They went out into the fields and Noel attacked Jerome, breaking his sword; with his opponent defenceless, Noel proceeded to kill him in an act which many saw as murder. He was buried in Nottingham. Edmund Elvois may well have been the Askham man whose name was usually spelt 'Helwys' \u2013 and father of [[Thomas Helwys]] the Baptist pioneer who paid for the 'Pilgrims' to go to Holland. Noel was a braggart and a bully, with a whole string of local quarrels including with George Lassells at Sturton. Soon afterwards someone spoke up for Noel at a meeting in the archbishop's palace at Southwell, nearly causing another quarrel as the Markhams reacted angrily.\n\nJerome's brother Gervase lived on but he lived anything but a good life \u2013 with a reputation for seducing wenches and stockpiling treasure. Gervase had some success as a soldier and returned home to live mainly at Dunham on Trent. He was known to be the 'gallant' of the Countess of Shrewsbury, a term that was clearly meant to imply more than knightly devotion. He was described as 'a proper handsome gentleman, and of great courage.\u2019\n\nIn 1616 Markham was involved in somewhat scandalous legal dispute with Lord Darcy, following an incident with the noble Lord's dog whilst they were both at a hunting event. After this he got involved in a dispute between Sir John Holles and the Stanhope family, as a result of which Holles accused him of 'lying like a villain.' Markham took this as a challenge to a duel, which he offered to fight in Worksop Park \u2013 territory of one of Holles' enemies, so Holles declined. Markham took this as a 'refusal'. However the two men met by chance in Sherwood Forect and Holles declared he would 'spoil' Markham; they duelled with rapiers, and Holles ran through Markham 'through the middle of the guts and up to the hilt, and out behind toward the small of the back.\u2019\n\nThis incident almost led to full-scale battle between Holles' men and those of Markham's friends, but Markham survived. Apparently he rashly swore to never eat supper or take the sacrament until he had gained revenge \u2013 but never did manage to! Despite his poor reputation, in 1625 Markham was Sheriff of Nottinghamshire with lands at Laneham and Dunham. While he was away from his home at Dunham one day, two youths who were reputed to be his 'bastards' robbed his house of property worth \u00a35000 \u2013 at least \u00a3800,000 today. Perhaps to evade capture, the youths buried their treasure in Gamston Woods. In 1627, when he was elderly and bedridden, one of the Holles family ordered his home to be searched for a fugitive catholic priest. This was widely interpreted as the action of someone denouncing Markham for reasons of a grudge, and the vicar of Dunham certified that he had routinely attended his parish church.\n\nHe cannot have been that ill in 1625 as he was still alive in 1636, though living the life of a miser. He was spending \u00a340 a year though his income from land was \u00a3800 and he had \u00a340,000 in money \u2013 so a substantial millionaire in today's values. Markham had no family and refused to acknowledge any of his extramarital offspring, so spent it on no-one. Despite this he refused to pay the king's new tax, Ship Money, and was ordered to be arrested.  The vicar had to certify that he was too ill to travel to London, reporting that he had taken communion in his bed for many years \u2013 so perhaps he had given up on his vengeance vow!\nHe died in 1637, old and crippled, and was buried in Laneham church beneath an effigy of himself as a young and handsome man that had been there many years already \u2013 having been presumably commissioned by his father.\n\nThere also seem to have been a few Quakers in the village. In 1689 Gervase Harrison was prosecuted at the ecclesiastical court following an action by Richard Bradley, vicar of Laneham, for not paying the sum of 6d each for three communicants in his household. Harrison did not appear to answer the case and was committed to Nottingham Gaol for nine weeks, including two weeks in one of its nefarious dungeons. IN 1707 John Parker was prosecuted for non-payment of tithes, a typical Quaker offence.\n\nIn 1810 the church tower was rebuilt after being struck by lightning and four bells added at a cost of \u00a3800. According to a Church of England report at the time, efforts to raise funds for this locally failed 'as the parishioners are too poor.'\n\nAccording to the Notts Guardian in 1865 there was a grave in the churchyard for James Penant, a blacksmith, who died on 27 May 1763, with the inscription:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:My tongs and hammer I\u2019ve declined\n:My bellows they have lost their wind\n:My fires extinct my forge decayed\n:And in the dust my vice is laid\n:My coals are spent my iron gone\n:My nails are drove my work is done.\n{{Refend}}\nOnly a few parts of this text are still legible.\n\nThe poverty of Laneham\u2019s former curate was reported in the news in 1842 when an income tax return was sent back from the village with the following verse attached:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:There\u2019s nothing here but poverty,\n:Scottish rags and hunger;\n:If Sir Robert Peel has sent you here\n:Surely it was in anger.\n{{Refend}}\nThe writer was Rev. John Irvine, a Scottish man who had taken on the curacy of both Laneham and Rampton for the \u2018shamefully small\u2019 stipend of \u00a350 a year. At that time it was quite common for a parish to have a vicar or rector \u2013 usually well-connected \u2013 who drew most of the income and then paid a small portion to a less well-connected clergyman to act as curate and do most of the work. After a year or two Irvine had to give up the role at Rampton (we do not know why) and was reduced to just the Laneham role for which he was paid 10&nbsp;shillings (\u00a30.50) a week \u2013 so his pay was little more than that of an agricultural labourer. When Laneham\u2019s rector died, Irvine felt he had a strong claim on the senior position and petitioned the patron of the benefice, the Dean and Chapter of York, for the place \u2013 without success.\n\nTo make ends meet, Irvine was forced to open a parish school where he could charge parents for the education of their children, but clearly this produced only a small income for him.\n\nSome of the vicars of Laneham were also interesting. In 1764 John Welch was \"not able to do any duty, being a little insane\". In 1842 Edmund Wallis died, having been vicar for 60 years; this perhaps explains some aspects of Irvine's story.\n\nA few minor crimes have received press coverage giving an insight into Laneham life in the past. In 1839 two women \u2018had words\u2019 in the street and then took to blows in a \u2018desperate encounter\u2019, which ended with one at death\u2019s door apparently. In 1843 at harvest the locals mixed with Irish itinerant workers in one of the village inns, but hostility was bubbling under the surface; Charles Parr, Thomas Lane and other local \u2018ruffians\u2019 were found \u2018absolutely roasting\u2019 a young Irish reaper on the fire of the inn until its landlord intervened.\n\n==Local boys made good==\nLaneham boys George Warriner and Enoch Hodgkinson left the village in the later 1700s for a career in London, where they became successful retail drapers with a shop at 124 New Bond Street. In 1788 two women were transported to Australia for seven years after being caught \u2018shoplifting\u2019 from the \u2018expensive\u2019 shop they ran.\n\nGeorge (1745-1822) was born in Laneham to parents who married in the village in 1739. In London, he bought a nice house in Lisson Grove. Having made his fortune, Warriner then reinvented himself as a country gentleman. He married a lady named Elizabeth and bought a small estate at Bloxham in 1797, Oxfordshire. In 1812 the area was visited by the famous agricultural author Arthur Young, who was impressed by the modern farming techniques in use on the estate. Warriner had a son, named Enoch Hodgkinson Warriner after his friend, who went to Oxford and became a clergyman at Footscray in Kent; Mrs Warriner\u2019s letters to her son are preserved in the National Archives. Bloxham stayed in the Warriner family until 1915 but his great grandson Henry inherited the Weston Park estate of the Earl of Camperdown, for whom he had been gamekeeper. Perhaps George\u2019s most enduring memorial is actually the secondary school in Bloxham, which is called the Warriner School.\n\nEnoch is less easy to trace but he had an active business career as well as the drapery side. He was a director of the Hand in Hand Fire Office, an insurance company, and owned properties at Blackfriars Bridge and Child\u2019s Hill, Middlesex. He was living \u2018above the shop\u2019 in 1773 and later in Stamford Street. Both he and George were supporters of the Lock Charity Hospital in London. He died in May 1810 at Stamford Street, aged 77. Hodkinson seems to have been a noted supporter of various charities including for poor clergymen and imprisoned debtors.\n\n==Suspected murder case==\nLaneham hit the headlines in December 1845 with the death of farmer Robert Draper. Draper, the oldest son of a wealthy Rampton farmer, had been born in 1776 and moved to the village after the breakdown of his marriage. He married in 1812 but very soon split from his wife; his wife sued for restitution of conjugal rights in 1838 but lost the case - it having taken her a very long time to bring one! (The Jurist, Volume 1, p.&nbsp;872) Most of the farm was left to Draper\u2019s younger brother although he clearly had some independent means and eventually bought himself 70 acres, farmed with the help of a labourer named in The Times as Hood (also reported as 'Troop').\n\nDraper was an eccentric collector of old coins, swords, pistols and watches. \u201cFor anything that might take his fancy, he was not particular as to the price he might pay,\u201d The Times noted after his death. At 8pm every night he would lock himself into his sitting room with his chronometers and a book, staying up all night until the villagers got up at 6am; if he heard a noise outside, he would fire his pistols through an \u2018aperture\u2019 in the window.\n\nIn 1844 he took in a servant girl, Harriet Trevor. She it was who reported that she had got up one morning to find all the doors locked, but had spied him on his hands and knees in the sitting room. She and Hood lay him down, but took several days to summon Mr Oliver, the surgeon. Oliver could do little to stop his death, but did notice he had bumped his head.\n\nDraper was buried in Laneham church, after which the trustees of his will noticed property missing. By this time Harriet Trevor had gone home, but she was traced and her possessions searched \u2013 she had \u00a340, an enormous sum for a servant girl. A gold chain was found stitched 'inside her stays.' She confessed that she and Hood had robbed Draper, so Hood\u2019s cottage was searched and more property found hidden in a stocking. Then a witness recalled Draper\u2019s head had seemed \u2018soft and boggy\u2019 on one side. It was decided to exhume him.\n\nThe body was dug up and placed in \u2018an empty tenement\u2019 near the church while the coroner\u2019s inquest \u2013 with a jury \u2013 met at the Butcher\u2019s Arms. Viewing the corpse was unpleasant \u2013 \u201cthe stench was awful and the colour of the face as black as that of an Indian. The beard had grown considerably and was covered with a kind of blue mould,\u201d The Times noted. The surgeon told the inquest that marks to the head could have been made with a spade or the blunt end of an axe. Perhaps fearing to place an accusation that could lead to the gallows against people they knew, the jury recorded a view that \u2018there was no satisfactory evidence as to cause of death.\u2019 Hood and Trevor were remarkably lucky to escape with a charge of robbery.\n\n==Laneham drainage==\nIn December 1768, a group of landowners from this part of Nottinghamshire asked the civil engineer [[John Grundy, Jr.]] to investigate the possibility of draining some {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} of land on the west bank of the [[River Trent]], stretching from Laneham to [[West Burton, Nottinghamshire|West Burton]]. He was accompanied by Samuel Goodhand, his clerk, on the initial site visit, and proposed three components to a solution. The first was a catchwater drain, which would intercept the streams flowing into the area at its western edge, and discharge into the Trent at West Burton. To prevent high water levels in the river flooding the land, he proposed a {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} flood bank, which would run from Laneham to West Burton. Finally, rainwater would be collected by a Mother Drain and numerous side drains, which would discharge into the Trent through an outfall sluice at Sturton Cow Pasture.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |pp=281\u2013282}}</ref>\n\nThe landowners liked the plans, asking Grundy to produce detailed proposals, and to supervise the obtaining of an [[Act of Parliament]] to authorise the work. Assisted by the surveyor George Kelk and a colleague called David Buffery, who checked the levels, he spent six weeks producing his plans, which he presented in February 1769. He estimated that {{convert|5900|acre|ha}} would be improved by the scheme, which would cost \u00a32,700 for the catchwater drain, \u00a36,800 for the bank along the river from Laneham to West Burton, \u00a32,400 for the Mother Drain, with an additional \u00a31,200 for the side drains, and \u00a3900 for the sluice at Sturton, making a total of \u00a314,000. He spent most of March and April in London, to ensure the bill passed through Parliament, and received \u00a3329 for his work up to this point. A detailed plan of the area at a scale of 1:21,120 (3 miles to the inch) was published.<ref name=skempton282>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=282}}</ref>\n\nThe Act appointed Drainage Commissioners, who met for the first time on 29 May 1769. Grundy became the engineer for the scheme, Buffery was the surveyor of works, and Kelk was the land surveyor. Grundy's plans for Sturton Sluice show a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} waterway. Brickwork and masonry were erected by local contractors, while the major excavations were handled by Dyson and Pinkerton. Grundy changed the plans somewhat, as he decided that a drainage mill would be needed at Sturton. This had a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} [[scoop wheel]], and was completed in April 1770 by Henry Bennett from [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], at a cost of \u00a3458. The works were finished on time in May 1772, with the final cost amounting to around \u00a315,000. Grundy visited the works at least seven times to ensure that his specifications were being met.<ref name=skempton282/> The only known details of the scheme are preserved in Grundy's ''Report Books'', which he spent the last few years of his life preparing. Running to 12 volumes and 4,000 pages, they were lost, but were re-discovered in the library at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1988. The Laneham Drainage scheme is covered in volumes 10 and 11.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=284}}</ref>\n\nThe drainage mill which pumped water from the Mother Drain into the Trent was replaced by a {{convert|43|hp|kW|adj=on|abbr=on}} steam-powered beam engine in 1847. It had a larger scoop wheel, which was {{convert|26.5|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|2.25|ft|m}} wide. It was scrapped some time before 1937, and has been replaced by an [[Gwynnes Limited|Allen-Gwynnes]] {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on}} electric pump.<ref>{{harvnb |Hinde |2006 |p=199}}</ref> With the passing of the [[Land Drainage Act 1930]], most land drainage authorities were superseded by [[Internal Drainage Board]]s (IDBs), and the original scheme formed the central section of the Laneham IDB, who were responsible for {{convert|78.5|mi|km}} of drains and ditches, which helped to prevent flooding of {{convert|22.9|sqmi|km2}} of low-lying land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/IDBindex.asp?Ref=22 |title=Laneham IDB \u2013 Summary details |publisher=Shire Group of IDBs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223023241/http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/IDBindex.asp?Ref=22 |archivedate=23 February 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> They maintained 10 pumping stations, which included those at the end of the catchwater drain and the Mother Drain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/Admin/Environmental/Laneham%20IDB%20BAP%20FINAL.pdf |title=Laneham IDB Biodiversity Action Plan |publisher=Shire Group of IDBs |date=January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323093115/http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/Admin/Environmental/Laneham%20IDB%20BAP%20FINAL.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> In April 2012, they amalgamated with the Newark, Kingston Brook, and Fairham Brook internal drainage boards to become part of the Trent Valley IDB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naidb.co.uk/general.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811225709/http://naidb.co.uk/general.htm |archivedate=11 August 2013 |title=History |publisher=Trent Valley IDB |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=Margery Ellen |last=Brown\n  |title=Aspects of Parliamentary Enclosure in Nottinghamshire\n  |publisher=Proquest for UMI Dissertation Publishing\n  |year=1995\n  |url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/35536/1/U071859.pdf\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Charities\n  |title=Reports for Commissioners\n  |publisher=House of Commons\n  |year=1828\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZTZbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA447&lpg=PA447\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=K.

It was founded by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] drummer [[Dave Grohl]] as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the [[suicide of Kurt Cobain]]. The group got its name from the [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and various aerial phenomena that were reported by [[Allies of World War II|Allied aircraft pilots]] in [[World War II]], which were known collectively as \"[[foo fighter]]s\".\n\nPrior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'', which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist [[Nate Mendel]] and drummer [[William Goldsmith]], both formerly of [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], as well as Nirvana touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]] to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'' (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011.\n\nThey were replaced by [[Taylor Hawkins]] and [[Franz Stahl]], respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until [[Chris Shiflett]] joined on guitar after the completion of ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''. The band released its fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'', in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc ''[[In Your Honor]]'' (2005), which was split between [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'', in 2007. The band's seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', produced by [[Butch Vig]], was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Sonic Highways]]'', was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|2014 miniseries]] of the same name. On September 15, 2017, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Concrete and Gold]]'', which became their second to reach number one in the United States and was the band's first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist [[Rami Jaffee]] as a full member.\n\nOver the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]. {{as of|2015}}, the band has sold 12 million units in the United States alone.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html \"Dave Grohl interview: 'I\u2019m going to fix my leg and then I\u2019m going to come back'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045037/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html |date=June 19, 2015 }}. telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015.

While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with how the mixes were turning out, and changed William Goldsmith's \"drum tracks with his own for all but two songs.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Sam|title=FOO FIGHTERS HAVE FOUND A POST-NIRVANA IDENTITY|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company LLC|id={{ProQuest|342848747}}}}</ref> During the L.A. sessions, Grohl had played drums on the songs. Unhappy with Goldsmith's drumming, Grohl removed it from the recordings and re-recorded the drum tracks. As Goldsmith was about to come down to L.A. to find out why he wasn't being called upon to re-record his parts, he called Mendel from Seattle inquiring if he should make the trip. Grohl then called Goldsmith saying, \"Dude, don't come down here, I'm recording some of the drum tracks\". Shocked by this, Goldsmith met up with Mendel in Seattle and repeated Grohl's claim to be re-recording \"some\" of the tracks. Mendel asked, \"Is that what he told you?\"; Goldsmith affirmed it, and Mendel stated, \"No, man, he did them all\".\n\n[[File:FoosLollBerlin190917-21 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Long-time drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band in 1997]]\nGrohl explained that he'd wanted the drums to sound a certain way on the album.

The producer ([[Gil Norton]]) wanted him to play drums on the record, and it felt like everyone was trying to get me to quit. But I didn't quit. I played drums on pretty much the whole record.

Grohl was surprised when Hawkins volunteered his own services as drummer.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Hawkins made his debut with the group in time for the release of its second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'', in May 1997. The album included the singles \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\", \"[[Everlong]]\", \"[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]\", and \"[[Walking After You]]\"\n\nPat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band, claiming exhaustion and burnout, but agreed to stay with the band until a replacement could be found for him. Four months later in September at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]], Smear simultaneously announced to the public his departure from the band and introduced his replacement, Grohl's former [[Scream (band)|Scream]] bandmate [[Franz Stahl]].<ref name=\"Kerrang 1997\">Johnson, Lisa. \"Classic interview: October 1997\".

However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in 1999, \"in those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't\". Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting the band to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day.<ref name=\"Burn away\">Beebee, Steve. \"Burn Away\".

The album spawned several singles, including \"[[Learn to Fly]]\", the band's first single to reach the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Other singles included \"[[Stacked Actors]]\", \"[[Generator (Foo Fighters song)|Generator]]\", \"[[Next Year]]\" and \"[[Breakout (Foo Fighters song)|Breakout]]\".\n\nBefore the release of the album, [[Capitol Records]] president [[Gary Gersh]] was forced out of the label.

After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, the album \"just didn't sound right\" and the band had no confidence in the album to sell many records. With the album not reaching their expectations, and much infighting amongst the members, Grohl spent some time helping [[Queens of the Stone Age]] complete their 2002 album ''[[Songs for the Deaf]]''. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, and touring had started for both Foo Fighters and Queens of the Stone Age, the band was on the verge of breaking up entirely as the animosity grew amongst the members. Grohl reconvened with Hawkins, Shiflett and Mendel to have them play at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]], with Queens of the Stone Age playing one day and Foo Fighters the following. After the Queens of the Stone Age played, Hawkins and Grohl talked about retrying the ''One by One'' album and had agreed to finishing it and seeing where they would go from there. The group re-recorded nearly all of the album (save \"Tired of You\") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's home studio in Alexandria, [[Virginia]].<ref name=back/> The original version of ''One by One'', referred to by the band as \"Million Dollar Demos\", has never been heard in its entirety, except for fragments that were leaked.<ref name=spin>{{cite journal|url=https://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|title=The Good Fight|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=November 2002|page=72|first=Alex|last=Pappademas|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107022246/http://www.spin.com/2003/07/foo-fighters/|archivedate=January 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe final album was released in October 2002 under the title ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]''.

However, in 2004, upon learning that [[George W.

Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down\". Foo Fighters also utilized the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking [[The Knack]], [[Bay City Rollers]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]], and [[ABBA]] as much as we liked [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], I suppose\".<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, \"I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.\"<ref name=\"Alien parking\" /> Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] described Grohl and the band as \"his generation's answer to [[Tom Petty]]\u2014a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock\".<ref name='Pitchfork'>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|title=Album Reviews: Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits|accessdate=May 30, 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702080052/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|archivedate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with heavier ones. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Grohl said in 2005, \"I love being in a rock band, but I don't know if I necessarily wanna be in an alternative rock band from the 1990s for the rest of my life.\" Grohl noted that the band's acoustic tour was an attempt to broaden the group's sound.<ref>Chick, Steve. \"Foo Fighters: 'Touring the UK?

The group got its name from the [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s and various aerial phenomena that were reported by [[Allies of World War II|Allied aircraft pilots]] in [[World War II]], which were known collectively as \"[[foo fighter]]s\".\n\nPrior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'', which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist [[Nate Mendel]] and drummer [[William Goldsmith]], both formerly of [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], as well as Nirvana touring guitarist [[Pat Smear]] to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, ''[[The Colour and the Shape]]'' (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward, though he would appear as a guest with the band frequently starting in 2006, and would rejoin as an official full-time member in 2011.\n\nThey were replaced by [[Taylor Hawkins]] and [[Franz Stahl]], respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, ''[[There Is Nothing Left to Lose]]'' (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until [[Chris Shiflett]] joined on guitar after the completion of ''There Is Nothing Left to Lose''. The band released its fourth album, ''[[One by One (Foo Fighters album)|One by One]]'', in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc ''[[In Your Honor]]'' (2005), which was split between [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, ''[[Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace]]'', in 2007. The band's seventh studio album, ''[[Wasting Light]]'', produced by [[Butch Vig]], was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Sonic Highways]]'', was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the Grohl-directed [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|2014 miniseries]] of the same name. On September 15, 2017, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Concrete and Gold]]'', which became their second to reach number one in the United States and was the band's first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist [[Rami Jaffee]] as a full member.\n\nOver the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]. {{as of|2015}}, the band has sold 12 million units in the United States alone.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html \"Dave Grohl interview: 'I\u2019m going to fix my leg and then I\u2019m going to come back'\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619045037/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/11684482/Dave-Grohl-interview-Im-going-to-fix-my-leg-and-then-Im-going-to-come-back.html |date=June 19, 2015 }}. telegraph.co.uk, June 18, 2015.

During tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the rest of the band; he said in 1997, \"I was in awe of [frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s songs], and [I was] intimidated. I thought it was best that I kept my songs to myself.\"<ref name=\"Foobulous\">di Perna, Alan. \"Absolutely Foobulous!\". ''Guitar World''.

They followed that with a show at the Velvet Elvis in Seattle on March 4. The show on March 3 had been part of a benefit gig to aid the finances of the investigation into the rape and murder of [[The Gits]] singer [[Mia Zapata]]. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album.<ref name=\"Breakout\" /> Foo Fighters undertook its first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for [[Mike Watt]]. The band's first single, \"[[This Is a Call]]\", was released in June 1995,<ref name=AMG /> and its debut album ''[[Foo Fighters (album)|Foo Fighters]]'' was released the next month. \"[[I'll Stick Around]]\", \"[[For All the Cows]]\", and \"[[Big Me]]\" were released as subsequent singles.

While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he was not happy with how the mixes were turning out, and changed William Goldsmith's \"drum tracks with his own for all but two songs.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Sam|title=FOO FIGHTERS HAVE FOUND A POST-NIRVANA IDENTITY|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company LLC|id={{ProQuest|342848747}}}}</ref> During the L.A. sessions, Grohl had played drums on the songs. Unhappy with Goldsmith's drumming, Grohl removed it from the recordings and re-recorded the drum tracks. As Goldsmith was about to come down to L.A. to find out why he wasn't being called upon to re-record his parts, he called Mendel from Seattle inquiring if he should make the trip. Grohl then called Goldsmith saying, \"Dude, don't come down here, I'm recording some of the drum tracks\". Shocked by this, Goldsmith met up with Mendel in Seattle and repeated Grohl's claim to be re-recording \"some\" of the tracks. Mendel asked, \"Is that what he told you?\"; Goldsmith affirmed it, and Mendel stated, \"No, man, he did them all\".\n\n[[File:FoosLollBerlin190917-21 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Long-time drummer [[Taylor Hawkins]] joined the band in 1997]]\nGrohl explained that he'd wanted the drums to sound a certain way on the album. He wanted Goldsmith to play for the tour even though it would not be his drumming but Grohl's on the album. Feeling betrayed, Goldsmith left the band.<ref>\"Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours' worth of takes on another one,\" he points out. \"It just seemed that everything I did wasn't good enough for him, or anyone else. I think that everyone at the label wanted Dave to play drums on the record. The producer ([[Gil Norton]]) wanted him to play drums on the record, and it felt like everyone was trying to get me to quit. But I didn't quit. I played drums on pretty much the whole record. But then, behind my back, Dave re-recorded the whole record without telling me. I found out through Nate, who, well, I won't get into that. But I thought, This is bullshit.\" Roberts, Michael. \"[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day/2 Bring Back That Sunny Day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103091941/http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1998-12-03/music/bring-back-that-sunny-day/2/ |date=November 3, 2012 }}\".

The album included the singles \"[[Monkey Wrench (song)|Monkey Wrench]]\", \"[[Everlong]]\", \"[[My Hero (song)|My Hero]]\", and \"[[Walking After You]]\"\n\nPat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band, claiming exhaustion and burnout, but agreed to stay with the band until a replacement could be found for him.

However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in 1999, \"in those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't\". Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood.

Other singles included \"[[Stacked Actors]]\", \"[[Generator (Foo Fighters song)|Generator]]\", \"[[Next Year]]\" and \"[[Breakout (Foo Fighters song)|Breakout]]\".\n\nBefore the release of the album, [[Capitol Records]] president [[Gary Gersh]] was forced out of the label.

Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, \"Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down\". Foo Fighters also utilized the technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud choruses, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana \"liking [[The Knack]], [[Bay City Rollers]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]], and [[ABBA]] as much as we liked [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], I suppose\".<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar in a similar manner to his playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, \"I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.\"<ref name=\"Alien parking\" /> Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.<ref name=\"Foobulous\" /> [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] described Grohl and the band as \"his generation's answer to [[Tom Petty]]\u2014a consistent hit machine pumping out working-class rock\".<ref name='Pitchfork'>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|title=Album Reviews: Foo Fighters: Greatest Hits|accessdate=May 30, 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702080052/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/|archivedate=July 2, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with heavier ones. Grohl noted in 1997, \"We all love music, whether it's [[the Beatles]] or [[Queen (band)|Queen]] or [[punk rock]]. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know?
