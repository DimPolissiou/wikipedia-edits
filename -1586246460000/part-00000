The book characterizes the fundamental factors that govern the qualitative and quantitative trajectories of a variety of deterministic, discrete dynamical systems, providing solution methods for systems that can be solved analytically and methods of qualitative analysis for systems that do not permit or necessitate an explicit solution. The analysis focuses initially on the characterization of the factors the govern the evolution of state variables in the elementary context of one-dimensional, first-order, linear, autonomous systems. The fundamental insights about the forces that affect the evolution of these elementary systems are subsequently generalized, and the determinants of the trajectory of multi-dimensional, nonlinear, higher-order, non-autonomous dynamical systems are established.\n\n=== ''Unified Growth Theory'' (2011) ===\n{{Main|Unified growth theory}}'''Backdrop'''\n\nThroughout most of human existence, economic growth has been all but absent across the globe. But two centuries ago, some regions of the world began to emerge from this epoch of economic stagnation into a period of sustained economic growth, profoundly altering the level and distribution of wealth and health around the world. In his book ''Unified Growth Theory'', Galor provides a global theory explaining what has triggered this remarkable transformation in human history.\n\n'''Synopsis'''\n\n''Unified Growth Theory'' is the first theory that sheds light on the determinants of the process of development since the emergence of Homo sapiens. Galor, who founded the field of unified growth theory, identifies the historical and prehistorical forces behind the differential transition timing from stagnation to growth and the emergence of income disparity around the world. He unveils the mechanisms that have trapped the world economy in millennia of near-stagnation but ultimately has induced the remarkable transition to an era of sustained economic growth characterized by vast inequality across countries and regions. ''Unified Growth Theory'' suggests that during most of human existence, technological progress was counterbalanced by population growth and living standards were near subsistence across time and space. However, the reinforcing interaction between the rate of technological progress and the size and composition of the population has gradually increased the pace of technological progress, enhancing the importance of education in the ability of individuals to adapt to the changing technological environment. The rise in the allocation of resources towards education triggered reductions in fertility rates, enabling economies to divert a larger share of the fruits of technological progress to the growth of income per capita, rather than towards the growth of population, paving the way for the emergence of sustained economic growth. The theory further suggests that variations in biogeographical characteristics, as well as cultural and institutional characteristics, have generated a differential pace of transition from stagnation to growth across countries and consequently divergence in their income per capita over the past two centuries.\n\n'''Reception'''\n\nNobel Laureate in Economics [[Robert Solow]] described Galor's project as \"breathtakingly ambitious\". He added that \"Galor proposes a fairly simple, intensely human-capital-oriented model that will accommodate the millennia of Malthusian near-stagnation, the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath of rapid growth, the accompanying demographic transition, and the emergence of modern human-capital-based growth. And the model is supposed to generate endogenously the transitions from one era to the next. The resulting book is a powerful mixture of fact, theory, and interpretation.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9477.html|title=Oded Galor, Unified Growth Theory|last=Princeton University Press|first=|date=2011|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] economist [[Daron Acemoglu]], \"''Unified Growth Theory'' is a work of unusual ambition\" that \"will inspire, motivate, and challenge economists.\"\n\nUniversity of Chicago economist [[Steven Durlauf|Steven N.

Following the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], part of Cheadle Bulkeley was amalgamated into the [[County Borough of Stockport|Municipal Borough of Stockport]].<ref name=\"GM Gazetteer\"/> Cheadle Bulkeley and Cheadle Moseley became separate [[civil parish]]es in 1866, but in 1879 they were united to form the civil parish of Cheadle.<ref>[http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/chs/cheadlebulkeley.html GENUKI: Cheadle Bulkeley]</ref><ref>[http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/chs/cheadlemoseley.html GENUKI: Cheadle Moseley]</ref>\n\nIn 1886, Cheadle was in the Cheadle and Gatley [[local board of health]], a [[local authority|regulatory body]] responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation for the area of [[Stockport Etchells]] township and the part of Cheadle township outside the Municipal Borough of Stockport. The board of health was also part of Stockport [[poor law union]].

However, from 1866 until 1964, the locality was served by a [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] railway station (initially called ''Cheadle'', and from 1950 ''Cheadle North'') situated {{convert|600|yd|m}} north of the village on the west side of Manchester Road and from 1866 until 1917 by [[Cheadle LNWR railway station|Cheadle LNWR]] a [[London & North Western Railway]] station located next to the railway overbridge near the centre of the village. Both stations were on lines leading from [[Altrincham]] to [[Stockport]].\n\nCheadle no longer has its own railway station, though there are stations in several neighbouring vicinities. [[Gatley railway station]] is approximately one mile west of Cheadle village, and the neighbouring areas of [[East Didsbury railway station|East Didsbury]] (within the City of Manchester's boundaries), [[Cheadle Hulme railway station|Cheadle Hulme]] and [[Heald Green railway station|Heald Green]] all have stations themselves.\n\nCheadle is accessed by junctions 2 and 3 of the [[M60 motorway|M60 Manchester orbital]] motorway.

Following the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], part of Cheadle Bulkeley was amalgamated into the [[County Borough of Stockport|Municipal Borough of Stockport]].<ref name=\"GM Gazetteer\"/> Cheadle Bulkeley and Cheadle Moseley became separate [[civil parish]]es in 1866, but in 1879 they were united to form the civil parish of Cheadle.<ref>[http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/chs/cheadlebulkeley.html GENUKI: Cheadle Bulkeley]</ref><ref>[http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/genuki/chs/cheadlemoseley.html GENUKI: Cheadle Moseley]</ref>\n\nIn 1886, Cheadle was in the Cheadle and Gatley [[local board of health]], a [[local authority|regulatory body]] responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation for the area of [[Stockport Etchells]] township and the part of Cheadle township outside the Municipal Borough of Stockport. The board of health was also part of Stockport [[poor law union]]. In 1888 the board was divided into four wards: Adswood, Cheadle, Cheadle Hulme and Gatley.<ref name=bowden25>Bowden, p.25</ref> Under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] the area of the local board became [[Cheadle and Gatley Urban District]]. There were exchanges of land with the neighbouring former [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s of [[Wilmslow]] and [[Handforth]] in 1901, and the wards were restructured again, splitting Cheadle Hulme into north and south, and merging in Adswood.<ref name=bowden25 /> Due to the fast-paced growth of the district, the wards were again restructured in 1930, with the addition of [[Heald Green]].

However, from 1866 until 1964, the locality was served by a [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] railway station (initially called ''Cheadle'', and from 1950 ''Cheadle North'') situated {{convert|600|yd|m}} north of the village on the west side of Manchester Road and from 1866 until 1917 by [[Cheadle LNWR railway station|Cheadle LNWR]] a [[London & North Western Railway]] station located next to the railway overbridge near the centre of the village. Both stations were on lines leading from [[Altrincham]] to [[Stockport]].\n\nCheadle no longer has its own railway station, though there are stations in several neighbouring vicinities. [[Gatley railway station]] is approximately one mile west of Cheadle village, and the neighbouring areas of [[East Didsbury railway station|East Didsbury]] (within the City of Manchester's boundaries), [[Cheadle Hulme railway station|Cheadle Hulme]] and [[Heald Green railway station|Heald Green]] all have stations themselves.\n\nCheadle is accessed by junctions 2 and 3 of the [[M60 motorway|M60 Manchester orbital]] motorway. It is approximately 4 miles from [[Manchester Airport]].\n\n==Housing==\nA number of houses in Cheadle that were built in the 1800s still stand today, in a conservation area in the centre of the village.\n\nThere is also a Manchester overspill council estate that was constructed shortly after the [[Second World War]] to rehouse families from the Victorian slums of inner-city Manchester.

The [[Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration|Training Course in Personnel Administration]], founded at [[Radcliffe College]] in 1937, was the beginning of business training for women at Harvard.

In 1959, alumnae of the one-year program (by then known as the Harvard-Radcliffe Program in Business Administration) were permitted to apply to join the HBS MBA program as second-years. In December 1962, the faculty voted to allow women to enter the MBA program directly.

Precognition also appears to violate the principle of [[causality]], that an effect cannot occur before its cause.\n\nPrecognition has been widely believed in throughout history. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many people believe it to be real; it is widely reported and remains a topic of research and discussion within the [[parapsychology]] community.\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\nSince ancient times, precognition has been associated with [[trance]] and [[dream]] states involved in phenomena such as [[prophecy]], [[fortune telling]] and [[second sight]], as well as waking premonitions. These phenomena were widely accepted and reports have persisted throughout history, with most instances appearing in dreams.<ref name=\"inglis\">Inglis (1985), Chapter on \"Precognition\"</ref>\n\nSuch claims of seeing the future have never been without their sceptical critics. [[Aristotle]] carried out an inquiry into allegedly prophetic dreams in his ''[[On Divination in Sleep]]''. He accepted that \"it is quite conceivable that some dreams may be tokens and causes [of future events]\" but also believed that \"most [so-called prophetic] dreams are, however, to be classed as mere [[coincidence]]s...\". Where [[Democritus]] had suggested that emanations from future events could be sent back to the dreamer, Aristotle proposed that it was, rather, the dreamer's sense impressions which reached forward to the event.<ref>Aristotle. (350 BC). On Prophesying by Dreams.  [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/prophesying.html Trans. J.I. Beare], MIT. (Retrieved 5 September 2018).</ref>\n\n===17th\u201319th centuries===\nThe term \"precognition\" first appeared in the 17th century but did not come into common use among investigators until much later.<ref name=\"inglis\"/>\n\nAn early investigation into claims of precognition was published by the missionary Fr. P. Boilat in 1883. He claimed to have put an unspoken question to an African [[witch-doctor]] whom he mistrusted. Contrary to his expectations, the witch-doctor gave him the correct answer without ever having heard the question.<ref name=\"inglis\"/>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn the early 20th century [[J. W. Dunne]], a British aeronautics engineer, experienced several dreams which he regarded as precognitive. He developed techniques to record and analyse them, identifying any correspondences between his future experiences and his recorded dreams. He reported his findings in his 1927 book ''[[An Experiment with Time]]''. In it he alleges that 10% of his dreams appeared to include some element of future experience. He also persuaded some friends to try the experiment on themselves, with mixed results. Dunne concluded that precognitive elements in dreams are common and that many people unknowingly have them.<ref name=\"dunne1927\">Dunne (1927).</ref><ref>[[Antony Flew|Flew, Antony]]; \"The Sources of Serialism'', in Shivesh Thakur (Ed). ''Philosophy and Psychical Research'', George Allen & Unwin Ltd. 1976, pp. 81\u201396. {{ISBN|0-04-100041-2}}</ref> He suggested also that dream precognition did not reference any kind of future event, but specifically the future experiences of the dreamer. He was led to this idea when he found that a dream of a volcanic eruption appeared to foresee not the disaster itself but his subsequent misreading of an inaccurate account in a newspaper.<ref>Sean O'Donnell, ''The Paranormal Explained''. Lulu 2007.</ref><ref name=\"dunne1927\" /> In 1932 he helped the [[Society for Psychical Research]] to conduct a more formal experiment, but he and the Society's lead researcher [[Theodore Besterman]] failed to agree on the significance of the results.<ref>Brian Inglis; ''The Paranormal: An Encyclopedia of Psychic Phenomena''.

The psychologists [[Henry Murray]] and D. R. Wheeler tested precognitive dreams by inviting the public to report any dreams of the child. A total of 1,300 dreams were reported. Only five percent envisioned the child dead and only 4 of the 1,300 envisioned the location of the grave as amongst trees. This number was no better than chance.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = D.

Rhine used a method of forced-choice matching in which participants guessed the order of a deck of 25 cards, each five of which bore one of five geometrical symbols. Although his results were positive and gained some academic acceptance, his methods were later shown to be badly flawed and subsequent researchers using more rigorous procedures were unable to reproduce his results. His mathematics was sometimes flawed, the experiments were not double-blinded or even necessarily single-blinded and some of the cards to be guessed were so thin that the symbol could be seen through the backing.<ref>[[Harold Gulliksen]].

Soal]] was described by Rhine as one of his harshest critics, running many similar experiments with wholly negative results. However, from around 1940 he ran forced-choice ESP experiments in which a subject attempted to identify which of five animal pictures a subject in another room was looking at. Their performance on this task was at chance, but when the scores were matched with the card that came ''after'' the target card, three of the thirteen subjects showed a very high hit rate.<ref name=\"colman\">{{cite book|last=Colman|first=Andrew M.|title=Facts, Fallacies and Frauds in Psychology|publisher=Unwin Hyman|year=1988|pages=175\u2013180|isbn=978-0-04-445289-8}}</ref> Rhine now described Soal's work as \"a milestone in the field\".<ref name=\"colman\" /> However analyses of Soal's findings, conducted several years later, concluded that the positive results were more likely the result of deliberate fraud.<ref name=\"hyman\" /><ref name=\"hyman\">{{cite book |last=Hyman |first=Ray|authorlink= |editor=Robert J.

In 1969 [[Helmut Schmidt (parapsychologist)|Helmut Schmidt]] introduced the use of high-speed random event generators (REG) for precognition testing, and experiments were also conducted at the [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab]].<ref name=Smee>{{cite journal |title=The lab that asked the wrong questions |journal=Nature |date=March 1, 2007 |first=Lucy |last=Odling-Smee |issue=7131 |pages=10\u201311 |doi=10.1038/446010a |url=http://intl.emboj.org/nature/journal/v446/n7131/full/446010a.html |accessdate=2007-06-29 |volume=446 |pmid=17330012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630213439/http://intl.emboj.org/nature/journal/v446/n7131/full/446010a.html |archivedate=June 30, 2007 |bibcode=2007Natur.446...10O }}</ref> Once again, flaws were found in all of Schmidt's experiments, when the psychologist [[C.

Priestley]] for experiences which challenged our understanding of Time.

His survey of over 433 participants showed that 290 or 66.9 percent reported some form of paranormal dream.  He rejected many of these reports, but claimed that 8.8 percent of the population was having actual precognitive dreams.<ref>Ryback, David, PhD. \"Dreams That Came True\".

Lambert, a former Council member of the SPR, proposed five criteria that needed to be met before an account of a precognitive dream could be regarded as credible:<ref name=\"inglis\"/>\n#The dream should be reported to a credible witness before the event.\n#The time interval between the dream and the event should be short.\n#The event should be unexpected at the time of the dream.\n#The description should be of an event destined literally, and not symbolically, to happen.\n#The details of dream and event should tally.\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2011 the psychologist [[Daryl Bem]], a Professor Emeritus at [[Cornell University]], published findings showing statistical evidence for precognition in an upper tier journal, the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bem|first=DJ|title=Feeling the future: experimental evidence for anomalous retroactive influences on cognition and affect.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=March 2011|volume=100|issue=3|pages=407\u201325|doi=10.1037/a0021524|pmid=21280961|url=http://dbem.ws/FeelingFuture.pdf}}</ref> The paper was heavily criticised and the criticism widened to include the journal itself and the validity of the peer review process.<ref>[[James Alcock]], [http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/back_from_the_future ''Back from the Future: Parapsychology and the Bem Affair''], March/April 2011 [[Skeptical Inquirer]], January 6, 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/01/06/the-esp-study-when-science-goes-psychic/when-peer-review-falters | work=The New York Times | title=Room for Debate: When Peer Review Falters | date=January 7, 2011}}</ref> Public controversy over the paper continued until in 2012 the results were published of an independent attempt to reproduce Bem's results, which failed to do so.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rouder | first1 = J. | last2 = Morey | first2 = R. | year = 2011 | title = A Bayes factor meta-analysis of Bem's ESP claim | url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2Fs13423-011-0088-7.pdf| journal = Psychonomic Bulletin & Review | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 682\u2013689 | doi=10.3758/s13423-011-0088-7| pmid = 21573926 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bem|first=Daryl|title=Response to Alcock's \"Back from the Future: Comments on Bem\"|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/response_to_alcocks_back_from_the_future_comments_on_bem|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Alcock|first=James|title=Response to Bem's Comments|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/response_to_bems_comments|date=6 January 2011|accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Galak | first1 = J. | last2 = LeBoeuf | first2 = R.

These include:\n\n* [[D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]] or identifying paramnesia, where people conjure up a false memory of a vision having occurred before the actual event.\n* [[subliminal stimuli|Unconscious perception]], where people unconsciously infer, from data they have unconsciously learned, that a certain event will probably happen in a certain context. When the event occurs, the former knowledge appears to have been acquired without the aid of recognized channels of information.\n* [[Self-fulfilling prophecy]] and unconscious enactment, where people unconsciously bring about events which they have previously imagined.\n* [[List of memory biases|Memory biases]], where people selectively distort past experiences to match subsequent events.<ref name=\"hines\">Hines (2003).</ref> In one experiment, subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a diary.

Retrofitting provides an explanation for the supposed accuracy of [[Nostradamus]]'s vague prediction.  For example, quatrain I:60 states \"A ruler born near Italy...He's less a prince than a butcher.\"  The phrase \"near Italy\" can be construed as covering a very broad range of geography, while no details are provided by Nostradamus regarding the era when this ruler will live.   Because of this vagueness, and the flexibility of retrofitting, this quatrain has been interpreted by some as referring to Napoleon, but by others as referring to the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, and by others still as a reference to Hitler.<ref name=\"Nickell SI 2019\">{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=Premonition!

Precognition also appears to violate the principle of [[causality]], that an effect cannot occur before its cause.\n\nPrecognition has been widely believed in throughout history. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many people believe it to be real; it is widely reported and remains a topic of research and discussion within the [[parapsychology]] community.\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\nSince ancient times, precognition has been associated with [[trance]] and [[dream]] states involved in phenomena such as [[prophecy]], [[fortune telling]] and [[second sight]], as well as waking premonitions. These phenomena were widely accepted and reports have persisted throughout history, with most instances appearing in dreams.<ref name=\"inglis\">Inglis (1985), Chapter on \"Precognition\"</ref>\n\nSuch claims of seeing the future have never been without their sceptical critics. [[Aristotle]] carried out an inquiry into allegedly prophetic dreams in his ''[[On Divination in Sleep]]''. He accepted that \"it is quite conceivable that some dreams may be tokens and causes [of future events]\" but also believed that \"most [so-called prophetic] dreams are, however, to be classed as mere [[coincidence]]s...\". Where [[Democritus]] had suggested that emanations from future events could be sent back to the dreamer, Aristotle proposed that it was, rather, the dreamer's sense impressions which reached forward to the event.<ref>Aristotle. (350 BC). On Prophesying by Dreams.  [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/prophesying.html Trans. J.I. Beare], MIT. (Retrieved 5 September 2018).</ref>\n\n===17th\u201319th centuries===\nThe term \"precognition\" first appeared in the 17th century but did not come into common use among investigators until much later.<ref name=\"inglis\"/>\n\nAn early investigation into claims of precognition was published by the missionary Fr. P. Boilat in 1883. He claimed to have put an unspoken question to an African [[witch-doctor]] whom he mistrusted. Contrary to his expectations, the witch-doctor gave him the correct answer without ever having heard the question.<ref name=\"inglis\"/>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn the early 20th century [[J. W. Dunne]], a British aeronautics engineer, experienced several dreams which he regarded as precognitive. He developed techniques to record and analyse them, identifying any correspondences between his future experiences and his recorded dreams. He reported his findings in his 1927 book ''[[An Experiment with Time]]''. In it he alleges that 10% of his dreams appeared to include some element of future experience. He also persuaded some friends to try the experiment on themselves, with mixed results. Dunne concluded that precognitive elements in dreams are common and that many people unknowingly have them.<ref name=\"dunne1927\">Dunne (1927).</ref><ref>[[Antony Flew|Flew, Antony]]; \"The Sources of Serialism'', in Shivesh Thakur (Ed). ''Philosophy and Psychical Research'', George Allen & Unwin Ltd. 1976, pp. 81\u201396. {{ISBN|0-04-100041-2}}</ref> He suggested also that dream precognition did not reference any kind of future event, but specifically the future experiences of the dreamer. He was led to this idea when he found that a dream of a volcanic eruption appeared to foresee not the disaster itself but his subsequent misreading of an inaccurate account in a newspaper.<ref>Sean O'Donnell, ''The Paranormal Explained''. Lulu 2007.</ref><ref name=\"dunne1927\" /> In 1932 he helped the [[Society for Psychical Research]] to conduct a more formal experiment, but he and the Society's lead researcher [[Theodore Besterman]] failed to agree on the significance of the results.<ref>Brian Inglis; ''The Paranormal: An Encyclopedia of Psychic Phenomena''.

The psychologists [[Henry Murray]] and D. R. Wheeler tested precognitive dreams by inviting the public to report any dreams of the child. A total of 1,300 dreams were reported. Only five percent envisioned the child dead and only 4 of the 1,300 envisioned the location of the grave as amongst trees. This number was no better than chance.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = D.

Rhine used a method of forced-choice matching in which participants guessed the order of a deck of 25 cards, each five of which bore one of five geometrical symbols. Although his results were positive and gained some academic acceptance, his methods were later shown to be badly flawed and subsequent researchers using more rigorous procedures were unable to reproduce his results. His mathematics was sometimes flawed, the experiments were not double-blinded or even necessarily single-blinded and some of the cards to be guessed were so thin that the symbol could be seen through the backing.<ref>[[Harold Gulliksen]].

However, from around 1940 he ran forced-choice ESP experiments in which a subject attempted to identify which of five animal pictures a subject in another room was looking at. Their performance on this task was at chance, but when the scores were matched with the card that came ''after'' the target card, three of the thirteen subjects showed a very high hit rate.<ref name=\"colman\">{{cite book|last=Colman|first=Andrew M.|title=Facts, Fallacies and Frauds in Psychology|publisher=Unwin Hyman|year=1988|pages=175\u2013180|isbn=978-0-04-445289-8}}</ref> Rhine now described Soal's work as \"a milestone in the field\".<ref name=\"colman\" /> However analyses of Soal's findings, conducted several years later, concluded that the positive results were more likely the result of deliberate fraud.<ref name=\"hyman\" /><ref name=\"hyman\">{{cite book |last=Hyman |first=Ray|authorlink= |editor=Robert J.

These include:\n\n* [[D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu]] or identifying paramnesia, where people conjure up a false memory of a vision having occurred before the actual event.\n* [[subliminal stimuli|Unconscious perception]], where people unconsciously infer, from data they have unconsciously learned, that a certain event will probably happen in a certain context. When the event occurs, the former knowledge appears to have been acquired without the aid of recognized channels of information.\n* [[Self-fulfilling prophecy]] and unconscious enactment, where people unconsciously bring about events which they have previously imagined.\n* [[List of memory biases|Memory biases]], where people selectively distort past experiences to match subsequent events.<ref name=\"hines\">Hines (2003).</ref> In one experiment, subjects were asked to write down their dreams in a diary.

Retrofitting provides an explanation for the supposed accuracy of [[Nostradamus]]'s vague prediction.  For example, quatrain I:60 states \"A ruler born near Italy...He's less a prince than a butcher.\"  The phrase \"near Italy\" can be construed as covering a very broad range of geography, while no details are provided by Nostradamus regarding the era when this ruler will live.   Because of this vagueness, and the flexibility of retrofitting, this quatrain has been interpreted by some as referring to Napoleon, but by others as referring to the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, and by others still as a reference to Hitler.<ref name=\"Nickell SI 2019\">{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=Premonition!

It was released in 1997 by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Republic Pictures]] in R-Rated and Unrated versions. It stars [[Amelia Kinkade]], [[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]], [[Gregory Calpakis]], [[Tara Slone]], [[Christian Tessier]], [[Joel Gordon]], [[Larry Day]], [[Kristen Holden-Reid]], [[Stephanie Bauder]], and Patricia Rodriguez.\n\n==Plot==\nSeveral years have passed after the massacre at St. Rita's Academy and on [[Halloween]] night, [[police officer|Officer]] Larry ([[Larry Day]]) is on night watch at Hull House, where he is confronted and murdered by Angela ([[Amelia Kinkade]]) with his own police [[badge]].\n\nBad boy Vince ([[Kristen Holden-Ried]]), his promiscuous girlfriend Lois ([[Tara Slone]]), and their friends Nick ([[Gregory Calpakis]]) and Reggie ([[Joel Gordon]]) are cruising through town in Vince's sidekick Orson's ([[Christian Tessier]]) [[van]]. They stop to pick up head [[cheerleader]] Holly (Stephanie Bauder) and her shy friend Abbie (Patricia Rodriguez), who broke down on their way to the school dance, on the side of the road. Holly remembers Nick from [[algebra]] class on the first day of school, and Nick speculates Holly likes him.\n\nWhile stopped at a [[convenience store]], Reggie tries to buy beer with his brother's fake ID, but the unfriendly clerk pulls out a [[shotgun]]. Tempers escalate, and Vince steals the gun just as two police officers enter the store. One of the officers is accidentally shot when the clerk grabs Vince, and the other shoots Reggie in the stomach twice. A fight between the officer and Vince breaks out, destroying the store. The teenagers and a wounded Reggie pile into the van, Vince brings the shotgun, and Orson steals the police officer's gun, and they drive away. Fortunately, the officer they shot is wearing a [[bulletproof vest]] and is not harmed. Lieutenant Dewhurst ([[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]]), who is due to retire at midnight that night, watches the [[security camera]] playback of what happened, and deduces that the clerk's story of a robbery is a cover for stealing the money from the [[cash register]], and that the kids are frightened teens, rather than vicious cop killers.\n\nIn the van, Vince notices that the gas tank is almost empty, and they decide to hide out at Hull House. Abbie tells Vince that the place is possessed and not to cross over the underground stream, since demons cannot cross over running water, but Vince forces them all to enter at gunpoint. Vince, trying to prove demons do not exist, taunts them and shoots a hole in the wall, causing the evil spirit that possesses the house to rush upstairs from the basement [[crematorium]] in the guise of Angela. Orson decides to stand up for himself and reveal that he has the police officer's pistol, and tells Vince that he will watch the others and Angela while Nick, Lois, and Vince make sure no one else is in the house.\n\nAngela puts on some music and does an [[erotic]] dance to distract Orson, and Abbie and Holly see this as an opportunity to escape with Reggie. Holly tries [[Hotwiring|hot wiring]] the van, but remembers that Nick is still inside. Angela begins to [[seduce]] Orson, simulating [[fellatio]] by sucking the bullets out of the gun through the barrel. Then she kisses Orson and her long, demon tongue shoots through the back of his head, killing him. Meanwhile, upstairs, Nick sneaks up on Vince and Lois who are making out, but fails to take the shotgun, and Vince fires the gun at Nick but misses. Outside, Holly hears the shot, and then overhears a voice over Larry's police radio and finds his car. Abbie leaves Reggie in the van to look for Holly, but Angela takes Abbie to a small chapel and plays on her insecurities and says she can make her an irresistible woman, and the demonic Angela kisses her and possesses her as well.\n\nThe badly wounded Reggie hears his name called, and leaves the van, only to be run over by the now possessed Orson. Abbie, who has been turned into a demonic version of her cat costume, seduces Vince until he hears the van crash. Lois, who is angry at Abbie because she thinks that she is now the perfect woman to fall in love with Vince, is scratched by Abbie after slapping her, then is pursued by Angela, who causes her hand to transform into a [[snake]] head which bites her. Holly smashes the police car window to call the police, but is attacked by Officer Larry. He chases Holly across the courtyard when she steps over the underground stream; Larry tries to step over it and is disintegrated. Nick finds Holly going back into the house to get everyone out. After encountering Orson, they hide in the attic and share a kiss. Orson appears, and Holly throws a can of [[lye]] in his face. They rush down to the hall when Dewhurst appears and he explains that he wants to help, then handcuffs them and takes them outside. Vince runs outside using Angela as a hostage. Dewhurst tells Vince that the officer he shot did not die, but Angela convinces Vince that Dewhurst is lying. Vince opens fire, but is shot through the eye and killed, and Angela returns to her demon form. The other demons appear, and Angela offers to let Dewhurst and Nick go free if Holly will willingly give up her pure and powerful soul. Holly agrees, and Angela turns Vince into a demon. The other demons make their way inside to [[Hell]].\n\nDewhurst creates a diversion, and stabs Angela with Nick's switchblade. Nick gets in the police car and rams Angela against a tree. As dawn breaks, Angela disappears inside the house. As the three make their way to the gate, Dewhurst tells Nick and Holly that they were not on the security camera at the store and no one will ever know they were there. Angela reappears just as they're about to escape and pulls Dewhurst's [[heart]] from his chest. She chases Holly and Nick and just before they cross the underground stream, Angela grabs Holly's arm. Nick ends up pulling Holly and Angela both over the stream and Angela dissolves. Holly leaves a cross made of sticks at the gate and promises she'll be back every Halloween to make sure no one ever goes inside again.  Holly and Nick then walk home and the last screen shot of the house shows the lights turning on and Angela laughing and saying \"Happy Halloween\".\n\n==Cast==\n* Larry Day as Officer Larry\n* [[Amelia Kinkade]] as [[Angela Franklin]]\n* [[Kristen Holden-Ried]] as Vince\n* Gregory Calpakis as Nick\n* [[Tara Slone]] as Lois\n* [[Christian Tessier]] as Orson\n* [[Joel Gordon]] as Reggie\n* Patricia Rodriguez as Abbie\n* Stephanie Bauder as Holly\n* Ian McDonald as Mr. Morris (Quicky Mart Clerk)\n* Richard Jutras as Officer Tony (Rookie Cop)\n* Minor Mustain as Veteran Cop\n* [[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]] as Lieutenant Dewhurst\n* Richard Zeman as Macho Cop\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reception for the film was mostly negative, with [[JoBlo.com]] stating the film was \"too routine, uninspired, badly shot and cheap to deliver as a satisfying Night of the Demons sequel\".<ref>[http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/reviews/night-of-the-demons-3 Night of the Demons 3] JoBlo.com</ref> [[Deseret News]] panned the film, writing it was \"another sequel to a horror movie no one liked the first time around\".<ref>Deseret News.

Before Compact for Success could be put into execution, SDSU staff and Sweetwater School Board teachers worked with one another to alter the curriculum in order to concur with the requirements for college admission in California. After the curriculum was adjusted, students within the Sweetwater Union School District would be guaranteed admission to San Diego State University if they could meet the five benchmarks set out by the partnership between Brand and Weber. In order to qualify for compact for success, students must remain in the Sweetwater District from 7th grade onward. Along with this the requirements for admission are: maintaining a 3.0 GPA, fulfilling all A-G requirements, passing the English and Math proficiency test, and lastly, taking the either the SAT or ACT. Along with guaranteed admission through the program, students from 7th grade onward will take multiple field trips to San Diego State University and will have mentors along the way to help guide students by helping them prepare for a higher education at a university. Compact for Success went into the execution in the fall of 2000 and with that year incoming 7th graders enrolled in the district. From 2000 to 2012, compact for success has caused an 87% increase in Sweetwater students enrolling in San Diego State University; applications increased from 789 in 2000 to 1,770 in 2012.<ref>How to Transcend, Not Reinforce, Class Distinctions at College retrieved from NationalJournal.com, may 13,2015</ref> As of 2012 compact of success has resulted in 1 of every 7 SDSU students being former Sweetwater School district students.

However, he lost in the first round, suffering a shocking three set defeat to world number 127 [[Michael Berrer]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/30702154 BBC Sport:Rafael Nadal suffers shock defeat by Michael Berrer in Doha]</ref> He won the doubles title with [[Juan M\u00f3naco]].\n\n====Australian Open====\nNadal opened his [[2015 Australian Open]] by defeating [[Mikhail Youzhny]] in straight sets. In the second round, he prevailed in a tough five-setter against American [[Tim Smyczek]], despite being visibly unwell at times during the match. He then beat [[Dudi Sela]] and [[Kevin Anderson (tennis)|Kevin Anderson]] in straight sets to advance to his 28th career Grand Slam quarterfinal. He was defeated there by [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych]], thus ending his 17-match win streak against the Czech. This resulted in Berdych becoming only the second player to defeat all four members of the [[Big Four (tennis)|Big Four]] at a Grand Slam, after [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]].\n\n===South American clay court season===\n\n====Rio Open====\nNadal reached the semifinals of the Rio Open after defeating [[Thomaz Bellucci]], [[Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta]] and [[Pablo Cuevas]]. However, he lost to [[Fabio Fognini]] in three sets in the semifinals, despite winning the first set and being a break up in the second. This was the first loss in his career against the Italian.\n\n====Argentina Open====\nNadal played in the [[ATP Buenos Aires]] tournament, in Argentina, reaching the final without losing a set. He won his first singles title of 2015 and his 46th career clay-court title with a straight-sets victory over [[Juan M\u00f3naco]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/31687217 BBC Sport]</ref>\n\n===The March Masters===\n\n====Indian Wells Masters====\nNadal reached the quarterfinals of the [[Indian Wells Masters]] after beating his first three opponents in straight sets. However, his run was ended by [[Milos Raonic]] who beat him in three tight sets after Nadal squandered three match points in the second set tiebreak.\n\n====Miami Open====\nHe next competed at the Miami Open, hoping to reach the final for the fifth time and win the tournament for the first time. He had a bye in the first round and proceeded by beating [[Nicol\u00e1s Almagro]] in straight sets but he lost to [[Fernando Verdasco]] in the next round in three sets, failing to reach the fourth round of the Miami Open for the first time since 2006 (absent in 2013).\n\n===European clay court season===\n\n====Monte-Carlo Masters====\nNadal began his favourite part of the season in the clay courts of Monte-Carlo. After a first round bye, he defeated [[Lucas Pouille]] in a straight sets match before working hard to pass through big-serving [[John Isner]] in three tough sets to book his quarterfinal spot. He defeated [[David Ferrer]] in another tight, three set match to proceed to the semifinals, and record his first win over a top 10 player since the final of the 2014 French Open. However, he was defeated by world No.1 [[Novak Djokovic]] in the semifinals in straight sets.\n\n====Barcelona Open====\nNadal received a bye in the first round of the [[2015 Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell]] and faced [[Nicol\u00e1s Almagro]] in the second round, completing his revenge for his only loss in Barcelona last year to him by beating him in straight sets. However, he was upset by [[Fabio Fognini]] in the next round in straight sets for the second time in the year. The loss made Fognini become the fifth man to beat Nadal on clay more than once after [[Gast\u00f3n Gaudio]], [[Roger Federer]], [[Novak Djokovic]], and [[David Ferrer]]. He also became the second man to beat Nadal on clay twice in a row in the same year after Djokovic in 2011.\n\n====Madrid Open====\nAfter a first round bye, Nadal had wins over [[Steve Johnson (tennis)|Steve Johnson]] and [[Simone Bolelli]], each in two sets. He faced [[Grigor Dimitrov]] in the quarterfinals and also dispatched him in straight sets.  In the semifinals, Nadal had a two set win over [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych]] to reach his seventh Madrid Open final and 41st Masters 1000 final. He lost to [[Andy Murray]] in the final in straight sets. The loss saw Nadal drop out of the Top 5 for the first time since 2005, falling to No. 7.\n\n====Italian Open====\nNadal was granted a first round bye and faced qualifier [[Marsel \u0130lhan]], dominating him in straight sets. He next faced the big-serving [[John Isner]] again in the third round and defeated him in straight sets to advance to the quarterfinals. He was taken down by [[Stan Wawrinka]] in the quarterfinals in straight sets, squandering a 6\u20132 lead in the first set tiebreak and four set points, marking the first time since 2008 that he did not reach the final at the tournament. This also marked the first time since 2004 that Nadal failed to win a single European clay court title before the [[French Open]].\n\n====French Open====\nNadal opened his campaign for a 10th French Open title by facing off against wildcard [[Quentin Halys]], beating him in straight sets. He then defeated compatriot [[Nicol\u00e1s Almagro]] and [[Andrey Kuznetsov (tennis)|Andrey Kuznetsov]], again both in straight sets. In the fourth round he defeated [[Jack Sock]] in four sets, but eventually lost to [[Novak Djokovic]] in the quarterfinals. The loss ended Nadal's 5 year winning streak at Roland Garros and was just his second loss ever at the tournament. This loss also marked the first time since 2004 that Nadal failed to win at least one of the first two Grand Slam events of the season. As a result, his ranking dropped to No. 10 in the ATP singles ranking, his lowest ranking since April 2005.\n\n===The grass season===\n\n====Stuttgart Open====\nNadal opened his  grass-court season campaign by participating in the Stuttgart Open and survived his first match against [[Marcos Baghdatis]] by beating him in three tight sets. He next faces [[Bernard Tomic]] and booked his semifinal spot by beating him in another three tight sets. Nadal reached his first grass-court tournament final since reaching the 2011 Wimbledon final by beating [[Ga\u00ebl Monfils]] in straight sets. Nadal won his third Stuttgart title and first grass-court title for the first time since winning the 2010 Wimbledon Championships by beating [[Viktor Troicki]] in straight sets in the final. It was only his 2nd title of 2015.\n\n====Queen's Club Championships====\nNadal played at the [[2015 Aegon Championships|Queen's Club]] for the first time since 2011 as the fifth seed. He was knocked out in the first round by [[Alexandr Dolgopolov]], who had previously beaten him at the [[2014 BNP Paribas Open]].\n\n====Wimbledon====\nNadal played at the [[2015 Wimbledon]] as tenth seed. After beating [[Thomaz Bellucci]] in the first round in straight sets, he was eliminated in the second round in four sets by [[Dustin Brown (tennis)|Dustin Brown]]. By winning, Brown became the first ever qualifier to ever beat Nadal at a Grand Slam.\n\n===US Open Series===\n\n====German Open====\n\nNadal decided to participate in the German Open for the first time since he defeated [[Roger Federer]] in the 2008 final in this tournament. He faced a tough opponent, [[Fernando Verdasco]], in the first round but managed to defeat him in three sets. He next faced [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Vesel\u00fd]] and easily dispatched him in straight sets followed by another straightforward quarterfinal victory against [[Pablo Cuevas]] to set a semifinal encounter with [[Andreas Seppi]], which he won again in straight sets. Nadal extended his streak of winning at least one European clay-court title every year since winning in 2004 by beating [[Fabio Fognini]] in the Hamburg final in straight sets.\n\n====Canadian Open====\n\nNadal opened his hard-court season campaign in Canada where he had won the title 3 times. He faced [[Sergiy Stakhovsky]] as his first opponent and defeated him in straight sets. He beat [[Mikhail Youzhny]] in the third round and advanced to QF, where he  lost to [[Kei Nishikori]] in straight sets. This marked the first time in eight meetings that he lost a match against the Japanese player.\n\n====Cincinnati Masters====\n\nNadal participated in the Cincinnati Masters the following week, hoping to repeat his 2013 feat by winning this tournament. He opened his campaign against Frenchman [[J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy]] and successfully defeated the Rogers Cup semi-finalist in straight sets to book his third round clash with compatriot [[Feliciano L\u00f3pez]], which he lost in three sets.\n\n====US Open====\n\nIn the final major of the season, Nadal once again faced Fognini, and again was defeated by the player from Italy, losing in the third round. In that match, Nadal won the first two sets, and previously had been 151\u20130 in Grand Slam matches that he led two sets to love(0). However, Fognini still defeated Nadal in five sets. The upset loss ended Nadal's record 10-year streak of winning at least one major, and leaving him one year short of the record 11-year streak of reaching at least one major final (shared by Lendl and Sampras).\n\n===Asian Fall & Indoor Hard Court Season===\n\n====Davis Cup====\n\nNadal and many of his Spanish compatriots made a comeback to the Spanish Davis Cup team after the captain of the Spanish Davis Cup team, Gala Leon, was fired due to several critics and rebellions from the Spanish tennis players like Nadal and Ferrer. Spain was now at the Europe Africa Zone due to several consecutive losses. Spain meets Denmark in the 1st round play-offs and easily defeated Denmark with a dominant 5\u20130 score with Rafa winning in both doubles and singles. He won against [[Mikael Torpegaard]] in straight sets.\n\n====China Open====\n\nNadal started the Asian Fall by participating in the China Open where he managed to reach the quarterfinals after beating home hope [[Wu Di (tennis)|Wu Di]] and [[Vasek Pospisil]] both in straight sets. He survived a quarterfinal test against [[Jack Sock]] after comebacking from a set down to set a fifth meeting this year with his nemesis [[Fabio Fognini]]. He succeeded in exacting revenge against Fognini by beating him in straight sets to reach his first hard-court tournament final for more than a year. Nadal lost to World No.1 [[Novak Djokovic]] in the final 2-6, 2-6.\n\n====Shanghai Masters====\n\nNadal received a first round bye into this ATP Masters 1000 event and faced [[Ivo Karlovi\u0107]] in the second round.  Nadal won the first set 7-5 after initially trailing 3-5 but Karlovic forced the second set to a decider which he won 6-7(4).  After 2 hours and 44 minutes, Nadal prevailed in the third and final set decider 7-6(4) and won the match. Nadal then avenged his Indian Wells quarterfinals lost against [[Milos Raonic]] by beating him in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals. He defeated World No.4 and 2015 French Open Champion [[Stan Wawrinka]] in straight sets to reach his first semifinal of a Masters 1000 hard-court tournament in more than a year and with this win, Nadal qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals. Despite sporting an 8-3 head-to-head winning record against [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]],  Nadal fell to the Frenchman in the semi-finals in three sets 4\u20136, 6\u20130, 5\u20137.\n\n====Swiss Indoors====\n\nNadal participated in the Swiss Indoors ATP 500 at Basel and survived a scare in the first round against [[Luk\u00e1\u0161 Rosol]] by beating him in a comeback three-setter where Rosol was 2 points away from winning at the 2nd set at 5-4 on his own serve. In Nadal's next match against [[Grigor Dimitrov]], Rafa battled back from a break down in the final set to defeat Dimitrov 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 to reach the Swiss Indoors quarter-finals. Nadal came back from a set and a break down to surpass big-serving Croatian [[Marin \u010cili\u0107]] in three sets. Nadal reached the second final in a hard-court tournament of the season when he beat Frenchman [[Richard Gasquet]] in straight sets to set his first meeting for almost 2 years with long-time rival [[Roger Federer]]. However, in his first final at the Swiss Indoor, Nadal lost 3-6, 7-5, 3-6 to Federer.\n\n====Paris Masters====\n\nNadal, seeded 7th, received a bye into the Round of 32 of the Paris Masters in Paris, France.  Rafa rolled into the Round of 16 with a 6-2, 6-2 win, his 2nd in back-to-back weeks, over [[Luk\u00e1\u0161 Rosol]], the 66th-ranked Czech, in just over an hour. Nadal then took on the big hitting South African [[Kevin Anderson (tennis)|Kevin Anderson]] and made another comeback from a set down and 5-6 down in the second set tie-break, saving a match point and closing out the match by breaking twice in the third set. Nadal faced world No.4 [[Stan Wawrinka]] in the quarterfinals and despite pushing both sets to a tiebreaker, Rafa lost the match 6\u20137<sup>(8\u201310)</sup>, 6\u20137<sup>(7\u20139)</sup>.\n\n===ATP World Tour Finals===\n\nRafael Nadal was seeded fifth in the [[2015 ATP World Tour Finals \u2013 Singles|2015 ATP World Tour Finals]] in London and was drawn in the Ilie N\u0103stase Group alongside [[Andy Murray]], [[David Ferrer]] and [[Stan Wawrinka]]. He first played against Wawrinka and successfully crushed his nemesis in straight sets. Nadal continued his blistering resurgence of form by dominating a fellow Big Four, Murray, in straight sets to claim a semifinal spot in the ATP Finals. He then beat Ferrer in three sets, advancing to the semifinals with three wins. But he then lost to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.\n\n==All matches==\n{{performance key}}\n\n===Singles matches===\n{{tennis sm header}}\n<!-- 2015 Qatar Open -->\n{{tennis sm

detail==\n\n===Australian Open Series===\n\n====Qatar Open====\nNadal began the year as the defending champion at the Qatar Open. However, he lost in the first round, suffering a shocking three set defeat to world number 127 [[Michael Berrer]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/30702154 BBC Sport:Rafael Nadal suffers shock defeat by Michael Berrer in Doha]</ref> He won the doubles title with [[Juan M\u00f3naco]].\n\n====Australian Open====\nNadal opened his [[2015 Australian Open]] by defeating [[Mikhail Youzhny]] in straight sets. In the second round, he prevailed in a tough five-setter against American [[Tim Smyczek]], despite being visibly unwell at times during the match. He then beat [[Dudi Sela]] and [[Kevin Anderson (tennis)|Kevin Anderson]] in straight sets to advance to his 28th career Grand Slam quarterfinal. He was defeated there by [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych]], thus ending his 17-match win streak against the Czech. This resulted in Berdych becoming only the second player to defeat all four members of the [[Big Four (tennis)|Big Four]] at a Grand Slam, after [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]].\n\n===South American clay court season===\n\n====Rio Open====\nNadal reached the semifinals of the Rio Open after defeating [[Thomaz Bellucci]], [[Pablo Carre\u00f1o Busta]] and [[Pablo Cuevas]]. However, he lost to [[Fabio Fognini]] in three sets in the semifinals, despite winning the first set and being a break up in the second. This was the first loss in his career against the Italian.\n\n====Argentina Open====\nNadal played in the [[ATP Buenos Aires]] tournament, in Argentina, reaching the final without losing a set. He won his first singles title of 2015 and his 46th career clay-court title with a straight-sets victory over [[Juan M\u00f3naco]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/31687217 BBC Sport]</ref>\n\n===The March Masters===\n\n====Indian Wells Masters====\nNadal reached the quarterfinals of the [[Indian Wells Masters]] after beating his first three opponents in straight sets. However, his run was ended by [[Milos Raonic]] who beat him in three tight sets after Nadal squandered three match points in the second set tiebreak.\n\n====Miami Open====\nHe next competed at the Miami Open, hoping to reach the final for the fifth time and win the tournament for the first time. He had a bye in the first round and proceeded by beating [[Nicol\u00e1s Almagro]] in straight sets but he lost to [[Fernando Verdasco]] in the next round in three sets, failing to reach the fourth round of the Miami Open for the first time since 2006 (absent in 2013).\n\n===European clay court season===\n\n====Monte-Carlo Masters====\nNadal began his favourite part of the season in the clay courts of Monte-Carlo. After a first round bye, he defeated [[Lucas Pouille]] in a straight sets match before working hard to pass through big-serving [[John Isner]] in three tough sets to book his quarterfinal spot. He defeated [[David Ferrer]] in another tight, three set match to proceed to the semifinals, and record his first win over a top 10 player since the final of the 2014 French Open. However, he was defeated by world No.1 [[Novak Djokovic]] in the semifinals in straight sets.\n\n====Barcelona Open====\nNadal received a bye in the first round of the [[2015 Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell]] and faced [[Nicol\u00e1s Almagro]] in the second round, completing his revenge for his only loss in Barcelona last year to him by beating him in straight sets. However, he was upset by [[Fabio Fognini]] in the next round in straight sets for the second time in the year. The loss made Fognini become the fifth man to beat Nadal on clay more than once after [[Gast\u00f3n Gaudio]], [[Roger Federer]], [[Novak Djokovic]], and [[David Ferrer]]. He also became the second man to beat Nadal on clay twice in a row in the same year after Djokovic in 2011.\n\n====Madrid Open====\nAfter a first round bye, Nadal had wins over [[Steve Johnson (tennis)|Steve Johnson]] and [[Simone Bolelli]], each in two sets. He faced [[Grigor Dimitrov]] in the quarterfinals and also dispatched him in straight sets.  In the semifinals, Nadal had a two set win over [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych]] to reach his seventh Madrid Open final and 41st Masters 1000 final. He lost to [[Andy Murray]] in the final in straight sets. The loss saw Nadal drop out of the Top 5 for the first time since 2005, falling to No. 7.\n\n====Italian Open====\nNadal was granted a first round bye and faced qualifier [[Marsel \u0130lhan]], dominating him in straight sets. He next faced the big-serving [[John Isner]] again in the third round and defeated him in straight sets to advance to the quarterfinals. He was taken down by [[Stan Wawrinka]] in the quarterfinals in straight sets, squandering a 6\u20132 lead in the first set tiebreak and four set points, marking the first time since 2008 that he did not reach the final at the tournament. This also marked the first time since 2004 that Nadal failed to win a single European clay court title before the [[French Open]].\n\n====French Open====\nNadal opened his campaign for a 10th French Open title by facing off against wildcard [[Quentin Halys]], beating him in straight sets. He then defeated compatriot [[Nicol\u00e1s Almagro]] and [[Andrey Kuznetsov (tennis)|Andrey Kuznetsov]], again both in straight sets. In the fourth round he defeated [[Jack Sock]] in four sets, but eventually lost to [[Novak Djokovic]] in the quarterfinals. The loss ended Nadal's 5 year winning streak at Roland Garros and was just his second loss ever at the tournament. This loss also marked the first time since 2004 that Nadal failed to win at least one of the first two Grand Slam events of the season. As a result, his ranking dropped to No. 10 in the ATP singles ranking, his lowest ranking since April 2005.\n\n===The grass season===\n\n====Stuttgart Open====\nNadal opened his  grass-court season campaign by participating in the Stuttgart Open and survived his first match against [[Marcos Baghdatis]] by beating him in three tight sets. He next faces [[Bernard Tomic]] and booked his semifinal spot by beating him in another three tight sets. Nadal reached his first grass-court tournament final since reaching the 2011 Wimbledon final by beating [[Ga\u00ebl Monfils]] in straight sets. Nadal won his third Stuttgart title and first grass-court title for the first time since winning the 2010 Wimbledon Championships by beating [[Viktor Troicki]] in straight sets in the final. It was only his 2nd title of 2015.\n\n====Queen's Club Championships====\nNadal played at the [[2015 Aegon Championships|Queen's Club]] for the first time since 2011 as the fifth seed. He was knocked out in the first round by [[Alexandr Dolgopolov]], who had previously beaten him at the [[2014 BNP Paribas Open]].\n\n====Wimbledon====\nNadal played at the [[2015 Wimbledon]] as tenth seed. After beating [[Thomaz Bellucci]] in the first round in straight sets, he was eliminated in the second round in four sets by [[Dustin Brown (tennis)|Dustin Brown]]. By winning, Brown became the first ever qualifier to ever beat Nadal at a Grand Slam.\n\n===US Open Series===\n\n====German Open====\n\nNadal decided to participate in the German Open for the first time since he defeated [[Roger Federer]] in the 2008 final in this tournament. He faced a tough opponent, [[Fernando Verdasco]], in the first round but managed to defeat him in three sets. He next faced [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Vesel\u00fd]] and easily dispatched him in straight sets followed by another straightforward quarterfinal victory against [[Pablo Cuevas]] to set a semifinal encounter with [[Andreas Seppi]], which he won again in straight sets. Nadal extended his streak of winning at least one European clay-court title every year since winning in 2004 by beating [[Fabio Fognini]] in the Hamburg final in straight sets.\n\n====Canadian Open====\n\nNadal opened his hard-court season campaign in Canada where he had won the title 3 times. He faced [[Sergiy Stakhovsky]] as his first opponent and defeated him in straight sets. He beat [[Mikhail Youzhny]] in the third round and advanced to QF, where he  lost to [[Kei Nishikori]] in straight sets. This marked the first time in eight meetings that he lost a match against the Japanese player.\n\n====Cincinnati Masters====\n\nNadal participated in the Cincinnati Masters the following week, hoping to repeat his 2013 feat by winning this tournament. He opened his campaign against Frenchman [[J\u00e9r\u00e9my Chardy]] and successfully defeated the Rogers Cup semi-finalist in straight sets to book his third round clash with compatriot [[Feliciano L\u00f3pez]], which he lost in three sets.\n\n====US Open====\n\nIn the final major of the season, Nadal once again faced Fognini, and again was defeated by the player from Italy, losing in the third round. In that match, Nadal won the first two sets, and previously had been 151\u20130 in Grand Slam matches that he led two sets to love(0). However, Fognini still defeated Nadal in five sets. The upset loss ended Nadal's record 10-year streak of winning at least one major, and leaving him one year short of the record 11-year streak of reaching at least one major final (shared by Lendl and Sampras).\n\n===Asian Fall & Indoor Hard Court Season===\n\n====Davis Cup====\n\nNadal and many of his Spanish compatriots made a comeback to the Spanish Davis Cup team after the captain of the Spanish Davis Cup team, Gala Leon, was fired due to several critics and rebellions from the Spanish tennis players like Nadal and Ferrer. Spain was now at the Europe Africa Zone due to several consecutive losses. Spain meets Denmark in the 1st round play-offs and easily defeated Denmark with a dominant 5\u20130 score with Rafa winning in both doubles and singles. He won against [[Mikael Torpegaard]] in straight sets.\n\n====China Open====\n\nNadal started the Asian Fall by participating in the China Open where he managed to reach the quarterfinals after beating home hope [[Wu Di (tennis)|Wu Di]] and [[Vasek Pospisil]] both in straight sets. He survived a quarterfinal test against [[Jack Sock]] after comebacking from a set down to set a fifth meeting this year with his nemesis [[Fabio Fognini]]. He succeeded in exacting revenge against Fognini by beating him in straight sets to reach his first hard-court tournament final for more than a year. Nadal lost to World No.1 [[Novak Djokovic]] in the final 2-6, 2-6.\n\n====Shanghai Masters====\n\nNadal received a first round bye into this ATP Masters 1000 event and faced [[Ivo Karlovi\u0107]] in the second round.  Nadal won the first set 7-5 after initially trailing 3-5 but Karlovic forced the second set to a decider which he won 6-7(4).  After 2 hours and 44 minutes, Nadal prevailed in the third and final set decider 7-6(4) and won the match. Nadal then avenged his Indian Wells quarterfinals lost against [[Milos Raonic]] by beating him in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals. He defeated World No.4 and 2015 French Open Champion [[Stan Wawrinka]] in straight sets to reach his first semifinal of a Masters 1000 hard-court tournament in more than a year and with this win, Nadal qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals. Despite sporting an 8-3 head-to-head winning record against [[Jo-Wilfried Tsonga]],  Nadal fell to the Frenchman in the semi-finals in three sets 4\u20136, 6\u20130, 5\u20137.\n\n====Swiss Indoors====\n\nNadal participated in the Swiss Indoors ATP 500 at Basel and survived a scare in the first round against [[Luk\u00e1\u0161 Rosol]] by beating him in a comeback three-setter where Rosol was 2 points away from winning at the 2nd set at 5-4 on his own serve. In Nadal's next match against [[Grigor Dimitrov]], Rafa battled back from a break down in the final set to defeat Dimitrov 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 to reach the Swiss Indoors quarter-finals. Nadal came back from a set and a break down to surpass big-serving Croatian [[Marin \u010cili\u0107]] in three sets. Nadal reached the second final in a hard-court tournament of the season when he beat Frenchman [[Richard Gasquet]] in straight sets to set his first meeting for almost 2 years with long-time rival [[Roger Federer]]. However, in his first final at the Swiss Indoor, Nadal lost 3-6, 7-5, 3-6 to Federer.\n\n====Paris Masters====\n\nNadal, seeded 7th, received a bye into the Round of 32 of the Paris Masters in Paris, France.  Rafa rolled into the Round of 16 with a 6-2, 6-2 win, his 2nd in back-to-back weeks, over [[Luk\u00e1\u0161 Rosol]], the 66th-ranked Czech, in just over an hour. Nadal then took on the big hitting South African [[Kevin Anderson (tennis)|Kevin Anderson]] and made another comeback from a set down and 5-6 down in the second set tie-break, saving a match point and closing out the match by breaking twice in the third set. Nadal faced world No.4 [[Stan Wawrinka]] in the quarterfinals and despite pushing both sets to a tiebreaker, Rafa lost the match 6\u20137<sup>(8\u201310)</sup>, 6\u20137<sup>(7\u20139)</sup>.\n\n===ATP World Tour Finals===\n\nRafael Nadal was seeded fifth in the [[2015 ATP World Tour Finals \u2013 Singles|2015 ATP World Tour Finals]] in London and was drawn in the Ilie N\u0103stase Group alongside [[Andy Murray]], [[David Ferrer]] and [[Stan Wawrinka]]. He first played against Wawrinka and successfully crushed his nemesis in straight sets. Nadal continued his blistering resurgence of form by dominating a fellow Big Four, Murray, in straight sets to claim a semifinal spot in the ATP Finals. He then beat Ferrer in three sets, advancing to the semifinals with three wins. But he then lost to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.\n\n==All matches==\n{{performance key}}\n\n===Singles matches===\n{{tennis sm header}}\n<!-- 2015 Qatar Open -->\n{{tennis sm
