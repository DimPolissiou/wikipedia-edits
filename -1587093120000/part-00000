{"title_page": "Virtual finite-state machine", "text_new": "{{Underlinked|date=February 2014}}\n\nA '''virtual finite state machine''' ('''VFSM''') is a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) defined in a [[#Virtual Environment|Virtual Environment]]. The VFSM concept provides a software specification method to describe the behaviour of a control system using assigned names of input control properties and of output actions.\n\nThe VFSM method introduces an execution model and facilitates  the idea of an executable specification. This technology is mainly used in complex machine control, instrumentation and telecommunication applications.\n\n== Why ==\nThe major problem by implementing of a state machine is the generation of logical conditions (State transition conditions and Action conditions). In the hardware environment, where state machines have found their original use, this problem does not exist: all signals are Boolean. In contrary the state machines specified and implemented in the software require logical conditions that are per se multivalued ones.\n\nExamples:<br>\n-\tTemperature can be at least Low , OK, High<br>\n-\tCommands may have several values: Init, Start, Stop, Break, Continue<br>\n-\tIn a (hierarchical) system of state machines the Slaves state machines have many states that are used in conditions of a Master state machine.<br>\nIn addition many input signals can be not known due for instance to a broken cable which means that even a digital input signals (considered as classical Boolean values) are in fact 3 values signals: Low, High, Unknown. The Temperature example needs probably also the value Unknown.\n\nA Positive Logical Algebra solves this problem by creating a Virtual Environment which allows specification of state machines for software using multivalued variables.\n\n== Control Properties ==\nA variable in the VFSM environment may have one or more values which are relevant for the control &ndash; in such a case it is an input variable. Those values are the control properties of this variable. Control properties are not necessarily specific data values but are rather certain states of the variable. For instance, a digital variable could provide three control properties: TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN according to its possible boolean values. A numerical (analog) input variable has control properties such as: LOW, HIGH, OK, BAD, UNKNOWN according to its range of desired values. A timer can have its OVER state (time-out occurred) as its most significant control value; other values could be STOPPED, RUNNING etc...\n\n== Actions ==\nA variable in the VFSM environment may be activated by actions - in such a case it is an output variable. For instance, a digital output has two actions: True and False. A numerical (analog) output variable has an action: Set. A timer which is both: an input and output variable can be  triggered by actions like: Start, Stop or Reset.\n\n== Virtual Environment ==\nThe virtual environment characterises the environment in which a VFSM operates. It is defined by three sets of names:\n*'''input names''' represent the control properties of all available variables\n*'''output names''' represent the available actions on the variables\n*'''state names''', as defined  for each of the states of the  FSM.\nThe input names  build virtual conditions to perform state transitions or input actions. The virtual conditions are built using the '''[[Boolean algebra|positive logic algebra]]'''. The output names  trigger actions (entry actions, exit actions, input actions or transition actions).\n\n[[Image:Virtual finite state machine executor in the virtual environment.gif|thumbnail|Figure 1: VFSM in the Virtual Environment]]\n\nA '''virtual finite state machine''' is a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) defined in a [[virtual environment]]. The VFSM concept provides a software specification method to describe the behaviour of a control system using assigned names of input '''control properties''' and of output '''actions'''.\n\nThe VFSM method introduces an execution model and facilitates  the idea of an '''executable specification'''. This technology is mainly used in complex machine control, instrumentation and telecommunication applications.\n\n== Positive Logic Algebra ==\nThe rules to build a virtual condition are as follows:\n\n=== Input Names and Virtual Input ===\nA state of an input is described by Input Names which create a set.\n\nFor instance:<br>\n- for the input A: Anames = {''A1'', ''A2'', ''A3''}<br>\n- for the input B: Bnames = {''B1'', ''B2''}<br>\n- for the input C: Cnames = {''C1'', ''C2'', ''C3'', ''C4'', ''C5''}<br>\netc.\n\nVirtual Input VI is a set of mutually exclusive elements of input names. A VI contains always the element always.\n\nExamples:<br>\nVI = {''always''}<br>\nVI = {''always'', ''A1''}<br>\nVI = {''always'', ''A1'', ''B2'', ''C4''}\n\n=== Logical operations on Input Names ===\n'''&''' (AND) operation is a set of input names.\n\nFor instance<br>\n\t''A1'' & ''B3'' & ''C2''= > {''A1'', ''B3'', ''C2''}\n\n'''|''' (OR) operation is a table of sets of input names.\n\nFor instance<br>\n''A1'' | ''B3'' | ''C2'' => <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\{ & A1 & \\} \\\\\n\\{ & B3 & \\} \\\\\n\\{ & C2 & \\} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\n'''~''' (Complement) is a complement of a set of input names.\n\nFor instance<br>\n\t ~''A2'' = {''A1'', ''A3''}\n\n=== Logical expression ===\nA logical expression is an OR-table of AND-sets (corresponds to disjunctive form of a boolean expression).\n\nFor instance:<br>\n''A1'' & ''B3'' | ''A1'' & ''B2'' & ''C4'' | ''C2''  => <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\{ & A1 & B3 & \\} \\\\\n\\{ & A1 & B2 & C4 & \\} \\\\\n\\{ & C2 & \\} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}</math><br>\nLogical expressions are used to express any logical function.\n\n=== Evaluation of a logical expression ===\nThe logical value (true, false) of a logical expression is calculated by testing whether any of the AND-sets in the OR-table is a subset of VI.\n\n=== Output Names and Virtual Output ===\nA state of an output is described by Output Names which create a set.\n\nFor instance:<br>\nfor an output Xnames = {''X1'', ''X2''}<br>\nfor an output Ynames = {''Y1'', ''Y2'', ''Y3''}<br>\nVirtual output VO is a set of mutually exclusive elements of output names.\n\n=== Virtual Environment===\nThe Virtual Name and Virtual Output completed by State Names create a Virtual Environment VE where the behavior is specified.\n\n== VFSM Execution Model ==\n[[Image:Virtual finite state machine executor flow chart.gif|thumbnail|Figure 2: VFSM Executor Flow Chart]]\nA subset of all defined input names, which can exist only in a certain situation, is called virtual input (VI). For instance temperature can be either \"too low\", \"good\" or \"too high\". Although there are three input names defined, only one of them can exist in a real situation. This one builds the VI.\n\nA subset of all defined output names, which can  exist only in a certain situation is called virtual output (VO). VO is built by the current action(s) of the VFSM.\n\nThe behaviour specification is built by a state table which describes all details of all states of the VFSM.\n\nThe VFSM executor is triggered by VI and the current state of the VFSM. In consideration of the  behaviour specification of the current state, the VO is set.\n\nFigure 2 shows one possible implementation of a VFSM executor. Based on this implementation a typical behaviour characteristics must be considered.\n\n== State Table ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Finite state machine]] -->\n:''main page: [[state transition table]].''\nA ''state table'' defines all details of the behaviour of a state of a VFSM. It consists of three columns: in the first column state names are used, in the second the virtual conditions built out of input names using the positive logic algebra are placed and in the third column the output names appear:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! State Name\n! Condition(s)\n!

The following lines which do not provide the next state represent the input actions. Finally the lines providing the next state represent the state transition conditions and transition actions. All fields are optional. A pure combinatorial VFSM is possible in case only where input actions are used, but no state transitions are defined. The transition action can be replaced by the proper use of other actions.\n\n== Tools ==\n*[http://www.stateworks.com StateWORKS]: an implementation of the VFSM concept\n*[http://www.hutonggames.com/index.html PlayMaker]: implements the VFSM concept as a method of \"visual scripting\" the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity game engine]]\n\n== References ==\n*Wagner, F., \"Modeling Software with Finite State Machines: A Practical Approach\", Rosa Fischer-L\u00f6w Verlag 1994, {{ISBN|3-929465-04-3}}\n*Wagner, F., \"The Virtual Finite State Machines: Executable Control Flow Specification\", Auerbach Publications, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8493-8086-3}}\n*[http://www.stateworks.com/active/download/wagf92-software-engineering.pdf VFSM Executable Specification], CompEuro 1992 Proceedings\n*[http://www.stateworks.com/active/download/wagf04-2-state-machine-misunderstandings.pdf State machine misunderstandings], IEE journal \"Computing and Control Engineering\", 1997\n*[http://www.stateworks.com/active/download/wagf03-1-real-time-software-design.pdf A Modern Real-Time Software Design Tool: Applying Lessons from Leo], IEE journal \"Computing and Control Engineering\", 2003\n*[http://www.stateworks.com/active/download/wagf03-2-modeling-reliable-software.pdf Modelling and Building Reliable, Re-usable Software.], Engineering of Computer -Based Software 2003 (ECBS'03) Proceedings\n*[http://www.stateworks.com/active/download/wagf04-1-software-modelling.pdf Closing the Gap Between Software Modelling and Code], Engineering of Computer -Based Software 2004 (ECBS'04) Proceedings\n*[http://www.stateworks.com/active/download/XML-VFSM-ML.pdf], Wagner, T., \"VFSMML - XML standard for VFSM\", 2004\n*[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bltj.2035], \"The virtual finite\u2010state machine design and implementation paradigm\", Bell Labs Technical Journal / Volume 2, Issue1, 2002\n\n[[Category:Models of computation]]\n", "text_old": "{{Underlinked|date=February 2014}}\n\nA '''virtual finite state machine''' ('''VFSM''') is a [[finite state machine]] (FSM) defined in a [[#Virtual Environment|Virtual Environment]].

(A separate theory, [[general relativity]], is used for gravity.) In this model, the [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] in nature arise from properties of our universe called [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge invariance]] and [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. The forces are [[force carrier|transmitted by particles]] known as [[gauge boson]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=49\u201352}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=603\u2013604}}</ref>\n\n=== The problem of gauge boson mass ===\nField theories had been used with great success in understanding the [[electromagnetic field]] and the [[strong force]], but by around 1960 all attempts to create a ''gauge invariant'' theory for the [[weak force]] (and its combination with [[fundamental interaction|fundamental force]] [[electromagnetism]], the [[electroweak interaction]]) had consistently failed, with gauge theories thereby starting to fall into disrepute as a result. The problem was that [[gauge theory]] contains [[symmetry]] requirements, and these incorrectly predicted that the weak force's gauge bosons ([[W and Z bosons|W and Z]]) should have zero mass. It is known from experiments that they have non-zero mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=372\u2013373}}</ref> This meant that either gauge invariance was an incorrect approach, or something else{{snd}} unknown{{snd}} was giving these particles their mass. However, all attempts to suggest a theory able to solve this problem just seemed to create new theoretical problems.\n\nBy the late 1950s, physicists had not resolved these issues, which were significant obstacles to developing a full-fledged theory for particle physics.\n\n=== Symmetry breaking ===\nBy the early 1960s, physicists had realised that [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|a given symmetry law might not always be followed]] under certain conditions, at least in some areas of physics.<ref group=lower-alpha>It is quite common for a law of physics to hold true only if certain assumptions held true or only under certain conditions. For example, [[Newton's laws of motion]] apply only at speeds where [[Special relativity|relativistic effects]] are negligible; and laws related to conductivity, gases, and classical physics (as opposed to quantum mechanics) may apply only within certain ranges of size, temperature, pressure, or other conditions.</ref> This is called [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry breaking]] and was recognised in the late 1950s by [[Yoichiro Nambu]]. Symmetry breaking can lead to surprising and unexpected results. In 1962 physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]]{{snd}} an expert in [[superconductivity]]{{snd}} wrote a paper that considered symmetry breaking in particle physics, and suggested that perhaps symmetry breaking might be the missing piece needed to solve the problems of gauge invariance in particle physics. If electroweak symmetry was somehow being broken, it might explain why electromagnetism's boson is massless, yet the weak force bosons have mass, and solve the problems. Shortly afterwards, in 1963, this was shown to be theoretically possible, at least for some limited ([[special relativity|non-relativistic]]) cases.\n\n=== Higgs mechanism ===\n{{Main|Higgs mechanism|Standard Model}}\nFollowing the 1962 and 1963 papers, three groups of researchers independently published the [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]] with similar conclusions and for all cases, not just some limited cases. They showed that the conditions for electroweak symmetry would be \"broken\" if an unusual type of [[field (physics)|field]] existed throughout the universe, and indeed, some fundamental particles would [[mass generation|acquire mass]]. The field required for this to happen (which was purely hypothetical at the time) became known as the ''Higgs field'' (after [[Peter Higgs]], one of the researchers) and the mechanism by which it led to symmetry breaking, known as the ''[[Higgs mechanism]]''. A key feature of the necessary field is that it would take ''less'' energy for the field to have a non-zero value than a zero value, unlike all other known fields, therefore, the Higgs field has a non-zero value (or ''vacuum expectation'') ''everywhere''. It was the first proposal capable of showing how the weak force gauge bosons could have mass despite their governing symmetry, within a gauge invariant theory.\n\nAlthough these ideas did not gain much initial support or attention, by 1972 they had been developed into a comprehensive theory and proved capable of giving [[renormalization|\"sensible\" results]] that accurately described particles known at the time, and which, with exceptional accuracy, [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predicted several other particles discovered during the following years]].<ref name=\"predictions\" group=lower-alpha>The success of the Higgs-based electroweak theory and Standard Model is illustrated by their [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predictions]] of the mass of two particles later detected: the W boson (predicted mass: {{nowrap|80.390 \u00b1 0.018 GeV}}, experimental measurement: {{nowrap|80.387 \u00b1 0.019 GeV}}), and the Z boson (predicted mass: {{nowrap|91.1874 \u00b1 0.0021}}, experimental measurement: {{nowrap|91.1876 \u00b1 0.0021 GeV}}). Other accurate predictions included the [[weak neutral current]], the [[gluon]], and the [[top quark|top]] and [[charm quark]]s, all later proven to exist as the theory said.</ref> During the 1970s these theories rapidly became the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics. \n\n===Higgs field===\nThe Standard Model includes a [[field (physics)|field]] of the kind needed to \"break\" electroweak symmetry and give particles their correct mass. This field, called the \"Higgs Field\", exists throughout space, and it breaks some symmetry laws of the [[electroweak interaction]]. Via the Higgs mechanism, this field causes the gauge bosons of the weak force to be massive at all temperatures below an extreme high value.<ref group=lower-alpha>Electroweak symmetry is broken by the Higgs field in its lowest energy state, called its ''[[ground state]]''. At high energy levels this does not happen, and the gauge bosons of the weak force would be expected to become massless above those energy levels.</ref> When the weak force bosons acquire mass, this affects their range, which  becomes very small, matching experimental findings.{{#tag:ref |The range of a force is inversely proportional to the mass of the particles transmitting it.<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Shu |first=F.

The movement and interactions of these particles with each other are limited by the energy\u2013time [[uncertainty principle]]. As a result, the more massive a single virtual particle is, the greater its energy, and therefore the shorter the distance it can travel. A particle's mass therefore, determines the maximum distance at which it can interact with other particles and on any force it mediates. By the same token, the reverse is also true: massless and near-massless particles can carry long distance forces. ''(See also: [[Compton wavelength]] and [[static forces and virtual-particle exchange]])'' Since experiments have shown that the weak force acts over only a very short range, this implies that massive gauge bosons must exist, and indeed, their masses have since been confirmed by measurement.|group=lower-alpha |name=\"massvsrange\"}} Furthermore, it was later realised that the same field would also explain, in a different way, why other fundamental constituents of matter (including [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s) have mass.\n\nUnlike all other known fields such as the [[electromagnetic field]], the Higgs field is a [[scalar field|scalar]] field, and has a non-zero constant value in [[Vacuum state|vacuum]]. \n\n=== The \"central problem\"===\nThere was not yet any direct evidence that the Higgs field existed, but even without proof of the field, the accuracy of its predictions led scientists to believe the theory might be true. By the 1980s the question of whether or not the Higgs field existed, and therefore whether or not the entire Standard Model was correct, had come to be regarded as one of the most important [[Unanswered questions in physics|unanswered questions in particle physics]].\n\nFor many decades, scientists had no way to determine whether or not the Higgs field existed, because the technology needed for its detection did not exist at that time. If the Higgs field did exist, then it would be unlike any other known fundamental field, but it also was possible that these key ideas, or even the entire Standard Model, were somehow incorrect.<ref group=lower-alpha>By the 1960s, many had already started to see gauge theories as failing to explain particle physics, because theorists had been unable to solve the mass problem or even explain how gauge theory could provide a solution. So the idea that the Standard Model{{snd}} which relied on a Higgs field, not yet proved to exist{{snd}} could be fundamentally incorrect, was not unreasonable. Against this, once the model was developed around 1972, no better theory existed, and its predictions and solutions were so accurate, that it became the preferred theory anyway. It then became crucial to science, to know whether or not it was ''correct''.</ref> \n\nThe hypothesised Higgs mechanism made several accurate predictions.<ref name=\"predictions\" group=lower-alpha /><ref name=\"L&T\" />{{rp|22}} One important prediction was that a matching [[subatomic particle|particle]] called the \"Higgs boson\" should also exist. Only proving the existence of the Higgs boson, and therefore the Higgs field, would solve the problem. Therefore there was an extensive [[search for the Higgs boson]], as a way to prove the Higgs field itself existed.<ref name=\"OnyisiFAQ\" /><ref name=\"strasslerFAQ2\" />\n\nThe existence of the Higgs field became the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics, and for several decades was considered \"the central problem in particle physics\".<ref name=\"Proceedings_1986\" /><ref name=\"Higgs_Hunters_Guide\" />\n\n===Search and discovery===\nAlthough the Higgs field exists everywhere, proving its existence was far from easy. In principle, it can be proved to exist by detecting its [[excited state|excitations]], which manifest as Higgs particles (the ''Higgs boson''), but these are extremely difficult to produce and detect, due to the energy required to produce them and their very rare production even if the energy is sufficient. It was therefore several decades before the first evidence of the Higgs boson was found.

It is also very unstable, [[particle decay|decaying]] into other particles almost immediately. The Higgs field is a [[scalar field|scalar]] [[field (physics)|field]], with two neutral and two electrically charged components that form a complex [[doublet (physics)|doublet]] of the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]] symmetry. The Higgs field has a \"[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking#Mexican hat potential|Mexican hat-shaped]]\" potential. In its [[vacuum state|ground state]], this causes the field to have a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), and as a result, below a very high energy it breaks the [[weak isospin]] symmetry of the [[electroweak interaction]]. (Technically the non-zero expectation value converts the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]'s Yukawa coupling terms into mass terms.) When this happens, three components of the Higgs field are \"absorbed\" by the SU(2) and U(1) [[gauge boson]]s (the \"[[Higgs mechanism]]\") to become the longitudinal components of the [[mass generation|now-massive]] [[W and Z bosons]] of the [[weak force]]. The remaining electrically neutral component either manifests as a Higgs particle, or may couple separately to other particles known as [[fermion]]s (via [[Yukawa coupling]]s), causing these to [[mass generation|acquire mass]] as well.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqNg819PiZY Demystifying the Higgs Boson with Leonard Susskind], [[Leonard Susskind]] presents an explanation of what the Higgs mechanism is, and what it means to \"give mass to particles.\" He also explains what's at stake for the future of physics and cosmology. 2012-07-30.</ref>\n\n== Significance ==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}\n{{originalresearch-section|date=January 2015}}\nEvidence of the Higgs field and its properties has been extremely significant for many reasons. The importance of the Higgs boson is largely that it is able to be examined using existing knowledge and experimental technology, as a way to confirm and study the entire Higgs field theory.<ref name=\"OnyisiFAQ\" /><ref name=\"strasslerFAQ2\" /> Conversely, proof that the Higgs field and boson do ''not'' exist would have also been significant.\n\n=== Particle physics ===\n==== Validation of the Standard Model ====\nThe Higgs boson validates the [[Standard Model]] through the mechanism of [[mass generation]]. As more precise measurements of its properties are made, more advanced extensions may be suggested or excluded. As experimental means to measure the field's behaviours and interactions are developed, this fundamental field may be better understood. If the Higgs field had not been discovered, the Standard Model would have needed to be modified or superseded.\n\nRelated to this, a belief generally exists among physicists that there is likely to be \"new\" [[physics beyond the Standard Model]], and the Standard Model will at some point be extended or superseded. The Higgs discovery, as well as the many measured collisions occurring at the LHC, provide physicists a sensitive tool to search their data for any evidence that the Standard Model seems to fail, and could provide considerable evidence guiding researchers into future theoretical developments.\n\n==== Symmetry breaking of the electroweak interaction ====\nBelow an extremely high temperature, [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] causes the [[electroweak interaction]] to manifest in part as the short-ranged [[weak force]], which is carried by massive [[gauge boson]]s. In the history of the universe, electroweak symmetry breaking is believed to have happened shortly after the hot big bang, when the universe was at a temperature 159.5\u00b11.5&nbsp;[[GeV]] <ref>{{Cite journal\n      |author         = D'Onofrio, Michela and Rummukainen, Kari\n      |title          = Standard model cross-over on the lattice\n      |journal        = Phys.

Occasionally, although rarely, a Higgs boson will be created fleetingly as part of the collision byproducts. Because the Higgs boson [[#Decay|decays]] very quickly, particle detectors cannot detect it directly. Instead the detectors register all the decay products (the ''decay signature'') and from the data the decay process is reconstructed. If the observed decay products match a possible decay process (known as a ''decay channel'') of a Higgs boson, this indicates that a Higgs boson may have been created. In practice, many processes may produce similar decay signatures. Fortunately, the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these, and each known process, occurring. So, if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a Higgs boson than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist, then this would be strong evidence that the Higgs boson exists.\n\nBecause Higgs boson production in a particle collision is likely to be very rare (1 in 10 billion at the LHC),{{#tag:ref|The example is based on the production rate at the LHC operating at 7 TeV. The total cross-section for producing a Higgs boson at the LHC is about 10 [[picobarn]],<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /> while the total cross-section for a proton\u2013proton collision is 110 [[millibarn]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/collisions.htm\n|title=Collisions\n|website=LHC Machine Outreach\n|publisher=CERN\n|accessdate=26 July 2012\n}}</ref>|name=\"production_rate\"|group=lower-alpha}} and many other possible collision events can have similar decay signatures, the data of hundreds of trillions of collisions needs to be analysed and must \"show the same picture\" before a conclusion about the existence of the Higgs boson can be reached. To conclude that a new particle has been found, [[particle physicist]]s require that the [[statistical analysis]] of two independent particle detectors each indicate that there is lesser than a one-in-a-million chance that the observed decay signatures are due to just background random Standard Model events{{snd}} i.e., that the observed number of events is more than 5 [[standard deviation]]s (sigma) different from that expected if there was no new particle. More collision data allows better confirmation of the physical properties of any new particle observed, and allows physicists to decide whether it is indeed a Higgs boson as described by the Standard Model or some other hypothetical new particle.\n\nTo find the Higgs boson, a powerful [[particle accelerator]] was needed, because Higgs bosons might not be seen in lower-energy experiments. The collider needed to have a high [[Luminosity (scattering theory)|luminosity]] in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn.

At lower energy levels ''(right)'', the overall \"rules\" remain symmetrical, but the \"Mexican hat\" potential comes into effect: [[local property|\"local\" symmetry]] inevitably becomes broken since eventually the ball must at random roll one way or another.]]\n[[Gauge invariance]] is an important property of modern particle theories such as the [[Standard Model]], partly due to its success in other areas of fundamental physics such as [[electromagnetism]] and the [[strong interaction]] ([[quantum chromodynamics]]). However, before [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon L. Glashow]] extended the [[electroweak unification]] models in 1961, there were great difficulties in developing gauge theories for the [[weak nuclear force]] or a possible unified [[electroweak interaction]]. [[Fermion]]s with a mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot be gauge invariant. (This can be seen by examining the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Dirac Lagrangian]] for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components; we find none of the spin-half particles could ever flip [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] as required for mass, so they must be massless.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In the Standard Model, the mass term arising from the Dirac Lagrangian for any fermion <math>\\psi</math> is <math>-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi</math>. This is ''not'' invariant under the electroweak symmetry, as can be seen by writing <math>\\psi</math> in terms of left and right handed components:\n\n:<math>-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\;=\\;-m(\\bar{\\psi}_L\\psi_R+\\bar{\\psi}_R\\psi_L)</math>\ni.e., contributions from <math>\\bar{\\psi}_L\\psi_L</math> and <math>\\bar{\\psi}_R\\psi_R</math> terms do not appear. We see that the mass-generating interaction is achieved by constant flipping of particle [[chirality]]. Since the spin-half particles have no right/left helicity pair with the same [[SU(2)]] and [[SU(3)]] representation and the same weak hypercharge, then assuming these gauge charges are conserved in the vacuum, none of the spin-half particles could ever swap helicity. Therefore, in the absence of some other cause, all fermions must be massless.</ref>) [[W and Z bosons]] are observed to have mass, but a boson mass term contains terms which clearly depend on the choice of gauge, and therefore these masses too cannot be gauge invariant. Therefore, it seems that ''none'' of the standard model fermions ''or'' bosons could \"begin\" with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance. If gauge invariance were to be retained, then these particles had to be acquiring their mass by some other mechanism or interaction. Additionally, whatever was giving these particles their mass had to not \"break\" gauge invariance as the basis for other parts of the theories where it worked well, ''and'' had to not require or predict unexpected massless particles or long-range forces (seemingly an inevitable consequence of [[Goldstone's theorem]]) which did not actually seem to exist in nature.\n\nA solution to all of these overlapping problems came from the discovery of a previously unnoticed borderline case hidden in the mathematics of Goldstone's theorem,<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"GoldstoneNote\">[[Goldstone's theorem]] only applies to gauges having [[Lorentz covariance|manifest Lorentz covariance]], a condition that took time to become questioned. But the process of [[quantization (physics)|quantisation]]<!--BRITISH ENGLISH SPELLING--> requires a [[gauge fixing|gauge to be fixed]] and at this point it becomes possible to choose a gauge such as the 'radiation' gauge which is not invariant over time, so that these problems can be avoided. According to {{harvp|Bernstein |1974|p=8}}:\n: \"the \"radiation gauge\" condition {{nowrap|1=\u2207\u22c5A(''x'') = 0}} is clearly noncovariant, which means that if we wish to maintain transversality of the photon in all [[Lorentz frame]]s, the [[photon field]] A<sub>\u03bc</sub>(''x'') cannot transform like a [[four-vector]]. This is no catastrophe, since the photon ''field'' is not an [[observable]], and one can readily show that the S-matrix elements, which ''are'' observable have covariant structures .... in gauge theories one might arrange things so that one had a symmetry breakdown because of the noninvariance of the vacuum; but, because the Goldstone ''et al.'' proof breaks down, the zero mass Goldstone mesons need not appear.\" [Emphasis in original]\n{{harvp|Bernstein |1974}} contains an accessible and comprehensive background and review of this area, see [[#external links|external links]]</ref> that under certain conditions it ''might'' theoretically be possible for a symmetry to be broken ''without'' disrupting gauge invariance and ''without'' any new massless particles or forces, and having \"sensible\" ([[renormalization|renormalisable]]) results mathematically. This became known as the [[Higgs mechanism]].\n\n[[File:Elementary particle interactions.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|Summary of interactions between certain [[elementary particle|particles]] described by the [[Standard Model]].]]\nThe Standard Model hypothesises a [[Quantum field theory|field]] which is responsible for this effect, called the Higgs field (symbol: <math>\\phi</math>), which has the unusual property of a non-zero amplitude in its [[ground state]]; i.e., a non-zero [[vacuum expectation value]]. It can have this effect because of its unusual \"Mexican hat\" shaped potential whose lowest \"point\" is not at its \"centre\". In simple terms, unlike all other known fields, the Higgs field requires ''less'' energy to have a non-zero value than a zero value, so it ends up having a non-zero value ''everywhere''. Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this non-zero vacuum expectation [[symmetry breaking|spontaneously breaks]] [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge symmetry]] which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field. This effect occurs because [[scalar field]] components of the Higgs field are \"absorbed\" by the massive bosons as [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], and couple to the fermions via [[Yukawa coupling]], thereby producing the expected mass terms. When symmetry breaks under these conditions, the [[Goldstone boson]]s that arise ''interact'' with the Higgs field (and with other particles capable of interacting with the Higgs field) instead of becoming new massless particles. The intractable problems of both underlying theories \"neutralise\" each other, and the residual outcome is that elementary particles acquire a consistent mass based on how strongly they interact with the Higgs field. It is the simplest known process capable of giving mass to the [[gauge boson]]s while remaining compatible with [[gauge theories]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995|pp=717\u2013719, 787\u2013791}}</ref>  Its [[quantum]] would be a [[scalar boson|scalar]] [[boson]], known as the Higgs boson.<ref>{{harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995|pp=715\u2013716 }}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative models ===\n{{Main|Alternatives to the Standard Model Higgs}}\n\nThe Minimal Standard Model as described above is the simplest known model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field. However, an extended Higgs sector with additional Higgs particle doublets or triplets is also possible, and many extensions of the Standard Model have this feature. The non-minimal Higgs sector favoured by theory are the [[Two-Higgs-Doublet Model|two-Higgs-doublet models]] (2HDM), which predict the existence of a [[quintet]] of scalar particles: two [[CP violation|CP-even]] neutral Higgs bosons h<sup>0</sup> and H<sup>0</sup>, a CP-odd neutral Higgs boson A<sup>0</sup>, and two charged Higgs particles H<sup>\u00b1</sup>. [[Supersymmetry]] (\"SUSY\") also predicts relations between the Higgs-boson masses and the masses of the gauge bosons, and could accommodate a {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} neutral Higgs boson.\n\nThe key method to distinguish between these different models involves study of the particles' interactions (\"coupling\") and exact decay processes (\"branching ratios\"), which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions. In the Type-I 2HDM model one Higgs doublet couples to up and down quarks, while the second doublet does not couple to quarks. This model has two interesting limits, in which the lightest Higgs couples to just fermions (\"gauge-[[phobia|phobic]]\") or just gauge bosons (\"fermiophobic\"), but not both. In the Type-II 2HDM model, one Higgs doublet only couples to up-type quarks, the other only couples to down-type quarks.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Branco\n | first = G.

In the Standard Model the effects of these corrections are potentially enormous, giving rise to the so-called [[hierarchy problem]].]]\nThe Standard Model leaves the mass of the Higgs boson as a [[parameter]] to be measured, rather than a value to be calculated. This is seen as theoretically unsatisfactory, particularly as quantum corrections (related to interactions with [[virtual particle]]s) should apparently cause the Higgs particle to have a mass immensely higher than that observed, but at the same time the Standard Model requires a mass [[order of magnitude|of the order of]] 100 to 1000 GeV to ensure [[unitarity]] (in this case, to unitarise longitudinal vector boson scattering).<ref name=\"Hierarchy problem Quantum Diaries\">{{cite web|title=The Hierarchy Problem: why the Higgs has a snowball's chance in hell|url=http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2012/07/01/the-hierarchy-problem-why-the-higgs-has-a-snowballs-chance-in-hell/|publisher=Quantum Diaries|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=2012-07-01}}</ref> Reconciling these points appears to require explaining why there is an almost-perfect cancellation resulting in the visible mass of ~ 125 GeV, and it is not clear how to do this.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs boson has a number of indirect effects; most notably, Higgs loops result in tiny corrections to masses of W and Z bosons. Precision measurements of electroweak parameters, such as the [[Fermi's interaction|Fermi constant]] and masses of W/Z bosons, can be used to calculate constraints on the mass of the Higgs. As of July 2011, the precision electroweak measurements tell us that the mass of the Higgs boson is likely to be less than about {{val|161|u=GeV/c2}} at 95% [[confidence level]] (this upper limit would increase to {{val|185|u=GeV/c2}} if the lower bound of {{val|114.4|u=GeV/c2}} from the LEP-2 direct search is allowed for<ref name=\"EWWG\">{{cite web |url=http://lepewwg.web.cern.ch/LEPEWWG/ |title=LEP Electroweak Working Group}}</ref>). These indirect constraints rely on the assumption that the Standard Model is correct.

If the collided particles are [[hadron]]s such as the [[proton]] or [[antiproton]]{{snd}} as is the case in the LHC and Tevatron{{snd}} then it is most likely that two of the [[gluon]]s binding the hadron together collide. The easiest way to produce a Higgs particle is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of [[virtual particle|virtual]] quarks. Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass, this process is more likely for heavy particles. In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual [[top quark|top]] and [[bottom quark|bottom]] quarks (the heaviest quarks). This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and Tevatron being about ten times more likely than any of the other processes.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" />\n* ''Higgs Strahlung''. If an elementary [[fermion]] collides with an anti-fermion{{snd}} e.g., a quark with an anti-quark or an [[electron]] with a [[positron]]{{snd}} the two can merge to form a virtual W or Z boson which, if it carries sufficient energy, can then emit a Higgs boson. This process was the dominant production mode at the LEP, where an electron and a positron collided to form a virtual Z boson, and it was the second largest contribution for Higgs production at the Tevatron. At the LHC this process is only the third largest, because the LHC collides protons with protons, making a quark-antiquark collision less likely than at the Tevatron. Higgs Strahlung is also known as ''associated production''.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" /><ref name=\"HprodLEP\" />\n* ''Weak boson fusion''. Another possibility when two (anti-)fermions collide is that the two exchange a virtual W or Z boson, which emits a Higgs boson. The colliding fermions do not need to be the same type. So, for example, an [[up quark]] may exchange a Z boson with an anti-down quark. This process is the second most important for the production of Higgs particle at the LHC and LEP.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodLEP\" />\n* ''Top fusion''. The final process that is commonly considered is by far the least likely (by two orders of magnitude). This process involves two colliding gluons, which each decay into a heavy quark\u2013antiquark pair. A quark and antiquark from each pair can then combine to form a Higgs particle.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" />\n\n=== Decay ===\n[[File:Higgsdecaywidth.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Standard Model prediction for the [[decay width]] of the Higgs particle depends on the value of its mass.]]\nQuantum mechanics predicts that if it is possible for a particle to decay into a set of lighter particles, then it will eventually do so.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2012/jun/22/higgs-boson-particlephysics |title=Why does the Higgs decay? |first=Lily |last=Asquith |work=Life and Physics |publisher=The Guardian |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref> This is also true for the Higgs boson. The likelihood with which this happens depends on a variety of factors including: the difference in mass, the strength of the interactions, etc. Most of these factors are fixed by the Standard Model, except for the mass of the Higgs boson itself. For a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} the SM predicts a mean life time of about {{val|1.6|e=-22|u=s}}.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=\"meanlife\"}}\n\n[[File:HiggsBR.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Standard Model prediction for the [[branching ratio]]s of the different decay modes of the Higgs particle depends on the value of its mass.]]\nSince it interacts with all the massive elementary particles of the SM, the Higgs boson has many different processes through which it can decay. Each of these possible processes has its own probability, expressed as the ''branching ratio''; the fraction of the total number decays that follows that process. The SM predicts these branching ratios as a function of the Higgs mass (see plot).\n\nOne way that the Higgs can decay is by splitting into a fermion\u2013antifermion pair. As general rule, the Higgs is more likely to decay into heavy fermions than light fermions, because the mass of a fermion is proportional to the strength of its interaction with the Higgs.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\">{{cite web\n|title=Higgs bosons: theory and searches\n|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/reviews/rpp2012-rev-higgs-boson.pdf\n|website=PDGLive\n|publisher=Particle Data Group\n|date=12 July 2012\n|accessdate=15 August 2012\n}}</ref> By this logic the most common decay should be into a [[top quark|top]]\u2013antitop quark pair. However, such a decay would only be possible if the Higgs were heavier than ~{{val|346|u=GeV/c2}}, twice the mass of the top quark. For a Higgs mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} the SM predicts that the most common decay is into a [[bottom quark|bottom]]\u2013antibottom quark pair, which happens 57.7% of the time.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> The second most common fermion decay at that mass is a [[tau particle|tau]]\u2013antitau pair, which happens only about 6.3% of the time.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" />\n\nAnother possibility is for the Higgs to split into a pair of massive gauge bosons. The most likely possibility is for the Higgs to decay into a pair of W bosons (the light blue line in the plot), which happens about 21.5% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> The W bosons can subsequently decay either into a quark and an antiquark or into a charged lepton and a neutrino. The decays of W bosons into quarks are difficult to distinguish from the background, and the decays into leptons cannot be fully reconstructed (because neutrinos are impossible to detect in particle collision experiments). A cleaner signal is given by decay into a pair of Z-bosons (which happens about 2.6% of the time for a Higgs with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}),<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> if each of the bosons subsequently decays into a pair of easy-to-detect charged leptons ([[electron]]s or [[muon]]s).\n\nDecay into massless gauge bosons (i.e., [[gluon]]s or [[photon]]s) is also possible, but requires intermediate loop of virtual heavy quarks (top or bottom) or massive gauge bosons.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\" /> The most common such process is the decay into a pair of gluons through a loop of virtual heavy quarks. This process, which is the reverse of the gluon fusion process mentioned above, happens approximately 8.6% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> Much rarer is the decay into a pair of photons mediated by a loop of W bosons or heavy quarks, which happens only twice for every thousand decays.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> However, this process is very relevant for experimental searches for the Higgs boson, because the energy and momentum of the photons can be measured very precisely, giving an accurate reconstruction of the mass of the decaying particle.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\" />\n\n== Public discussion ==\n\n=== Naming ===\n\n==== Names used by physicists ====\nThe name most strongly associated with the particle and field is the Higgs boson<ref name=\"frank_close_infinity_puzzle\" />{{rp|168}} and Higgs field.

(A separate theory, [[general relativity]], is used for gravity.) In this model, the [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] in nature arise from properties of our universe called [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge invariance]] and [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. The forces are [[force carrier|transmitted by particles]] known as [[gauge boson]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=49\u201352}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=603\u2013604}}</ref>\n\n=== The problem of gauge boson mass ===\nField theories had been used with great success in understanding the [[electromagnetic field]] and the [[strong force]], but by around 1960 all attempts to create a ''gauge invariant'' theory for the [[weak force]] (and its combination with [[fundamental interaction|fundamental force]] [[electromagnetism]], the [[electroweak interaction]]) had consistently failed, with gauge theories thereby starting to fall into disrepute as a result. The problem was that [[gauge theory]] contains [[symmetry]] requirements, and these incorrectly predicted that the weak force's gauge bosons ([[W and Z bosons|W and Z]]) should have zero mass. It is known from experiments that they have non-zero mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=372\u2013373}}</ref> This meant that either gauge invariance was an incorrect approach, or something else{{snd}} unknown{{snd}} was giving these particles their mass. However, all attempts to suggest a theory able to solve this problem just seemed to create new theoretical problems.\n\nBy the late 1950s, physicists had not resolved these issues, which were significant obstacles to developing a full-fledged theory for particle physics.\n\n=== Symmetry breaking ===\nBy the early 1960s, physicists had realised that [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|a given symmetry law might not always be followed]] under certain conditions, at least in some areas of physics.<ref group=lower-alpha>It is quite common for a law of physics to hold true only if certain assumptions held true or only under certain conditions. For example, [[Newton's laws of motion]] apply only at speeds where [[Special relativity|relativistic effects]] are negligible; and laws related to conductivity, gases, and classical physics (as opposed to quantum mechanics) may apply only within certain ranges of size, temperature, pressure, or other conditions.</ref> This is called [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry breaking]] and was recognised in the late 1950s by [[Yoichiro Nambu]]. Symmetry breaking can lead to surprising and unexpected results. In 1962 physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]]{{snd}} an expert in [[superconductivity]]{{snd}} wrote a paper that considered symmetry breaking in particle physics, and suggested that perhaps symmetry breaking might be the missing piece needed to solve the problems of gauge invariance in particle physics. If electroweak symmetry was somehow being broken, it might explain why electromagnetism's boson is massless, yet the weak force bosons have mass, and solve the problems. Shortly afterwards, in 1963, this was shown to be theoretically possible, at least for some limited ([[special relativity|non-relativistic]]) cases.\n\n=== Higgs mechanism ===\n{{Main|Higgs mechanism|Standard Model}}\nFollowing the 1962 and 1963 papers, three groups of researchers independently published the [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]] with similar conclusions and for all cases, not just some limited cases. They showed that the conditions for electroweak symmetry would be \"broken\" if an unusual type of [[field (physics)|field]] existed throughout the universe, and indeed, some fundamental particles would [[mass generation|acquire mass]]. The field required for this to happen (which was purely hypothetical at the time) became known as the ''Higgs field'' (after [[Peter Higgs]], one of the researchers) and the mechanism by which it led to symmetry breaking, known as the ''[[Higgs mechanism]]''. A key feature of the necessary field is that it would take ''less'' energy for the field to have a non-zero value than a zero value, unlike all other known fields, therefore, the Higgs field has a non-zero value (or ''vacuum expectation'') ''everywhere''. It was the first proposal capable of showing how the weak force gauge bosons could have mass despite their governing symmetry, within a gauge invariant theory.\n\nAlthough these ideas did not gain much initial support or attention, by 1972 they had been developed into a comprehensive theory and proved capable of giving [[renormalization|\"sensible\" results]] that accurately described particles known at the time, and which, with exceptional accuracy, [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predicted several other particles discovered during the following years]].<ref name=\"predictions\" group=lower-alpha>The success of the Higgs-based electroweak theory and Standard Model is illustrated by their [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predictions]] of the mass of two particles later detected: the W boson (predicted mass: {{nowrap|80.390 \u00b1 0.018 GeV}}, experimental measurement: {{nowrap|80.387 \u00b1 0.019 GeV}}), and the Z boson (predicted mass: {{nowrap|91.1874 \u00b1 0.0021}}, experimental measurement: {{nowrap|91.1876 \u00b1 0.0021 GeV}}). Other accurate predictions included the [[weak neutral current]], the [[gluon]], and the [[top quark|top]] and [[charm quark]]s, all later proven to exist as the theory said.</ref> During the 1970s these theories rapidly became the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics. \n\n===Higgs field===\nThe Standard Model includes a [[field (physics)|field]] of the kind needed to \"break\" electroweak symmetry and give particles their correct mass. This field, called the \"Higgs Field\", exists throughout space, and it breaks some symmetry laws of the [[electroweak interaction]]. Via the Higgs mechanism, this field causes the gauge bosons of the weak force to be massive at all temperatures below an extreme high value.<ref group=lower-alpha>Electroweak symmetry is broken by the Higgs field in its lowest energy state, called its ''[[ground state]]''. At high energy levels this does not happen, and the gauge bosons of the weak force would be expected to become massless above those energy levels.</ref> When the weak force bosons acquire mass, this affects their range, which  becomes very small, matching experimental findings.{{#tag:ref |The range of a force is inversely proportional to the mass of the particles transmitting it.<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Shu |first=F.

The movement and interactions of these particles with each other are limited by the energy\u2013time [[uncertainty principle]]. As a result, the more massive a single virtual particle is, the greater its energy, and therefore the shorter the distance it can travel. A particle's mass therefore, determines the maximum distance at which it can interact with other particles and on any force it mediates. By the same token, the reverse is also true: massless and near-massless particles can carry long distance forces. ''(See also: [[Compton wavelength]] and [[static forces and virtual-particle exchange]])'' Since experiments have shown that the weak force acts over only a very short range, this implies that massive gauge bosons must exist, and indeed, their masses have since been confirmed by measurement.|group=lower-alpha |name=\"massvsrange\"}} Furthermore, it was later realised that the same field would also explain, in a different way, why other fundamental constituents of matter (including [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s) have mass.\n\nUnlike all other known fields such as the [[electromagnetic field]], the Higgs field is a [[scalar field|scalar]] field, and has a non-zero constant value in [[Vacuum state|vacuum]]. \n\n=== The \"central problem\"===\nThere was not yet any direct evidence that the Higgs field existed, but even without proof of the field, the accuracy of its predictions led scientists to believe the theory might be true. By the 1980s the question of whether or not the Higgs field existed, and therefore whether or not the entire Standard Model was correct, had come to be regarded as one of the most important [[Unanswered questions in physics|unanswered questions in particle physics]].\n\nFor many decades, scientists had no way to determine whether or not the Higgs field existed, because the technology needed for its detection did not exist at that time. If the Higgs field did exist, then it would be unlike any other known fundamental field, but it also was possible that these key ideas, or even the entire Standard Model, were somehow incorrect.<ref group=lower-alpha>By the 1960s, many had already started to see gauge theories as failing to explain particle physics, because theorists had been unable to solve the mass problem or even explain how gauge theory could provide a solution. So the idea that the Standard Model{{snd}} which relied on a Higgs field, not yet proved to exist{{snd}} could be fundamentally incorrect, was not unreasonable. Against this, once the model was developed around 1972, no better theory existed, and its predictions and solutions were so accurate, that it became the preferred theory anyway. It then became crucial to science, to know whether or not it was ''correct''.</ref> \n\nThe hypothesised Higgs mechanism made several accurate predictions.<ref name=\"predictions\" group=lower-alpha /><ref name=\"L&T\" />{{rp|22}} One important prediction was that a matching [[subatomic particle|particle]] called the \"Higgs boson\" should also exist. Only proving the existence of the Higgs boson, and therefore the Higgs field, would solve the problem. Therefore there was an extensive [[search for the Higgs boson]], as a way to prove the Higgs field itself existed.<ref name=\"OnyisiFAQ\" /><ref name=\"strasslerFAQ2\" />\n\nThe existence of the Higgs field became the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics, and for several decades was considered \"the central problem in particle physics\".<ref name=\"Proceedings_1986\" /><ref name=\"Higgs_Hunters_Guide\" />\n\n===Search and discovery===\nAlthough the Higgs field exists everywhere, proving its existence was far from easy. In principle, it can be proved to exist by detecting its [[excited state|excitations]], which manifest as Higgs particles (the ''Higgs boson''), but these are extremely difficult to produce and detect, due to the energy required to produce them and their very rare production even if the energy is sufficient. It was therefore several decades before the first evidence of the Higgs boson was found.

It is also very unstable, [[particle decay|decaying]] into other particles almost immediately. The Higgs field is a [[scalar field|scalar]] [[field (physics)|field]], with two neutral and two electrically charged components that form a complex [[doublet (physics)|doublet]] of the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]] symmetry. The Higgs field has a \"[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking#Mexican hat potential|Mexican hat-shaped]]\" potential. In its [[vacuum state|ground state]], this causes the field to have a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), and as a result, below a very high energy it breaks the [[weak isospin]] symmetry of the [[electroweak interaction]]. (Technically the non-zero expectation value converts the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]'s Yukawa coupling terms into mass terms.) When this happens, three components of the Higgs field are \"absorbed\" by the SU(2) and U(1) [[gauge boson]]s (the \"[[Higgs mechanism]]\") to become the longitudinal components of the [[mass generation|now-massive]] [[W and Z bosons]] of the [[weak force]]. The remaining electrically neutral component either manifests as a Higgs particle, or may couple separately to other particles known as [[fermion]]s (via [[Yukawa coupling]]s), causing these to [[mass generation|acquire mass]] as well.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqNg819PiZY Demystifying the Higgs Boson with Leonard Susskind], [[Leonard Susskind]] presents an explanation of what the Higgs mechanism is, and what it means to \"give mass to particles.\" He also explains what's at stake for the future of physics and cosmology. 2012-07-30.</ref>\n\n== Significance ==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}\n{{originalresearch-section|date=January 2015}}\nEvidence of the Higgs field and its properties has been extremely significant for many reasons. The importance of the Higgs boson is largely that it is able to be examined using existing knowledge and experimental technology, as a way to confirm and study the entire Higgs field theory.<ref name=\"OnyisiFAQ\" /><ref name=\"strasslerFAQ2\" /> Conversely, proof that the Higgs field and boson do ''not'' exist would have also been significant.\n\n=== Particle physics ===\n==== Validation of the Standard Model ====\nThe Higgs boson validates the [[Standard Model]] through the mechanism of [[mass generation]]. As more precise measurements of its properties are made, more advanced extensions may be suggested or excluded. As experimental means to measure the field's behaviours and interactions are developed, this fundamental field may be better understood. If the Higgs field had not been discovered, the Standard Model would have needed to be modified or superseded.\n\nRelated to this, a belief generally exists among physicists that there is likely to be \"new\" [[physics beyond the Standard Model]], and the Standard Model will at some point be extended or superseded. The Higgs discovery, as well as the many measured collisions occurring at the LHC, provide physicists a sensitive tool to search their data for any evidence that the Standard Model seems to fail, and could provide considerable evidence guiding researchers into future theoretical developments.\n\n==== Symmetry breaking of the electroweak interaction ====\nBelow an extremely high temperature, [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] causes the [[electroweak interaction]] to manifest in part as the short-ranged [[weak force]], which is carried by massive [[gauge boson]]s. In the history of the universe, electroweak symmetry breaking is believed to have happened shortly after the hot big bang, when the universe was at a temperature 159.5\u00b11.5&nbsp;[[GeV]] <ref>{{Cite journal\n      |author         = D'Onofrio, Michela and Rummukainen, Kari\n      |title          = Standard model cross-over on the lattice\n      |journal        = Phys.

This symmetry breaking is required for [[atom]]s and other structures to form, as well as for nuclear reactions in stars, such as our [[Sun]]. The Higgs field is responsible for this symmetry breaking.\n\n==== Particle mass acquisition ====\nThe Higgs field is pivotal in [[Mass generation|generating the masses]] of [[quark]]s and charged [[leptons]] (through Yukawa coupling) and the [[W and Z bosons|W and Z]] [[gauge boson]]s (through the Higgs mechanism).\n\nIt is worth noting that the Higgs field does not \"create\" mass [[creatio ex nihilo|out of nothing]] (which would violate the [[law of conservation of energy]]), nor is the Higgs field responsible for the mass of all particles. For example, approximately 99% of the mass of [[baryon]]s ([[composite particle]]s such as the [[proton]] and [[neutron]]), is due instead to [[quantum chromodynamics binding energy|quantum chromodynamic binding energy]], which is the sum of the [[kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] of quarks and the [[gluon energy|energies]] of the massless [[gluon]]s mediating the [[strong interaction]] inside the baryons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cms.web.cern.ch/news/why-would-i-care-about-higgs-boson |title=Why would I care about the Higgs boson? |last=Rao |first=Achintya |date=2 July 2012 |publisher=CERN |website=CMS Public Website |accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref> In Higgs-based theories, the property of \"mass\" is a manifestation of [[potential energy]] transferred to fundamental particles when they interact (\"couple\") with the Higgs field, which had contained that mass [[mass\u2013energy equivalence|in the form of energy]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Max |last=Jammer |title=Concepts of Mass in Contemporary Physics and Philosophy |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2000 |pages=162\u2013163}}, who provides many references in support of this statement.</ref>\n\n==== Scalar fields and extension of the Standard Model ====\nThe Higgs field is the only scalar (spin&nbsp;0) field to be detected; all the other fields in the Standard Model are spin&nbsp;\u00bd [[fermions]] or spin&nbsp;1 bosons. According to [[Rolf-Dieter Heuer]], director general of CERN when the Higgs boson was discovered, this existence proof of a scalar field is almost as important as the Higgs's role in determining the mass of other particles.

Such theories are highly tentative and face significant problems related to [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity]], but may be viable if combined with additional features such as large non-minimal coupling, a [[Brans\u2013Dicke theory|Brans\u2013Dicke]] scalar, or other \"new\" physics, and they have received treatments suggesting that Higgs inflation models are still of interest theoretically.\n\n==== Nature of the universe, and its possible fates ====\n[[File:Higgs-Mass-MetaStability.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|Diagram showing the Higgs boson and [[top quark]] masses, which could indicate whether our universe is stable, or a [[Metastability|long-lived 'bubble']].

Occasionally, although rarely, a Higgs boson will be created fleetingly as part of the collision byproducts. Because the Higgs boson [[#Decay|decays]] very quickly, particle detectors cannot detect it directly. Instead the detectors register all the decay products (the ''decay signature'') and from the data the decay process is reconstructed. If the observed decay products match a possible decay process (known as a ''decay channel'') of a Higgs boson, this indicates that a Higgs boson may have been created. In practice, many processes may produce similar decay signatures. Fortunately, the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these, and each known process, occurring. So, if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a Higgs boson than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist, then this would be strong evidence that the Higgs boson exists.\n\nBecause Higgs boson production in a particle collision is likely to be very rare (1 in 10 billion at the LHC),{{#tag:ref|The example is based on the production rate at the LHC operating at 7 TeV. The total cross-section for producing a Higgs boson at the LHC is about 10 [[picobarn]],<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /> while the total cross-section for a proton\u2013proton collision is 110 [[millibarn]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/collisions.htm\n|title=Collisions\n|website=LHC Machine Outreach\n|publisher=CERN\n|accessdate=26 July 2012\n}}</ref>|name=\"production_rate\"|group=lower-alpha}} and many other possible collision events can have similar decay signatures, the data of hundreds of trillions of collisions needs to be analysed and must \"show the same picture\" before a conclusion about the existence of the Higgs boson can be reached. To conclude that a new particle has been found, [[particle physicist]]s require that the [[statistical analysis]] of two independent particle detectors each indicate that there is lesser than a one-in-a-million chance that the observed decay signatures are due to just background random Standard Model events{{snd}} i.e., that the observed number of events is more than 5 [[standard deviation]]s (sigma) different from that expected if there was no new particle. More collision data allows better confirmation of the physical properties of any new particle observed, and allows physicists to decide whether it is indeed a Higgs boson as described by the Standard Model or some other hypothetical new particle.\n\nTo find the Higgs boson, a powerful [[particle accelerator]] was needed, because Higgs bosons might not be seen in lower-energy experiments. The collider needed to have a high [[Luminosity (scattering theory)|luminosity]] in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn. Finally, advanced computing facilities were needed to process the vast amount of data (25 [[petabyte]]s per year as of 2012) produced by the collisions.<ref name=\"msnbc-discovery\" /> For the announcement of 4 July 2012, a new collider known as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] was constructed at [[CERN]] with a planned eventual collision energy of 14 [[TeV]]{{snd}} over seven times any previous collider{{snd}} and over 300 trillion (3\u00d710<sup>14</sup>) LHC proton\u2013proton collisions were analysed by the [[LHC Computing Grid]], the world's largest [[computing grid]] (as of 2012), comprising over 170 computing facilities in a [[distributed computing|worldwide network]] across 36 countries.<ref name=\"msnbc-discovery\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wlcg.web.cern.ch/ |title=Welcome to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |website=WLCG{{snd}} Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |publisher=CERN |access-date=14 November 2012 |quote=[A] global collaboration of more than 170 computing centres in 36 countries \u2026 to store, distribute and analyse the ~25 Petabytes (25 million Gigabytes) of data annually generated by the Large Hadron Collider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://home.cern/about/computing/worldwide-lhc-computing-grid |title=The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |website=The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |publisher=CERN |date=November 2017 |quote=It now links thousands of computers and storage systems in over 170 centres across 41 countries. \u2026 The WLCG is the world's largest computing grid}}</ref>\n\n==== Search before 4 July 2012 ====\nThe first extensive search for the Higgs boson was conducted at the [[Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider]] (LEP) at CERN in the 1990s.

There was no guarantee that the Tevatron would be able to find the Higgs, but it was the only supercollider that was operational since the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) was still under construction and the planned [[Superconducting Super Collider]] had been cancelled in 1993 and never completed. The Tevatron was only able to exclude further ranges for the Higgs mass, and was shut down on 30 September 2011 because it no longer could keep up with the LHC. The final analysis of the data excluded the possibility of a Higgs boson with a mass between {{val|147|u=GeV/c2}} and {{val|180|u=GeV/c2}}.

However, before [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon L. Glashow]] extended the [[electroweak unification]] models in 1961, there were great difficulties in developing gauge theories for the [[weak nuclear force]] or a possible unified [[electroweak interaction]]. [[Fermion]]s with a mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot be gauge invariant. (This can be seen by examining the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Dirac Lagrangian]] for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components; we find none of the spin-half particles could ever flip [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] as required for mass, so they must be massless.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In the Standard Model, the mass term arising from the Dirac Lagrangian for any fermion <math>\\psi</math> is <math>-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi</math>. This is ''not'' invariant under the electroweak symmetry, as can be seen by writing <math>\\psi</math> in terms of left and right handed components:\n\n:<math>-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\;=\\;-m(\\bar{\\psi}_L\\psi_R+\\bar{\\psi}_R\\psi_L)</math>\ni.e., contributions from <math>\\bar{\\psi}_L\\psi_L</math> and <math>\\bar{\\psi}_R\\psi_R</math> terms do not appear. We see that the mass-generating interaction is achieved by constant flipping of particle [[chirality]]. Since the spin-half particles have no right/left helicity pair with the same [[SU(2)]] and [[SU(3)]] representation and the same weak hypercharge, then assuming these gauge charges are conserved in the vacuum, none of the spin-half particles could ever swap helicity. Therefore, in the absence of some other cause, all fermions must be massless.</ref>) [[W and Z bosons]] are observed to have mass, but a boson mass term contains terms which clearly depend on the choice of gauge, and therefore these masses too cannot be gauge invariant. Therefore, it seems that ''none'' of the standard model fermions ''or'' bosons could \"begin\" with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance. If gauge invariance were to be retained, then these particles had to be acquiring their mass by some other mechanism or interaction. Additionally, whatever was giving these particles their mass had to not \"break\" gauge invariance as the basis for other parts of the theories where it worked well, ''and'' had to not require or predict unexpected massless particles or long-range forces (seemingly an inevitable consequence of [[Goldstone's theorem]]) which did not actually seem to exist in nature.\n\nA solution to all of these overlapping problems came from the discovery of a previously unnoticed borderline case hidden in the mathematics of Goldstone's theorem,<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"GoldstoneNote\">[[Goldstone's theorem]] only applies to gauges having [[Lorentz covariance|manifest Lorentz covariance]], a condition that took time to become questioned. But the process of [[quantization (physics)|quantisation]]<!--BRITISH ENGLISH SPELLING--> requires a [[gauge fixing|gauge to be fixed]] and at this point it becomes possible to choose a gauge such as the 'radiation' gauge which is not invariant over time, so that these problems can be avoided. According to {{harvp|Bernstein |1974|p=8}}:\n: \"the \"radiation gauge\" condition {{nowrap|1=\u2207\u22c5A(''x'') = 0}} is clearly noncovariant, which means that if we wish to maintain transversality of the photon in all [[Lorentz frame]]s, the [[photon field]] A<sub>\u03bc</sub>(''x'') cannot transform like a [[four-vector]]. This is no catastrophe, since the photon ''field'' is not an [[observable]], and one can readily show that the S-matrix elements, which ''are'' observable have covariant structures .... in gauge theories one might arrange things so that one had a symmetry breakdown because of the noninvariance of the vacuum; but, because the Goldstone ''et al.'' proof breaks down, the zero mass Goldstone mesons need not appear.\" [Emphasis in original]\n{{harvp|Bernstein |1974}} contains an accessible and comprehensive background and review of this area, see [[#external links|external links]]</ref> that under certain conditions it ''might'' theoretically be possible for a symmetry to be broken ''without'' disrupting gauge invariance and ''without'' any new massless particles or forces, and having \"sensible\" ([[renormalization|renormalisable]]) results mathematically. This became known as the [[Higgs mechanism]].\n\n[[File:Elementary particle interactions.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|Summary of interactions between certain [[elementary particle|particles]] described by the [[Standard Model]].]]\nThe Standard Model hypothesises a [[Quantum field theory|field]] which is responsible for this effect, called the Higgs field (symbol: <math>\\phi</math>), which has the unusual property of a non-zero amplitude in its [[ground state]]; i.e., a non-zero [[vacuum expectation value]]. It can have this effect because of its unusual \"Mexican hat\" shaped potential whose lowest \"point\" is not at its \"centre\". In simple terms, unlike all other known fields, the Higgs field requires ''less'' energy to have a non-zero value than a zero value, so it ends up having a non-zero value ''everywhere''. Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this non-zero vacuum expectation [[symmetry breaking|spontaneously breaks]] [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge symmetry]] which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field. This effect occurs because [[scalar field]] components of the Higgs field are \"absorbed\" by the massive bosons as [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], and couple to the fermions via [[Yukawa coupling]], thereby producing the expected mass terms. When symmetry breaks under these conditions, the [[Goldstone boson]]s that arise ''interact'' with the Higgs field (and with other particles capable of interacting with the Higgs field) instead of becoming new massless particles. The intractable problems of both underlying theories \"neutralise\" each other, and the residual outcome is that elementary particles acquire a consistent mass based on how strongly they interact with the Higgs field. It is the simplest known process capable of giving mass to the [[gauge boson]]s while remaining compatible with [[gauge theories]].<ref>{{harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995|pp=717\u2013719, 787\u2013791}}</ref>  Its [[quantum]] would be a [[scalar boson|scalar]] [[boson]], known as the Higgs boson.<ref>{{harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995|pp=715\u2013716 }}</ref>\n\n=== Alternative models ===\n{{Main|Alternatives to the Standard Model Higgs}}\n\nThe Minimal Standard Model as described above is the simplest known model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field. However, an extended Higgs sector with additional Higgs particle doublets or triplets is also possible, and many extensions of the Standard Model have this feature. The non-minimal Higgs sector favoured by theory are the [[Two-Higgs-Doublet Model|two-Higgs-doublet models]] (2HDM), which predict the existence of a [[quintet]] of scalar particles: two [[CP violation|CP-even]] neutral Higgs bosons h<sup>0</sup> and H<sup>0</sup>, a CP-odd neutral Higgs boson A<sup>0</sup>, and two charged Higgs particles H<sup>\u00b1</sup>. [[Supersymmetry]] (\"SUSY\") also predicts relations between the Higgs-boson masses and the masses of the gauge bosons, and could accommodate a {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} neutral Higgs boson.\n\nThe key method to distinguish between these different models involves study of the particles' interactions (\"coupling\") and exact decay processes (\"branching ratios\"), which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions. In the Type-I 2HDM model one Higgs doublet couples to up and down quarks, while the second doublet does not couple to quarks. This model has two interesting limits, in which the lightest Higgs couples to just fermions (\"gauge-[[phobia|phobic]]\") or just gauge bosons (\"fermiophobic\"), but not both. In the Type-II 2HDM model, one Higgs doublet only couples to up-type quarks, the other only couples to down-type quarks.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Branco\n | first = G.

In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual [[top quark|top]] and [[bottom quark|bottom]] quarks (the heaviest quarks).

This process was the dominant production mode at the LEP, where an electron and a positron collided to form a virtual Z boson, and it was the second largest contribution for Higgs production at the Tevatron. At the LHC this process is only the third largest, because the LHC collides protons with protons, making a quark-antiquark collision less likely than at the Tevatron.

The most likely possibility is for the Higgs to decay into a pair of W bosons (the light blue line in the plot), which happens about 21.5% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> The W bosons can subsequently decay either into a quark and an antiquark or into a charged lepton and a neutrino. The decays of W bosons into quarks are difficult to distinguish from the background, and the decays into leptons cannot be fully reconstructed (because neutrinos are impossible to detect in particle collision experiments). A cleaner signal is given by decay into a pair of Z-bosons (which happens about 2.6% of the time for a Higgs with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}),<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> if each of the bosons subsequently decays into a pair of easy-to-detect charged leptons ([[electron]]s or [[muon]]s).\n\nDecay into massless gauge bosons (i.e., [[gluon]]s or [[photon]]s) is also possible, but requires intermediate loop of virtual heavy quarks (top or bottom) or massive gauge bosons.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\" /> The most common such process is the decay into a pair of gluons through a loop of virtual heavy quarks. This process, which is the reverse of the gluon fusion process mentioned above, happens approximately 8.6% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> Much rarer is the decay into a pair of photons mediated by a loop of W bosons or heavy quarks, which happens only twice for every thousand decays.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> However, this process is very relevant for experimental searches for the Higgs boson, because the energy and momentum of the photons can be measured very precisely, giving an accurate reconstruction of the mass of the decaying particle.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\" />\n\n== Public discussion ==\n\n=== Naming ===\n\n==== Names used by physicists ====\nThe name most strongly associated with the particle and field is the Higgs boson<ref name=\"frank_close_infinity_puzzle\" />{{rp|168}} and Higgs field.

It grades from more brownish plumage in the southern regions of Australia to more yellow in tropical areas.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe weebill was described by John Gould in 1838 as ''Psilopus brevirostris''.

In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].\n\nHis first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time. \n\nPart Two of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1615, other publications include ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'', or ''Exemplary Novels'', ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses''.

Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nAnother area of dispute are his ethnic origins. In the 16th century, many Spaniards were descended either from [[Morisco]]s, Muslims who remained after the conquest of [[Emirate_of_Granada|Granada]] in 1492, or [[Converso]]s, Jews who converted to Catholicism after [[Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain|expulsion from Spain in 1492]].

Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[Pastoral]] romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular.

In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234\u2013235}}\n\nThe two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|2006|pp=148\u2013152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}  \n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels'', similar in style to [[picaresque novel]]s written by [[Lazarillo de Tormes]]. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\nHe was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9\u201331}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69\u201370}} \n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''El coloquio de los perros'', or ''[[The_Dialogue_of_the_Dogs|Dialogue of the Dogs]]'', from ''Exemplary Tales''. Two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza, share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, he and his close friend, Eduard Silberstein, wrote letters to each other, using Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza.{{sfn |Riley |1994|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nThe tricentennial of ''Don Quixote'''s publication in 1905 was marked with celebrations in Spain; the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of ''Cervantina'', a celebration of his plays by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico in Madrid.

Despite this, his influence and literary contribution is reflected by the fact Spanish is often referred to as \"the language of Cervantes\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=La lengua de Cervantes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |publisher=Ministerio de la Presidencia de Espa\u00f1a |accessdate=14 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003083955/http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 }}</ref> \n\nIn 1569, Cervantes was forced to leave Spain and moved to Rome, where he worked in the household of a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]]. In 1570, he enlisted in a [[Spanish Marine Infantry|Spanish Navy infantry]] regiment, and was badly wounded at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in October 1571. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by [[Barbary pirates]]; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to [[Madrid]].\n\nHis first significant novel, titled ''[[La Galatea]]'', was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, then later a government [[tax collector]]. Part One of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1605, and its immediate success allowed him to write full time for the first time. \n\nPart Two of ''Don Quixote'' was published in 1615, other publications include ''[[Novelas ejemplares]]'', or ''Exemplary Novels'', ''[[Viaje del Parnaso]]'', or ''Journey to Parnassus'', and ''Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses''. ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', or ''The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda'', was published after his death in 1616.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Capilla_del_Oidor%2C_Alcal\u00e1_de_Henares.jpg|thumb|''Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor'', in [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named ''Plaza Cervantes'']]\nDespite his subsequent fame, much of Cervantes' life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself ''Cerbantes'', his printers used ''Cervantes'', which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used ''Saavedra'', the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual ''Cortinas'', after his mother.{{sfn|Garc\u00e9s|2002|p=189}}\n\nAnother area of dispute are his ethnic origins. In the 16th century, many Spaniards were descended either from [[Morisco]]s, Muslims who remained after the conquest of [[Emirate_of_Granada|Granada]] in 1492, or [[Converso]]s, Jews who converted to Catholicism after [[Expulsion_of_Jews_from_Spain|expulsion from Spain in 1492]]. An estimated 20% of the Spanish population in the south fell into one of these categories, and it has been suggested Cervantes' mother may have been one of these [[New Christians]].{{sfn|Byron|1978|p=32}} However, others refute this theory.{{sfn|Lokos|p=116}} \n\nNo confirmed portrait of the author is known to exist.

He was the second son of [[barber-surgeon]] Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (ca 1520\u20131593).{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=35}} Rodrigo came from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=32}} \n\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly.

Such works were extremely short-lived, and even [[Lope de Vega]], the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|p=112}} In 1585, he published ''La Galatea'', a conventional [[Pastoral]] romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In ''Don Quixote'', he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' [[chivalric romance]]s.{{sfn|Close|2008|p=39}} His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular.

In the foreword to his 1613 work, ''Novelas ejemplares'', dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda]]. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of ''Don Quixote'' in 1615.{{sfn|McCrory|2006|pp=234\u2013235}}\n\nThe two parts of ''Don Quixote'' are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose, and realism; the first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.{{sfn|Mitsuo|2006|pp=148\u2013152}} The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.{{sfn|Putnam|1976|p=14}}  \n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled ''Exemplary Novels'', similar in style to [[picaresque novel]]s written by [[Lazarillo de Tormes]]. This was followed by ''Viaje del Parnaso'', or ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'', and ''[[Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda]]'', completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\nHe was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century; literary editor [[John Bowle (writer)|John Bowle]] argued Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.{{sfn|Truman|2003|pp=9\u201331}} However, ''Don Quixote'' has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author [[Carlos Fuentes]] suggested Cervantes and his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]] form part of a narrative tradition, which includes [[Homer]], [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]], [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]], [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac|Balzac]], and [[James Joyce|Joyce]].{{sfn|Fuentes|1988|p=69\u201370}} \n\n[[Sigmund Freud]] claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired ''El coloquio de los perros'', or ''[[The_Dialogue_of_the_Dogs|Dialogue of the Dogs]]'', from ''Exemplary Tales''. Two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza, share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, he and his close friend, Eduard Silberstein, wrote letters to each other, using Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza.{{sfn |Riley |1994|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nThe tricentennial of ''Don Quixote'''s publication in 1905 was marked with celebrations in Spain; the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of ''Cervantina'', a celebration of his plays by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico in Madrid.
