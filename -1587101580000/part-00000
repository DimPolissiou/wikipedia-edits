The national parks of [[Scotland]] and those of [[England and Wales]] are governed by separate legislation: the [[National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000]] in Scotland and the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]] for England and Wales.  For the latter, the [[Environment Act 1995]] defines the role of national parks as being: ''to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks.'' and ''to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public.'' The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the [[National Trust]]. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the [[Sandford Principle]]. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/default.aspx Natural England - National Parks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518030735/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/default.aspx |date=2012-05-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Legal designation==\nNational parks were first designated under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]], and in England and Wales any new national park is designated under this Act, and must be confirmed by the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 [[Kinder Scout]] mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 [[white paper]] on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949|National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act]].<ref name=\"NP history\">[http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/press/history.htm History of the National Parks - National Parks official site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421112821/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/press/history.htm |date=2013-04-21 }}</ref>\n\nIn England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks in the United Kingdom may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals.<ref name=\"Dartmoor\"/>\n\n==Origins and growth==\nThe first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the [[Peak District]], was designated in April 1951 under the [[Clement Attlee]] led [[Labour Government 1945\u20131951|Labour administration]], eight months before the end of King [[George VI]]'s reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated.<ref name=\"NP history\"/> The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own [[Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988|Act of Parliament in 1988]] gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the [[National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000]], and from this two Scottish national parks, the [[Cairngorms National Park|Cairngorms]] and [[Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park|Loch Lomond and The Trossachs]], were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the [[Association of National Park Authorities]].\n\nOf the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen [[Ceremonial counties of England|English counties]] and cover 9.3% of England,<ref name=\"fact\"/> with no national park in the central counties. The three national parks of Wales by contrast occupy 19.9% of the land.<ref name=\"fact\"/> The [[Cairngorms National Park]] at {{convert|4,528|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is the largest of the national parks. Outside the Scottish Highlands, the largest is the [[Lake District National Park]] at {{convert|2,292|km2|mi2}}; the largest National Park in England and second largest in the United Kingdom. [[Snowdonia National Park]], at {{convert|2,142|km2|mi2}}, is Wales' largest national park and the third largest in the United Kingdom.

The national parks of [[Scotland]] and those of [[England and Wales]] are governed by separate legislation: the [[National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000]] in Scotland and the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]] for England and Wales.  For the latter, the [[Environment Act 1995]] defines the role of national parks as being: ''to conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks.'' and ''to promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the National Parks by the public.'' The national park authority for each park addresses these aims in partnership with other organisations, such as the [[National Trust]]. In cases where there may be conflict between the two purposes of designation, the first must take precedence under the [[Sandford Principle]]. The national park authorities also have a duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of communities in pursuit of these purposes.<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/default.aspx Natural England - National Parks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518030735/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nationalparks/default.aspx |date=2012-05-18 }}</ref>\n\n==Legal designation==\nNational parks were first designated under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]], and in England Wales any new national park is designated under this Act, and must be confirmed by the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. The 1949 Act came about after a prolonged campaign for public access to the countryside in the United Kingdom with its roots in the Industrial Revolution. The first 'freedom to roam' bill was introduced to Parliament in 1884 by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] but it was not until 1931 that a government inquiry recommended the creation of a 'National Park Authority' to select areas for designation as national parks. Despite the recommendation and continued lobbying and demonstrations of public discontent, such as the 1932 [[Kinder Scout]] mass trespass in the Peak District, nothing further was done until a 1945 [[white paper]] on national parks was produced as part of the Labour Party's planned post-war reconstruction, leading in 1949 to the passing of the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949|National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act]].<ref name=\"NP history\">[http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/press/history.htm History of the National Parks - National Parks official site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421112821/http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/press/history.htm |date=2013-04-21 }}</ref>\n\nIn England and Wales, as in Scotland, designation as a national park means that the area has been identified as being of importance to the national heritage and as such is worthy of special protection and attention. Unlike the model adopted in many other countries, such as the USA and Germany, this does not mean the area is owned by the state. National parks in the United Kingdom may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and within a national park there are many landowners including public bodies and private individuals.<ref name=\"Dartmoor\"/>\n\n==Origins and growth==\nThe first national park, and site of the Kinder Scout trespass, the [[Peak District]], was designated in April 1951 under the [[Clement Attlee]] led [[Labour Government 1945\u20131951|Labour administration]], eight months before the end of King [[George VI]]'s reign. This was followed in the same year by the designations of three more national parks; the Lake District, Snowdonia and Dartmoor. By the end of the decade the national park family had increased to ten with the Pembrokeshire Coast, North York Moors, Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and Brecon Beacons national parks all being designated.<ref name=\"NP history\"/> The Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, the eleventh member of the national park family, was designated through its own [[Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988|Act of Parliament in 1988]] gaining status equivalent to that of a national park. Separate legislation was passed in Scotland, namely the [[National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000]], and from this two Scottish national parks, the [[Cairngorms National Park|Cairngorms]] and [[Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park|Loch Lomond and The Trossachs]], were created. Of the original twelve proposed English and Welsh national parks, two remained undesignated going into the new millennium - the Cambrian Mountains and Cornish Coast. The New Forest became a national park in 2005 and the South Downs was formally designated on 31 March 2010. All fifteen United Kingdom national parks are represented by the [[Association of National Park Authorities]].\n\nOf the ten national parks in England, five are in the northern counties, two in the southwest counties, one in the east, and the most recent two designations in the south. In total, the national parks touch only sixteen [[Ceremonial counties of England|English counties]] and cover 9.3% of England,<ref name=\"fact\"/> with no national park in the central counties. The three national parks of Wales by contrast occupy 19.9% of the land.<ref name=\"fact\"/> The [[Cairngorms National Park]] at {{convert|4,528|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} is the largest of the national parks.

It stars [[Bill Murray]], Aykroyd, [[Sigourney Weaver]], Ramis, [[Rick Moranis]], [[Ernie Hudson]], and [[Annie Potts]]. It is the sequel to the 1984 film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and the second film in the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]]. Set five years after the events of the first film, the Ghostbusters have been sued and put out of business after the destruction caused during their battle with the demi-god [[Gozer]]. When a new paranormal threat emerges, the Ghostbusters re-form to combat it and save the world.\n\nAfter the phenomenal success of ''Ghostbusters'', [[Columbia Pictures]] wanted a sequel but struggled to overcome objections from the cast and crew. As with the first film, Aykroyd and Ramis collaborated on the script, which went through many variations. The pair wanted to convey a message about the consequences of negative human emotions in large cities. They settled on the idea of negative feelings creating a mass of supernatural slime beneath New York City that empowers malevolent spirits. With a budget of $30\u201340 million, filming took place between November 1988 and March 1989 in New York City and Los Angeles. Production was rushed compared to the original film's 13-month cycle; large sections of the film were scrapped after poorly received test screenings. New scenes were written and filmed during re-shoots between March and April 1989, only two months before its release.\n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was released on June 16, 1989, to generally negative reviews. Critics responded unfavorably to what they perceived as largely a copy of the original and a softening of its cynical, dark humor to be more family-friendly, although the performances of [[Peter MacNicol]] and Moranis were repeatedly singled out for praise. As the sequel to the then-highest-grossing comedy film of all time, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was expected to dominate the box office. Instead, the film earned $215.4 million during its theatrical run compared with the original's $282.2 million, making it the [[1989 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest-grossing film of the year]]. Columbia Pictures deemed it a financial and critical failure, the effect of which dissuaded Murray from participating in a third ''Ghostbusters'' film. Its soundtrack single, \"[[On Our Own (song)|On Our Own]]\" by [[Bobby Brown]], was a success, spending 20 weeks on the United States music charts.\n\nThe film failed to replicate the cultural impact and following of ''Ghostbusters''. Although some retrospective audiences praised it, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is generally seen as a poor follow-up to ''Ghostbusters'' and responsible for stalling the franchise for decades. The film spawned a series of merchandise including [[List of Ghostbusters video games|video games]], board games, [[Ghostbusters (comics)|comic books]], music, toys, and [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted houses]]. Despite the relative failure of ''Ghostbusters II'', a second sequel was pursued through to the early 2010s. A financially unsuccessful and controversial [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|2016 series reboot]] led to renewed efforts on a direct sequel, ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', which is scheduled for release in 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nFive years after saving New York City from destruction by the demigod [[Gozer]], the Ghostbusters have been sued for the property damage incurred and barred from investigating the supernatural, forcing them out of business. Raymond Stantz owns an occult bookstore and works a side job alongside Winston Zeddemore as unpopular children's entertainers. Egon Spengler works in a laboratory experimenting with human emotions, and Peter Venkman hosts a television show about psychics.\n\nDana Barrett, Peter's ex-girlfriend, has an infant son named Oscar with her ex-husband and works at an art museum cleaning paintings. She turns to the Ghostbusters for help after Oscar's [[baby transport|baby stroller]] rolls, seemingly by itself, into a busy road intersection. At the museum, a portrait of Vigo the Carpathian, a brutal, sixteenth-century tyrant and powerful magician, comes to life and enslaves Dana's boss Janosz Poha. Vigo orders Janosz to bring him a child to possess, allowing him to escape the confines of his painting and live again to conquer the world. Because of his infatuation with Dana, Janosz chooses Oscar.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ghostbusters excavate the intersection where Oscar's stroller stopped and discover a river of slime running through the abandoned [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] system. Raymond obtains a sample but is attacked by the slime and accidentally kicks a power line, causing a citywide blackout. The Ghostbusters are arrested and taken to court for the damage and for investigating the supernatural. In the courtroom, the slime sample is presented as evidence. It responds physically to judge Wexler's angry tirade against the Ghostbusters and then explodes, summoning the ghosts of two brothers he sentenced to death. The Ghostbusters capture the ghosts in exchange for a dismissal of the charges and the revocation of the order banning them from operating.\n\nOne night, the slime invades Dana's apartment, attacking her and Oscar. She seeks refuge with Peter and they rekindle their relationship. The Ghostbusters discover the slime reacts to emotions and suspect it has amassed from the negative attitudes of New Yorkers. While Peter and Dana have dinner, Egon, Raymond, and Winston explore the underground river of slime and are pulled in. They begin fighting until Egon realizes they are being influenced by the slime. They determine that the river of slime flows to the museum.\n\nThe Ghostbusters tell the mayor of their suspicions but are dismissed; his assistant Jack Hardemeyer has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor's political interests. A spirit in the form of Janosz kidnaps Oscar and Dana pursues them into the museum, which is then covered with impenetrable slime. On [[New Year's Eve]], the slime rises to the streets, causing widespread chaos. Learning of Hardemeyer's actions, the mayor fires him and has the Ghostbusters released. \n\nDetermining the need for a positive symbol to rally the citizens and weaken the slime, the Ghostbusters use positively charged slime to animate the [[Statue of Liberty]] and pilot it through the streets filled with cheering citizens. At the museum, the museum's slime covering partially recedes and they use the Statue's torch to break through the ceiling, stopping Vigo from completing his possession of Oscar.\n\nThe ghostbusters rappel through the ceiling and neutralize Janosz with positive slime. Vigo takes on physical form, immobilizes Dana and the Ghostbusters, and recaptures Oscar. The gathered crowds outside begin singing a chorus of \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\", and their positivity weakens Vigo. He is forced to return to the painting and the Ghostbusters are freed. Vigo possesses Raymond, but the Ghostbusters use their weapons to free him and destroy Vigo, his portrait being replaced by their likenesses surrounding Oscar. In the aftermath, the Ghostbusters are cheered by the city and the Statue of Liberty is returned to Liberty Island.\n\n==Cast ==\n{{main|List of Ghostbusters characters}}\n[[File:Ghostbusters 1989 Cast.png|thumb|alt=Portrait photos of the stars of the film: Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, Harold Ramis, and Rick Moranis|Stars of the film include (l\u2013r, top row) [[Bill Murray]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], (bottom row) [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Harold Ramis]], and [[Rick Moranis]]]]\n* [[Bill Murray]] as [[Peter Venkman]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as [[Ray Stantz|Raymond Stantz]]\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Dana Barrett]]\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as [[Egon Spengler]]\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as [[Louis Tully]]\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as [[Winston Zeddemore]]\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Janine Melnitz]]\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Janosz Poha\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Jack Hardemeyer\n* [[David Margulies]] as Mayor Lenny Clotch\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Judge Stephen Wexler\n* [[Janet Margolin]] as the Prosecutor\n* William T.

He favored smaller films such as the critically acclaimed war film ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987) and the comedy film ''[[Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989 film)|Bloodhounds of Broadway]]'' (1989) over big-budget blockbusters. He also greenlit several foreign-language films by European directors because he preferred making films for the \"world market\".<ref name=\"NYTimesFeb89\"/> ''Ghostbusters'' was part of former Columbia executive [[Frank Price]]'s legacy, and Puttnam would have had no interest in furthering that legacy while building his own.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\nReitman later said the delay in development was not Puttnam's fault and that executives above Puttnam at Columbia's New York branch had attempted to work around him because they thought he was holding up the project, but they discovered they could not get the production moving even after sidelining him. According to Reitman, the delay occurred because the main actors did not want to make a sequel for nearly three years; by the time they decided to go ahead, Murray was committed to his starring role in the Christmas comedy film ''[[Scrooged]]'' (1988). When Murray was finally ready, the script was not.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> As co-creators, Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis all had control over the franchise, and their unanimous approval was required to proceed.<ref name=\"RollingJul62016\"/><ref name=\"VultureControl\"/>\n\nIn April 1987, Puttnam announced that ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' would go into production in November that year without having informed Reitman, who had not yet reviewed the unfinished script.<ref name=\"LATimesMay87\"/><ref name=\"LooperDunno\"/> Puttnam was removed from his job in September 1987. It was reported that this was in part because he had alienated Murray and his talent agent Michael Ovitz. Puttnam had publicly criticized Murray for making millions of dollars from Hollywood without giving \"back to his art. He\u2019s a taker.\"<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/><ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> He also attacked expensive talent agency packages that provided scripts, directors, and stars; Ovitz also represented Aykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman.<ref name=\"THRPuttnam\"/>  \n\nPuttnam was replaced as Columbia president by [[Dawn Steel]].<ref name=\"NYTimesJan1990\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesFeb89\"/> When she took the job, her corporate bosses made it clear that getting the sequel into production was a priority.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Columbia had experienced a long series of box-office failures since ''Ghostbusters'', and ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was seen as the best way of reversing their fortunes.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> By November 1987, filming was scheduled to begin in summer the following year. At the time, Murray reportedly wanted $10 million to star in the sequel and his co-stars demanded an equal amount.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribFilmingSched\"/><ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\"/>\n\nThe main obstacle was the disputes between the principal cast and crew that had arisen since ''Ghostbusters''. Ramis later said, \"there was a little air to clear\" before they could work together.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> In March 1988,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Ovitz arranged a private lunch for himself, Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Reitman, and Ovitz's colleague, CAA head of business affairs Ray Kurtzman, at Jimmy's, a celebrity restaurant in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. Concerns were raised such as whether the principals could still carry the sequel because Murray had been away from films for so long and Aykroyd had experienced a series of film failures. During the meeting, the group had fun and decided they could work together.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> \n\nMonths of negotiations followed with Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis to negotiate a minimal salary in exchange for a percentage of the box office profits.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/><ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> The deal was reported to be 10% of the box office profits each; Reitman denied that the figure was that large but said, \"it's a big one\".<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/><ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> This was done to keep the budget low, aiming for approximately $30 million, whereas upfront salaries would have raised it closer to $50 million.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> After this, the film was rushed into production, with shooting scheduled for summer 1988 in anticipation of a mid-1989 release.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/><ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\"/> Despite the five years it took to produce a sequel and its necessity for special effects, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' had a shorter schedule than its predecessor's one-year turnaround.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} [[Michael C.

Early on, they decided ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' should reflect the five-year passage of time between the two films.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=57}} Ramis suggested the story focus on a baby because he had previously developed a horror film concept centered on an infant who possessed adult agility and focus. This inspired him to create the character Oscar.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} Initially, the child was the son of Peter Venkman and Dana, who would have maintained their relationship in the intervening years. The child would have become possessed as a focal point of the film; Murray felt this created an imbalance in the story, placing too much emphasis on his and Dana's relationship with the child rather than the Ghostbusters and their character dynamics.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|pp=57,58}} Instead, they chose to have Peter's and Dana's relationship fail, allowing her to marry, have a child and be divorced by the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Ramis wanted to show that the Ghostbusters had not remained heroes after their victory in the previous film; he felt that would have been a less original approach.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}}\n\nThe river of slime was conceived early in their collaboration.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} Ramis wanted the slime beneath New York to present a moral issue caused by the build-up of negative human emotions in large cities;{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}}{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}} he considered it a metaphor for [[urban decay]] and a call to deliver a human solution, though he said this was buried deeply in the script.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> The pair wanted negative emotions to have consequences and found humor in New York City having to be nice or face destruction, though at this point they did not know what form that destruction would take.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}} Ramis said; \"Comedically, it suggested, what if everyone in New York City had to be nice for forty-eight hours?\".<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Aykroyd said they wanted to show negativity has to go somewhere, potentially into the person the emotion is directed towards. He felt this made the film more grounded compared with dealings with gods.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=60\u201361}} He said; \"cities everywhere are dangerous. Life has become cheap. You can go to{{nbsp}}... see a movie and get machine-gunned on the street\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} The story evolved far from Ramis' and Aykroyd's combined efforts but retained the core notion of emotions and their impact.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} By May 1987, Aykroyd and Ramis had been working for over a year,<ref name=\"LATimesMay87\"/> and had completed the screenplay by March 1988.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\"/>\n\nIn the years since the release of the more adult-oriented ''Ghostbusters'', its animated spin-off television series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' had become popular with its target child audience. The team were tasked with balancing the needs of ''Ghostbusters'' fans and those of the cartoon's audience.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> According to Medjuck, the cartoon's success was influential in the return of [[Slimer]] for the sequel, and they aimed to avoid contradicting the cartoon where possible; he said although the Ghostbusters have been out of work for five years, they had to act as though the cartoon's events took place after the film.<ref name=\"BTMSep14\"/> \n\n===Cast===\n[[File:Max von Sydow Cannes 2013.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A profile image of Max von Sydow.

He described ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} success as a phenomenon that would forever be his biggest accomplishment and felt \"radioactive\" after the failure of his personal project ''[[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'' (1984). He chose to avoid making films until he returned for ''Scrooged''.<ref name=\"CSTEbert\"/><ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Murray was also dismissive of sequels in general, believing they exist only for \"greed\" or \"business\" reasons, the latter of which he said should carry a death sentence.

When he wrote the scene, Ramis expected the production to use a manhole, but the only available underground location was a telephone conduit.

A scene showing the Ghostbusters' developed photographs of Vigo bursting into flames, threatening to immolate them, was also added. Reitman wanted these scenes added because he thought his previous cut of the film focused too much on the relationship between Murray's and Weaver's characters.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\"/> The ghost train scene was filmed at the [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]] night club in New York.

Some of this footage was repurposed into a montage.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/>{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} There were also scenes of Louis Tully attempting to capture Slimer, which test audiences found intrusive, and Slimer was reduced to two appearances.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} Gross said they retained some Slimer scenes for children but that audiences generally had no reaction to the character, which was not what they had expected.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=22}} Because the sequence in which Tully's cousin frees the Ghostbusters from the psychiatric hospital was removed, a scene showing a paranormal eclipse from the Mayor's office was added to explain the Mayor securing their release. Other removed scenes showed Raymond and Egon experimenting with the slime, which explained how they learned to manipulate it to control the Statue of Liberty. A ghost was also removed from the sequence in which the slime causes ghosts to rise across New York because Reitman felt it was not creepy enough.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\n===Music===\n\n[[Ray Parker, Jr.]] helped develop an updated version of his hit song \"[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]\", which was co-written and performed by [[Hip hop|hip hop group]] [[Run-DMC]].<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/><ref name=\"RollingVinyl2\"/> Aiming to replicate the success of the original, soundtrack producer Peter Afterman wanted to hire Bobby Brown who had a recent succession of hit songs.<ref name=\"RollingStoneBobbyB\"/><ref name=\"RollingStoneBrown\"/> To secure Brown's involvement, Afterman offered Brown's music label, [[MCA Records]], the rights to the soundtrack.

A middle-aged, balding Caucasian male with short-white hair on the sides of his head. He is wearing dark glasses and looking towards the camera with a smile.|[[Dennis Muren]] served as the visual effects supervisor on ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.]]\nAs with his work on ''Ghostbusters'', Reitman had little interest in the technical side of his film. For the sequel, he employed special effects studio [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), giving them a rough outline of the plot and the freedom to do as they wanted.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}}<ref name=\"TestedMay15\"/><ref name=\"NYTimesEffects\"/> Columbia had previously helped [[Richard Edlund]] found special effects company ''Boss Film Studios'' for ''Ghostbusters'', but Reitman was reported to be unhappy with their work. Edlund's former ILM co-worker [[Dennis Muren]] served as the visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Despite the film's intentionally rushed schedule, Muren wanted to work on the film because it would let him design new creatures.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}} Muren admitted that his designs would not be as original as ''Ghostbusters''{{'}}, and instead wanted to make them more flexible and \"ghostly\".<ref name=\"NYTimesEffects\"/> The team were originally hired to provide 110 effects shots but this grew to 180.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}}<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\nILM was also working on special effects for other 1989 releases; ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', and ''[[The Abyss]]'', but had the most difficulty with ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' because designs and concepts were constantly changing and new scenes were being added. ILM eventually refused to accept any further alterations.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> As the schedule tightened, ILM had nine teams working every day for four weeks to complete the expanded 180 shots,{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=25}} and had to outsource some of the extra work to Visual Concept Engineering, Available Light, Character Shop, and the uncredited [[Tippett Studio]].<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Apogee Productions handled many of the effects for the reshoots.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}}\n\n===Slime===\nMethocel, a vegetable-based gel, was used to create the slime.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Food coloring was added; the colors included green (to match Slimer) and blue. Physical effects supervisor [[Chuck Gaspar]] mocked up differently colored batches and Reitman settled on pink.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} The film required approximately {{convert|100,000|USgal|l|sp=us|abbr=off}} of slime.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Four cement mixers were kept on-site to mix fresh batches daily because it deteriorated quickly.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} [[Mica]] dust and mineral oil were added for the river of slime; the dust added depth to the river while the oil created varying shapes on its surface.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}}\n\nThe river of slime in the Van Horne Pneumatic Transit station was a miniature model with a plexiglass trough {{convert|1|foot|meter|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|10|feet|meters|abbr=on}} long. It operated in a [[Pump#Gravity pumps|gravity pump]] and was fed from a large tank {{convert|15|feet|meters|abbr=on}} above it. After reaching the end of the river, the slime fell into another tank, from which it was fed back to the upper tank. Air injectors and puppeteered [[Slosh dynamics|baffles]] were used to create bubbles and manipulate the slime to flow as though something was moving beneath the surface.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=9, 10}} Small slime tentacles were created using vinyl-covered sticks operated from below. The large tentacle was plastic and was filmed against a blue screen as it fell away from a stand-in's boot. The footage was then played in reverse so the tentacle would appear to be grabbing at Aykroyd.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} The Van Horne scene combined the miniature river, matte paintings of the station, and a practical set for stairs leading to a tunnel.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} The scene in which Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson fall into the river was considered one of the most difficult effects to achieve; the actors were filmed falling from the Van Horne set, which was composited with the miniature river. Hudson's character being dragged away by the slime's current was filmed against a blue screen so he would appear in the river; his motion in the river had to be animated by hand against the river's natural movements.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}}\n\n===Creature effects===\nThe returning Slimer ghost was re-developed to be more child-friendly like his popular ''The Real Ghostbusters'' incarnation. His face, which was controlled with wires and cables in ''Ghostbusters'', was now controlled by servo motors and had a pneumatic jaw. Bobby Porter was hired to wear the Slimer costume until the character was removed from the film entirely. A few weeks later, Slimer was reinserted but by this time, Porter was not available and was replaced by Robin Shelby.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=21}} \n\nThe Scoleri Brother ghosts, Tony and Nunzio, were inspired by a pair of brothers who robbed Ramis' father's store. Creature designer Tim Lawrence was influenced by the musical comedy film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), which starred Aykroyd and featured two brothers, one of whom was tall and thin (Tony) and the other short and fat (Nunzio). The brothers were given a cartoonish design to counter the film's scary moments. Lawrence aimed to represent the characters' evil rather than their pre-death appearances.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=14}} Camilla Henneman created most of Nunzio using spandex pouches filled with gelatinous materials to make him appear impossibly fat. The costume was worn by Lawrence. The impossibly thin Tony was designed as a life-size puppet but Muren thought this approach would impact the filming schedule. Tony was reworked as a costume that was worn by actor Jim Fye; it was given elongated appendages to appear unnaturally thin.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=14}}\n\nThe ghosts' faces were articulated with motors and pneumatics created by mechanical animator Al Coulter and his team. Lawrence also developed an animation system to allow the masks to lip-sync dialog. Alongside early concepts of the ghosts walking and creating explosive ruptures with each step, most of these features were abandoned in the final film. Lawrence later said without those features the same effect could have been created with a one-third-scale puppet.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=17}} The brothers' electric chairs were miniatures composited into footage of the seated, costumed actors.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=17}} Distortion effects such as the ghosts being squeezed were created using completed effect shots that were rephotographed through [[mylar]] material that could be warped to affect the underlying image.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=18}} For the scene in which Nunzio carries the prosecutor upside-down from the courtroom, a stuntwoman was hung upside down on a rail. Reitman wanted her to pass through the doorway while seeing above it. Gaspar's team created a passage made of foam above a door that resembled the iron grill. The foam was spring-loaded so that when the wire passed through, the set sprang back into place quickly; the effect was hidden behind a composite of Nunzio.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=13,14}} Full-scale cutouts of the ghosts were used during filming to aid the actors.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=13}} ''Ghostbusters'' storyboard artist Thom Enriquez storyboarded the scene; he found the process difficult because the limited schedule meant the courtroom was being built as he worked. He was also restricted by the budget, saying he \"could use only fourteen chairs. I could also blow up four pillars and one wall of glass\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=13}}\n\n[[File:116 NYC (Liberty Island).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The Statue of Liberty as seen from below. The green statue is a female figure wearing a toga and crowd, while holding a torch above in her right hand. There is a blue sky and white clouds behind it. |The [[Statue of Liberty]] was a prominent feature in the film's finale. [[Dan Aykroyd]] liked the idea of animating something otherwise immobile.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}}]]\n\nThe animated Statue of Liberty was conceived by Aykroyd, who liked the idea of taking a static image and making it move about, comparing it with seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] moving or [[Victoria Falls]] flowing in reverse.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} The statue's role was originally written as a weapon for Vigo but this idea did not progress the narrative.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=34}} The effect was a combination of a costume worn by Fye, miniatures, and larger-than-life-size elements like the statue's crown\u2014 which in reality was too small to let the Ghostbusters peer out. The crown was mounted on a [[gimbal]], allowing it to be pivoted as though its wearer was walking. Reitman ordered the crown be tilted down further than the actors were expecting to elicit from them a genuine reaction of surprise. The upper body was modeled and filmed at night in a makeshift pool to show it emerging from the ocean.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=37}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=41}} Fye also portrayed the ghost of a [[Central Park]] jogger.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=20}}\n\nTo portray the possessed Janosz illuminating a hallway with his eyes, MacNicol was filmed walking down a hallway, which was filmed again without lights off Michael Chapman holding a light at the height of MacNicol's head while panning it from side-to-side. Several takes were done to cover MacNicol's gaze. Animators added the beams emanating from Janosz, including particulate matter to enhance the realism.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} The \"ghost nanny\" version of Janosz that snatches Oscar from Venkman's apartment went through many variations. During development, it was conceived of as a two-headed dragon\u2014an idea that was dismissed as unoriginal\u2014billboard figures, animated gargoyles, a phantom taxi, and [[Santa Claus]].{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} A possessed item in the apartment was also considered; this idea inspired the possessed bathtub.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} MacNicol wore [[drag (clothing)|drag]] as the nanny for closeups and a puppet was used for wide shots. The ghost's extending arm was made from stretchable plastic tubing covered in fabric.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=26,27}} \n\nWelch built the exterior walls and ledge of Venkman's apartment to scale; it was positioned {{convert|10|feet|meters|abbr=on}} in the air. The ledge was superimposed over a matte painting of the full building. The infant actor was secured in a rig that helped him to stand up before his abduction.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} The possessed bathtub started as a bubble-bath monster that would appear to have thousands of eyes in each bubble; it is destroyed when Dana drops her hairdryer into the bath. Reitman preferred the slime to be the monster. A silicone bath that could be easily bent was used; from below, Tom Floutz puppeteered a tentacle made of dielectric gel and reinforced with spandex and china silk, which was covered in slime. A fiberglass maw was inserted in front of a vacuum tube that sucked the material backward when activated, revealing a mouth. An animated tongue was added later.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=23}}\n\nThe [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] was one of the first shots ILM completed; they wanted a powerful image for the scene and considered using the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'']] airship complete with flaming passengers and luggage, a subway train carrying rotting passengers, and a graveyard with exploding headstones. A miniature model of the ''Titanic'' with slightly modified aspects; the position of the ship's name was altered to make it clearly identifiable. Extras were filmed wearing period costume, seaweed, and dripping water but many of the minor details were lost in the wide shot.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=33}} A scale model of the museum was created because Reitman wanted to be able to show the slime oozing from cracks and seams.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=33}} Several last-minute effect shots were added due to the hectic schedule. The ghost train was intended to be a subway car but there was no time to find a suitable model and an antique train was used. The severed heads were sourced from multiple places; poorer quality heads were placed further away from the camera.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} The theater ghost took three weeks to build and required four puppeteers. The Washington Square monster was animated in [[stop motion]] by [[Phil Tippett]], who accepted the job on the condition that the effect was no longer than 160 frames, was built on an existing model, and could be done in one take. Tippett was seriously injured in a car accident during development but continued to work and finished his effect in time.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}} The slime-possessed fur coat was achieved using four coats with parts controlled with servo motors. ILM considered using live animals for the segment but abandoned the idea.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}}\n\n===Vigo the Carpathian===\n[[File:Ghostbusters II Vigo Painting.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An image of Wilhelm von Homburg in character as Vigo the Carpathian.

The character went through many designs, and this canvas painting was in actuality a photograph of von Homburg taken on a set that was blown up in size and treated to resemble an oil painting.]]\n\nThe concept for the physical form of the central villain Vigo went through many changes,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> including a plan to transform him into a large monstrosity.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=44-45}} There was difficulty determining how Vigo would interact outside his painting.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} Vigo was intended to have heavier creature makeup, but after Von Homburg was cast, his distinctive look meant the extra makeup was largely unnecessary.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=44}}\n\nIn early 1989, ILM contacted Glen Eytchison to develop a painting that could come to life. Eytchison specialized in ''[[Tableau vivant]]s''\u2014the use of static sets and stationary actors to create the illusion of a flat painting. Muren said while they could have figured out the concept, they did not have enough time and needed an expert. The aim was to portray what appeared to be a painting of Vigo that would come to life to shock the audience. ILM spent months producing concepts of the painting's look but Reitman rejected them for being too similar to \"[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan [the Barbarian]]]\".<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=7}} Eytchison and his team researched the look of a 16th-century warlord and references the period's painters to match the contemporaneous art styles.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>\n\nEytchison's team painted a background and individual items including skies, skulls, and trees on acetate. This allowed Reitman to view combinations quickly; he chose his favored design in 15 minutes. Local painter Lou Police produced a painting from this concept; Reitman approved it but Eytchison realized a painting would not be realistic enough to allow them to switch between it and the actor.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> Eytchison's team decided to create a small set resembling the painting; it had structural elements, including styrofoam skulls, in which Von Homburg could stand. Von Homburg's  costume and the set were painted by the same team to ensure they had the same texture and blended together.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>\n\nOnce the set arrived at ILM, Von Homburg was positioned in it wearing full costume, makeup, and prosthetics. Lighting was used to eliminate shadows, creating a flat image. A photograph was then taken and enlarged to be used as the painting. Welch's department treated the photograph to make it closely resemble an oil painting.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=7\u20139}} Scenes of Von Homburg on the set delivering his dialog and stepping out of the set as if leaving the painting were filmed; according to Eytchison, the actor struggled with the action and Reitman did not like the effect. The ending was changed completely, eliminating the living picture concept.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> When Vigo interacts from the painting in the finished film, the image is replaced by Von Homburg's disembodied head floating over a miniature river-of-slime set built from foam by ILM.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} When leaving the painting, Vigo disappears and materializes into the scene.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> Another concept had him \"peel\" from the canvas,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> and another had the slime bring other paintings to life to aid him.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=45}} A molded mask was created to represent his inner evil; it was worn by [[Harold Weed]] as the possessed version of Aykroyd's character.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=45}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{see also|Ectomobile|Proton pack}}\n''Ghostbusters''{{'}} hardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for much of the Ghostbusters' equipment and their vehicle, the Ectomobile; he designed new equipment for ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' in an uncredited role. Dane revised the designs of the [[proton pack]] weapons, the ghost trap, and also revised the Ectomobile, which became the Ectomobile 1A. Dane designed new equipment including the giga-meter, the slime scooper, and the slime blower\u2014a large tank connected to a slime-spewing nozzle. He re-purposed leftover prop warning labels and symbols from his work on ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) to make the equipment look more authentic.<ref name=\"BTMSep14Dane\"/>\n\nThe slime blower weapons were three times heavier than the proton packs; the tanks did not contain slime, which was pumped through the guns from off-camera.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=37}} The bulky proton packs, which were considered heavy and uncomfortable during the filming of ''Ghostbusters'', were redesigned to weigh {{convert|28|lb|kg|abbr=on}} in comparison with the {{convert|30|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|50|lb|kg|abbr=on}} versions used on the previous film. The new design offered more comfort while removing some of the powered effects.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=7}} Muren's team redesigned the proton pack neutrino wand beams to be multi-functional, allowing them to be used as lassos or fishing lines to capture ghosts instead of being straight beams.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}} Five remotely controlled baby strollers were used to create the possessed stroller in the film's opening; motors and driveshafts were concealed with the stroller's chrome body, and brakes that could stop it immediately or slow it gradually were used.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Gaspar employed two-time national miniature-car champion Jay Halsey to drive the stroller; he had to weave it between traffic from up to {{convert|75|feet|meters|abbr=on}} away.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}}\n\n==Release==\nIn the late 1980s, film sequels were still quite rare, but the concept of the media franchise had quickly developed following the success of the original ''[[Star Wars Trilogy|Star Wars]]'' trilogy.<ref name=\"UpRoxxApr14\"/> In 1989, more sequels were released than in any previous year, including ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'', ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]'', ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', and ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]''.<ref name=\"NYTimesMay89\"/> Also released that year were original hits that would become popular classics like ''[[Uncle Buck]]'', ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'', ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'', and ''[[Dead Poets Society]]''.<ref name=\"NYPostJul14\"/> That year's most anticipated film was ''Batman'', which was scheduled for release a week after ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', and whose logo had become ubiquitous through a significant marketing campaign aided by its mega-congomlerate owner [[Time-Warner]].<ref name=\"UpRoxxApr14\"/><ref name=\"THRJun19\"/><ref name=\"MentalFlossMar19\"/> Shortly before its release, a \"major theater chain\" executive said they expected ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' to make approximately $150 million during its run, behind ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' ($225 million) and ''Batman'' ($175 million), and ahead of ''Lethal Weapon 2'' ($100 million).<ref name=\"LATimesJun81989\"/>\n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was originally scheduled for release in July 1989 but less than three months before release, it was brought forward to June to avoid direct competition with ''Batman''.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} The premiere of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' took place on June 15, 1989, at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theater]], with an after-party that required payment to attend at the [[Hollywood Palladium]]; the entrance fees collected were donated to [[Saint John's Health Center]].<ref name=\"LATimesJun191989\"/> \n\n===Box office===\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' received a wide release on June 16, 1989, in 2,410 theaters, compared with the original film's opening on 1,339.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref name=\"LATimesJun89\"/> Compared to ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} $13{{nbsp}}million opening weekend, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' film earned $29.5{{nbsp}}million\u2014an average of $12,229 per theater\u2014as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of the action-adventure film ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' ($11.7{{nbsp}}million) which was in its fourth week of release and drama film ''Dead Poets Society'' ($9.1{{nbsp}}million), which was in its third.<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref name=\"BOMOpeningWKND\"/> Based on its gross and an average increase in ticket price of 22% since ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} release, an estimated 2{{nbsp}}million more people went to see the film's opening.

Benson called them \"impressive\", and Caroll highlighted moments like the ghostly, resurrected ''Titanic'', but she felt that the creatures lacked any real menace.<ref name=\"RevNYDaily\"/>{{sfn|Benson|1989|p=1}} According to ''Variety'', the film's slime and visuals would appeal to children, while adults could appreciate the witty dialogue.<ref name=\"RevVariety\"/>\n\nUnlike ''Ghostbusters'', reviewers were more conflicted over Murray's performance in the sequel.<ref name=\"RevNYDaily\"/>{{sfn|Groen|1989|p=D9}} Kehr said that his performance retained \"bright\" moments, but he seemed less energetic than in his previous film ''Scrooged''.<ref name=\"ReviewKehr\"/> Rosenbaum concurred, stating that the actor's trademark comedic indifference seemed to be lacking commitment, and Caroll said that his well-received performance in ''Ghostbusters'' had been replaced by a \"smug swagger and constant smirking\" that she found irritating.<ref name=\"RevChicagoReader\"/><ref name=\"RevNYDaily\"/> ''Variety'' considered his character is central to the film because of his ad-libbed dialog, and Groen argued that Murray essentially carried the film alone.<ref name=\"RevVariety\"/>{{sfn|Groen|1989|p=D9}} Hinson said that Murray's comedic performance was vital to tempering the film from becoming over-sentimental when discussing battling negativity with positivity.<ref name=\"RevWaPo\"/>\n\nThomas claimed that the previous film had allowed Murray's character to be aloof, selfish, and immature, while ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' pushed him towards being in a mature relationship and demonstrating genuine human warmth, which he felt did not work.<ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/> Benson commented that Murray's and Weaver's characters felt unconnected and more like rivals than lovers.{{sfn|Benson|1989|p=1}} Thomas and Siskel said that the film's emphasis on this romantic subplot was to its detriment, both occupying too much of its runtime and largely removing Murray from the action scenes.<ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/><ref name=\"RevSiskel\"/><ref name=\"InvestJul16\"/> Clark lamented that Weaver was underutilized in a stereotypical working mother role.{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=1D}}\n\nMacNicol's performance was consistently praised.<ref name=\"ReviewKehr\"/><ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/><ref name=\"RevNYDaily\"/>{{sfn|Groen|1989|p=D9}}{{sfn|Benson|1989|p=1}} Groen, who was critical of much of the cast for lackluster performances, said that his \"wickedly funny\" performance was the film's sole surprising feature.{{sfn|Groen|1989|p=D9}} Canby and Kehr concurred on MacNicol being a highlight of the film, Thomas saying that his character would be impersonated by children everywhere.<ref name=\"RevCanby\"/><ref name=\"ReviewKehr\"/><ref name=\"RevEmpire\"/> Carroll called it a  \"deliriously over-the-top performance\".<ref name=\"RevNYDaily\"/> Moranis was also singled out for his comedic performance.

An older, caucasian male with short dark hair with slight greying on the sides. He is looking towards the camera with a slight smile. |Director [[Ivan Reitman]] in 2011. He blamed the film's perceived failure on audiences' desire for darker films.]]\n\nFinancially, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was a relative success but it failed to meet studio expectations as a sequel to the highest-grossing comedy of all time. Despite being predicted to outperform its rival films before its release it failed to do so.<ref name=\"LAtimesApr1990\"/><ref name=\"LATimesAug1989\"/> As a part of the most successful summer for film to that date, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was seen as a critical and commercial failure; it also failed to garner the same passionate response from critics and fans as its predecessor.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/><ref name=\"VanityFair2014\"/> While Columbia did not comment, industry experts believed the film was undone, at least partly, by the combination of ''Batman'' attracting teenage audiences and ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' taking family audiences.<ref name=\"LATimesAug1989\"/> Another issue was the quantity of films being released close together and unexpected successes that meant films were staying in theaters longer than anticipated. By only mid-July, one theater was alternating ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' and ''The Karate Kid III'' on the same screen because of their diminishing returns to play ''Batman'' and ''Lethal Weapon 2'' on other screens.<ref name=\"LATimesGlut\"/>\n\nReitman blamed changes in what audiences wanted from films. He said he felt contemporaneous society was more negative and cynical, and noted the popularity of ''Batman'', which had a darker tone whereas ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is more positive, particularly its upbeat, optimistic ending that shows New Yorkers coming together to help defeat Vigo.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\"/><ref name=\"RollingJul62016\"/><ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> Reitman also felt the novelty of ''Ghostbusters'' could not be repeated because big surprises like ghosts and epic finales were now expected.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> In 2014, he said, \"It didn't all come together{{nbsp}}... we just sort of got off on the wrong foot story-wise on that film\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\"/> Reviewers often noted that the film largely resembles its predecessor down to the story structure, a giant figure stomping through New York, and a mid-film montage set to a theme song.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> Some noted that releasing a film set at Christmas in June may also have worked against it.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> It has also been suggested the five-year gap between films worked against it, both losing the momentum generated by the original and setting expectations too high. This period also allowed a potential cultural saturation of the brand through the cartoon series and merchandise.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/><ref name=\"DOGJul16\"/>\n\nReitman was disappointed with ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'s}} performance and said making the film had not been as much fun an experience as working on ''Ghostbusters''. He told Columbia he would not be part of a third film, and intended to break from comedies altogether.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> In a 2008 interview, Murray said, \"We did a sequel and it was sort of rather unsatisfying for me, because the first one to me was{{nbsp}}... the real thing{{nbsp}}... They'd written a whole different movie than the one [initially discussed]. And the special-effects guys got it{{nbsp}}... There were a few great scenes in it, but it wasn't the same movie.\"<ref name=\"SciFi2008\"/><ref name=\"LAtimes2008\"/> Moranis said, \"To have something as offbeat, unusual, and unpredictable [as] the first ''Ghostbusters'', it's next to impossible to create something better. [And] with sequels{{nbsp}}... they want better.\"<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\"/> Much as with the first film, Hudson was disappointed his role was relatively small. In ''Ghostbusters'', many of his major scenes had been given to Murray who was better-known, and Hudson felt the sequel continued to marginalize his character. He affirmed that despite this, he appreciated the role because of the positive way in which fans have reacted to it.<ref name=\"EWNov2014\"/><ref name=\"HudsonGuardian\"/>\n\n===Home media===\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was released on [[VHS]] on November 22, 1989, only shortly after the end of its theatrical run. Since the early 1980s, home media was normally released at least six months after films launched in theaters, and in the case of blockbusters like ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' and ''Batman'', anywhere from nine to twelve months later. To take advantage of the [[Christmas and holiday season|Christmas season]], ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', ''Batman'', and ''When Harry Met Sally...'' were all released before the end of the year. The ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' VHS was priced at $90 and aimed towards rentals rather than individual purchases.<ref name=\"LAtimesOct201989\"/><ref name=\"LATIMESAug91989\"/><ref name=\"LATimesOct61989\"/> The film entered the rental chart at number 10 and by late December it peaked as the second top VHS rental behind ''Batman''.<ref name=\"LATimesVideo1\"/><ref name=\"LATImesVideo2\"/> The release was controversial for the use of [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxing]] \u2014 the process of transferring a film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard-width video formats while preserving the film's original aspect ratio \u2014 which cropped much of the video shown on screen.<ref name=\"HomeLaserDisc\"/> A [[DVD]] version was released in 1999.<ref name=\"HomeDVD\"/>\n\n[[Blu-ray]] disc editions were released to celebrate the film's 25th and 30th anniversaries in 2014 and 2019 respectively; the film was remastered and the releases feature [[4K resolution]] video, deleted scenes, alternate takes, and an interview with Aykroyd and Reitman. The 30th-anniversary version was packaged in a limited-edition steel book cover, and also included ''Ghostbusters'' and commentary by Reitman, Aykroyd, and producer Joe Medjuck.<ref name=\"ColliderSep14\"/><ref name=\"SyFyApr19\"/>\n\nThe original soundtrack of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was first released on [[compact disc]] in 1989.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Brown's song \"On Our Own\" was a number-one song on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] music chart for one week in early August before being replaced by ''Batman''{{'}}s own hit song \"[[Batdance]]\" by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref name=\"BillboardRANDB\"/> \"On Our Own\" peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, again behind ''Batdance'', and later behind \"[[Right Here Waiting]]\" by [[Richard Marx]]. \"On Our Own\" spent 20 weeks on the chart.<ref name=\"Billboardoverview\"/><ref name=\"BillBoardPrince\"/><ref name=\"BillboardMarx\"/> The Run-DMC version of \"Ghostbusters\" failed to develop the same level of enduring fandom as Parker, Jr.'s original.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> In 2014, the Run-DMC version was released on a special-edition, white [[vinyl record]] that was presented in a marshmallow-scented jacket. The record also contains the Parker, Jr. version of the song and was released to celebrate the 30th and 25th anniversaries of ''Ghostbusters'' and ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' respectively.<ref name=\"RollingVinyl2\"/> The same year, the soundtrack was first released in digital format.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n===Thematic analysis===\nSeveral elements of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' deal with the consequences of actions. Instead of being lauded as heroes after defeating Gozer, the Ghostbusters are driven out of business because of the associated destruction they caused. The slime amasses beneath the city as a consequence of negative emotions projected by New Yorkers.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> When writing the script, Aykroyd and Ramis wanted to show that negativity had a lasting impact on the person inflicting it or the one receiving it. Aykroyd noted that, at the time, he considered major cities to be places where danger was rife and life held little value.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=60\u201361}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Writing for ''[[Mashable]]'' in 2019, Pravit Chatterjee argues that this theme is more relevant in the contemporary age of social media and hate speech.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/>\n\nSimilarly, positivity is presented as a uniquely powerful force. Their previous combined efforts defeated Gozer, a demi-god, but the Ghostbusters are completely powerless against Vigo and the accumulated negativity fuelling him. It is only when the citizens gathered outside the museum unite to sing a chorus of \"Auld Lang Syne\" that their positivity overwhelms Vigo, allowing the Ghostbusters to defeat him.{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=213}}{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}}<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> In 2016, A. Bowdoin van Riper wrote that while destruction-heavy films set in New York made before the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attack]] had taken on darker, unintended meanings, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was now more relevant. Its ending, which can be seen as \"hokey\" or false, now seemed \"touchingly real\".{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=213}} Murray described it as a \"story about innocence restored, and good values, and the power of faith in ordinary people.\"{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=99}} Unlike ''Ghostbusters'', ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' lauds the values of community and family over their Ghostbusters' personal successes.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}} Indeed, the Ghostbusters' involvement in the sequel comes from the threat to their personal acquaintance Dana Barrett and her son. They are drawn out of retirement and break the rules of their legal settlement with the city to help, despite the lack of financial rewards and the personal risk to themselves.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=102}} \n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is among many films released during the 1980s and 1990s that dealt with issues of fatherhood; these included ''Three Men and a Baby'' (1987),  ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' (1989), ''Uncle Buck'' (1989), ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990), ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'' (1989), ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993). These film types appeared among their respective release years' highest-grossing films, and focus on redeeming or celebrating the concept of fatherhood in different forms from warm and friendly to authoritarian.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=102}} These father figures are initially unprepared for their responsibility. Nicole Matthews argues that the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=110}} These films each share a similar concept, that female characters are either absent or not important to the overall story.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=105}} ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s driving plot is ostensibly about a mother (Dana Barrett) trying to protect her son who is the target of a malevolent force. Instead, it becomes about Peter Venkman and his relationship to the child, both representing a surrogate paternal figure and lamenting that he is not the child's biological father. The film focuses on moments of paternal tenderness such as Venkman using his treasured football shirt to clothe Oscar.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=107}} This focus is evident during the film's finale where Vigo's portrait is replaced by an image of the Ghostbusters as four paternal figures surrounding Oscar, with no female present. Instead a sword is depicted penetrating a stone; a symbol of fertility.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=107}}{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nAs with the previous film, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' criticizes political institutions. The team actively questions authority in a deteriorating city filled with unhappy people. Government representatives are shown to be more concerned with proper processes than the imminent threat of the ghosts.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}}<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> They are shown to be incompetent or pursuing an agenda of self-interest that means they cannot be trusted to protect the people they represent.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}} The Ghostbusters' outspokenness results in them being sent to a psychiatric institution to silence them.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> The Ghostbusters are freed from the governmental bonds\u2014the legal requirements barring them from operating as paranormal exterminators\u2014but only while they are solving more problems than they create.{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=212}} Christine Alice Corcos describes the courtroom scene, in which the executed Scoleri brothers' return to wreak havoc, as a demonstration of the failure of the legal system. The government must again empower the Ghostbusters to deal with the problem, reaffirming the team's personal liberty over government influence.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}} Corcos also analyzed the slime as a symbol of pollution. The human soul is polluted by negativity, which is given a physical form as slime beneath the city until there is too much for the Earth to handle.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|pp=266\u2013267}} Zoila Clark considered the ghosts to represent immigrants to America.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=31, 37}} Several antagonists and ghostly forces are foreign\u2014the Scoleri brothers, the passengers of the Titanic, Janosz, and Vigo.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=37\u201338}} Vigo is compared to [[Count Dracula]], a threatening foreign entity that hypnotizes subjects with his eyes, and aims to take an American woman for his own.{{sfn|Clark|2015|p=37}} The Statue of Liberty is of French origin and although it is described as a symbol of purity, Murray's character sexualizes it, defining it outside the American stereotype of purity.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Lasting reception===\nSince its release, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' has been labeled as the film that \"killed\" the franchise because it made less money from a larger budget than ''Ghostbusters'' and because the filming experience and resulting reception dissuaded Murray from involvement in a third film.<ref name=\"IndieJun14\"/><ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/> While some modern critics continue to criticize it as a bad film or inferior to its predecessor, it may only seem that way in comparison with ''Ghostbusters'' and is otherwise above average.<ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/><ref name=\"InvestJul16\"/><ref name=\"DOGJul16\"/> In a 2014 interview, Reitman defended the film, saying while it was unfairly compared with ''Batman'' at the time, he felt ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' still holds up well against the superhero film.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/>\n\n[[Digital Spy]] defended the film as being as good as or better than ''Ghostbusters''. It said the plot of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is arguably better executed than that of the first film, with multiple threads coming together in a \"seamless\" third act with a positive ending that works better with modern audiences. <ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> [[Den of Geek]] compared it to sequels to other genre-specific classics like ''Back to the Future Part II'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), which were considered not as good as the original but as good films in their own right, while ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is perceived as being a bad film despite a close similarity to the original.<ref name=\"DOGJul16\"/> ''[[Deadspin]]'' said that like those aforementioned films, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s darker setpieces and comedy made it more suited for adults than children, but that it is better than most people remember.<ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/> [[Uproxx]] called it the ideal film to watch during the [[New Year]] period because it offers an unsubtle, but simple morality tale about treating others well.<ref name=\"LegacyUproxx\"/>\n\nContemporary review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a 53% approval rating from 38 critics\u2014an average rating of 5.32/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Thanks to the cast, ''Ghostbusters 2'' is reasonably amusing, but it lacks the charm, wit, and energy of its predecessor\".<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\"/> The film has a score of 56 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 14 critical reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> In 2009, Den of Geek listed it as the eighteenth best blockbuster sequel of all time.<ref name=\"DOG2009Best\"/>\n\n===Merchandise===\n{{see also|List of Ghostbusters video games#Ghostbusters II video game|l1=Ghostbusters video games}}\nFilm merchandising was a relatively new concept created mainly by the success of the ''Star Wars'' series. Merchandising for ''Ghostbusters'' was unsuccessful; toys in particular sold poorly until the release of the cartoon spin-off ''The Real Ghostbusters''. Sequels were seen as a brighter prospect because they are based on established characters. Over 24 tie-in toys were released alongside the film including water guns, colored slimes,<ref name=\"NYTimesJun89\"/> [[coloring book]]s, comics, and children's meals.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> ''Ghostbusters'' action figures were the fifth-most in-demand toy for the 1989 Christmas season according to a survey of 15,000 retailers.<ref name=\"LATimesToys\"/> Approximately 2.8 million units of a promotional [[noisemaker]] toy called the \"Ghostblaster\", which was released across 3,100 outlets of the fast-food restaurant [[Hardee's]], were recalled in June 1989 because of reports children were ingesting its small batteries.<ref name=\"UPIHardees\"/><ref name=\"CSPCHardees\"/> [[Now Comics]] released a three-part comic book miniseries adaptation of the film set in ''The Real Ghostbusters'' cartoon universe.

''New Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was also released for the NES in Europe and Japan but could not be released in America because Activision held the rights to the game there.<ref name=\"ViceVideoGames\"/><ref name=\"EngagetNes\"/>\n\nSince its release, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' merchandise has included [[Playmobil]] sets with action figures and a model of the Ectomobile 1A.<ref name=\"MerchPlaymobil\"/> A [[board game]], ''Ghostbusters: The Board Game II'', was released in 2017 by [[Cryptozoic Entertainment]].

The concept failed to progress for many years because Murray was reluctant to participate.<ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/><ref name=\"LAtimes2008\"/> ''The Real Ghostbusters'' series continued to air until 1991 and ended after seven seasons; according to Medjuck, the cartoon series technically took place after the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.<ref name=\"BTMSep14\"/><ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> ''The Real Ghostbusters'' was followed in 1997 by a sequel series called ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'', which aimed to reinvigorate the franchise but lasted for only one season.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> In the years that followed the release of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', Aykroyd continued his attempts to develop a film sequel throughout the 1990s to the early 2010s. By 1999, he had completed a 122-page concept for a sequel called ''Ghostbusters III: Hellbent'', which would add several new characters and take them to ManHellton\u2014a demonic version of Manhattan\u2014where they would encounter the demon [[Lucifer]].<ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' featuring story consulting by Ramis and Aykroyd, and the likenesses and voice acting of Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, and Atherton, was released. Set two years after ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', the story follows the Ghostbusters training a new recruit (the player) to combat a ghostly threat related to Gozer. The game was well-received, earning award nominations for its storytelling. Aykroyd said the game is \"essentially the third movie\".<ref name=\"DOGJun14\"/><ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/> The game establishes that following the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' the still-possessed portrait of Vigo became a decoration at the Ghostbusters' firehouse.<ref name=\"DOGJul16Game\"/> ''Ghostbusters: The Return'' (2004) was the first in a planned series of sequel novels before the publisher, [[Byron Preiss|iBooks]], went out of business.<ref name=\"THRApr16\"/> Several [[Ghostbusters (comics)|''Ghostbusters'' comic books]] have also continued the original characters' adventures across the globe and in other dimensions.<ref name=\"THRApr16\"/><ref name=\"THRJan2019\"/>\n\nFollowing Ramis's death in 2014, Reitman chose to no longer serve as director for a potential third film.<ref name=\"EWOCt14\"/><ref name=\"THRFeb14\"/> He decided the creative control shared by himself, Ramis, Aykroyd, and Murray was holding the franchise back and negotiated a deal with the studio to sell the rights. Reitman spent two weeks persuading Murray. Reitman refused to release details about the deal but said, \"the creators would be enriched for the rest of our lives, and for the rest of our children\u2019s lives\". He and Aykroyd set up a production company called [[Ghost Corps]] to continue and expand the franchise, starting with the 2016 female-led reboot, ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', which was directed by [[Paul Feig]]<ref name=\"VultureControl\"/> and starred [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], and [[Kate McKinnon]] as the Ghostbusters.<ref name=\"EWOCt14\"/><ref name=\"BBCJan15\"/> Before its release, the film was beset by controversies and on release it attracted mixed reviews and was later considered a [[box office bomb]].<ref name=\"MSNBCMar16\"/><ref name=\"PolygonJul16\"/><ref name=\"FortuneJul16\"/><ref name=\"EsquireJun17\"/> A second, direct sequel to the original two films, ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', was announced in January 2019, with Reitman's son [[Jason Reitman|Jason]] serving as director.

It stars [[Bill Murray]], Aykroyd, [[Sigourney Weaver]], Ramis, [[Rick Moranis]], [[Ernie Hudson]], and [[Annie Potts]]. It is the sequel to the 1984 film ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and the second film in the [[Ghostbusters (franchise)|''Ghostbusters'' franchise]]. Set five years after the events of the first film, the Ghostbusters have been sued and put out of business after the destruction caused during their battle with the demi-god [[Gozer]]. When a new paranormal threat emerges, the Ghostbusters re-form to combat it and save the world.\n\nAfter the phenomenal success of ''Ghostbusters'', [[Columbia Pictures]] wanted a sequel but struggled to overcome objections from the cast and crew. As with the first film, Aykroyd and Ramis collaborated on the script, which went through many variations. The pair wanted to convey a message about the consequences of negative human emotions in large cities. They settled on the idea of negative feelings creating a mass of supernatural slime beneath New York City that empowers malevolent spirits. With a budget of $30\u201340 million, filming took place between November 1988 and March 1989 in New York City and Los Angeles. Production was rushed compared to the original film's 13-month cycle; large sections of the film were scrapped after poorly received test screenings. New scenes were written and filmed during re-shoots between March and April 1989, only two months before its release.\n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was released on June 16, 1989, to generally negative reviews. Critics responded unfavorably to what they perceived as largely a copy of the original and a softening of its cynical, dark humor to be more family-friendly, although the performances of [[Peter MacNicol]] and Moranis were repeatedly singled out for praise. As the sequel to the then-highest-grossing comedy film of all time, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was expected to dominate the box office. Instead, the film earned $215.4 million during its theatrical run compared with the original's $282.2 million, making it the [[1989 in film#Highest-grossing films|eighth-highest-grossing film of the year]]. Columbia Pictures deemed it a financial and critical failure, the effect of which dissuaded Murray from participating in a third ''Ghostbusters'' film. Its soundtrack single, \"[[On Our Own (song)|On Our Own]]\" by [[Bobby Brown]], was a success, spending 20 weeks on the United States music charts.\n\nThe film failed to replicate the cultural impact and following of ''Ghostbusters''. Although some retrospective audiences praised it, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is generally seen as a poor follow-up to ''Ghostbusters'' and responsible for stalling the franchise for decades. The film spawned a series of merchandise including [[List of Ghostbusters video games|video games]], board games, [[Ghostbusters (comics)|comic books]], music, toys, and [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted houses]]. Despite the relative failure of ''Ghostbusters II'', a second sequel was pursued through to the early 2010s. A financially unsuccessful and controversial [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|2016 series reboot]] led to renewed efforts on a direct sequel, ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', which is scheduled for release in 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nFive years after saving New York City from destruction by the demigod [[Gozer]], the Ghostbusters have been sued for the property damage incurred and barred from investigating the supernatural, forcing them out of business. Raymond Stantz owns an occult bookstore and works a side job alongside Winston Zeddemore as unpopular children's entertainers. Egon Spengler works in a laboratory experimenting with human emotions, and Peter Venkman hosts a television show about psychics.\n\nDana Barrett, Peter's ex-girlfriend, has an infant son named Oscar with her ex-husband and works at an art museum cleaning paintings. She turns to the Ghostbusters for help after Oscar's [[baby transport|baby stroller]] rolls, seemingly by itself, into a busy road intersection. At the museum, a portrait of Vigo the Carpathian, a brutal, sixteenth-century tyrant and powerful magician, comes to life and enslaves Dana's boss Janosz Poha. Vigo orders Janosz to bring him a child to possess, allowing him to escape the confines of his painting and live again to conquer the world. Because of his infatuation with Dana, Janosz chooses Oscar.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ghostbusters excavate the intersection where Oscar's stroller stopped and discover a river of slime running through the abandoned [[Beach Pneumatic Transit]] system. Raymond obtains a sample but is attacked by the slime and accidentally kicks a power line, causing a citywide blackout. The Ghostbusters are arrested and taken to court for the damage and for investigating the supernatural. In the courtroom, the slime sample is presented as evidence. It responds physically to judge Wexler's angry tirade against the Ghostbusters and then explodes, summoning the ghosts of two brothers he sentenced to death. The Ghostbusters capture the ghosts in exchange for a dismissal of the charges and the revocation of the order banning them from operating.\n\nOne night, the slime invades Dana's apartment, attacking her and Oscar. She seeks refuge with Peter and they rekindle their relationship. The Ghostbusters discover the slime reacts to emotions and suspect it has amassed from the negative attitudes of New Yorkers. While Peter and Dana have dinner, Egon, Raymond, and Winston explore the underground river of slime and are pulled in. They begin fighting until Egon realizes they are being influenced by the slime. They determine that the river of slime flows to the museum.\n\nThe Ghostbusters tell the mayor of their suspicions but are dismissed; his assistant Jack Hardemeyer has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor's political interests. A spirit in the form of Janosz kidnaps Oscar and Dana pursues them into the museum, which is then covered with impenetrable slime. On [[New Year's Eve]], the slime rises to the streets, causing widespread chaos. Learning of Hardemeyer's actions, the mayor fires him and has the Ghostbusters released. \n\nDetermining the need for a positive symbol to rally the citizens and weaken the slime, the Ghostbusters use positively charged slime to animate the [[Statue of Liberty]] and pilot it through the streets filled with cheering citizens. At the museum, the museum's slime covering partially recedes and they use the Statue's torch to break through the ceiling, stopping Vigo from completing his possession of Oscar.\n\nThe ghostbusters rappel through the ceiling and neutralize Janosz with positive slime. Vigo takes on physical form, immobilizes Dana and the Ghostbusters, and recaptures Oscar. The gathered crowds outside begin singing a chorus of \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\", and their positivity weakens Vigo. He is forced to return to the painting and the Ghostbusters are freed. Vigo possesses Raymond, but the Ghostbusters use their weapons to free him and destroy Vigo, his portrait being replaced by their likenesses surrounding Oscar. In the aftermath, the Ghostbusters are cheered by the city and the Statue of Liberty is returned to Liberty Island.\n\n==Cast ==\n{{main|List of Ghostbusters characters}}\n[[File:Ghostbusters 1989 Cast.png|thumb|alt=Portrait photos of the stars of the film: Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, Harold Ramis, and Rick Moranis|Stars of the film include (l\u2013r, top row) [[Bill Murray]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], (bottom row) [[Ernie Hudson]], [[Harold Ramis]], and [[Rick Moranis]]]]\n* [[Bill Murray]] as [[Peter Venkman]]\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as [[Ray Stantz|Raymond Stantz]]\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Dana Barrett]]\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as [[Egon Spengler]]\n* [[Rick Moranis]] as [[Louis Tully]]\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as [[Winston Zeddemore]]\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Janine Melnitz]]\n* [[Peter MacNicol]] as Janosz Poha\n* [[Kurt Fuller]] as Jack Hardemeyer\n* [[David Margulies]] as Mayor Lenny Clotch\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Judge Stephen Wexler\n* [[Janet Margolin]] as the Prosecutor\n* William T.

The man is shown from his front-right profile, facing right and smiling away from the camera. |Then-[[Columbia Pictures]] executive [[David Puttnam]] was blamed for ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s lengthy production, though director [[Ivan Reitman]] said it was more the fault of the reluctant cast and crew.<ref name=\"RollingJul62016\"/>]]\n\nAfter the massive success of ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', a sequel was considered inevitable even though the film had been developed as a stand-alone project.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/><ref name=\"NYTDec88\"/> The development of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was arduous, and the behind-the-scenes conflicts were given as much coverage in the press as the film.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> When [[David Puttnam]] became chairman of [[Columbia Pictures]] in June 1986, he was not interested in developing an expensive sequel to ''Ghostbusters'' despite its success. He favored smaller films such as the critically acclaimed war film ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987) and the comedy film ''[[Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989 film)|Bloodhounds of Broadway]]'' (1989) over big-budget blockbusters. He also greenlit several foreign-language films by European directors because he preferred making films for the \"world market\".<ref name=\"NYTimesFeb89\"/> ''Ghostbusters'' was part of former Columbia executive [[Frank Price]]'s legacy, and Puttnam would have had no interest in furthering that legacy while building his own.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\nReitman later said the delay in development was not Puttnam's fault and that executives above Puttnam at Columbia's New York branch had attempted to work around him because they thought he was holding up the project, but they discovered they could not get the production moving even after sidelining him. According to Reitman, the delay occurred because the main actors did not want to make a sequel for nearly three years; by the time they decided to go ahead, Murray was committed to his starring role in the Christmas comedy film ''[[Scrooged]]'' (1988). When Murray was finally ready, the script was not.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> As co-creators, Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis all had control over the franchise, and their unanimous approval was required to proceed.<ref name=\"RollingJul62016\"/><ref name=\"VultureControl\"/>\n\nIn April 1987, Puttnam announced that ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' would go into production in November that year without having informed Reitman, who had not yet reviewed the unfinished script.<ref name=\"LATimesMay87\"/><ref name=\"LooperDunno\"/> Puttnam was removed from his job in September 1987. It was reported that this was in part because he had alienated Murray and his talent agent Michael Ovitz. Puttnam had publicly criticized Murray for making millions of dollars from Hollywood without giving \"back to his art.

Ramis later said, \"there was a little air to clear\" before they could work together.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> In March 1988,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Ovitz arranged a private lunch for himself, Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Reitman, and Ovitz's colleague, CAA head of business affairs Ray Kurtzman, at Jimmy's, a celebrity restaurant in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. Concerns were raised such as whether the principals could still carry the sequel because Murray had been away from films for so long and Aykroyd had experienced a series of film failures. During the meeting, the group had fun and decided they could work together.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> \n\nMonths of negotiations followed with Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis to negotiate a minimal salary in exchange for a percentage of the box office profits.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/><ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> The deal was reported to be 10% of the box office profits each; Reitman denied that the figure was that large but said, \"it's a big one\".<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/><ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> This was done to keep the budget low, aiming for approximately $30 million, whereas upfront salaries would have raised it closer to $50 million.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> After this, the film was rushed into production, with shooting scheduled for summer 1988 in anticipation of a mid-1989 release.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/><ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\"/> Despite the five years it took to produce a sequel and its necessity for special effects, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' had a shorter schedule than its predecessor's one-year turnaround.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} [[Michael C.

Early on, they decided ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' should reflect the five-year passage of time between the two films.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=57}} Ramis suggested the story focus on a baby because he had previously developed a horror film concept centered on an infant who possessed adult agility and focus. This inspired him to create the character Oscar.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} Initially, the child was the son of Peter Venkman and Dana, who would have maintained their relationship in the intervening years. The child would have become possessed as a focal point of the film; Murray felt this created an imbalance in the story, placing too much emphasis on his and Dana's relationship with the child rather than the Ghostbusters and their character dynamics.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|pp=57,58}} Instead, they chose to have Peter's and Dana's relationship fail, allowing her to marry, have a child and be divorced by the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Ramis wanted to show that the Ghostbusters had not remained heroes after their victory in the previous film; he felt that would have been a less original approach.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}}\n\nThe river of slime was conceived early in their collaboration.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} Ramis wanted the slime beneath New York to present a moral issue caused by the build-up of negative human emotions in large cities;{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}}{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}} he considered it a metaphor for [[urban decay]] and a call to deliver a human solution, though he said this was buried deeply in the script.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> The pair wanted negative emotions to have consequences and found humor in New York City having to be nice or face destruction, though at this point they did not know what form that destruction would take.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=58}} Ramis said; \"Comedically, it suggested, what if everyone in New York City had to be nice for forty-eight hours?\".<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Aykroyd said they wanted to show negativity has to go somewhere, potentially into the person the emotion is directed towards. He felt this made the film more grounded compared with dealings with gods.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=60\u201361}} He said; \"cities everywhere are dangerous. Life has become cheap. You can go to{{nbsp}}... see a movie and get machine-gunned on the street\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=5}} The story evolved far from Ramis' and Aykroyd's combined efforts but retained the core notion of emotions and their impact.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} By May 1987, Aykroyd and Ramis had been working for over a year,<ref name=\"LATimesMay87\"/> and had completed the screenplay by March 1988.<ref name=\"ChicagoTribSalary\"/>\n\nIn the years since the release of the more adult-oriented ''Ghostbusters'', its animated spin-off television series ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' had become popular with its target child audience.

He described ''Ghostbusters''{{'}} success as a phenomenon that would forever be his biggest accomplishment and felt \"radioactive\" after the failure of his personal project ''[[The Razor's Edge (1984 film)|The Razor's Edge]]'' (1984). He chose to avoid making films until he returned for ''Scrooged''.<ref name=\"CSTEbert\"/><ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Murray was also dismissive of sequels in general, believing they exist only for \"greed\" or \"business\" reasons, the latter of which he said should carry a death sentence.

When he wrote the scene, Ramis expected the production to use a manhole, but the only available underground location was a telephone conduit. Space in the hole was limited, and the actors had to squeeze into it while covered in slime. Freezing temperatures combined with the liquid slime made the actors uncomfortable.

When they learned the superhero film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' was also being released that day, they asked to move to the 16th. According to Gross, \"Joe Medjuck and I were turning pale{{nbsp}}... it did not look possible{{nbsp}}... It was a real killer\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=25}}\n\nSeveral new scenes were added to increase the sense of urgency and threat to the Ghostbusters, including the underground ghost train sequence and the associated severed-heads scare. A scene showing the Ghostbusters' developed photographs of Vigo bursting into flames, threatening to immolate them, was also added. Reitman wanted these scenes added because he thought his previous cut of the film focused too much on the relationship between Murray's and Weaver's characters.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\"/> The ghost train scene was filmed at the [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]] night club in New York. It was added to create a sense of an unseen force trying to keep the Ghostbusters away.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=23}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} Medjuck noted that the added scenes did not require extensive special effects.{{sfn|McCabe|2016B|pp=74,75}} Cheech Marin's cameo as a dock supervisor was also added in this period.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\nThe additional content replaced some scenes and subplots that were far into completion and contained finished special effects.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Further shooting was done in [[Washington Square Park]], which was used for the monster moving under the [[Washington Square Arch]]. The popularity of the film was evident at that time when thousands of people arrived after hearing ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was being filmed there. They took part in filming, screaming on cue and running to escape the monster.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}} The film's final battle with Vigo was reshot, and the way that Vigo left the painting to confront the Ghostbusters changed completely.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/><ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\nOne of the cut scenes included a subplot in which the Raymond Stantz character is possessed by Vigo following his inspection of the Vigo painting. Raymond erratically drives the [[Ectomobile]] until he is freed of Vigo's control by Winston. This explained Raymond's possession in the finale. Some of this footage was repurposed into a montage.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/>{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} There were also scenes of Louis Tully attempting to capture Slimer, which test audiences found intrusive, and Slimer was reduced to two appearances.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} Gross said they retained some Slimer scenes for children but that audiences generally had no reaction to the character, which was not what they had expected.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=22}} Because the sequence in which Tully's cousin frees the Ghostbusters from the psychiatric hospital was removed, a scene showing a paranormal eclipse from the Mayor's office was added to explain the Mayor securing their release. Other removed scenes showed Raymond and Egon experimenting with the slime, which explained how they learned to manipulate it to control the Statue of Liberty. A ghost was also removed from the sequence in which the slime causes ghosts to rise across New York because Reitman felt it was not creepy enough.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>\n\n===Music===\n\n[[Ray Parker, Jr.]] helped develop an updated version of his hit song \"[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]\", which was co-written and performed by [[Hip hop|hip hop group]] [[Run-DMC]].<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/><ref name=\"RollingVinyl2\"/> Aiming to replicate the success of the original, soundtrack producer Peter Afterman wanted to hire Bobby Brown who had a recent succession of hit songs.<ref name=\"RollingStoneBobbyB\"/><ref name=\"RollingStoneBrown\"/> To secure Brown's involvement, Afterman offered Brown's music label, [[MCA Records]], the rights to the soundtrack. Brown agreed in exchange for receiving a role in the film. Filming had nearly concluded at that time, but Reitman wrote Brown a cameo as the mayor's doorman.<ref name=\"RollingStoneBrown\"/> The resulting song, \"[[On Our Own (song)|On Our Own]],\" was written by [[L.A.

ILM eventually refused to accept any further alterations.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> As the schedule tightened, ILM had nine teams working every day for four weeks to complete the expanded 180 shots,{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=25}} and had to outsource some of the extra work to Visual Concept Engineering, Available Light, Character Shop, and the uncredited [[Tippett Studio]].<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> Apogee Productions handled many of the effects for the reshoots.<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}}\n\n===Slime===\nMethocel, a vegetable-based gel, was used to create the slime.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Food coloring was added; the colors included green (to match Slimer) and blue. Physical effects supervisor [[Chuck Gaspar]] mocked up differently colored batches and Reitman settled on pink.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} The film required approximately {{convert|100,000|USgal|l|sp=us|abbr=off}} of slime.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> Four cement mixers were kept on-site to mix fresh batches daily because it deteriorated quickly.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} [[Mica]] dust and mineral oil were added for the river of slime; the dust added depth to the river while the oil created varying shapes on its surface.<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}}\n\nThe river of slime in the Van Horne Pneumatic Transit station was a miniature model with a plexiglass trough {{convert|1|foot|meter|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|10|feet|meters|abbr=on}} long. It operated in a [[Pump#Gravity pumps|gravity pump]] and was fed from a large tank {{convert|15|feet|meters|abbr=on}} above it. After reaching the end of the river, the slime fell into another tank, from which it was fed back to the upper tank. Air injectors and puppeteered [[Slosh dynamics|baffles]] were used to create bubbles and manipulate the slime to flow as though something was moving beneath the surface.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=9, 10}} Small slime tentacles were created using vinyl-covered sticks operated from below. The large tentacle was plastic and was filmed against a blue screen as it fell away from a stand-in's boot. The footage was then played in reverse so the tentacle would appear to be grabbing at Aykroyd.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} The Van Horne scene combined the miniature river, matte paintings of the station, and a practical set for stairs leading to a tunnel.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} The scene in which Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson fall into the river was considered one of the most difficult effects to achieve; the actors were filmed falling from the Van Horne set, which was composited with the miniature river. Hudson's character being dragged away by the slime's current was filmed against a blue screen so he would appear in the river; his motion in the river had to be animated by hand against the river's natural movements.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}}\n\n===Creature effects===\nThe returning Slimer ghost was re-developed to be more child-friendly like his popular ''The Real Ghostbusters'' incarnation. His face, which was controlled with wires and cables in ''Ghostbusters'', was now controlled by servo motors and had a pneumatic jaw. Bobby Porter was hired to wear the Slimer costume until the character was removed from the film entirely. A few weeks later, Slimer was reinserted but by this time, Porter was not available and was replaced by Robin Shelby.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=61}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=21}} \n\nThe Scoleri Brother ghosts, Tony and Nunzio, were inspired by a pair of brothers who robbed Ramis' father's store. Creature designer Tim Lawrence was influenced by the musical comedy film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' (1980), which starred Aykroyd and featured two brothers, one of whom was tall and thin (Tony) and the other short and fat (Nunzio). The brothers were given a cartoonish design to counter the film's scary moments. Lawrence aimed to represent the characters' evil rather than their pre-death appearances.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=14}} Camilla Henneman created most of Nunzio using spandex pouches filled with gelatinous materials to make him appear impossibly fat. The costume was worn by Lawrence. The impossibly thin Tony was designed as a life-size puppet but Muren thought this approach would impact the filming schedule. Tony was reworked as a costume that was worn by actor Jim Fye; it was given elongated appendages to appear unnaturally thin.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=14}}\n\nThe ghosts' faces were articulated with motors and pneumatics created by mechanical animator Al Coulter and his team. Lawrence also developed an animation system to allow the masks to lip-sync dialog. Alongside early concepts of the ghosts walking and creating explosive ruptures with each step, most of these features were abandoned in the final film. Lawrence later said without those features the same effect could have been created with a one-third-scale puppet.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=17}} The brothers' electric chairs were miniatures composited into footage of the seated, costumed actors.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=17}} Distortion effects such as the ghosts being squeezed were created using completed effect shots that were rephotographed through [[mylar]] material that could be warped to affect the underlying image.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=18}} For the scene in which Nunzio carries the prosecutor upside-down from the courtroom, a stuntwoman was hung upside down on a rail. Reitman wanted her to pass through the doorway while seeing above it. Gaspar's team created a passage made of foam above a door that resembled the iron grill. The foam was spring-loaded so that when the wire passed through, the set sprang back into place quickly; the effect was hidden behind a composite of Nunzio.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=13,14}} Full-scale cutouts of the ghosts were used during filming to aid the actors.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=13}} ''Ghostbusters'' storyboard artist Thom Enriquez storyboarded the scene; he found the process difficult because the limited schedule meant the courtroom was being built as he worked. He was also restricted by the budget, saying he \"could use only fourteen chairs. I could also blow up four pillars and one wall of glass\".{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=13}}\n\n[[File:116 NYC (Liberty Island).jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=The Statue of Liberty as seen from below.

[[Dan Aykroyd]] liked the idea of animating something otherwise immobile.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}}]]\n\nThe animated Statue of Liberty was conceived by Aykroyd, who liked the idea of taking a static image and making it move about, comparing it with seeing the [[Eiffel Tower]] moving or [[Victoria Falls]] flowing in reverse.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=62}} The statue's role was originally written as a weapon for Vigo but this idea did not progress the narrative.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=34}} The effect was a combination of a costume worn by Fye, miniatures, and larger-than-life-size elements like the statue's crown\u2014 which in reality was too small to let the Ghostbusters peer out. The crown was mounted on a [[gimbal]], allowing it to be pivoted as though its wearer was walking. Reitman ordered the crown be tilted down further than the actors were expecting to elicit from them a genuine reaction of surprise. The upper body was modeled and filmed at night in a makeshift pool to show it emerging from the ocean.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=37}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=41}} Fye also portrayed the ghost of a [[Central Park]] jogger.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=20}}\n\nTo portray the possessed Janosz illuminating a hallway with his eyes, MacNicol was filmed walking down a hallway, which was filmed again without lights off Michael Chapman holding a light at the height of MacNicol's head while panning it from side-to-side. Several takes were done to cover MacNicol's gaze. Animators added the beams emanating from Janosz, including particulate matter to enhance the realism.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=10}} The \"ghost nanny\" version of Janosz that snatches Oscar from Venkman's apartment went through many variations. During development, it was conceived of as a two-headed dragon\u2014an idea that was dismissed as unoriginal\u2014billboard figures, animated gargoyles, a phantom taxi, and [[Santa Claus]].{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} A possessed item in the apartment was also considered; this idea inspired the possessed bathtub.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} MacNicol wore [[drag (clothing)|drag]] as the nanny for closeups and a puppet was used for wide shots. The ghost's extending arm was made from stretchable plastic tubing covered in fabric.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=26,27}} \n\nWelch built the exterior walls and ledge of Venkman's apartment to scale; it was positioned {{convert|10|feet|meters|abbr=on}} in the air. The ledge was superimposed over a matte painting of the full building. The infant actor was secured in a rig that helped him to stand up before his abduction.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} The possessed bathtub started as a bubble-bath monster that would appear to have thousands of eyes in each bubble; it is destroyed when Dana drops her hairdryer into the bath. Reitman preferred the slime to be the monster. A silicone bath that could be easily bent was used; from below, Tom Floutz puppeteered a tentacle made of dielectric gel and reinforced with spandex and china silk, which was covered in slime. A fiberglass maw was inserted in front of a vacuum tube that sucked the material backward when activated, revealing a mouth. An animated tongue was added later.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=23}}\n\nThe [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] was one of the first shots ILM completed; they wanted a powerful image for the scene and considered using the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'']] airship complete with flaming passengers and luggage, a subway train carrying rotting passengers, and a graveyard with exploding headstones. A miniature model of the ''Titanic'' with slightly modified aspects; the position of the ship's name was altered to make it clearly identifiable. Extras were filmed wearing period costume, seaweed, and dripping water but many of the minor details were lost in the wide shot.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=33}} A scale model of the museum was created because Reitman wanted to be able to show the slime oozing from cracks and seams.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=33}} Several last-minute effect shots were added due to the hectic schedule. The ghost train was intended to be a subway car but there was no time to find a suitable model and an antique train was used. The severed heads were sourced from multiple places; poorer quality heads were placed further away from the camera.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=26}} The theater ghost took three weeks to build and required four puppeteers. The Washington Square monster was animated in [[stop motion]] by [[Phil Tippett]], who accepted the job on the condition that the effect was no longer than 160 frames, was built on an existing model, and could be done in one take. Tippett was seriously injured in a car accident during development but continued to work and finished his effect in time.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}} The slime-possessed fur coat was achieved using four coats with parts controlled with servo motors. ILM considered using live animals for the segment but abandoned the idea.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=30}}\n\n===Vigo the Carpathian===\n[[File:Ghostbusters II Vigo Painting.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=An image of Wilhelm von Homburg in character as Vigo the Carpathian.

Eytchison specialized in ''[[Tableau vivant]]s''\u2014the use of static sets and stationary actors to create the illusion of a flat painting. Muren said while they could have figured out the concept, they did not have enough time and needed an expert. The aim was to portray what appeared to be a painting of Vigo that would come to life to shock the audience. ILM spent months producing concepts of the painting's look but Reitman rejected them for being too similar to \"[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan [the Barbarian]]]\".<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=7}} Eytchison and his team researched the look of a 16th-century warlord and references the period's painters to match the contemporaneous art styles.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>\n\nEytchison's team painted a background and individual items including skies, skulls, and trees on acetate. This allowed Reitman to view combinations quickly; he chose his favored design in 15 minutes. Local painter Lou Police produced a painting from this concept; Reitman approved it but Eytchison realized a painting would not be realistic enough to allow them to switch between it and the actor.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> Eytchison's team decided to create a small set resembling the painting; it had structural elements, including styrofoam skulls, in which Von Homburg could stand. Von Homburg's  costume and the set were painted by the same team to ensure they had the same texture and blended together.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>\n\nOnce the set arrived at ILM, Von Homburg was positioned in it wearing full costume, makeup, and prosthetics. Lighting was used to eliminate shadows, creating a flat image. A photograph was then taken and enlarged to be used as the painting. Welch's department treated the photograph to make it closely resemble an oil painting.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/>{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|pp=7\u20139}} Scenes of Von Homburg on the set delivering his dialog and stepping out of the set as if leaving the painting were filmed; according to Eytchison, the actor struggled with the action and Reitman did not like the effect. The ending was changed completely, eliminating the living picture concept.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> When Vigo interacts from the painting in the finished film, the image is replaced by Von Homburg's disembodied head floating over a miniature river-of-slime set built from foam by ILM.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=9}} When leaving the painting, Vigo disappears and materializes into the scene.<ref name=\"MentalFlossVigo\"/> Another concept had him \"peel\" from the canvas,<ref name=\"AICNOverview\"/> and another had the slime bring other paintings to life to aid him.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=45}} A molded mask was created to represent his inner evil; it was worn by [[Harold Weed]] as the possessed version of Aykroyd's character.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=45}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{see also|Ectomobile|Proton pack}}\n''Ghostbusters''{{'}} hardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for much of the Ghostbusters' equipment and their vehicle, the Ectomobile; he designed new equipment for ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' in an uncredited role.

Dane designed new equipment including the giga-meter, the slime scooper, and the slime blower\u2014a large tank connected to a slime-spewing nozzle. He re-purposed leftover prop warning labels and symbols from his work on ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982) to make the equipment look more authentic.<ref name=\"BTMSep14Dane\"/>\n\nThe slime blower weapons were three times heavier than the proton packs; the tanks did not contain slime, which was pumped through the guns from off-camera.{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=37}} The bulky proton packs, which were considered heavy and uncomfortable during the filming of ''Ghostbusters'', were redesigned to weigh {{convert|28|lb|kg|abbr=on}} in comparison with the {{convert|30|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and {{convert|50|lb|kg|abbr=on}} versions used on the previous film.

By only mid-July, one theater was alternating ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' and ''The Karate Kid III'' on the same screen because of their diminishing returns to play ''Batman'' and ''Lethal Weapon 2'' on other screens.<ref name=\"LATimesGlut\"/>\n\nReitman blamed changes in what audiences wanted from films. He said he felt contemporaneous society was more negative and cynical, and noted the popularity of ''Batman'', which had a darker tone whereas ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is more positive, particularly its upbeat, optimistic ending that shows New Yorkers coming together to help defeat Vigo.<ref name=\"FSRJun19\"/><ref name=\"RollingJul62016\"/><ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> Reitman also felt the novelty of ''Ghostbusters'' could not be repeated because big surprises like ghosts and epic finales were now expected.<ref name=\"LATimesDec1989\"/> In 2014, he said, \"It didn't all come together{{nbsp}}... we just sort of got off on the wrong foot story-wise on that film\".<ref name=\"VanityFair2014\"/> Reviewers often noted that the film largely resembles its predecessor down to the story structure, a giant figure stomping through New York, and a mid-film montage set to a theme song.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> Some noted that releasing a film set at Christmas in June may also have worked against it.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> It has also been suggested the five-year gap between films worked against it, both losing the momentum generated by the original and setting expectations too high.

The 30th-anniversary version was packaged in a limited-edition steel book cover, and also included ''Ghostbusters'' and commentary by Reitman, Aykroyd, and producer Joe Medjuck.<ref name=\"ColliderSep14\"/><ref name=\"SyFyApr19\"/>\n\nThe original soundtrack of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was first released on [[compact disc]] in 1989.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/> Brown's song \"On Our Own\" was a number-one song on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] music chart for one week in early August before being replaced by ''Batman''{{'}}s own hit song \"[[Batdance]]\" by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref name=\"BillboardRANDB\"/> \"On Our Own\" peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, again behind ''Batdance'', and later behind \"[[Right Here Waiting]]\" by [[Richard Marx]]. \"On Our Own\" spent 20 weeks on the chart.<ref name=\"Billboardoverview\"/><ref name=\"BillBoardPrince\"/><ref name=\"BillboardMarx\"/> The Run-DMC version of \"Ghostbusters\" failed to develop the same level of enduring fandom as Parker, Jr.'s original.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> In 2014, the Run-DMC version was released on a special-edition, white [[vinyl record]] that was presented in a marshmallow-scented jacket. The record also contains the Parker, Jr. version of the song and was released to celebrate the 30th and 25th anniversaries of ''Ghostbusters'' and ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' respectively.<ref name=\"RollingVinyl2\"/> The same year, the soundtrack was first released in digital format.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/>\n\n===Thematic analysis===\nSeveral elements of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' deal with the consequences of actions. Instead of being lauded as heroes after defeating Gozer, the Ghostbusters are driven out of business because of the associated destruction they caused. The slime amasses beneath the city as a consequence of negative emotions projected by New Yorkers.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> When writing the script, Aykroyd and Ramis wanted to show that negativity had a lasting impact on the person inflicting it or the one receiving it. Aykroyd noted that, at the time, he considered major cities to be places where danger was rife and life held little value.{{sfn|McCabe|2016|p=60\u201361}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1989|p=6}} Writing for ''[[Mashable]]'' in 2019, Pravit Chatterjee argues that this theme is more relevant in the contemporary age of social media and hate speech.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/>\n\nSimilarly, positivity is presented as a uniquely powerful force. Their previous combined efforts defeated Gozer, a demi-god, but the Ghostbusters are completely powerless against Vigo and the accumulated negativity fuelling him. It is only when the citizens gathered outside the museum unite to sing a chorus of \"Auld Lang Syne\" that their positivity overwhelms Vigo, allowing the Ghostbusters to defeat him.{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=213}}{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}}<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> In 2016, A. Bowdoin van Riper wrote that while destruction-heavy films set in New York made before the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attack]] had taken on darker, unintended meanings, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was now more relevant. Its ending, which can be seen as \"hokey\" or false, now seemed \"touchingly real\".{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=213}} Murray described it as a \"story about innocence restored, and good values, and the power of faith in ordinary people.\"{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=99}} Unlike ''Ghostbusters'', ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' lauds the values of community and family over their Ghostbusters' personal successes.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=103}} Indeed, the Ghostbusters' involvement in the sequel comes from the threat to their personal acquaintance Dana Barrett and her son. They are drawn out of retirement and break the rules of their legal settlement with the city to help, despite the lack of financial rewards and the personal risk to themselves.{{sfn|Whalley|2010|p=102}} \n\n''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is among many films released during the 1980s and 1990s that dealt with issues of fatherhood; these included ''Three Men and a Baby'' (1987),  ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' (1989), ''Uncle Buck'' (1989), ''[[Kindergarten Cop]]'' (1990), ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'' (1989), ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' (1993). These film types appeared among their respective release years' highest-grossing films, and focus on redeeming or celebrating the concept of fatherhood in different forms from warm and friendly to authoritarian.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=102}} These father figures are initially unprepared for their responsibility. Nicole Matthews argues that the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=110}} These films each share a similar concept, that female characters are either absent or not important to the overall story.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=105}} ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s driving plot is ostensibly about a mother (Dana Barrett) trying to protect her son who is the target of a malevolent force. Instead, it becomes about Peter Venkman and his relationship to the child, both representing a surrogate paternal figure and lamenting that he is not the child's biological father. The film focuses on moments of paternal tenderness such as Venkman using his treasured football shirt to clothe Oscar.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=107}} This focus is evident during the film's finale where Vigo's portrait is replaced by an image of the Ghostbusters as four paternal figures surrounding Oscar, with no female present. Instead a sword is depicted penetrating a stone; a symbol of fertility.{{sfn|Matthews|2000|p=107}}{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nAs with the previous film, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' criticizes political institutions. The team actively questions authority in a deteriorating city filled with unhappy people. Government representatives are shown to be more concerned with proper processes than the imminent threat of the ghosts.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}}<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> They are shown to be incompetent or pursuing an agenda of self-interest that means they cannot be trusted to protect the people they represent.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}} The Ghostbusters' outspokenness results in them being sent to a psychiatric institution to silence them.<ref name=\"MashableChatter\"/> The Ghostbusters are freed from the governmental bonds\u2014the legal requirements barring them from operating as paranormal exterminators\u2014but only while they are solving more problems than they create.{{sfn|Bowdoin van Riper|2016|p=212}} Christine Alice Corcos describes the courtroom scene, in which the executed Scoleri brothers' return to wreak havoc, as a demonstration of the failure of the legal system. The government must again empower the Ghostbusters to deal with the problem, reaffirming the team's personal liberty over government influence.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|p=269}} Corcos also analyzed the slime as a symbol of pollution. The human soul is polluted by negativity, which is given a physical form as slime beneath the city until there is too much for the Earth to handle.{{sfn|Corcos|1997|pp=266\u2013267}} Zoila Clark considered the ghosts to represent immigrants to America.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=31, 37}} Several antagonists and ghostly forces are foreign\u2014the Scoleri brothers, the passengers of the Titanic, Janosz, and Vigo.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=37\u201338}} Vigo is compared to [[Count Dracula]], a threatening foreign entity that hypnotizes subjects with his eyes, and aims to take an American woman for his own.{{sfn|Clark|2015|p=37}} The Statue of Liberty is of French origin and although it is described as a symbol of purity, Murray's character sexualizes it, defining it outside the American stereotype of purity.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Lasting reception===\nSince its release, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' has been labeled as the film that \"killed\" the franchise because it made less money from a larger budget than ''Ghostbusters'' and because the filming experience and resulting reception dissuaded Murray from involvement in a third film.<ref name=\"IndieJun14\"/><ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/> While some modern critics continue to criticize it as a bad film or inferior to its predecessor, it may only seem that way in comparison with ''Ghostbusters'' and is otherwise above average.<ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/><ref name=\"InvestJul16\"/><ref name=\"DOGJul16\"/> In a 2014 interview, Reitman defended the film, saying while it was unfairly compared with ''Batman'' at the time, he felt ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' still holds up well against the superhero film.<ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/>\n\n[[Digital Spy]] defended the film as being as good as or better than ''Ghostbusters''. It said the plot of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is arguably better executed than that of the first film, with multiple threads coming together in a \"seamless\" third act with a positive ending that works better with modern audiences. <ref name=\"DigitalSpyFeb15\"/> [[Den of Geek]] compared it to sequels to other genre-specific classics like ''Back to the Future Part II'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' (1984), which were considered not as good as the original but as good films in their own right, while ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' is perceived as being a bad film despite a close similarity to the original.<ref name=\"DOGJul16\"/> ''[[Deadspin]]'' said that like those aforementioned films, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'}}s darker setpieces and comedy made it more suited for adults than children, but that it is better than most people remember.<ref name=\"DeadSpinJun14\"/> [[Uproxx]] called it the ideal film to watch during the [[New Year]] period because it offers an unsubtle, but simple morality tale about treating others well.<ref name=\"LegacyUproxx\"/>\n\nContemporary review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a 53% approval rating from 38 critics\u2014an average rating of 5.32/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Thanks to the cast, ''Ghostbusters 2'' is reasonably amusing, but it lacks the charm, wit, and energy of its predecessor\".<ref name=\"RottenTomatoes\"/> The film has a score of 56 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 14 critical reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> In 2009, Den of Geek listed it as the eighteenth best blockbuster sequel of all time.<ref name=\"DOG2009Best\"/>\n\n===Merchandise===\n{{see also|List of Ghostbusters video games#Ghostbusters II video game|l1=Ghostbusters video games}}\nFilm merchandising was a relatively new concept created mainly by the success of the ''Star Wars'' series. Merchandising for ''Ghostbusters'' was unsuccessful; toys in particular sold poorly until the release of the cartoon spin-off ''The Real Ghostbusters''. Sequels were seen as a brighter prospect because they are based on established characters. Over 24 tie-in toys were released alongside the film including water guns, colored slimes,<ref name=\"NYTimesJun89\"/> [[coloring book]]s, comics, and children's meals.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> ''Ghostbusters'' action figures were the fifth-most in-demand toy for the 1989 Christmas season according to a survey of 15,000 retailers.<ref name=\"LATimesToys\"/> Approximately 2.8 million units of a promotional [[noisemaker]] toy called the \"Ghostblaster\", which was released across 3,100 outlets of the fast-food restaurant [[Hardee's]], were recalled in June 1989 because of reports children were ingesting its small batteries.<ref name=\"UPIHardees\"/><ref name=\"CSPCHardees\"/> [[Now Comics]] released a three-part comic book miniseries adaptation of the film set in ''The Real Ghostbusters'' cartoon universe. The story included subplots from the film including Ray's possession while driving the Ectomobile and Tully trying to capture Slimer.{{sfn|ComicBookIssue1|1989|pp=1,2}}{{sfn|ComicBookIssue2|1989|pp=1,2,21\u201324, 27}}{{sfn|ComicBookIssue3|1989|pp=1,2}}\n\nSeveral video games were released around the release of the film; ''[[Ghostbusters II (computer video game)|Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II]]'' in 1989 for personal computers, ''[[Ghostbusters II (NES video game)|Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II]]'' (published by [[Activision]]) in 1990 for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), and ''[[New Ghostbusters II]]'' (as ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''), also in 1990 for the Nintendo [[Game Boy]]. ''New Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' was also released for the NES in Europe and Japan but could not be released in America because Activision held the rights to the game there.<ref name=\"ViceVideoGames\"/><ref name=\"EngagetNes\"/>\n\nSince its release, ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' merchandise has included [[Playmobil]] sets with action figures and a model of the Ectomobile 1A.<ref name=\"MerchPlaymobil\"/> A [[board game]], ''Ghostbusters: The Board Game II'', was released in 2017 by [[Cryptozoic Entertainment]]. Based on the film, it casts the players as the Ghostbusters and tasks them with defeating Vigo and his ghostly minions. The game's creation was [[crowdfunding|crowdfunded]], raising over $760,000.<ref name=\"BoardGame1\"/><ref name=\"BoardGame2\"/><ref name=\"BoardGame3\"/> The 2019 [[Halloween Horror Nights]] event at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[Universal Studios Florida]] held a 'Ghostbusters-themed haunted maze that featured locations, characters, and ghosts from ''Ghostbusters'', and the Scoleri Brothers.<ref name=\"MazeIGN\"/>\n\n==Sequels and spin-offs==\n{{see also|Ghostbusters (franchise)|Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters: Afterlife}}\n[[File:Men Women and Children 45 (15273754892).jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=A profile image of Jason Reitman.

He is seen from his right, smiling towards something off camera. |[[Jason Reitman]], director of  ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', a sequel to ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'']]\n\nDiscussion about a sequel took place during filming of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', but Ramis was dismissive because of both the actors' ages and the difficulty in getting all of the cast together.<ref name=\"NYTDec88\"/> Despite ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''{{'s}} relative failure, the name recognition and popularity of the actors and their characters meant a third film was still pursued. The concept failed to progress for many years because Murray was reluctant to participate.<ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/><ref name=\"LAtimes2008\"/> ''The Real Ghostbusters'' series continued to air until 1991 and ended after seven seasons; according to Medjuck, the cartoon series technically took place after the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II''.<ref name=\"BTMSep14\"/><ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> ''The Real Ghostbusters'' was followed in 1997 by a sequel series called ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'', which aimed to reinvigorate the franchise but lasted for only one season.<ref name=\"Collider2013\"/> In the years that followed the release of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', Aykroyd continued his attempts to develop a film sequel throughout the 1990s to the early 2010s. By 1999, he had completed a 122-page concept for a sequel called ''Ghostbusters III: Hellbent'', which would add several new characters and take them to ManHellton\u2014a demonic version of Manhattan\u2014where they would encounter the demon [[Lucifer]].<ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' featuring story consulting by Ramis and Aykroyd, and the likenesses and voice acting of Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, and Atherton, was released. Set two years after ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'', the story follows the Ghostbusters training a new recruit (the player) to combat a ghostly threat related to Gozer. The game was well-received, earning award nominations for its storytelling. Aykroyd said the game is \"essentially the third movie\".<ref name=\"DOGJun14\"/><ref name=\"VultureAug14\"/> The game establishes that following the events of ''Ghostbusters{{nbsp}}II'' the still-possessed portrait of Vigo became a decoration at the Ghostbusters' firehouse.<ref name=\"DOGJul16Game\"/> ''Ghostbusters: The Return'' (2004) was the first in a planned series of sequel novels before the publisher, [[Byron Preiss|iBooks]], went out of business.<ref name=\"THRApr16\"/> Several [[Ghostbusters (comics)|''Ghostbusters'' comic books]] have also continued the original characters' adventures across the globe and in other dimensions.<ref name=\"THRApr16\"/><ref name=\"THRJan2019\"/>\n\nFollowing Ramis's death in 2014, Reitman chose to no longer serve as director for a potential third film.<ref name=\"EWOCt14\"/><ref name=\"THRFeb14\"/> He decided the creative control shared by himself, Ramis, Aykroyd, and Murray was holding the franchise back and negotiated a deal with the studio to sell the rights. Reitman spent two weeks persuading Murray. Reitman refused to release details about the deal but said, \"the creators would be enriched for the rest of our lives, and for the rest of our children\u2019s lives\". He and Aykroyd set up a production company called [[Ghost Corps]] to continue and expand the franchise, starting with the 2016 female-led reboot, ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'', which was directed by [[Paul Feig]]<ref name=\"VultureControl\"/> and starred [[Melissa McCarthy]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]], and [[Kate McKinnon]] as the Ghostbusters.<ref name=\"EWOCt14\"/><ref name=\"BBCJan15\"/> Before its release, the film was beset by controversies and on release it attracted mixed reviews and was later considered a [[box office bomb]].<ref name=\"MSNBCMar16\"/><ref name=\"PolygonJul16\"/><ref name=\"FortuneJul16\"/><ref name=\"EsquireJun17\"/> A second, direct sequel to the original two films, ''[[Ghostbusters: Afterlife]]'', was announced in January 2019, with Reitman's son [[Jason Reitman|Jason]] serving as director. This sequel was written by him and [[Gil Kenan]], and is scheduled for a March 2021 release.<ref name=\"EWJan19\"/> Several members of the original cast are set to appear in the film alongside new cast members [[Mckenna Grace]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Carrie Coon]], and [[Paul Rudd]].<ref name=\"GB2020Continued\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist||refs=\n\n<ref name=\"AICNOverview\">{{cite

He became the first ever directly elected president of Yonsei University's student council. While he was the president of the student council, Song participated in the democratic movement with students from other universities. In 1985, Song was sent to prison for one-and-a-half years for violating the Law on Assembly and Demonstration.\nFollowing his release, Song worked as a laborer, including time as a welder for Daewoo Motor, and as a taxi driver for 7 years. At the age of 30, he took the National Bar Examination to challenge human rights violations and improve unfair treatment of the underprivileged.\nAfter passing the exam, he became an active human rights lawyer working alongside the weak and the poor. In 1999, in order to further help those in need, he ran in the 1999 by-elections, but lost. He was later elected as a National Assemblyman in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 general elections.\nAs a lawmaker, his activities include a member of Special Committees on the Historical Distortion of Japanese Textbooks, Against the Iraq War, the Korea-US FTA, and KIKO.\nHe was also a member of the Legislation & Judiciary Committee and the Finance & Economy Committee. When he was member of the National Assembly's Committee on Health, Welfare and Information and a Supreme Council Member of the Democratic Party, he ran in the Incheon mayoral election and was elected Mayor on June 2, 2010.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/06/116_66993.html|work=The Korea Times|title=Ruling camp leaders resign over local elections defeat|date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nSong, Young Gil was born in Goheung, South Jeolla Province, the fourth son of a poor civil servant. He grew up in a rural area and was inspired by nature. In May 1980 when he was a senior high school student, he witnessed the Gwangju Democratization Movement. Seeing the deaths of innocent citizens with his own eyes marked a turning point in his life. After entering Yonsei University to study business management in 1981, he joined the anti-dictatorship movement without any hesitation. In 1984, he succeeded in removing the government-controlled student body and reinstated the student council. He subsequently became the first ever directly elected president of the student council and thereafter led the student democratization movement. He was jailed as a result. In 1988, he was recognized for his contribution to democratization and had his rights reinstated.\n\n===Labor movement===\nAfter release from jail in 1985, Song moved to Incheon to start life as a laborer. He became a welder at the Daewoo Motor factory in Incheon. He also worked in watch, glove, and furniture factories for two years to experience the hardships of laborers. In 1987 with the support of Germany's human rights foundation \u2018Bread for the World\u2019 and Kim, Dae-joong, Kim, Young-sam and other politicians, Song established \u2018Christian Public Education Research Institutes\u2019 in Bupyeong, Incheon. Song conducted legal counseling for human rights violations, education on labor unions, and provided legal support. While working as a taxi driver, he democratized the Taxi Labor Union and became the first Secretary-General of the National Taxi Trade Union, Incheon Division in 1991. He dedicated himself in promoting the rights of transportation laborers.\n\n===Human rights lawyer===\nSong realized the reality that laborers were treated badly and that their human rights were violated, and he sought to help them. After passing the National Bar Examination in 1994, he went to Incheon to keep the promise he had made to his colleagues. He worked hard as a human rights lawyer. For the poor workers, he provided 500 free legal services. Song proved the innocence of workers who were falsely charged and won compensation for street vendors who had been unjustly killed. Although he was poor, he felt rewarded because he was able to help colleagues who were with him during those difficult times.\n\n===Political career===\nThe more Song became active as a human rights lawyer, the more he wanted to improve the legal systems and institutions for the underprivileged. After much thought, he ran in the 1999 by-election to help people in need but lost because the general public was disenchanted by politics at the time. A day after the defeat, Song climbed up a mountain early in the morning to absorb the defeat and reflect on the opinions of the voters. It is said that a period of wandering and defeat matures the soul, and Song acknowledges this was the case during this period of self-reflection. Shortly afterwards, Song began his career as a National Assemblyman in 2000 with a new determination to serve in the interests of the general public.\n\n====Human rights activities====\nBased on his experience as a lawyer, Song applied to work for the Legislation & Judiciary Committee to take care of bills that are closely related to the people's livelihood and human rights. Years of experience as a labor movement activist and human rights lawyer were the inspiration for his parliamentary activities and made him more interested in human rights and democracy. As a part of such efforts, Song led a National assembly delegation which attended a Human Rights and Parliamentary Conference for the five Northeast Asian nations which was held in Mongolia. At the conference, he made a speech about the human rights situation in Korea and proposed legislation on anti-humanitarian crimes. As a member of the Legislation & Judiciary Committee of the National Assembly, Song played a crucial role in creating a law on the National Human Rights Commission. Song also assumed the role of Chairman of the Democratic Party's Commission on the Yong-san Tragedy to negotiate with the government and Seoul City over much delayed compensation and funeral issues.\n\n====Correcting distorted history====\nEvents during the Japanese colonization of Korea have been thorny issues for decades, including the issue of compensation for Korean comfort women used by the Japanese army, the distorted history which appears in Japanese textbooks, and the name and territorial rights over the islet of Dokdo. Japan has distorted its history textbooks and made reckless remarks on Dokdo without an official apology to the Korean comfort women who suffered enormous physical and psychological pain. In response to this, Song proposed a resolution on the distortion of Japanese history books and the elimination of vestiges of the Japanese colonial period with other lawmakers, calling for immediate action by the Korean government. In 2001, through the activities of a special committee, Song sent CDs containing information on Japan's invasion, comfort women and the distortion of Japanese history books to 600 overseas institutions, demanding Japan's apology and asking for the support of other nations. In addition to calling for Japan's apology, Song attended the Joint Conference of the Korea-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Council and proposed a statement which sought ways for Korea and Japan to cooperate in diverse areas as new partners. As such, Song has underscored a more accurate perception of history and contributed to a future-oriented partnership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20051102000042|work=koreaherald|title=Korea concerned over japan's cabinet|date=2010-04-06}}</ref>\n\n====Anti-Iraq War and peace====\nIn 2003, the Bush administration invaded Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction without legitimate reason. All people of conscience opposed the war and demanded peace. For Korea, which is faced with the nuclear weapons development of North Korea, the US invasion of Iraq was not something that they could ignore. Amid the government's lukewarm attitude due to the Korea-US alliance, Song and other lawmakers agreed that they needed to take action as lawmakers. Starting with an understanding on the Iraq situation, they drafted an anti-war statement and resolution urging others to join. After that, they formed an Iraq Fact Finding Team led by Song to visit Iraq in order to possibly find a peaceful resolution through the extension of UN weapons inspectors and promote Korean lawmakers\u2019 support for a peaceful resolution of the Iraq War to the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe lawmakers met the Iraq Congress President Hammadi and Chairman Kubaisai of the Diplomatic Commission of the Iraq Congress to express their opinion that Iraq could avoid the war by complying with UN regulations which would increase its credibility among international society. They held a press conference to announce their statement against the US attack on Iraq and their message supporting peace. Song also met NGO groups to offer unsparing encouragement and support for their activities.\nSince then, Song has continued his efforts for peace including sending messages of peace to the Pope and Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa. As the secretary of the Special Committee on the Korean Killed by Terrorists in Iraq, he visited Iraq again and urged the world to act to prevent war and bring peace where justice and freedom would prevail.\n\n====Support for Myanmar's democratization movement====\nSong has been well aware of the dismal situation in Myanmar where democracy has been dampened by military juntas and human rights have been violated. He had experienced a similar situation during the Gwangju Democratic Movement when he was a student, which allowed him to understand the activities of the Korean branch of the Myanmar Democratization Alliance. He thought that there should be keen interest in and support for Myanmar from the whole world as well as Korea, and has cooperated with it since 2003. In 2007, he and 13 lawmakers who were dedicated to the democratization of Korea during the dictatorship in the 1980s jointly proposed a resolution that supported the democratization of Myanmar and donated money that had been raised to the Korean branch of the Myanmar Democratization Alliance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/uden/entry/korea_marks_64th_birthday_of|work=time|title=Martin Uden|date=2009-06-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727141208/http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/uden/entry/korea_marks_64th_birthday_of|archive-date=2011-07-27|df=}}</ref> In October 2008, they announced a resolution which called for the release of Aungsan Suchi from house arrest and expressed support for the Myanmare people who continued to struggle against the junta. They also sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban, Ki-moon and Myanmar military regime to urge the democratization of Myanmar. In 2011 after Song became Incheon Mayor, he made a phone call to Aungsan Suchi after her release from long house arrest to pay his respects to her dedication and noble spirit toward democracy, and to request that she visit Incheon during the Asian Games Incheon 2014.\n\n====Inter-Korean exchanges====\nSong has said that to prepare for reunification and to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, the South needs to increase similarities through economic, political and cultural exchanges with the North, which would help the North Korean economy increase its self-reliance. He believes that to bring lasting peace to the Korean Peninsula, new changes are much needed. In this context, Song went to Pyeongyang with young businessmen in 2003 and discussed the possibility of expanding economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two Koreas.\nSong has also visited Gaeseong Industrial Complex several times which has been playing a critical role in ensuring the self-reliance of North Korea and contributing to peace on the Korean Peninsula and in the world. Through these visits, he saw for himself the importance of Gaeseong Industrial Complex for Korean small enterprises as new sales channels. He held meetings with businessmen and government officials to encourage more companies to move to the North which might in turn induce the communist nation to introduce reform and openness.\nSong and the Democratic Party urged the government to carry out what had been agreed upon in the June 15 and October 4 Joint Declaration to improve relations between the two Koreas which had been strained by the tough stance of the current administration on North Korea. He also called on the government to enter dialogue with the North and to closely cooperate with neighboring countries to form 6-party talks which play such a vital role in the joint security of Northeast Asia.\nAfter becoming Incheon Mayor in 2010, Mayor Song declared Incheon to be the outpost of reconciliation, exchanges, peace and reunification of the two Koreas. Despite opposition from the government, he has insisted that there should be peace on the 5 islands near the Northern Limit Line in the West Sea for the economic development of Incheon. At the same time, Song has provided products to mothers and babies in North Korea through an agreement with the Korea Peace Foundation, which opened a door that was shut after the North's [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|sinking of the ''Cheonan'']].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20101112000630|work=The Korea Herald|title=Pivotal role for Korea in N.E. Asia integration|date=November 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Stimulating the economy====\nBased on his experience as a laborer and a taxi driver, Song believes that a lawmaker should be a good listener who is in touch with the difficulties and opinions of the general public. Song has tried to minimize damage to the economy which would directly impact the lives of commoners. As such, he doesn't want to focus on a few large companies and would rather focus on helping the livelihoods of ordinary people. He proposed bills to exempt value added tax on rental fees for traditional market vendors in order to nurture traditional markets. He also submitted bills to prevent excessive increases in rental fees and protect the tenants of commercial buildings. He is dedicated to helping the underprivileged and middle classes.\n\n====Enhancing competitiveness for small and medium enterprises====\nWhile working for 6 years as a member of the Finance & Economy Committee in the National Assembly, Song felt that the main driver of Korea's economy came from the small companies which account for 80% of all companies and therefore that the most important thing is to lay down foundations for those firms to grow. In 2008, most small exporting firms bought currency option products called KIKO (Knock-in Knock-out) to avoid the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/04/123_31423.html|work=The Korea Times|title=banks Hit for transferring currency Loss to small firms|date=2008-09-22}}</ref> The companies were about to collapse again due to the inappropriate exchange rate policy of the current government but the government didn't take the proper measures to rescue small companies. Song urged the Democratic Party to pay keen interest in this issue and to find solutions. By forming a special committee, he held dozens of meetings with small enterprises and led hearings to narrow differences and find solutions. In due course, he got a promise from the government to provide speedy support for small enterprises which performed well.\n\n====Diplomatic activities====\nIn this globalized world, the problems of one nation are no longer limited to one nation. Song has long believed that the world needs to share diverse global issues through multi-channel dialogues to deal with its problems and through exchanges we need to understand and cooperate with each other. He has met with a lot of foreign leaders through many friendly activities after becoming a National Assemblyman. In particular, he became the Chairman of the Korean-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Council's 21st Century Committee in 2004, and consequently held discussions and conferences on the various issues concerning Korea and Japan. He was also the Chairman of the Korea-France Parliaments\u2019 Friendship Association and led active exchanges to promote knowledge about the EU and France. In 2007, he received L\u00e9gion d'Honneur Chevalier from France for his dedication in promoting relations between Korea and France.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20090302000059|work=The Korea Herald|title=386er knighted|date= 2010-03-30}}</ref>\nAfter his second term, Song realized the importance of diplomacy and visited and received other nations in order to increase exchanges and deepen the understanding of the US, Australia, China and other neighboring nations.\nWhen the Korea-US FTA negotiations began in 2006, Song became the Chairman of the Uri Party's Special Committee on the Korea-US FTA in order to reflect the opinions of stakeholders and to take measures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vop.co.kr/A00000049562.html|work=Minjung ui Sori|title=US should not exclude KIC in the KORUS FTA|date=2006-08-24}}</ref> As such, he was able to expand exchanges with US officials including negotiation delegates and US congressmen. As the recognition of products from Gaesong Industrial Complex as Korean products became a hot issue, Song exchanged opinions on Gaeseong Industrial Complex that could help North Korea's self-reliance and guarantee peace on the Korean Peninsula. In 2007, at the invitation of a US senator, he attended a reception marking the opening of the US Congress and discussed the Korea-US FTA, the North Korean nuclear program, and peace on the Korean Peninsula with then presidential nominee Obama, Senator Biden and other congressmen of the Democratic Party.\nIn 2008, the results of the US presidential election and the Democratic Party's regaining control after 8 years demanded new cooperation and close exchanges between Korea and the US. Song formed a Special Committee on Korea-US Relations Development and as chairman he endeavored to establish balanced diplomatic relations between Korea and the US, develop inter-Korean relations, enhance the Korea-US alliance, and promote economic cooperation including the Korea-US FTA.\n\n===Incheon mayoral election===\nWhen he declared his intention to run in the Incheon mayoral election, Song explained that he was running to win. At that time, the victory of the Democratic Party in the three metropolitan areas of Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and Incheon was uncertain, but he made it clear that he would win in Incheon, triggering victories in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, which will lay the foundations for a change of administration.\nWith the announcement of his running, Song talked about his plans for nurturing small enterprises, balancing development between the old and new town, expanding welfare provision, enhancing educational competitiveness, and providing free eco-friendly meals to make Incheon the economic capital of Korea.\nlink\n<ref>http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=003&aid=0003182610</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100714000607|work=koreaherald|title=Development of incheon crucial for nation's future|date=2010-07-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Invitation of the UNGCF Secretariat ===\n\nThe challenges of climate change necessitate a transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient development pathway. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is expected to promote such a transition by providing support to developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. Meaningful progress will be made through a combination of long-term commitments and immediate action based on international cooperation.\n\nKorea officially delivered is intention to host the GCF Secretariat in November 2011, and also selected Songdo of Incheon to be the host city of the office in March 2012.\n\nGreen Climate Fund\n\n-History\n\nAt the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in Cancun, Mexico, from 29 November to 10 December 2010, the Parties decided to establish the Green Climate Fund.\n\nBy the same decision, the COP decided that the Green Climate Fund would be designed by a Transitional Committee.\n\nThe Transitional Committee comprised 40 members (15 members from developed country Parties and 25 members from developing country Parties). It met four times in the course of 2011 and, in accordance with its terms of reference, submitted to the COP at its 17th session in Durban, South Africa, from 28 November to 9 December 2011, the report for its consideration and approval.\n\nSongdo was selected as the host city of the UNGCF Secretariat at the 2nd GCF Board Meeting on October 20, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=Korea aims to be leader in green growth  |url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/11/117_123611.html|publisher=The korea times |date=2012-10-31}}</ref>\n\n-Composition\n\nThe Fund has 24-board members, the Secretariat and 194 member nations.\n\n-Scale of the Secretariat\n\nThe Secretariat is expected to have 300 to 500 employees in the initial period, which will rise to over 8,000 once the fund gets up and running.\n\n-Rationale for the selection of Incheon as the host city\n\nIncheon is a hub city of economy, logistics and trade in Northeast Asia. There are 61 cities of more than 1 million people with access to 2 billion people within a 3-hour flight of the city.\n\nBy vigorously nurturing logistics, tourism, leisure, IT and BT industries, Incheon is developing into the leading hub city of Northeast Asia and the heart and business hub of Korea. Much of its development is centered on Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port.\n\n-The optimal location for the UNGCF Secretariat.\n\nSongdo International City boasts state-of-the-art working conditions. It has international schools, a Global University Campus and its own Central Park. As such, it is well equipped with education and medical services, accommodation provision, MICE, and parks. In addition, it has garnered attention from around the world as a low-carbon, eco-friendly city. Songdo International City at once embodies the goal of the Green Climate Fund, and provides foreigner-friendly living conditions as a compact, smart city.\n\n-A new growth engine for Incheon\n\nThe KDI (Korea Development Institute) has estimated that the economic benefit of the UNGCF Secretariat to be 380 billion won a year in the initial stage. The IDI (Incheon Development Institute) has forecasted that the direct economic effect to Incheon will reach 190 billion won a year.\nIn addition, hosting the GCF will create new businesses in green financing, green technology industries, and green products, increasing the direct and indirect economic effects.\n\nIn particular, it will increase Incheon's brand value as a low carbon green growth model city and contribute to boosting investment in Incheon Free Economic Zone. The decision to establish such a major international organization in the city will contribute to easing inter-Korean relations and develop Incheon's role as a bridge between developing and developed nations. The influence of Korea in international society is also expected to grow gradually as a result of the decision to locate the GCF Secretariat in Songdo.\n\n=== [[Tsinghua University]] ===\nSong ran for 6th local election (Incheon mayoral election) in 2014. After losing the election against Yoo, Jeong Bok by 1.75%, He decided to study abroad at Tsinghua University in China. While he was studying at Tsinghua University, his research foci were the issues of housing, jobs and welfare system. He returned to Korea in 2015. Following October, he launched \u2018eat and live\u2019 research lab to further develop his research at Tsinghua University into policies\n\n=== Member of the 20th National Assembly ===\nOn 1 March 2016, Song declared that he is running for the National Assembly as a Democrat in Incheon's Gyeyang (B) constituency, which he represented in previous years. He considered running in competitive constituency. However, he decided to run in Gyeyang (B) after assemblyman Choi, Won Sik leaves the Democratic Party despite Song's persuasion to stay. Song declared that he will run for the party leadership after the general election and he said that he takes the full responsibility of the entire elections in Incheon and will recover the Incheon politics. On 13 April 2016, he won the post by 12% against Yoon, Hyung-sun of Saenuri Party. He returned to the National Assembly after 6 years since he ran for the 5th General election in 2010\n\nOn 24 July 2016, He declared his running for the party leadership. He pledged to devote himself to make the Party into a \u2018strong\u2019 opposition and to replace the Saenuri government in the upcoming presidential election. He was considered to be the leading candidate who represented the wide mainstream democrats. However, he lost the primary election. Political commentators analyze Song's [[Election threshold|'cut-off']]  with two reasons, disparity of \u2018pro-Roh\u2019 (pro-[[Roh Moo-hyun|Roh, Moo-Hyun]]) voters and the very last minute leadership bid waged by Lee, Jong-kul, which gathered strong \u2018non-Roh\u2019 voters.\n\nOn 8 February 2017, Song joined [[Moon Jae-in|Moon, Jae-in's]] campaign for [[2017 South Korean presidential election|the 19th Presidential Election]] as chief campaign manager. It is later known that Moon persuaded Song several times to join his presidential campaign. Song commented that \u201cI also considered running for the presidential election, however, I decided to cooperate with Moon to replace the government and believe that helping Moon is answering the call of the people of Republic of Korea\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mbn.mk.co.kr/pages/news/newsView.php?category=mbn00006&news_seq_no=3136907|title=\ubb38 \uc804 \ub300\ud45c \uc0bc\uace0\ucd08\ub824\ub85c '\ucd1d\uad04\ubcf8\ubd80\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc1a1\uc601\uae38' \uc601\uc785|last=|first=|date=|website=mbn.mk.co.kr|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of Moon's presidency, Song has been designated as the special envoy of President Moon Jae-in to the Russian Federation in May 2017.

He became the first ever directly elected president of Yonsei University's student council. While he was the president of the student council, Song participated in the democratic movement with students from other universities. In 1985, Song was sent to prison for one-and-a-half years for violating the Law on Assembly and Demonstration.\nFollowing his release, Song worked as a laborer, including time as a welder for Daewoo Motor, and as a taxi driver for 7 years. At the age of 30, he took the National Bar Examination to challenge human rights violations and improve unfair treatment of the underprivileged.\nAfter passing the exam, he became an active human rights lawyer working alongside the weak and the poor. In 1999, in order to further help those in need, he ran in the 1999 by-elections, but lost. He was later elected as a National Assemblyman in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 general elections.\nAs a lawmaker, his activities include a member of Special Committees on the Historical Distortion of Japanese Textbooks, Against the Iraq War, the Korea-US FTA, and KIKO.\nHe was also a member of the Legislation & Judiciary Committee and the Finance & Economy Committee. When he was member of the National Assembly's Committee on Health, Welfare and Information and a Supreme Council Member of the Democratic Party, he ran in the Incheon mayoral election and was elected Mayor on June 2, 2010.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/06/116_66993.html|work=The Korea Times|title=Ruling camp leaders resign over local elections defeat|date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nSong, Young Gil was born in Goheung, South Jeolla Province, the fourth son of a poor civil servant. He grew up in a rural area and was inspired by nature. In May 1980 when he was a senior high school student, he witnessed the Gwangju Democratization Movement. Seeing the deaths of innocent citizens with his own eyes marked a turning point in his life. After entering Yonsei University to study business management in 1981, he joined the anti-dictatorship movement without any hesitation. In 1984, he succeeded in removing the government-controlled student body and reinstated the student council. He subsequently became the first ever directly elected president of the student council and thereafter led the student democratization movement. He was jailed as a result. In 1988, he was recognized for his contribution to democratization and had his rights reinstated.\n\n===Labor movement===\nAfter release from jail in 1985, Song moved to Incheon to start life as a laborer. He became a welder at the Daewoo Motor factory in Incheon. He also worked in watch, glove, and furniture factories for two years to experience the hardships of laborers. In 1987 with the support of Germany's human rights foundation \u2018Bread for the World\u2019 and Kim, Dae-joong, Kim, Young-sam and other politicians, Song established \u2018Christian Public Education Research Institutes\u2019 in Bupyeong, Incheon. Song conducted legal counseling for human rights violations, education on labor unions, and provided legal support. While working as a taxi driver, he democratized the Taxi Labor Union and became the first Secretary-General of the National Taxi Trade Union, Incheon Division in 1991. He dedicated himself in promoting the rights of transportation laborers.\n\n===Human rights lawyer===\nSong realized the reality that laborers were treated badly and that their human rights were violated, and he sought to help them. After passing the National Bar Examination in 1994, he went to Incheon to keep the promise he had made to his colleagues. He worked hard as a human rights lawyer. For the poor workers, he provided 500 free legal services. Song proved the innocence of workers who were falsely charged and won compensation for street vendors who had been unjustly killed. Although he was poor, he felt rewarded because he was able to help colleagues who were with him during those difficult times.\n\n===Political career===\nThe more Song became active as a human rights lawyer, the more he wanted to improve the legal systems and institutions for the underprivileged. After much thought, he ran in the 1999 by-election to help people in need but lost because the general public was disenchanted by politics at the time. A day after the defeat, Song climbed up a mountain early in the morning to absorb the defeat and reflect on the opinions of the voters. It is said that a period of wandering and defeat matures the soul, and Song acknowledges this was the case during this period of self-reflection. Shortly afterwards, Song began his career as a National Assemblyman in 2000 with a new determination to serve in the interests of the general public.\n\n====Human rights activities====\nBased on his experience as a lawyer, Song applied to work for the Legislation & Judiciary Committee to take care of bills that are closely related to the people's livelihood and human rights. Years of experience as a labor movement activist and human rights lawyer were the inspiration for his parliamentary activities and made him more interested in human rights and democracy. As a part of such efforts, Song led a National assembly delegation which attended a Human Rights and Parliamentary Conference for the five Northeast Asian nations which was held in Mongolia. At the conference, he made a speech about the human rights situation in Korea and proposed legislation on anti-humanitarian crimes. As a member of the Legislation & Judiciary Committee of the National Assembly, Song played a crucial role in creating a law on the National Human Rights Commission. Song also assumed the role of Chairman of the Democratic Party's Commission on the Yong-san Tragedy to negotiate with the government and Seoul City over much delayed compensation and funeral issues.\n\n====Correcting distorted history====\nEvents during the Japanese colonization of Korea have been thorny issues for decades, including the issue of compensation for Korean comfort women used by the Japanese army, the distorted history which appears in Japanese textbooks, and the name and territorial rights over the islet of Dokdo. Japan has distorted its history textbooks and made reckless remarks on Dokdo without an official apology to the Korean comfort women who suffered enormous physical and psychological pain. In response to this, Song proposed a resolution on the distortion of Japanese history books and the elimination of vestiges of the Japanese colonial period with other lawmakers, calling for immediate action by the Korean government. In 2001, through the activities of a special committee, Song sent CDs containing information on Japan's invasion, comfort women and the distortion of Japanese history books to 600 overseas institutions, demanding Japan's apology and asking for the support of other nations. In addition to calling for Japan's apology, Song attended the Joint Conference of the Korea-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Council and proposed a statement which sought ways for Korea and Japan to cooperate in diverse areas as new partners. As such, Song has underscored a more accurate perception of history and contributed to a future-oriented partnership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20051102000042|work=koreaherald|title=Korea concerned over japan's cabinet|date=2010-04-06}}</ref>\n\n====Anti-Iraq War and peace====\nIn 2003, the Bush administration invaded Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction without legitimate reason. All people of conscience opposed the war and demanded peace. For Korea, which is faced with the nuclear weapons development of North Korea, the US invasion of Iraq was not something that they could ignore. Amid the government's lukewarm attitude due to the Korea-US alliance, Song and other lawmakers agreed that they needed to take action as lawmakers. Starting with an understanding on the Iraq situation, they drafted an anti-war statement and resolution urging others to join. After that, they formed an Iraq Fact Finding Team led by Song to visit Iraq in order to possibly find a peaceful resolution through the extension of UN weapons inspectors and promote Korean lawmakers\u2019 support for a peaceful resolution of the Iraq War to the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe lawmakers met the Iraq Congress President Hammadi and Chairman Kubaisai of the Diplomatic Commission of the Iraq Congress to express their opinion that Iraq could avoid the war by complying with UN regulations which would increase its credibility among international society. They held a press conference to announce their statement against the US attack on Iraq and their message supporting peace. Song also met NGO groups to offer unsparing encouragement and support for their activities.\nSince then, Song has continued his efforts for peace including sending messages of peace to the Pope and Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa. As the secretary of the Special Committee on the Korean Killed by Terrorists in Iraq, he visited Iraq again and urged the world to act to prevent war and bring peace where justice and freedom would prevail.\n\n====Support for Myanmar's democratization movement====\nSong has been well aware of the dismal situation in Myanmar where democracy has been dampened by military juntas and human rights have been violated. He had experienced a similar situation during the Gwangju Democratic Movement when he was a student, which allowed him to understand the activities of the Korean branch of the Myanmar Democratization Alliance. He thought that there should be keen interest in and support for Myanmar from the whole world as well as Korea, and has cooperated with it since 2003. In 2007, he and 13 lawmakers who were dedicated to the democratization of Korea during the dictatorship in the 1980s jointly proposed a resolution that supported the democratization of Myanmar and donated money that had been raised to the Korean branch of the Myanmar Democratization Alliance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/uden/entry/korea_marks_64th_birthday_of|work=time|title=Martin Uden|date=2009-06-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727141208/http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/uden/entry/korea_marks_64th_birthday_of|archive-date=2011-07-27|df=}}</ref> In October 2008, they announced a resolution which called for the release of Aungsan Suchi from house arrest and expressed support for the Myanmare people who continued to struggle against the junta. They also sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban, Ki-moon and Myanmar military regime to urge the democratization of Myanmar. In 2011 after Song became Incheon Mayor, he made a phone call to Aungsan Suchi after her release from long house arrest to pay his respects to her dedication and noble spirit toward democracy, and to request that she visit Incheon during the Asian Games Incheon 2014.\n\n====Inter-Korean exchanges====\nSong has said that to prepare for reunification and to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, the South needs to increase similarities through economic, political and cultural exchanges with the North, which would help the North Korean economy increase its self-reliance. He believes that to bring lasting peace to the Korean Peninsula, new changes are much needed. In this context, Song went to Pyeongyang with young businessmen in 2003 and discussed the possibility of expanding economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two Koreas.\nSong has also visited Gaeseong Industrial Complex several times which has been playing a critical role in ensuring the self-reliance of North Korea and contributing to peace on the Korean Peninsula and in the world. Through these visits, he saw for himself the importance of Gaeseong Industrial Complex for Korean small enterprises as new sales channels. He held meetings with businessmen and government officials to encourage more companies to move to the North which might in turn induce the communist nation to introduce reform and openness.\nSong and the Democratic Party urged the government to carry out what had been agreed upon in the June 15 and October 4 Joint Declaration to improve relations between the two Koreas which had been strained by the tough stance of the current administration on North Korea. He also called on the government to enter dialogue with the North and to closely cooperate with neighboring countries to form 6-party talks which play such a vital role in the joint security of Northeast Asia.\nAfter becoming Incheon Mayor in 2010, Mayor Song declared Incheon to be the outpost of reconciliation, exchanges, peace and reunification of the two Koreas. Despite opposition from the government, he has insisted that there should be peace on the 5 islands near the Northern Limit Line in the West Sea for the economic development of Incheon. At the same time, Song has provided products to mothers and babies in North Korea through an agreement with the Korea Peace Foundation, which opened a door that was shut after the North's [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|sinking of the ''Cheonan'']].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20101112000630|work=The Korea Herald|title=Pivotal role for Korea in N.E. Asia integration|date=November 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Stimulating the economy====\nBased on his experience as a laborer and a taxi driver, Song believes that a lawmaker should be a good listener who is in touch with the difficulties and opinions of the general public. Song has tried to minimize damage to the economy which would directly impact the lives of commoners. As such, he doesn't want to focus on a few large companies and would rather focus on helping the livelihoods of ordinary people. He proposed bills to exempt value added tax on rental fees for traditional market vendors in order to nurture traditional markets. He also submitted bills to prevent excessive increases in rental fees and protect the tenants of commercial buildings. He is dedicated to helping the underprivileged and middle classes.\n\n====Enhancing competitiveness for small and medium enterprises====\nWhile working for 6 years as a member of the Finance & Economy Committee in the National Assembly, Song felt that the main driver of Korea's economy came from the small companies which account for 80% of all companies and therefore that the most important thing is to lay down foundations for those firms to grow. In 2008, most small exporting firms bought currency option products called KIKO (Knock-in Knock-out) to avoid the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/04/123_31423.html|work=The Korea Times|title=banks Hit for transferring currency Loss to small firms|date=2008-09-22}}</ref> The companies were about to collapse again due to the inappropriate exchange rate policy of the current government but the government didn't take the proper measures to rescue small companies. Song urged the Democratic Party to pay keen interest in this issue and to find solutions. By forming a special committee, he held dozens of meetings with small enterprises and led hearings to narrow differences and find solutions. In due course, he got a promise from the government to provide speedy support for small enterprises which performed well.\n\n====Diplomatic activities====\nIn this globalized world, the problems of one nation are no longer limited to one nation. Song has long believed that the world needs to share diverse global issues through multi-channel dialogues to deal with its problems and through exchanges we need to understand and cooperate with each other. He has met with a lot of foreign leaders through many friendly activities after becoming a National Assemblyman. In particular, he became the Chairman of the Korean-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Council's 21st Century Committee in 2004, and consequently held discussions and conferences on the various issues concerning Korea and Japan. He was also the Chairman of the Korea-France Parliaments\u2019 Friendship Association and led active exchanges to promote knowledge about the EU and France. In 2007, he received L\u00e9gion d'Honneur Chevalier from France for his dedication in promoting relations between Korea and France.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20090302000059|work=The Korea Herald|title=386er knighted|date= 2010-03-30}}</ref>\nAfter his second term, Song realized the importance of diplomacy and visited and received other nations in order to increase exchanges and deepen the understanding of the US, Australia, China and other neighboring nations.\nWhen the Korea-US FTA negotiations began in 2006, Song became the Chairman of the Uri Party's Special Committee on the Korea-US FTA in order to reflect the opinions of stakeholders and to take measures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vop.co.kr/A00000049562.html|work=Minjung ui Sori|title=US should not exclude KIC in the KORUS FTA|date=2006-08-24}}</ref> As such, he was able to expand exchanges with US officials including negotiation delegates and US congressmen. As the recognition of products from Gaesong Industrial Complex as Korean products became a hot issue, Song exchanged opinions on Gaeseong Industrial Complex that could help North Korea's self-reliance and guarantee peace on the Korean Peninsula. In 2007, at the invitation of a US senator, he attended a reception marking the opening of the US Congress and discussed the Korea-US FTA, the North Korean nuclear program, and peace on the Korean Peninsula with then presidential nominee Obama, Senator Biden and other congressmen of the Democratic Party.\nIn 2008, the results of the US presidential election and the Democratic Party's regaining control after 8 years demanded new cooperation and close exchanges between Korea and the US. Song formed a Special Committee on Korea-US Relations Development and as chairman he endeavored to establish balanced diplomatic relations between Korea and the US, develop inter-Korean relations, enhance the Korea-US alliance, and promote economic cooperation including the Korea-US FTA.\n\n===Incheon mayoral election===\nWhen he declared his intention to run in the Incheon mayoral election, Song explained that he was running to win. At that time, the victory of the Democratic Party in the three metropolitan areas of Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and Incheon was uncertain, but he made it clear that he would win in Incheon, triggering victories in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, which will lay the foundations for a change of administration.\nWith the announcement of his running, Song talked about his plans for nurturing small enterprises, balancing development between the old and new town, expanding welfare provision, enhancing educational competitiveness, and providing free eco-friendly meals to make Incheon the economic capital of Korea.\nlink\n<ref>http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=003&aid=0003182610</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100714000607|work=koreaherald|title=Development of incheon crucial for nation's future|date=2010-07-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Invitation of the UNGCF Secretariat ===\n\nThe challenges of climate change necessitate a transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient development pathway. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is expected to promote such a transition by providing support to developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. Meaningful progress will be made through a combination of long-term commitments and immediate action based on international cooperation.\n\nKorea officially delivered is intention to host the GCF Secretariat in November 2011, and also selected Songdo of Incheon to be the host city of the office in March 2012.\n\nGreen Climate Fund\n\n-History\n\nAt the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in Cancun, Mexico, from 29 November to 10 December 2010, the Parties decided to establish the Green Climate Fund.\n\nBy the same decision, the COP decided that the Green Climate Fund would be designed by a Transitional Committee.\n\nThe Transitional Committee comprised 40 members (15 members from developed country Parties and 25 members from developing country Parties). It met four times in the course of 2011 and, in accordance with its terms of reference, submitted to the COP at its 17th session in Durban, South Africa, from 28 November to 9 December 2011, the report for its consideration and approval.\n\nSongdo was selected as the host city of the UNGCF Secretariat at the 2nd GCF Board Meeting on October 20, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=Korea aims to be leader in green growth  |url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/11/117_123611.html|publisher=The korea times |date=2012-10-31}}</ref>\n\n-Composition\n\nThe Fund has 24-board members, the Secretariat and 194 member nations.\n\n-Scale of the Secretariat\n\nThe Secretariat is expected to have 300 to 500 employees in the initial period, which will rise to over 8,000 once the fund gets up and running.\n\n-Rationale for the selection of Incheon as the host city\n\nIncheon is a hub city of economy, logistics and trade in Northeast Asia. There are 61 cities of more than 1 million people with access to 2 billion people within a 3-hour flight of the city.\n\nBy vigorously nurturing logistics, tourism, leisure, IT and BT industries, Incheon is developing into the leading hub city of Northeast Asia and the heart and business hub of Korea. Much of its development is centered on Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port.\n\n-The optimal location for the UNGCF Secretariat.\n\nSongdo International City boasts state-of-the-art working conditions. It has international schools, a Global University Campus and its own Central Park. As such, it is well equipped with education and medical services, accommodation provision, MICE, and parks. In addition, it has garnered attention from around the world as a low-carbon, eco-friendly city. Songdo International City at once embodies the goal of the Green Climate Fund, and provides foreigner-friendly living conditions as a compact, smart city.\n\n-A new growth engine for Incheon\n\nThe KDI (Korea Development Institute) has estimated that the economic benefit of the UNGCF Secretariat to be 380 billion won a year in the initial stage. The IDI (Incheon Development Institute) has forecasted that the direct economic effect to Incheon will reach 190 billion won a year.\nIn addition, hosting the GCF will create new businesses in green financing, green technology industries, and green products, increasing the direct and indirect economic effects.\n\nIn particular, it will increase Incheon's brand value as a low carbon green growth model city and contribute to boosting investment in Incheon Free Economic Zone. The decision to establish such a major international organization in the city will contribute to easing inter-Korean relations and develop Incheon's role as a bridge between developing and developed nations. The influence of Korea in international society is also expected to grow gradually as a result of the decision to locate the GCF Secretariat in Songdo.\n\n=== [[Tsinghua University]] ===\nSong ran for 6th local election (Incheon mayoral election) in 2014. After losing the election against Yoo, Jeong Bok by 1.75%, He decided to study abroad at Tsinghua University in China. While he was studying at Tsinghua University, his research foci were the issues of housing, jobs and welfare system. He returned to Korea in 2015. Following October, he launched \u2018eat and live\u2019 research lab to further develop his research at Tsinghua University into policies\n\n=== Member of the 20th National Assembly ===\nOn 1 March 2016, Song declared that he is running for the National Assembly as a Democrat in Incheon's Gyeyang (B) constituency, which he represented in previous years. He considered running in competitive constituency. However, he decided to run in Gyeyang (B) after assemblyman Choi, Won Sik leaves the Democratic Party despite Song's persuasion to stay. Song declared that he will run for the party leadership after the general election and he said that he takes the full responsibility of the entire elections in Incheon and will recover the Incheon politics. On 13 April 2016, he won the post by 12% against Yoon, Hyung-sun of Saenuri Party. He returned to the National Assembly after 6 years since he ran for the 5th General election in 2010\n\nOn 24 July 2016, He declared his running for the party leadership. He pledged to devote himself to make the Party into a \u2018strong\u2019 opposition and to replace the Saenuri government in the upcoming presidential election. He was considered to be the leading candidate who represented the wide mainstream democrats. However, he lost the primary election. Political commentators analyze Song's [[Election threshold|'cut-off']]  with two reasons, disparity of \u2018pro-Roh\u2019 (pro-[[Roh Moo-hyun|Roh, Moo-Hyun]]) voters and the very last minute leadership bid waged by Lee, Jong-kul, which gathered strong \u2018non-Roh\u2019 voters.\n\nOn 8 February 2017, Song joined [[Moon Jae-in|Moon, Jae-in's]] campaign for [[2017 South Korean presidential election|the 19th Presidential Election]] as chief campaign manager.
