({{harvnb|Davis|Bagozzi|Warshaw|1989}})]]\n\nThe '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.  \n\nThe '''actual system use''' is the end-point where we want everyone to be able to do with technology, so we have to form '''Behavioral Intention''', which is a factor that leads people to use the technology. The behavioral intention (BI) is influenced by the '''attitude''' (A) which is the general impression of the technology.\n\nThe model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:\n\n*'''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) \u2013 This was defined by Fred Davis as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]\". It means whether or not someone perceives that technology to be useful for what they want to do.\n*'''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) \u2013 Davis defined this as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort\" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}). If the technology is easy to use, then the barriers conquered. If it's not easy to use and the interface is complicated, no one has a positive attitudes towards it.\n\n'''External variables''' such as social influence is an important factor to determine the attitude. When these things (TAM) are in place, people will have the attitude and intention to use the technology.However, the perception may change depending on age and gender because everyone is different.\n\nThe TAM has been continuously studied and expanded\u2014the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} & {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).\n\n==Background==\n\nTAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989)\nis the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology\n(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747\u2013768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}</ref>). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).\n\nBagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:\n\n:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})\n\nEarlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms \"task fit\" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.\n\n==Usage==\nSeveral researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.\n\nSegars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.\n\nMark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2\u00d72 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).\nThe TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604\u2013634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}</ref>\n\nVenkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n\n* '''Subjective norm''' \u2013 An individual's perception that other individuals who are important to him/she consider if he/she could perform a behavior. This was consistent with the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA).\n* '''Voluntariness''' \u2013 This was defined by Venkatesh & Davis as \"extent to which potential adopters perceive the adoption decision to be non-mandatory\" ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Image''' \u2013 This was defined by Moore & Benbasat as \"the degree to which use of an innovation perceived to enhance one's status in one's social system\" ({{Harvnb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gary C.|last2=Benbasat|first2=Izak|date=1991-09-01|title=Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=2|issue=3|pages=192\u2013222|doi=10.1287/isre.2.3.192|issn=1047-7047}}</ref>).\n* '''Job relevance''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perspective on the extent to which the target system is suitable for the job ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Output quality''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perception of the system's ability to perform specific tasks ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Result demonstrability''' \u2013 The production of tangible results will directly influence the system's usefulness ({{Harnvb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}).\n\nIn an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.<ref name=hf2010>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Huser | first1 = V. \n| last2 = Narus | first2 = S. P. \n| last3 = Rocha | first3 = R.

The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), \"Living in the State of Stuck\", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.\n# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.\n# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments\n|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238\u2013247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nTAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a \"theory\" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM \"has diverted researchers' attention away from other \nimportant research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the \nindependent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion\" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29\u201347|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).\n\nLegris et al.<ref>Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.</ref> claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.\n\nBased on more fundamental models, Li <ref name=\"Li2020\">Li J  (2020), Blockchain technology adoption: Examining the Fundamental Drivers, ''Conference Proceedings, 2020 International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering'',  https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.17226.93123 (preprint version)</ref> has demonstrated that better predictive power can be achieved by proper initial screening. The results provide insights for research design under real business settings. \n\nPerceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}).\n\nA study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. & Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]]\n* [[Diffusion of innovations]]\n* [[Domestication theory]]\n* [[Lazy user model]]\n* [[List of marketing topics]]\n* [[New product development]]\n* [[Product life cycle management]]\n* [[Research and development]]\n* [[Technology adoption lifecycle]]\n* [[Technology lifecycle]]\n* [[Theory of planned behavior]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* {{citation|last1=Adams|first1=D.

({{harvnb|Davis|Bagozzi|Warshaw|1989}})]]\n\nThe '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.  \n\nThe '''actual system use''' is the end-point where we want everyone to be able to do with technology, so we have to form '''Behavioral Intention''', which is a factor that leads people to use the technology. The behavioral intention (BI) is influenced by the '''attitude''' (A) which is the general impression of the technology.\n\nThe model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:\n\n*'''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) \u2013 This was defined by Fred Davis as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]\". It means whether or not someone perceives that technology to be useful for what they want to do.\n*'''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) \u2013 Davis defined this as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort\" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}). If the technology is easy to use, then the barriers conquered. If it's not easy to use and the interface is complicated, no one has a positive attitudes towards it.\n\n'''External variables''' such as social influence is an important factor to determine the attitude. When these things (TAM) are in place, people will have the attitude and intention to use the technology.However, the perception may change depending on age and gender because everyone is different.\n\nThe TAM has been continuously studied and expanded\u2014the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} & {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).\n\n==Background==\n\nTAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989)\nis the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology\n(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747\u2013768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}</ref>). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).\n\nBagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:\n\n:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})\n\nEarlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms \"task fit\" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.\n\n==Usage==\nSeveral researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.\n\nSegars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.\n\nMark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2\u00d72 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).\nThe TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604\u2013634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}</ref>\n\nVenkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n\n* '''Subjective norm''' \u2013 An individual's perception that other individuals who are important to him/she consider if he/she could perform a behavior. This was consistent with the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA).\n* '''Voluntariness''' \u2013 This was defined by Venkatesh & Davis as \"extent to which potential adopters perceive the adoption decision to be non-mandatory\" ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Image''' \u2013 This was defined by Moore & Benbasat as \"the degree to which use of an innovation perceived to enhance one's status in one's social system\" ({{Harvnb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gary C.|last2=Benbasat|first2=Izak|date=1991-09-01|title=Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=2|issue=3|pages=192\u2013222|doi=10.1287/isre.2.3.192|issn=1047-7047}}</ref>).\n* '''Job relevance''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perspective on the extent to which the target system is suitable for the job ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Output quality''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perception of the system's ability to perform specific tasks ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Result demonstrability''' \u2013 The production of tangible results will directly influence the system's usefulness ({{Harnvb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}).\n\nIn an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.<ref name=hf2010>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Huser | first1 = V. \n| last2 = Narus | first2 = S. P. \n| last3 = Rocha | first3 = R.

The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), \"Living in the State of Stuck\", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.\n# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.\n# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments\n|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238\u2013247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nTAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a \"theory\" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM \"has diverted researchers' attention away from other \nimportant research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the \nindependent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion\" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29\u201347|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).\n\nLegris et al.<ref>Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.</ref> claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.\n\nBased on more fundamental models, Li <ref>Li J  (2020), Blockchain technology adoption: Examining the Fundamental Drivers, ''Conference Proceedings, 2020 International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering'',  https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.17226.93123 (preprint version)</ref> has demonstrated that better predictive power can be achieved by proper initial screening. The results provide insights for research design under real business settings. \n\nPerceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}).\n\nA study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. & Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]]\n* [[Diffusion of innovations]]\n* [[Domestication theory]]\n* [[Lazy user model]]\n* [[List of marketing topics]]\n* [[New product development]]\n* [[Product life cycle management]]\n* [[Research and development]]\n* [[Technology adoption lifecycle]]\n* [[Technology lifecycle]]\n* [[Theory of planned behavior]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* {{citation|last1=Adams|first1=D.

The series takes place in a romanticized [[Stone Age]] setting and follows the activities of the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles (who are also their best friends). It was originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series to hold a [[prime time#Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues|prime time]] slot on television.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/106/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=103\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''The Flintstones'' rests heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.<ref>CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Flintstones, The \u2013 Season 1 Review|url= http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|work= [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|accessdate= August 25, 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126142316/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|archivedate= November 26, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref> ''The Flintstones'' was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades, until ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which debuted in late 1989, outlasted it.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/excavating-bedrock-reminiscences-of-the-flintstones/ \"Excavating Bedrock: Reminiscences of 'The Flintstones,'\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #9, 2000]</ref> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''The Flintstones'' the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after ''The Simpsons'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|first =Rich | last= Sands|date=September 24, 2013| work= TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{one source|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe show is set in a comical version of the [[Stone Age]] but has added features and technologies which resemble mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the [[sitcom]]s of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] (pop. 2,500). In this fantasy version of the past, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and other long-extinct animals are inaccurately portrayed to co-exist during the time of [[cavemen]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]].  The earliest known humans inhabited the Earth approximately 66 million years after the [[KT extinction]].\n\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [[anachronism]]s. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [[prehistory]]. This society takes inspiration from the [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=September 30, 2010|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html|accessdate=October 1, 2010|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them.  This depiction is inconsistent, however.  On some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound-effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline.  (Fred might pull into a gas station, and say, \"Fill 'er up with [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethel]].\" Which, of course, is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL.\")  Whether the car runs by foot or by gas varies according to the needs of the story. Finally, the stone houses of this society are [[Tract housing|cookie-cutter homes]] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 25</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Flintstones===\n*[[Fred Flintstone]] is the main character of the series. Fred is an accident-prone [[Sauropod|bronto-crane]] operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company and the head of the Flintstone household. He is quick to anger (usually over trivial matters), but is a very loving husband and father. He is also good at bowling and is a member of the fictional \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\" (Lodge No. 26), a men-only club paralleling real-life fraternities such as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. His famous [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\"\n*[[Wilma Flintstone]] is Fred's wife and Pebbles' mother. She is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband, though she often has a habit of spending money (with Betty and her catchphrase being \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Da-da-da duh da-da]] CHARGE IT!!\"). She often is a foil to Fred's poor behavior, but is a very loyal wife to him. She is also a very jealous woman who is easily angered if there's even a hint of another woman (especially a pretty one) having anything to do with Fred.\n*[[Pebbles Flintstone]] is the Flintstones' infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season.\n*[[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] is the Flintstones' pet dinosaur that acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down and licking his face repeatedly.\n*Baby Puss is the Flintstones' pet [[saber-toothed cat]], which is rarely seen in the actual series but is always seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits, causing Fred to pound repeatedly on the front door and yell \"Wilma!\", waking the whole neighborhood in the process.\n\n===The Rubbles===\n* [[Barney Rubble]] is the secondary main character and Fred's best friend and next-door neighbor. His occupation is, for the most part of the series, unknown, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred's interests such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\". Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another (usually due to Fred's short temper), their deep fraternal bond remains very evident.\n* [[Betty Rubble]] is Barney's wife and Wilma's best friend. Like Wilma, she, too, has a habit of spending money and also is highly jealous of other pretty women being around her husband.\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]] is the Rubbles' abnormally strong adopted son, whom they adopt during the fourth season; his name comes from the only phrase he ever speaks as a baby: \"Bamm, Bamm!\"\n* Hoppy is the Rubbles' pet hopparoo (a kangaroo-dinosaur combination creature), which they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When he first arrives, Dino and Fred mistake him for a giant mouse and are frightened of him, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. He babysits the kids as he takes them around in his pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.\n\n===Other characters===\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.<ref>Romanek, Broc. [http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/nonmember/Flintstones/ \"List of Flintstones Characters\"]. Thecorporatecounsel.net, accessed March 31, 2011</ref>\n*'''Mr. George Slate''' is Fred and Barney's hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit. Mr. Slate fires Fred on several occasions throughout the series, only to give him his job back by the end of the episode. A running gag is Slate's ever-changing first name, which was revealed to be Sylvester, Nate, Oscar, and George as the series progressed. In the episode \"The Long, Long, Long Weekend\" which originally aired on January 21, 1966, he is shown as being the founder of \"Slate Rock and Gravel Company\"; still in business two million years later, the company is operated by his descendant, \"George Slate the Eighty-Thousandth\". Note, in the early Flintstones episodes, the more recognized \"Mr. Slate\" character was known as \"Mr. Rockhead\" and was a supervisor of Fred's. Mr. Slate was a short character. During the course of the cartoon, the two men switched identities and the shorter character faded away from existence.\n*'''Arnold''' is the Flintstones' paperboy, whom Fred absolutely despises, mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart Fred at a number of tasks and also because he often (\"unintentionally\") throws the newspaper in Fred's face. Arnold's parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, a friend of Wilma and Betty's (as evidenced in the episode \"The Little Stranger\", which originally aired on November 2, 1962), is referenced in name only, never actually appearing onscreen. Arnold's father, however, did appear in the episode \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", which originally aired on April 27, 1962, though his name is never mentioned.\n*'''Joe Rockhead''' is a mutual friend of Fred and Barney. Usually, when Fred and Barney have some kind of falling out, Fred mentions doing something (such as going to a baseball game) with Joe. Joe was, at some point, chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department (as shown on the episode \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\", which originally aired on January 13, 1961). His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode \"The Picnic\", which originally aired on December 15, 1961, was the one most commonly used.\n*[[Pearl Slaghoople]] is Wilma's hard-to-please mother, Fred's mother-in-law and Pebbles' maternal grandmother, who is constantly disapproving of Fred and his behavior. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in the episode \"Bachelor Daze\", which originally aired on March 5, 1964. They briefly reconciled in the episode \"Mother-in-Law's Visit\", which originally aired on February 1, 1963. That is, until, she found out that she became Fred's \"nice fat pigeon\" when he suckered her out of money that he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. They reconciled again at the end of the TV movie ''I Yabba Dabba Do''.\n*[[The Great Gazoo]] is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] exiled to Earth that helps Fred and Barney, often against their will. He is actually from the future, and is quite dismayed when he realizes he has been sent back to \"the Stone Age\". He can only be seen by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy. Gazoo appeared in the final season only.\n*'''Uncle Tex Hardrock''' is Fred's maternal uncle and a member of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texarock Rangers]]. He constantly holds Fred's future inheritance over his head.\n*'''Sam Slagheap''' is the [[Grand Poobah]] of the Water Buffalo Lodge.\n\n==Voice actors==\n\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, [[Alan Reed]], and [[Jackie Gleason]], whose series, ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', inspired ''The Flintstones''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/flintstones-hanna-barbera-found-shameless-rip-work-204382|title=In The Flintstones, Hanna-Barbera found a shameless rip-off that worked|newspaper=[[The A.V.

Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the [[Abominable Snowman]] he performed in other cartoons and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\n\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's ''Honeymooners'' interpretation of [[Ralph Kramden]], while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by [[Art Carney]] in his portrayal of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]]. The first time the Art Carney-like voice was used was for a few seconds in \"The Prowler\" (the third episode produced).\n\nIn a 1986 ''[[Playboy]]'' interview, Gleason said Alan Reed had done voice-overs for Gleason in his early movies and that he had considered suing Hanna-Barbera for copying ''The Honeymooners'' but decided to let it pass.<ref name=\"zehme-playboy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/jackie-gleason-1986-interview/index.html?page=2|title=Jackie Gleason \u2013 Playboy Interview \u2013 Life History|last=Zehme|first=Bill (interviewer)|date=August 1986|accessdate=July 25, 2009}}</ref> According to [[Henry Corden]], a voice actor and a friend of Gleason's, \"Jackie's lawyers told him he could probably have ''The Flintstones'' pulled right off the air.

Since 2000, [[Jeff Bergman]], [[James Arnold Taylor]], and [[Scott Innes]] (performing both Fred and Barney for [[Toshiba]] commercials) have performed the voice of Fred. Since Mel Blanc's death in 1989, Barney has been voiced by [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Frank Welker]], and [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].

Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \"kids only\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated [[situation comedy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Flintstones, season 2 DVD documentary</ref>\n\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two ''Flintstones'' episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\"), [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (Hanna-Barbera eventually created ''[[The Roman Holidays]]''), pilgrims, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera, 1997</ref> Under the working title ''The Flagstones'', the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book| last = Barbera| first = Joseph| title = My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| year = 1994| publisher = [[Turner Publishing]]| location = Atlanta, GA| isbn = 1-57036-042-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Animator [[Kenneth Muse]], who worked on the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of ''The Flintstones''.\n\nThe show imitated and spoofed ''The Honeymooners'', although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.<ref>Stinnett, Chuck.

In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"[[The First Bad Man]]\" (narrated by cowboy legend [[Tex Ritter]]). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age [[Dallas]]. Many of the [[sight gag]]s from that series predated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series by many years. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\n\nThe concept was also predated by the [[Stone Age Cartoons]] series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by [[Fleischer Studios]]. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is ''[[Granite Hotel]]'' including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of [[Edgar Bergen]] and Charlie McCarthy.\n\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n\n{{quote|text=Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show. So we developed two storyboards; one was they had a helicopter of some kind and they went to the opera or whatever, and the other was Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble fighting over a swimming pool. So I go back to New York with a portfolio and two half-hour boards. And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]], the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys....\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nWhen the series went into production, the working title ''The Flagstones'' was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip ''[[Hi and Lois]]''.

However, some early ''Flintstones'' merchandise, such as a 1961 [[Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]], included \"Fred Jr.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com//2011/11/flintstones-little-golden-book-1961.html|title=Homes and Offices|website=bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a [[laugh track]]. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer [[Joanna Lee (actor)|Joanna Lee]] while still using traditional animation story men such as [[Warren Foster]] and [[Michael Maltese]].\n\n''The Flintstones'' premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's ''[[Mary Kay and Johnny]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm |title=First TV Couple in Same Bed |publisher= |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Fred and Wilma Flintstone advertising cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Fred and Wilma advertising [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] cigarettes during the closing credits]]\n\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://adage.com/article/rewind/yabba-dabba-cough-flintstones-shilled-cigarettes/240572 |title=Yabba Dabba Cough!

Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although most ''Flintstones'' episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a [[story arc]] surrounding the birth of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and [[Welch's]] (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift younger. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the [[Nine Network]] ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past ''Flintstone'' episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios.\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making ''The Flintstones'' the first animated series in history to address the issue of [[infertility]], though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterward, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by [[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.<ref name=\"FLINSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstones/ |title=Big Cartoon Database |publisher=bcdb.com |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first three seasons of ''The Flintstones'' aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised the ''Flintstones'' in color, one of the first programs in color on that network.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC-TV To Start Color Programs|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1962|page=84}}</ref> Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\n\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when [[E/I]] regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of [[Ted Turner]]'s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]] aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], where it aired until March 6, 2017 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a [[graveyard slot]]) and returned to the channel on July 30, 2018.

The series takes place in a romanticized [[Stone Age]] setting and follows the activities of the titular family, the Flintstones, and their next-door neighbors, the Rubbles (who are also their best friends). It was originally broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from September 30, 1960 to April 1, 1966, and was the first animated series to hold a [[prime time#Prime time in the context of U.S. radio/TV-revenues|prime time]] slot on television.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/106/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=103\u2013108}}</ref>\n\nThe continuing popularity of ''The Flintstones'' rests heavily on its juxtaposition of modern everyday concerns in the Stone Age setting.<ref>CD liner notes: Saturday Mornings: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, 1995 MCA Records</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Flintstones, The \u2013 Season 1 Review|url= http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|work= [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]|accessdate= August 25, 2010|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126142316/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/reviews/Flintstones-Season-1/3383|archivedate= November 26, 2010|df= mdy-all}}</ref> ''The Flintstones'' was the most financially successful and longest-running network animated television series for three decades, until ''[[The Simpsons]]'', which debuted in late 1989, outlasted it.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/excavating-bedrock-reminiscences-of-the-flintstones/ \"Excavating Bedrock: Reminiscences of 'The Flintstones,'\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #9, 2000]</ref> In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''The Flintstones'' the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after ''The Simpsons'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|first =Rich | last= Sands|date=September 24, 2013| work= TVGuide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n{{one source|section|date=October 2017}}\nThe show is set in a comical version of the [[Stone Age]] but has added features and technologies which resemble mid-20th-century suburban America. The plots deliberately resemble the [[sitcom]]s of the era, with the caveman Flintstone and Rubble families getting into minor conflicts characteristic of modern life. The show is set in the Stone Age town of [[Bedrock (The Flintstones)|Bedrock]] (pop. 2,500). In this fantasy version of the past, non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and other long-extinct animals are inaccurately portrayed to co-exist during the time of [[cavemen]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]].  The earliest known humans inhabited the Earth approximately 66 million years after the [[KT extinction]].\n\nAnimation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series draws its humor in part from creative uses of [[anachronism]]s. The main one is the placing of a \"modern\", 20th-century society in [[prehistory]]. This society takes inspiration from the [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]] developed in the first two decades of the postwar period. This society has modern home appliances, but they work by employing animals.<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 10 wackiest Bedrock inventions|work= Daily Telegraph |date=September 30, 2010|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034759/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-10-wackiest-Bedrock-inventions.html|accessdate=October 1, 2010|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> They have automobiles, but they hardly resemble the cars of the 20th century. These cars are large wooden and rock structures and burn no fuel. They are powered by people who run while inside them.  This depiction is inconsistent, however.  On some occasions, the cars are known to have engines (with appropriate sound-effects), requiring ignition keys and gasoline.  (Fred might pull into a gas station, and say, \"Fill 'er up with [[Ethyl Corporation|Ethel]].\" Which, of course, is pumped through the trunk of a woolly mammoth marked \"ETHEL.\")  Whether the car runs by foot or by gas varies according to the needs of the story. Finally, the stone houses of this society are [[Tract housing|cookie-cutter homes]] positioned into neighborhoods typical of mid-20th-century American suburbs.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 25</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The Flintstones===\n*[[Fred Flintstone]] is the main character of the series. Fred is an accident-prone [[Sauropod|bronto-crane]] operator at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company and the head of the Flintstone household. He is quick to anger (usually over trivial matters), but is a very loving husband and father. He is also good at bowling and is a member of the fictional \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\" (Lodge No. 26), a men-only club paralleling real-life fraternities such as the [[Loyal Order of Moose]]. His famous [[catchphrase]] is \"Yabba Dabba Doo!\"\n*[[Wilma Flintstone]] is Fred's wife and Pebbles' mother. She is more intelligent and level-headed than her husband, though she often has a habit of spending money (with Betty and her catchphrase being \"[[Charge (fanfare)|Da-da-da duh da-da]] CHARGE IT!!\"). She often is a foil to Fred's poor behavior, but is a very loyal wife to him. She is also a very jealous woman who is easily angered if there's even a hint of another woman (especially a pretty one) having anything to do with Fred.\n*[[Pebbles Flintstone]] is the Flintstones' infant daughter, who is born near the end of the third season.\n*[[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino]] is the Flintstones' pet dinosaur that acts like a dog. A running gag in the series involves Fred coming home from work and Dino getting excited and knocking him down and licking his face repeatedly.\n*Baby Puss is the Flintstones' pet [[saber-toothed cat]], which is rarely seen in the actual series but is always seen throwing Fred out of the house during the end credits, causing Fred to pound repeatedly on the front door and yell \"Wilma!\", waking the whole neighborhood in the process.\n\n===The Rubbles===\n* [[Barney Rubble]] is the secondary main character and Fred's best friend and next-door neighbor. His occupation is, for the most part of the series, unknown, though later episodes depict him working in the same quarry as Fred. He shares many of Fred's interests such as bowling and golf, and is also a member of the \"Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes\". Though Fred and Barney frequently get into feuds with one another (usually due to Fred's short temper), their deep fraternal bond remains very evident.\n* [[Betty Rubble]] is Barney's wife and Wilma's best friend. Like Wilma, she, too, has a habit of spending money and also is highly jealous of other pretty women being around her husband.\n* [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble]] is the Rubbles' abnormally strong adopted son, whom they adopt during the fourth season; his name comes from the only phrase he ever speaks as a baby: \"Bamm, Bamm!\"\n* Hoppy is the Rubbles' pet hopparoo (a kangaroo-dinosaur combination creature), which they purchase at the beginning of the fifth season. When he first arrives, Dino and Fred mistake him for a giant mouse and are frightened of him, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy gets help when they are in an accident. He babysits the kids as he takes them around in his pouch, which also serves as a shopping cart for Betty.\n\n===Other characters===\nOver 100 other characters appeared throughout the program.<ref>Romanek, Broc. [http://www.thecorporatecounsel.net/nonmember/Flintstones/ \"List of Flintstones Characters\"]. Thecorporatecounsel.net, accessed March 31, 2011</ref>\n*'''Mr. George Slate''' is Fred and Barney's hot-tempered boss at the gravel pit. Mr. Slate fires Fred on several occasions throughout the series, only to give him his job back by the end of the episode. A running gag is Slate's ever-changing first name, which was revealed to be Sylvester, Nate, Oscar, and George as the series progressed. In the episode \"The Long, Long, Long Weekend\" which originally aired on January 21, 1966, he is shown as being the founder of \"Slate Rock and Gravel Company\"; still in business two million years later, the company is operated by his descendant, \"George Slate the Eighty-Thousandth\". Note, in the early Flintstones episodes, the more recognized \"Mr. Slate\" character was known as \"Mr. Rockhead\" and was a supervisor of Fred's. Mr. Slate was a short character. During the course of the cartoon, the two men switched identities and the shorter character faded away from existence.\n*'''Arnold''' is the Flintstones' paperboy, whom Fred absolutely despises, mainly because Arnold is frequently able to best and outsmart Fred at a number of tasks and also because he often (\"unintentionally\") throws the newspaper in Fred's face. Arnold's parents are mentioned in the series, but his mother Doris, a friend of Wilma and Betty's (as evidenced in the episode \"The Little Stranger\", which originally aired on November 2, 1962), is referenced in name only, never actually appearing onscreen. Arnold's father, however, did appear in the episode \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\", which originally aired on April 27, 1962, though his name is never mentioned.\n*'''Joe Rockhead''' is a mutual friend of Fred and Barney. Usually, when Fred and Barney have some kind of falling out, Fred mentions doing something (such as going to a baseball game) with Joe. Joe was, at some point, chief of the Bedrock Volunteer Fire Department (as shown on the episode \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\", which originally aired on January 13, 1961). His appearance varied throughout the run of the series, but his appearance in the episode \"The Picnic\", which originally aired on December 15, 1961, was the one most commonly used.\n*[[Pearl Slaghoople]] is Wilma's hard-to-please mother, Fred's mother-in-law and Pebbles' maternal grandmother, who is constantly disapproving of Fred and his behavior. Their disastrous first meeting was recounted in the episode \"Bachelor Daze\", which originally aired on March 5, 1964. They briefly reconciled in the episode \"Mother-in-Law's Visit\", which originally aired on February 1, 1963. That is, until, she found out that she became Fred's \"nice fat pigeon\" when he suckered her out of money that he needed to buy a baby crib for Pebbles. They reconciled again at the end of the TV movie ''I Yabba Dabba Do''.\n*[[The Great Gazoo]] is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] exiled to Earth that helps Fred and Barney, often against their will. He is actually from the future, and is quite dismayed when he realizes he has been sent back to \"the Stone Age\". He can only be seen by Fred, Barney, Pebbles, Bamm-Bamm, other small children, Dino, and Hoppy. Gazoo appeared in the final season only.\n*'''Uncle Tex Hardrock''' is Fred's maternal uncle and a member of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texarock Rangers]]. He constantly holds Fred's future inheritance over his head.\n*'''Sam Slagheap''' is the [[Grand Poobah]] of the Water Buffalo Lodge.\n\n==Voice actors==\n\nFred Flintstone physically resembles both the first voice actor who played him, [[Alan Reed]], and [[Jackie Gleason]], whose series, ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', inspired ''The Flintstones''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/flintstones-hanna-barbera-found-shameless-rip-work-204382|title=In The Flintstones, Hanna-Barbera found a shameless rip-off that worked|newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=May 12, 2014|last=VanDerWerff|first=Emily|accessdate=October 6, 2019}}</ref> The voice of Barney Rubble was provided by voice actor Mel Blanc, though five episodes during the second season (the first, second, fifth, sixth, and ninth) employed Hanna-Barbera regular [[Daws Butler]] while Blanc was incapacitated by a near-fatal car accident. Blanc was able to return to the series much sooner than expected, by virtue of a temporary recording studio for the entire cast set up at Blanc's bedside. Blanc's portrayal of Barney had changed considerably after the accident. In the earliest episodes, Blanc had used a much higher pitch to the point of portraying Barney as a smart-aleck. After his recovery from the accident, Blanc used a deeper voice, quite similar to the voice of the [[Abominable Snowman]] he performed in other cartoons and was shown as somewhat dopier than before.\n\nReed based Fred's voice upon Gleason's ''Honeymooners'' interpretation of [[Ralph Kramden]], while Blanc, after a season of using a nasal, high-pitched voice for Barney, eventually adopted a style of voice similar to that used by [[Art Carney]] in his portrayal of [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]].

Although these programs were successful, they did not have the same wide audience appeal as their previous theatrical cartoon series ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', which entertained both children and the adults who accompanied them. However, since children did not need their parents' supervision to watch television, Hanna-Barbera's output became labeled \"kids only\". Barbera and Hanna wanted to recapture the adult audience with an animated [[situation comedy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Flintstones, season 2 DVD documentary</ref>\n\nBarbera and Hanna experimented with hillbillies (a hillbilly theme was later incorporated into two ''Flintstones'' episodes, \"The Bedrock Hillbillies\" and \"The Hatrocks and the Gruesomes\"), [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (Hanna-Barbera eventually created ''[[The Roman Holidays]]''), pilgrims, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] as the settings for the two families before deciding on the Stone Age. According to Barbera, they settled on that because \"you could take anything that was current, and convert it to stone-age\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Leonard Maltin interviews Joseph Barbera, 1997</ref> Under the working title ''The Flagstones'', the family originally consisted of Fred, Wilma, and their son, Fred, Jr. A brief demonstration film was also created to sell the idea of a \"modern stone-age family\" to sponsors and the network.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book| last = Barbera| first = Joseph| title = My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| year = 1994| publisher = [[Turner Publishing]]| location = Atlanta, GA| isbn = 1-57036-042-1| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Animator [[Kenneth Muse]], who worked on the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, also worked on the early seasons of ''The Flintstones''.\n\nThe show imitated and spoofed ''The Honeymooners'', although the early voice characterization for Barney was that of Lou Costello.<ref>Stinnett, Chuck.

In 1955, Avery directed a cartoon entitled \"[[The First Bad Man]]\" (narrated by cowboy legend [[Tex Ritter]]). The cartoon concerned the rowdy antics of a bank robber in stone-age [[Dallas]]. Many of the [[sight gag]]s from that series predated similar situations used by Hanna-Barbera in the Flintstones series by many years. Many students of American animation point to this cartoon as a progenitive seed of the Flintstones.\n\nThe concept was also predated by the [[Stone Age Cartoons]] series of 12 animated cartoons released from January 1940 to September 1940 by [[Fleischer Studios]]. These cartoons show stone-age people doing modern things with primitive means. One example is ''[[Granite Hotel]]'' including characters such as a newsboy, telephone operator, hotel clerk, and a spoof of [[Edgar Bergen]] and Charlie McCarthy.\n\nBarbera explained that selling the show to a network and sponsors was not an easy task.\n\n{{quote|text=Here we were with a brand new thing that had never been done before, an animated prime-time television show. So we developed two storyboards; one was they had a helicopter of some kind and they went to the opera or whatever, and the other was Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble fighting over a swimming pool. So I go back to New York with a portfolio and two half-hour boards. And no-one would even believe that you'd dare to suggest a thing like that, I mean they looked at you and they'd think you're crazy. But slowly the word got out, and I used the presentation which took almost an hour and a half. I would go to the other two boards and tell them what they did, and do all the voices and the sounds and so-on, and I'd stagger back to the hotel and I'd collapse. The phone would ring like crazy, like one time I did [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]], the whole company was there. When I got through I'd go back to the hotel the phone would ring and say \"the president wasn't at that meeting, could you come back and do it for him.\" So I had many of those, one time I had two agencies, they'd fill the room I mean God about 40 people, and I did this whole show. I got to know where the laughs were, and where to hit it, nothing; dead, dead, dead. So one of the people at Screen Gems said \"This is the worst, those guys....\" he was so angry at them. What it was, was that there were two agencies there, and neither one was going to let the other one know they were enjoying it. But I pitched it for eight straight weeks and nobody bought it. So after sitting in New York just wearing out, you know really wearing out. Pitch, pitch, pitch, sometimes five a day. So finally on the very last day I pitched it to ABC, which was a young daring network willing to try new things, and bought the show in 15 minutes. Thank goodness, because this was the very last day and if they hadn't bought it, I would have taken everything down, put it in the archives and never pitched it again. Sometimes I wake up in a cold-sweat thinking this is how close you get to disaster.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\n\nWhen the series went into production, the working title ''The Flagstones'' was changed, possibly to avoid confusion with the Flagstons, characters in the comic strip ''[[Hi and Lois]]''.

However, some early ''Flintstones'' merchandise, such as a 1961 [[Little Golden Books|Little Golden Book]], included \"Fred Jr.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com//2011/11/flintstones-little-golden-book-1961.html|title=Homes and Offices|website=bookstevesbookstore.blogspot.com|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the animation and fantasy setting, the series was initially aimed at adult audiences, which was reflected in the comedy writing, which, as noted, resembled the average primetime sitcoms of the era, with the usual family issues resolved with a laugh at the end of each episode, as well as the inclusion of a [[laugh track]]. Hanna and Barbera hired many writers from the world of live-action, including two of Jackie Gleason's writers, Herbert Finn and Sydney Zelinka, as well as relative newcomer [[Joanna Lee (actor)|Joanna Lee]] while still using traditional animation story men such as [[Warren Foster]] and [[Michael Maltese]].\n\n''The Flintstones'' premiered on September 30, 1960, at 8:30 pm Eastern time, and quickly became a hit. It was the first American animated show to depict two people of the opposite sex (Fred and Wilma; Barney and Betty) sleeping together in one bed, although Fred and Wilma are sometimes depicted as sleeping in separate beds. For comparison, the first live-action depiction of this in American TV history was in television's first-ever sitcom: 1947's ''[[Mary Kay and Johnny]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/marykay.htm |title=First TV Couple in Same Bed |publisher= |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Fred and Wilma Flintstone advertising cigarettes.jpg|thumb|Fred and Wilma advertising [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]] cigarettes during the closing credits]]\n\nThe first two seasons were co-sponsored by [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] and the characters appeared in several black-and-white television commercials for Winston<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://adage.com/article/rewind/yabba-dabba-cough-flintstones-shilled-cigarettes/240572 |title=Yabba Dabba Cough!

Originally, Hanna and Barbera intended for the Flintstone family to have a boy, the head of the marketing department convinced them to change it to a girl since \"girl dolls sell a lot better than boy dolls\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although most ''Flintstones'' episodes were stand-alone storylines, Hanna-Barbera created a [[story arc]] surrounding the birth of [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]]. Beginning with the episode \"The Surprise\", aired midway through the third season (January 25, 1963), in which Wilma reveals her pregnancy to Fred, the arc continued through the time leading up to Pebbles' birth in the episode \"Dress Rehearsal\" (February 22, 1963), and then continued with several episodes showing Fred and Wilma adjusting to the world of parenthood. Around this time, Winston pulled out their sponsorship and [[Welch's]] (grape juice and grape jellies) became the primary sponsor, as the show's audience began to shift younger. The integrated commercials for Welch's products feature Pebbles asking for grape juice in her toddler dialect, and Fred explaining to Pebbles Welch's unique process for making the jelly, compared to the competition. Welch's also produced a line of grape jelly packaged in jars which were reusable as drinking glasses, with painted scenes featuring the Flintstones and characters from the show. In Australia, the [[Nine Network]] ran a \"Name the Flintstones' baby\" competition during the 'pregnancy' episodes\u2014few Australian viewers were expected to have a U.S. connection giving them information about past ''Flintstone'' episodes. An American won the contest and received an all-expenses-paid trip to tour Hanna-Barbera Studios.\nAnother arc occurred in the fourth season, in which the Rubbles, depressed over being unable to have children of their own (making ''The Flintstones'' the first animated series in history to address the issue of [[infertility]], though subtly), adopt Bamm-Bamm. The 100th episode made (but the 90th to air), \"Little Bamm-Bamm Rubble\" (October 3, 1963), established how Bamm-Bamm was adopted. Nine episodes were produced before it but aired afterward, which explains why Bamm-Bamm was not seen again until episode 101, \"Daddies Anonymous\" (Bamm-Bamm was in a teaser on episode 98, \"Kleptomaniac Pebbles\"). Another story arc, occurring in the final season, centered on Fred and Barney's dealings with the Great Gazoo (voiced by [[Harvey Korman]]).\n\nAfter Pebbles' birth, the tone and writing became more juvenile and ratings from the adult demographic began to decline. The last original episode was broadcast on April 1, 1966.<ref name=\"FLINSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Hanna-Barbera_Studios/D-F/The_Flintstones/ |title=Big Cartoon Database |publisher=bcdb.com |accessdate=July 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe first three seasons of ''The Flintstones'' aired Friday nights at 8:30 Eastern time on ABC, with the first two seasons in black-and-white. Beginning with the third season in 1962, ABC televised the ''Flintstones'' in color, one of the first programs in color on that network.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC-TV To Start Color Programs|work=[[New York Times]]|date=April 1, 1962|page=84}}</ref> Season four and part of season five aired Thursdays at 7:30. The rest of the series aired Fridays at 7:30.\n\nIn the U.S., syndicated reruns of the series were offered to local stations until 1997, when [[E/I]] regulations and changing tastes in the industry led to the show's move to cable television. From the time of [[Ted Turner]]'s purchase of Hanna-Barbera in 1991, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], and [[Cartoon Network]] aired the program. On April 1, 2000, the program moved to [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], where it aired until March 6, 2017 (in its last years on the channel, it had been relegated to a [[graveyard slot]]) and returned to the channel on July 30, 2018. Online, the series was made available on the [[In2TV]] service beginning in 2006, then the online version of [[Kids' WB]] until that service was discontinued in 2015. As of 2017, full episodes are only available in the U.S. on Boomerang's subscription [[Video on demand|video-on-demand]] service, with select clips made available on the official [[YouTube]] account tied to the revamped Kids' WB website.

A [[MPFI]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] model was introduced in 1985, with a 2.0&nbsp;L SOHC I4 engine rated at {{Convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|166|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. The 1987 model year had the RS model which came with a 4ZC1 [[turbo]] engine. The 1988 model year saw several changes. Mild exterior and interior changes were made to the appearance of the vehicle (including a larger rear spoiler and fixed headlights without pop up covers).\n\nThe 2.0&nbsp;L non-turbo engine was replaced with a 2.3&nbsp;L SOHC I4 engine, rated at {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, 127&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft The 2.3&nbsp;L engine was offered only in the US market, because the larger engine would have obligated Japanese consumers to pay more annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]], thereby affecting sales, as well as the larger engine conflicted with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]] concerning maximum displacement for cars classified as \"compact\". All Impulses received a Lotus-tuned suspension beginning in the 1988 model year, which consisted of redesigned [[sway bar]]s, stiffer [[Shock absorber|dampers]], and a change in previous spring rates.<ref name=\"impulsejrspecs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isuzuperformance.com/isupage/hist/specimpjr.html| title= Impulse JR Specifications| accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the US market, the Impulse was marketed as \"everything standard\", meaning that all Impulses came with all available equipment for the vehicle's model year, and only two trim levels offered: non-turbo and Turbo. There were, however, some special edition models, most notably the RS model of the 1987 model year, available only in white body color with [[pewter]] color trim, and featuring the stiffest suspension available on any Impulse, very close to the Irmscher suspension sold only in Japan. For the 1989 model year, a Special Edition non-turbo model was offered which was equipped with the Turbo model wheels and interior trim.\n\nThe vehicle was sold as the Piazza in [[Europe]] and Australia, though introduced into these markets in 1985 or later.\n\nIn the UK the Piazza was sold in only one trim level and only Turbo form, with a 147&nbsp;bhp 2.0 Turbocharged engine [[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu Z engine|(4ZC1-T)]].\n\nThe Piazza had a shaky start in the UK with the first importer Isuzu GB, based in Maidstone, Kent going out of business in 1986, and London car dealer Alan Day bought the remaining stock of Piazzas at a bargain price. These cars were sold by Alan Day at significantly reduced price; the main reason Isuzu GB went out of business was due to high unit price. In 1987 International Motors Group of West Bromwich (IM Group) were awarded the official Isuzu franchise for the UK. (They also at the time represented [[Subaru]] and [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] in the UK.) IM Group still marketed the Piazza in single trim/engine form, but they only sold the updated 'Lotus' Piazza. The earlier cars sold by Day became known as 'pre-Lotus' cars; the suspension and handling of these pre-Lotus cars was derided by UK Press as poor, especially the [[live axle]] arrangement at the rear, which by the late '80s was seen to be antiquated. The updated 'Handling by Lotus' car was available from 1987 and the handling, although keeping the live axle arrangement, was transfomed by Lotus in the UK after significant development work, involving modified suspension layouts, larger brakes, specially produced dampers and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres. The 'Handling by Lotus' cars had updated interior and exterior equipment. The exterior having a redesigned rear, with a large 'hoop' spoiler, new rear lamps, new rear badging with 'Handling by Lotus' badges and removal of the rubber side bumper strakes for a cleaner, more modern look. The updated interior trim was mainly 'tweed' check fabric, an updated centre console, but the loss of air conditioning to keep the price down for the UK market.\n\n[[File:Holden YB Piazza.JPG|thumb|right|The Piazza was marketed in Australia as the YB series Holden Piazza]]\nIsuzu (UK) Ltd, the West Bromwich-based importer, sold the Lotus Piazza from 1987 to 1989, before concentrating on the 4WD [[Isuzu Trooper]]. They never sold the second generation Piazza in the UK, nor was it sold in any European market.\n\nIn [[Australia]], the Piazza was introduced very late (April 1986), and offered only in Turbo form.<ref name=\"holdenbook\">Bebbington, Terry, and Michel A.

GM had commissioned Isuzu to build a replacement for the [[Chevrolet Spectrum|Spectrum]], this time a sportier model called the [[Geo Storm|Storm]] ([[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini Coupe]] in Japan). The body design of the Storm was strongly influenced by GM and drew heavily from [[GM Europe]]'s design submission for the [[Lotus Elan M100]].<ref name=\"lotussincethe70sbook\">Robinson, Graham.

Starting with the Storm, alternative front and rear treatments were made, retaining the lozenge theme of the Gemini sedan, and drawing heavy influence from the rear-wheel drive Impulse (semi-concealed headlights with integrated grille as well as hood and taillight styling) while also expanding on the \"European look\", which later became a central point of marketing the vehicle in Japan.\n\nThe three-door hatchback debuted as the Impulse XS in 1989 for the 1990 model year. It was offered only in front-wheel drive with a DOHC 1.6&nbsp;L (1588&nbsp;cc) I4 engine which produced 130&nbsp;hp (97&nbsp;kW) and 102&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (138&nbsp;Nm). The suspension consisted of [[MacPherson strut]]s both front and rear, with a rigid trailing arm front suspension and a [[multi-link suspension|multi-link]] rear suspension, featuring Nishiboric [[Steering#Passive rear wheel steering|passive steering]].\n\nFor the 1991 model year, the Impulse RS was introduced with a 160&nbsp;hp (119&nbsp;kW) and 150&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (203&nbsp;Nm) turbocharged engine and all-wheel drive drivetrain which featured rear viscous differential and center planetary differential and viscous coupling. The wagonback model was also introduced for the 1991 model year, only available with the normally aspirated 1.6&nbsp;L engine.\n\nFor the 1992 model year, the Turbo model was discontinued and the base engine was replaced with a 1.8&nbsp;L (1809&nbsp;cc) engine, sharing the same bore but with a longer stroke due to the taller engine block. This larger powerplant was good for 140&nbsp;hp (104&nbsp;kW) and 125&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (169&nbsp;Nm).<ref name=\"impulsejispecs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isuzuperformance.com/isupage/hist/specimpji.html|title=Impulse JI and Asuna Sunfire Specifications|accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref> Both body styles continued into 1992, but very few were produced.\n\nSince the Impulse weighed just 2411&nbsp;lb (1094&nbsp;kg) in front-wheel drive configuration and 2732&nbsp;lb (1239&nbsp;kg) in all-wheel drive configuration, the turbo engine and all-wheel drive combined gave excellent performance.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nGeneral Motors, who owned nearly half of Isuzu, also owned [[Lotus Cars]] at the time. Lotus selected the 1.6-litre engine and transmission from the Isuzu Gemini for the [[Lotus Elan M100]] and a following generation of that engine eventually ended up in the Impulse. Lotus was subcontracted by Isuzu to fine-tune the suspension of the Impulse, through selection of stiffer dampers, larger sway bars, and softer springs. All of the second generation Impulses had the Lotus-tuned suspension.\n\nA non-Lotus innovation in the Impulse was the development of the Nishiboric passive [[Steering#Passive rear wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]] system which adjusted the toe of the rear wheels by changing the rear wheel alignment through the range of suspension travel.\n\nThe combination of the burst of the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese economic bubble]], rising [[Automobile emissions control|emissions]] and [[Automobile safety|crash safety]] requirements, and continued restrictive market segment changes by General Motors forced Isuzu out of the car making market and brought an end to the Impulse.\n\n[[File:'93 Asuna Sunfire.JPG|thumb|left|1993 [[As\u00fcna]] Sunfire]]\nIn the Japanese market, this vehicle was sold as the Piazza from July 1991 through the spring of 1992. The second generation Piazza was offered only in front-wheel drive with the 1.8&nbsp;L engine. All of the second generation Piazzas came with the Lotus-tuned suspension. The Japanese were also offered the [[Geo Storm]] version of the Piazza, called the Piazza PA-Nero. This model was exclusive to the Japanese import dealership network [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]], under a special arrangement that sold GM products in Japan.\n\nIn [[Canada]], the same models, with minor variations, were sold in the 1990 and 1991 model years. No Impulses were made for Canada for the 1992 model year. In 1993 the 1.8&nbsp;L model was sold in Canada as the [[As\u00fcna]] Sunfire, but only with the [[hatchback]] body.<ref name=\"impulsejispecs\" /> With the phaseout of the As\u00fcna brand in 1993, the Sunfire name moved to a [[Pontiac]], as [[Pontiac Sunfire|its version]] of the third-generation [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] on the [[GM J platform]] rather than an Isuzu platform.\n\nThe second generation Piazza was replaced by the [[Opel Vectra]] based [[Holden Calibra]] in Australia.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Isuzu Piazza}}\n* [http://www.isuzupiazza.com/ IsuzuPiazza.com]\u2014 Isuzu Piazza Online Community\n* [http://www.iptoc.com/ Isuzu Piazza Turbo Owners' Club (IPTOC)] (Great Britain)\n\n{{Isuzu modern timeline}}\n{{Isuzu United States}}\n\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Isuzu vehicles|Piazza]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:Hatchbacks]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive sports cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1980]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Small sporty 3-door liftback coup\u00e9}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Isuzu Piazza\n| image = File:1987 ISUZU Piazza 2.0 Turbo.jpg\n| manufacturer = [[Isuzu Motors]]\n| production = 1981\u20131993\n| assembly = [[Isuzu Motors#Japan|Fujisawa Plant]], [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa]], [[Japan]]\n| class = [[Sports car]]\n| predecessor = [[Isuzu 117 Coup\u00e9]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[hatchback]] coup\u00e9<br />3-door [[station wagon]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Isuzu Piazza''' is a small, sporty 3-door [[liftback]] [[coup\u00e9]] which was manufactured by [[Isuzu]] from 1981 to 1992 in two generations.

There were three different suspension tuning levels, standard, [[Irmscher]], and [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]].<ref name=\"nekobook\">''Isuzu Piazza, 117 Coupe, and Bellett GT''.

For the 1983 and 1984 model years, only one engine was available, the 2.0&nbsp;L SOHC I4 engine, rated at {{Convert|90|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|108|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. A [[MPFI]] [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] model was introduced in 1985, with a 2.0&nbsp;L SOHC I4 engine rated at {{Convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|166|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. The 1987 model year had the RS model which came with a 4ZC1 [[turbo]] engine. The 1988 model year saw several changes. Mild exterior and interior changes were made to the appearance of the vehicle (including a larger rear spoiler and fixed headlights without pop up covers).\n\nThe 2.0&nbsp;L non-turbo engine was replaced with a 2.3&nbsp;L SOHC I4 engine, rated at {{Convert|110|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, 127&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft The 2.3&nbsp;L engine was offered only in the US market, because the larger engine would have obligated Japanese consumers to pay more annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]], thereby affecting sales, as well as the larger engine conflicted with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]] concerning maximum displacement for cars classified as \"compact\". All Impulses received a Lotus-tuned suspension beginning in the 1988 model year, which consisted of redesigned [[sway bar]]s, stiffer [[Shock absorber|dampers]], and a change in previous spring rates.<ref name=\"impulsejrspecs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isuzuperformance.com/isupage/hist/specimpjr.html| title= Impulse JR Specifications| accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn the US market, the Impulse was marketed as \"everything standard\", meaning that all Impulses came with all available equipment for the vehicle's model year, and only two trim levels offered: non-turbo and Turbo. There were, however, some special edition models, most notably the RS model of the 1987 model year, available only in white body color with [[pewter]] color trim, and featuring the stiffest suspension available on any Impulse, very close to the Irmscher suspension sold only in Japan. For the 1989 model year, a Special Edition non-turbo model was offered which was equipped with the Turbo model wheels and interior trim.\n\nThe vehicle was sold as the Piazza in [[Europe]] and Australia, though introduced into these markets in 1985 or later.\n\nIn the UK the Piazza was sold in only one trim level and only Turbo form, with a 147&nbsp;bhp 2.0 Turbocharged engine [[List of Isuzu engines#Isuzu Z engine|(4ZC1-T)]].\n\nThe Piazza had a shaky start in the UK with the first importer Isuzu GB, based in Maidstone, Kent going out of business in 1986, and London car dealer Alan Day bought the remaining stock of Piazzas at a bargain price. These cars were sold by Alan Day at significantly reduced price; the main reason Isuzu GB went out of business was due to high unit price. In 1987 International Motors Group of West Bromwich (IM Group) were awarded the official Isuzu franchise for the UK. (They also at the time represented [[Subaru]] and [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] in the UK.) IM Group still marketed the Piazza in single trim/engine form, but they only sold the updated 'Lotus' Piazza. The earlier cars sold by Day became known as 'pre-Lotus' cars; the suspension and handling of these pre-Lotus cars was derided by UK Press as poor, especially the [[live axle]] arrangement at the rear, which by the late '80s was seen to be antiquated. The updated 'Handling by Lotus' car was available from 1987 and the handling, although keeping the live axle arrangement, was transfomed by Lotus in the UK after significant development work, involving modified suspension layouts, larger brakes, specially produced dampers and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres. The 'Handling by Lotus' cars had updated interior and exterior equipment. The exterior having a redesigned rear, with a large 'hoop' spoiler, new rear lamps, new rear badging with 'Handling by Lotus' badges and removal of the rubber side bumper strakes for a cleaner, more modern look. The updated interior trim was mainly 'tweed' check fabric, an updated centre console, but the loss of air conditioning to keep the price down for the UK market.\n\n[[File:Holden YB Piazza.JPG|thumb|right|The Piazza was marketed in Australia as the YB series Holden Piazza]]\nIsuzu (UK) Ltd, the West Bromwich-based importer, sold the Lotus Piazza from 1987 to 1989, before concentrating on the 4WD [[Isuzu Trooper]]. They never sold the second generation Piazza in the UK, nor was it sold in any European market.\n\nIn [[Australia]], the Piazza was introduced very late (April 1986), and offered only in Turbo form.<ref name=\"holdenbook\">Bebbington, Terry, and Michel A.

GM had commissioned Isuzu to build a replacement for the [[Chevrolet Spectrum|Spectrum]], this time a sportier model called the [[Geo Storm|Storm]] ([[Isuzu Gemini|Gemini Coupe]] in Japan). The body design of the Storm was strongly influenced by GM and drew heavily from [[GM Europe]]'s design submission for the [[Lotus Elan M100]].<ref name=\"lotussincethe70sbook\">Robinson, Graham.

Starting with the Storm, alternative front and rear treatments were made, retaining the lozenge theme of the Gemini sedan, and drawing heavy influence from the rear-wheel drive Impulse (semi-concealed headlights with integrated grille as well as hood and taillight styling) while also expanding on the \"European look\", which later became a central point of marketing the vehicle in Japan.\n\nThe three-door hatchback debuted as the Impulse XS in 1989 for the 1990 model year. It was offered only in front-wheel drive with a DOHC 1.6&nbsp;L (1588&nbsp;cc) I4 engine which produced 130&nbsp;hp (97&nbsp;kW) and 102&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (138&nbsp;Nm). The suspension consisted of [[MacPherson strut]]s both front and rear, with a rigid trailing arm front suspension and a [[multi-link suspension|multi-link]] rear suspension, featuring Nishiboric [[Steering#Passive rear wheel steering|passive steering]].\n\nFor the 1991 model year, the Impulse RS was introduced with a 160&nbsp;hp (119&nbsp;kW) and 150&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (203&nbsp;Nm) turbocharged engine and all-wheel drive drivetrain which featured rear viscous differential and center planetary differential and viscous coupling. The wagonback model was also introduced for the 1991 model year, only available with the normally aspirated 1.6&nbsp;L engine.\n\nFor the 1992 model year, the Turbo model was discontinued and the base engine was replaced with a 1.8&nbsp;L (1809&nbsp;cc) engine, sharing the same bore but with a longer stroke due to the taller engine block. This larger powerplant was good for 140&nbsp;hp (104&nbsp;kW) and 125&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (169&nbsp;Nm).<ref name=\"impulsejispecs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isuzuperformance.com/isupage/hist/specimpji.html|title=Impulse JI and Asuna Sunfire Specifications|accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref> Both body styles continued into 1992, but very few were produced.\n\nSince the Impulse weighed just 2411&nbsp;lb (1094&nbsp;kg) in front-wheel drive configuration and 2732&nbsp;lb (1239&nbsp;kg) in all-wheel drive configuration, the turbo engine and all-wheel drive combined gave excellent performance.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nGeneral Motors, who owned nearly half of Isuzu, also owned [[Lotus Cars]] at the time. Lotus selected the 1.6-litre engine and transmission from the Isuzu Gemini for the [[Lotus Elan M100]] and a following generation of that engine eventually ended up in the Impulse. Lotus was subcontracted by Isuzu to fine-tune the suspension of the Impulse, through selection of stiffer dampers, larger sway bars, and softer springs. All of the second generation Impulses had the Lotus-tuned suspension.\n\nA non-Lotus innovation in the Impulse was the development of the Nishiboric passive [[Steering#Passive rear wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]] system which adjusted the toe of the rear wheels by changing the rear wheel alignment through the range of suspension travel.\n\nThe combination of the burst of the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese economic bubble]], rising [[Automobile emissions control|emissions]] and [[Automobile safety|crash safety]] requirements, and continued restrictive market segment changes by General Motors forced Isuzu out of the car making market and brought an end to the Impulse.\n\n[[File:'93 Asuna Sunfire.JPG|thumb|left|1993 [[As\u00fcna]] Sunfire]]\nIn the Japanese market, this vehicle was sold as the Piazza from July 1991 through the spring of 1992. The second generation Piazza was offered only in front-wheel drive with the 1.8&nbsp;L engine. All of the second generation Piazzas came with the Lotus-tuned suspension. The Japanese were also offered the [[Geo Storm]] version of the Piazza, called the Piazza PA-Nero. This model was exclusive to the Japanese import dealership network [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]], under a special arrangement that sold GM products in Japan.\n\nIn [[Canada]], the same models, with minor variations, were sold in the 1990 and 1991 model years. No Impulses were made for Canada for the 1992 model year. In 1993 the 1.8&nbsp;L model was sold in Canada as the [[As\u00fcna]] Sunfire, but only with the [[hatchback]] body.<ref name=\"impulsejispecs\" /> With the phaseout of the As\u00fcna brand in 1993, the Sunfire name moved to a [[Pontiac]], as [[Pontiac Sunfire|its version]] of the third-generation [[Chevrolet Cavalier]] on the [[GM J platform]] rather than an Isuzu platform.\n\nThe second generation Piazza was replaced by the [[Opel Vectra]] based [[Holden Calibra]] in Australia.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Isuzu Piazza}}\n* [http://www.isuzupiazza.com/ IsuzuPiazza.com]\u2014 Isuzu Piazza Online Community\n* [http://www.iptoc.com/ Isuzu Piazza Turbo Owners' Club (IPTOC)] (Great Britain)\n\n{{Isuzu modern timeline}}\n{{Isuzu United States}}\n\n[[Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Isuzu vehicles|Piazza]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:Hatchbacks]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive sports cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1980]]\n", "name_user": "180.244.248.91", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200e1980\u20131990 (JR120/130))", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isuzu_Piazza"}
