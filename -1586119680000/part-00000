Mount Dora is home to one of three freshwater lighthouses in Florida. It hosts many monthly festivals and is known as the \"Festival City\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lakeside Inn Mount Dora Florida.jpg|thumb|right|The front entrance of the Lakeside Inn.]]\nThe town of Mount Dora began in 1874 when the area was settled by David Simpson, his wife, and two children.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History Of Mount Dora Florida|url = http://www.florida-backroads-travel.com/history-of-mount-dora.html|website = Florida Backroads Travel|accessdate = November 30, 2015}}</ref> In 1880, Ross C.

In 1846, the surveyors named Lake Dora after her, and in 1883 the town was renamed after the lake.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title = Mount Dora, FL - Official Website - History of Mount Dora|url = http://ci.mount-dora.fl.us/index.aspx?nid=317|website = ci.mount-dora.fl.us|accessdate = November 3, 2015}}</ref> The Mount in Mount Dora reflects the fact that the town is on a [[plateau]] 184 feet above sea level.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition to this, Dora is memorialized through Dora Drawdy Way, an alleyway located in the downtown area.\n\nThe town became a popular winter retreat for hunters, fishermen, and boaters, and in 1883 the Alexander House, a two-story hotel, was opened. The Alexander House has been renamed several times and was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. A railroad came to town in 1887, followed by an [[orange (fruit)|orange]] packing house, fertilizer factories, and a [[cannery]] were established as well. The town was granted a charter in 1910 with John Philip Donnelly as its first mayor; the town had 371 residents at the time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1920s, Mount Dora began to grow significantly, both in residential development and business development. Mount Dora began investing in public infrastructure, including streetlights, a water system, curbs, and paved roads.<ref name=\":0\" /> The first two public parks were created and the Mount Dora Community Building was built largely from funds raised by Mount Dora residents. The building has since served as the city's performance and meeting venue.\n\nIn 2013, the City of Mount Dora began to develop an area of land called the Wolf Branch Innovation District.  That plan was developed as the Wekiva Parkway started to expand and State Road 453 opened right into Mount Dora.  The Wolf Branch Innovation District is currently being developed to become a high tech and life sciences business area.  Expansion of infrastructure and roadways continues as Mount Dora prepared for future growth.\n\n===Historic sites===\nThe following are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:\n* [[Blandford (Mount Dora, Florida)|Blandford]]\n* [[Donnelly House (Mount Dora, Florida)|John P.

Mount Dora is home to one of three freshwater lighthouses in Florida. It hosts many monthly festivals and is known as the \"Festival City\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lakeside Inn Mount Dora Florida.jpg|thumb|right|The front entrance of the Lakeside Inn.]]\nThe town of Mount Dora began in 1874 when the area was settled by David Simpson, his wife, and two children.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History Of Mount Dora Florida|url = http://www.florida-backroads-travel.com/history-of-mount-dora.html|website = Florida Backroads Travel|accessdate = November 30, 2015}}</ref> In 1880, Ross C.

In 1846, the surveyors named Lake Dora after her, and in 1883 the town was renamed after the lake.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title = Mount Dora, FL - Official Website - History of Mount Dora|url = http://ci.mount-dora.fl.us/index.aspx?nid=317|website = ci.mount-dora.fl.us|accessdate = November 3, 2015}}</ref> The Mount in Mount Dora reflects the fact that the town is on a [[plateau]] 184 feet above sea level.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition to this, Dora is memorialized through Dora Drawdy Way, an alleyway located in the downtown area.\n\nThe town became a popular winter retreat for hunters, fishermen, and boaters, and in 1883 the Alexander House, a two-story hotel, was opened. The Alexander House has been renamed several times and was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. A railroad came to town in 1887, followed by an [[orange (fruit)|orange]] packing house, fertilizer factories, and a [[cannery]] were established as well. The town was granted a charter in 1910 with John Philip Donnelly as its first mayor; the town had 371 residents at the time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1920s, Mount Dora began to grow significantly, both in residential development and business development. Mount Dora began investing in public infrastructure, including streetlights, a water system, curbs, and paved roads.<ref name=\":0\" /> The first two public parks were created and the Mount Dora Community Building was built largely from funds raised by Mount Dora residents. The building has since served as the city's performance and meeting venue.\n\nIn 2013, the City of Mount Dora began to develop an area of land called the Wolf Branch Innovation District.  That plan was developed as the Wekiva Parkway started to expand and State Road 453 opened right into Mount Dora.  The Wolf Branch Innovation District is currently being developed to become a high tech and life sciences business area.

The attendance of France was seen as problematic because the country quickly surrendered, established the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy government]], rounded up and transported many thousands of its Jews to the Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, and its role in the liberation of Europe was effectively limited to its own borders. By contrast, Polish uniformed forces under Allied command outnumbered those of France and indisputably helped liberate Europe. Polish forces included General Maczek\u2019s 1st Armored Division, General Anders\u2019s 2nd Army Corps, and General Berling\u2019s 1st Polish Army. In addition, Polish RAF squadrons under British command helped defeat Hitler\u2019s Luftwaffe in the [[Battle of Britain]] while Poland\u2019s early [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] successes enabled the deciphering of German communications, which helped shorten the war. Poland was also the first to tell the West of Hitler\u2019s mass murder of Polish and European Jews. This information came directly from a Polish intelligence network in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] established by Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], who voluntarily infiltrated Auschwitz by walking into a German roundup and became Auschwitz inmate number 4859.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/the-auschwitz-volunteer-by-witold-pilecki.html|title=\u2018Were We All People?\u2019|date=2012-06-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nPresident Duda criticized the event\u2019s organizers for making Putin a featured speaker while ignoring the fact that, before the [[Soviet Union]] helped [[Eastern Front (World War II)|liberate Europe in 1945]], Soviet leader Stalin, together with Hitler, attacked Poland in 1939 to destroy the Polish state and annihilate its people on both sides of the Molotov-Ribbentrop line. This was confirmed during Putin\u2019s address to the Forum, which portrayed the Soviet Union\u2019s participation in the war as beginning in 1942 after [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded it in 1941]]. The presentation did not show that the Soviet Union had occupied its half of Poland, as was agreed to in the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe controversy began after Putin made a number of accusations, one of which was that Poland was partly responsible for the outbreak of World War II because of [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak border conflicts|Poland's participation]] in the annexation of parts of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, following the Munich Agreement. Putin\u2019s anger stemmed from a [[European Parliament]] Resolution issued on 19 September 2019 entitled \u201cImportance of European remembrance for the future of Europe\u201d. It blamed the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany for [[Timeline of events preceding World War II|starting World War II]], and called for the removal of Soviet war memorials erected after 1945.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Broder |first1=David |title=The End of Anti-Fascism |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/09/european-parliament-nazism-communism-russia-viktor-orban |work=Jacobin |date=September 2019}}</ref> The resolution condemns the Soviet Union and Germany for agreeing, via the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, to start World War II by first jointly attacking Poland and then dividing Europe between them, all the while engaging in the mass murders of civilians. The Resolution further states that Russian authorities have denied responsibility for the Pact and its horrific consequences, and instead are promoting the view that Poland, the Baltic States, and the West are the true instigators of the war. Putin angrily dismissed the Resolution as \"sheer nonsense\u201d and suggested that Stalin was forced into the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact after other European nations signed nonaggression agreements with Hitler. He further said the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]], which allowed Hitler to annex Czechoslovakia, was an example of western \"collusion\" with Hitler.\n\nPresident [[Gitanas Naus\u0117da|Gitanas Nauseda]] of Lithuania endorsed President's Duda position and also withdrew from the summit.

The attendance of France was seen as problematic because the country quickly surrendered, established the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy government]], rounded up and transported many thousands of its Jews to the Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, and its role in the liberation of Europe was effectively limited to its own borders. By contrast, Polish uniformed forces under Allied command outnumbered those of France and indisputably helped liberate Europe. Polish forces included General Maczek\u2019s 1st Armored Division, General Anders\u2019s 2nd Army Corps, and General Berling\u2019s 1st Polish Army. In addition, Polish RAF squadrons under British command helped defeat Hitler\u2019s Luftwaffe in the [[Battle of Britain]] while Poland\u2019s early [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] successes enabled the deciphering of German communications, which helped shorten the war. Poland was also the first to tell the West of Hitler\u2019s mass murder of Polish and European Jews. This information came directly from a Polish intelligence network in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] established by Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], who voluntarily infiltrated Auschwitz by walking into a German roundup and became Auschwitz inmate number 4859.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/the-auschwitz-volunteer-by-witold-pilecki.html|title=\u2018Were We All People?\u2019|date=2012-06-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nPresident Duda criticized the event\u2019s organizers for making Putin a featured speaker while ignoring the fact that, before the [[Soviet Union]] helped [[Eastern Front (World War II)|liberate Europe in 1945]], Soviet leader Stalin, together with Hitler, attacked Poland in 1939 to destroy the Polish state and annihilate its people on both sides of the Molotov-Ribbentrop line. This was confirmed during Putin\u2019s address to the Forum, which portrayed the Soviet Union\u2019s participation in the war as beginning in 1942 after [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded it in 1941]]. The presentation did not show that the Soviet Union had occupied its half of Poland, as was agreed to in the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe controversy began after Putin made a number of accusations, one of which was that Poland was partly responsible for the outbreak of World War II because of [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak border conflicts|Poland's participation]] in the annexation of parts of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, following the Munich Agreement. Putin\u2019s anger stemmed from a [[European Parliament]] Resolution issued on 19 September 2019 entitled \u201cImportance of European remembrance for the future of Europe\u201d. It blamed the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany for [[Timeline of events preceding World War II|starting World War II]], and called for the removal of Soviet war memorials erected after 1945.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Broder |first1=David |title=The End of Anti-Fascism |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/09/european-parliament-nazism-communism-russia-viktor-orban |work=Jacobin |date=September 2019}}</ref> The resolution condemns the Soviet Union and Germany for agreeing, via the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, to start World War II by first jointly attacking Poland and then dividing Europe between them, all the while engaging in the mass murders of civilians. The Resolution further states that Russian authorities have denied responsibility for the Pact and its horrific consequences, and instead are promoting the view that Poland, the Baltic States, and the West are the true instigators of the war. Putin angrily dismissed the Resolution as \"sheer nonsense\u201d and suggested that Stalin was forced into the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact after other European nations signed nonaggression agreements with Hitler. He further said the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]], which allowed Hitler to annex Czechoslovakia, was an example of western \"collusion\" with Hitler.\n\nPresident [[Gitanas Naus\u0117da|Gitanas Nauseda]] of Lithuania endorsed President's Duda position and also withdrew from the summit.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 9,288.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US2453875| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001), Mount Airy town, Maryland| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American FactFinder| accessdate=May 27, 2016| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213083607/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US2453875| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOutside the town limits, the surrounding countryside is colloquially referred to as Mount Airy or the \"Four-County Area\" by locals. The \"Four-County Area\" derives its name from the fact that the \"Mount Airy\" mailing area encompasses portions of Frederick, Carroll, [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]], and [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]] counties.\n\n==History==\nThe community was first settled in 1830 and continued to develop throughout the decade, beginning with the construction of house settlements along Parr's Ridge. A man named Henry Bussard built the first of these houses. This town was known for its [[train station]] on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) at Parr's Ridge. The railroad ran from [[Baltimore]] to [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], cities to the east and west, respectively, of Mt. Airy. Following 1830, the town received its official name after the suggestion of \"Mount Airy\" from an Irish B&O worker who complained about his freezing ears on a windy work day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountairymd.org/233/Town-History|title=Town History {{!}} Mount Airy, MD|website=www.mountairymd.org|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref> Over the years, [[miller|milling]], [[canning]] and [[sewing]] industries initially helped support Mt. Airy's economy.\n\nThe town's proximity to the [[National Road]] contributed to its growth. The National Road ran west from Baltimore to [[Illinois]]. By the 1890s, the town's growth had increased significantly and three new churches were built (one [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] and two [[Methodism|Methodist]]), along with a very important bridge, still standing and known by residents as the Twin Arch, that helped with railroad transportation. Three great fires (1903, 1914, and 1925) caused setbacks in growth, but the town rebuilt every time.\n\nWhen Carroll County defined its permanent boundaries in 1837, Mount Airy was divided between two counties, Carroll and Frederick; the town has remained in two counties since that time. About one mile south of the town is the junction of Carroll, Frederick, Howard and Montgomery counties at the source of the South Branch of the [[Patapsco River]].\n\nThe town was originally settled in the early 1830s by a core group of six families. Dorsey, Davis and Bussard were the most prominent names in that first settlement, which was followed closely by the construction of the B & O railroad line in 1831. Because Mount Airy sits at an elevation of {{convert|830|ft}}, a series of four [[inclined plane]]s were constructed in order for the trains to climb the steep hills. Locomotives and cars were lifted with the assistance of horses and steam winches. Passengers had to disembark during this process. Plane #4, located west of the town at the intersection of Woodville Road and [[Maryland Route 144|MD Route 144]], is still a recognized location today. In 1839 the planes were abandoned, and the new line was constructed north of where Mount Airy is today. This was a result of more powerful locomotives that had been constructed and heavier loads were being hauled. In 1901, a railroad tunnel was constructed on the south side of town and the existing line into town became a spur line into the center of Mount Airy. The town named the first resident, Henry Bussard, the station agent for the new train station. Mr. Bussard was the first major landowner in Mount Airy.\n\nBy 1846, the town was sparsely settled with several houses, a store, barber shop and shoemaker shop. Pine Grove Chapel, circa 1846, now a historic monument, was constructed to fill the need for a community church. From the time it was constructed, the chapel basement functioned as a private school. The chapel remained open during the early part of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] despite soldier encampments in proximity. The school and church were closed later because of distracting soldier activity around the vicinity of the school. After the war ended, the church reopened in 1867 after undergoing a renovation.\n\nIn 1893, the Carroll County Board of Education funded the construction of a three-room schoolhouse which was completed in September 1894. The building, approximately {{convert|1700|sqft}} in size, was located on the east side of Main Street, 1/4 mile south of the railroad tracks. It is now part of the Calvary United Methodist Church property. The school operated from 9:00 am to 4:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\nWith the incorporation of the town in 1894 came the establishment of the town government structure, including a mayor and council. The first Mount Airy mayor was Byron S. Dorsey, who served ten years in that office between 1894 and 1904. In 1900, the town population had grown to 332 residents. By 1910, the town population was 428, and it was determined that the town had enough student population to justify a state-accredited high school. A high school with classes was organized, but an official high school building to house all eleven grades was not constructed at that time.\n\nThe town of Mount Airy endured three disastrous fires during the first quarter of the 20th century. The first fire occurred in 1902 and destroyed the business section of the southern side of the downtown area. The second fire was in 1914 and consumed the north side of the downtown business section. The third fire took place about ten years later, in 1925, and again, the northern side of the downtown business district was destroyed. As a result of the 1925 fire, the Mount Airy Volunteer Fire Company was organized in 1926.\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s the town continued to flourish despite the onset of the Great Depression. The 1930 U.S. Census tallied the town population at 845 persons, an increase of 91 people since 1920. The railroad company largely contributed to the growth of not only the population, but the town's economy as well. As a result, expanded town services included necessary public utilities such as electric service when Potomac Edison was established in Mount Airy. The thriving economy supported the initiation of several large businesses in the 1930s, such as a poultry operation, two automobile garages, an ice factory, and the creation of the Mount Airy Canning Company, which provided about 250 jobs. In 1932, the first motion picture theater opened in Mount Airy, establishing a core business district. During that time, the town also saw the purchase of land for a town park, the opening of a grocery store and a lumberyard, and the dedication of Pine Grove Chapel for use as a [[nonsectarian]] chapel.\n\nThe [[Mount Airy Historic District (Mount Airy, Maryland)|Mount Airy Historic District]] that includes the railroad station was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, Mt. Airy is no longer economically dependent on the railroad, as citizens work a variety of different jobs. Many of its citizens work in [[Washington, DC]], or [[Baltimore]]; the city is a part of both of those cities' metropolitan areas. Mt. Airy is a neighborhood community for these job centers. Mt. Airy is similar to back in the day with the National Road but now with Interstate 70 bordering the southern end of the city with an interchange with MD-27. In the last few decades Mount Airy has seen significant growth, as laid out in the Mount Airy Master Plan from the 1994 to 2003 update. In 2007 President [[George W. Bush]] made a speech in Mount Airy.\n\nMt. Airy hosts townwide events each year including the Main Street Chili Cookoff, Celebrate Mount Airy in August, Mount Airy Oktoberfest in September, and A Main Street Christmas in December.

Mount Airy's Main Street, formerly MD 27 and now [[Maryland Route 808]], runs atop Parrs Ridge in a northeast\u2013southwest direction with elevations ranging between {{convert|800|and|850|ft}}. Numerous valleys that extend outward toward the east and west from this ridge give the town its unusually hilly topography. Mount Airy straddles the division of two major drainage basins. Within the Frederick County portion of the town are the headwaters of Woodville Branch and Ben's Branch which are parts of the [[Linganore Creek]] watershed, as well as the headwaters of Bush Creek in the southwestern part of the town. The Linganore watershed drains into Lake Linganore, a secondary source of public water for Frederick County. The Linganore and Bush Creek watersheds are part of the Lower [[Monocacy River]] watershed, with eventual drainage to the [[Potomac River]]. The east side of Mount Airy drains via tributaries of Middle Run and the South Branch of the [[Patapsco River]] to [[Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]]. Both the Potomac and the Patapsco are part of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] watershed.\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the town of Mount Airy has a total area of {{convert|10.70|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|10.67|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqkm|order=flip|2}}, or 0.29%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:2019-05-20 12 17 52 View west along Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 40 (Baltimore National Pike) at Exit 68 (Maryland State Route 27, Damascus, Mount Airy) in Mount Airy, Carroll County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The exit for Mount Airy along I-70/US 40]]\nThe primary means of travel to and from Mount Airy are by road.

[[Maryland Route 808]] follows the original route of Maryland Route 27 through downtown Mount Airy.\n\n===Climate===\nMount Airy is similar to Westminster in its position astride Parrs Ridge, and has a humid, temperate climate, more specifically a [[humid subtropical climate]] falling short of a [[humid continental climate]], with four rather well defined seasons. The general atmospheric flow is from west to east but alternate surges of cold air from the north and of warm humid air from the south occurs in the area, causing highly variable weather. Nearness to the Atlantic Coast allows coastal storms to make up any deficiency of precipitation resulting from the passage of weather systems over the mountains to the west.\n\nThe average annual temperature is approximately 54 degrees, with January generally the coldest month and July the warmest. Temperatures exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit an average of 27 days a year. The Town of Mount Airy is in the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a for an annual extreme minimum temperature of 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe average annual precipitation totals about 45 inches, with February the driest and August the wettest month. During the growing season, which averages about 177 days from April through to September, the last part of July through to the first part of August is the driest, with an average of 85-90 degrees.\n\nThe average seasonal snowfall is 28 inches.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Mount Airy, Maryland\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 77\n|Feb record high F = 79\n|Mar record high F = 85\n|Apr record high F = 93\n|May record high F = 96\n|Jun record high F = 100\n|Jul record high F = 103\n|Aug record high F = 103\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F = 92\n|Nov record high F = 83\n|Dec record high F = 78\n|year record high F = 103\n|Jan high F = 40\n|Feb high F = 44\n|Mar high F = 54\n|Apr high F = 65\n|May high F = 74\n|Jun high F = 83\n|Jul high F = 87\n|Aug high F = 85\n|Sep high F = 78\n|Oct high F = 67\n|Nov high F = 55\n|Dec high F = 44\n|year high F = 64.7\n|Jan low F = 20\n|Feb low F = 22\n|Mar low F = 30\n|Apr low F = 38\n|May low F = 48\n|Jun low F = 57\n|Jul low F = 62\n|Aug low F = 60\n|Sep low F = 53\n|Oct low F = 41\n|Nov low F = 32\n|Dec low F = 25\n|year low F = 40.7\n|Jan record low F = -22\n|Feb record low F = -20\n|Mar record low F = -9\n|Apr record low F = 15\n|May record low F = 25\n|Jun record low F = 33\n|Jul record low F = 39\n|Aug record low F = 35\n|Sep record low F = 26\n|Oct record low F = 14\n|Nov record low F = 5\n|Dec record low F = -12\n|year record low F = -22\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.37\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.62\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.63\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.38\n|May precipitation inch = 4.16\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.31\n|Jul precipitation inch = 3.53\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.22\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.87\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.49\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.63\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.19\n|year precipitation inch = 42.40\n|Jan snow inch =  9.8\n|Feb snow inch = 10.1\n|Mar snow inch =  3.2\n|Apr snow inch =   .2\n|May snow inch =    0\n|Jun snow inch =    0\n|Jul snow inch =    0\n|Aug snow inch =    0\n|Sep snow inch =    0\n|Oct snow inch =   .1\n|Nov snow inch =   .9\n|Dec snow inch =  3.7\n|year snow inch= 28.0\n|source 1 = [[The Weather Channel]]<ref name=TWC>{{cite web | url =\nhttp://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/grph/21771 | title = Average Weather for Mount Airy, MD - Temperature and precipitation | publisher=The Weather Channel | accessdate=November 14, 2014}}</ref>\n|date=November 2014\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 91\n|1900= 332\n|1910= 428\n|1920= 754\n|1930= 860\n|1940= 791\n|1950= 1061\n|1960= 1352\n|1970= 1825\n|1980= 2450\n|1990= 3730\n|2000= 6425\n|2010= 9288\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=9452\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 9,288 people, 3,107 households, and 2,453 families residing in the city.

The \"Four-County Area\" derives its name from the fact that the \"Mount Airy\" mailing area encompasses portions of Frederick, Carroll, [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]], and [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]] counties.\n\n==History==\nThe community was first settled in 1830 and continued to develop throughout the decade, beginning with the construction of house settlements along Parr's Ridge. A man named Henry Bussard built the first of these houses. This town was known for its [[train station]] on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) at Parr's Ridge. The railroad ran from [[Baltimore]] to [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], cities to the east and west, respectively, of Mt. Airy. Following 1830, the town received its official name after the suggestion of \"Mount Airy\" from an Irish B&O worker who complained about his freezing ears on a windy work day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountairymd.org/233/Town-History|title=Town History {{!}} Mount Airy, MD|website=www.mountairymd.org|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref> Over the years, [[miller|milling]], [[canning]] and [[sewing]] industries initially helped support Mt. Airy's economy.\n\nThe town's proximity to the [[National Road]] contributed to its growth. The National Road ran west from Baltimore to [[Illinois]]. By the 1890s, the town's growth had increased significantly and three new churches were built (one [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] and two [[Methodism|Methodist]]), along with a very important bridge, still standing and known by residents as the Twin Arch, that helped with railroad transportation. Three great fires (1903, 1914, and 1925) caused setbacks in growth, but the town rebuilt every time.\n\nWhen Carroll County defined its permanent boundaries in 1837, Mount Airy was divided between two counties, Carroll and Frederick; the town has remained in two counties since that time. About one mile south of the town is the junction of Carroll, Frederick, Howard and Montgomery counties at the source of the South Branch of the [[Patapsco River]].\n\nThe town was originally settled in the early 1830s by a core group of six families. Dorsey, Davis and Bussard were the most prominent names in that first settlement, which was followed closely by the construction of the B & O railroad line in 1831. Because Mount Airy sits at an elevation of {{convert|830|ft}}, a series of four [[inclined plane]]s were constructed in order for the trains to climb the steep hills. Locomotives and cars were lifted with the assistance of horses and steam winches. Passengers had to disembark during this process. Plane #4, located west of the town at the intersection of Woodville Road and [[Maryland Route 144|MD Route 144]], is still a recognized location today. In 1839 the planes were abandoned, and the new line was constructed north of where Mount Airy is today. This was a result of more powerful locomotives that had been constructed and heavier loads were being hauled. In 1901, a railroad tunnel was constructed on the south side of town and the existing line into town became a spur line into the center of Mount Airy. The town named the first resident, Henry Bussard, the station agent for the new train station. Mr. Bussard was the first major landowner in Mount Airy.\n\nBy 1846, the town was sparsely settled with several houses, a store, barber shop and shoemaker shop. Pine Grove Chapel, circa 1846, now a historic monument, was constructed to fill the need for a community church. From the time it was constructed, the chapel basement functioned as a private school. The chapel remained open during the early part of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] despite soldier encampments in proximity. The school and church were closed later because of distracting soldier activity around the vicinity of the school. After the war ended, the church reopened in 1867 after undergoing a renovation.\n\nIn 1893, the Carroll County Board of Education funded the construction of a three-room schoolhouse which was completed in September 1894. The building, approximately {{convert|1700|sqft}} in size, was located on the east side of Main Street, 1/4 mile south of the railroad tracks. It is now part of the Calvary United Methodist Church property. The school operated from 9:00 am to 4:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\nWith the incorporation of the town in 1894 came the establishment of the town government structure, including a mayor and council. The first Mount Airy mayor was Byron S. Dorsey, who served ten years in that office between 1894 and 1904. In 1900, the town population had grown to 332 residents. By 1910, the town population was 428, and it was determined that the town had enough student population to justify a state-accredited high school. A high school with classes was organized, but an official high school building to house all eleven grades was not constructed at that time.\n\nThe town of Mount Airy endured three disastrous fires during the first quarter of the 20th century. The first fire occurred in 1902 and destroyed the business section of the southern side of the downtown area. The second fire was in 1914 and consumed the north side of the downtown business section. The third fire took place about ten years later, in 1925, and again, the northern side of the downtown business district was destroyed. As a result of the 1925 fire, the Mount Airy Volunteer Fire Company was organized in 1926.\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s the town continued to flourish despite the onset of the Great Depression. The 1930 U.S. Census tallied the town population at 845 persons, an increase of 91 people since 1920. The railroad company largely contributed to the growth of not only the population, but the town's economy as well. As a result, expanded town services included necessary public utilities such as electric service when Potomac Edison was established in Mount Airy. The thriving economy supported the initiation of several large businesses in the 1930s, such as a poultry operation, two automobile garages, an ice factory, and the creation of the Mount Airy Canning Company, which provided about 250 jobs. In 1932, the first motion picture theater opened in Mount Airy, establishing a core business district. During that time, the town also saw the purchase of land for a town park, the opening of a grocery store and a lumberyard, and the dedication of Pine Grove Chapel for use as a [[nonsectarian]] chapel.\n\nThe [[Mount Airy Historic District (Mount Airy, Maryland)|Mount Airy Historic District]] that includes the railroad station was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, Mt. Airy is no longer economically dependent on the railroad, as citizens work a variety of different jobs. Many of its citizens work in [[Washington, DC]], or [[Baltimore]]; the city is a part of both of those cities' metropolitan areas. Mt. Airy is a neighborhood community for these job centers. Mt. Airy is similar to back in the day with the National Road but now with Interstate 70 bordering the southern end of the city with an interchange with MD-27. In the last few decades Mount Airy has seen significant growth, as laid out in the Mount Airy Master Plan from the 1994 to 2003 update. In 2007 President [[George W. Bush]] made a speech in Mount Airy.\n\nMt. Airy hosts townwide events each year including the Main Street Chili Cookoff, Celebrate Mount Airy in August, Mount Airy Oktoberfest in September, and A Main Street Christmas in December.

Mount Airy's Main Street, formerly MD 27 and now [[Maryland Route 808]], runs atop Parrs Ridge in a northeast-southwest direction with elevations ranging between {{convert|800|and|850|ft}}. Numerous valleys that extend outward toward the east and west from this ridge give the town its unusually hilly topography. Mount Airy straddles the division of two major drainage basins. Within the Frederick County portion of the town are the headwaters of Woodville Branch and Ben's Branch which are parts of the [[Linganore Creek]] watershed, as well as the headwaters of Bush Creek in the southwestern part of the town. The Linganore watershed drains into Lake Linganore, a secondary source of public water for Frederick County. The Linganore and Bush Creek watersheds are part of the Lower [[Monocacy River]] watershed, with eventual drainage to the [[Potomac River]]. The east side of Mount Airy drains via tributaries of Middle Run and the South Branch of the [[Patapsco River]] to [[Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]]. Both the Potomac and the Patapsco are part of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] watershed.\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the town of Mount Airy has a total area of {{convert|10.70|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|10.67|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqkm|order=flip|2}}, or 0.29%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:2019-05-20 12 17 52 View west along Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 40 (Baltimore National Pike) at Exit 68 (Maryland State Route 27, Damascus, Mount Airy) in Mount Airy, Carroll County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The exit for Mount Airy along I-70/US 40]]\nThe primary means of travel to and from Mount Airy are by road. The most prominent highway serving the town is [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|Interstate 70]] and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|U.S. Route 40]], which forms the southern border of Mount Airy and leads east {{convert|32|mi}} to [[Baltimore]] and west {{convert|14|mi}} to [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]]. [[Maryland Route 27]] (Ridge Road) runs through the east side of the town, leading northeast {{convert|16|mi}} to [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]], the Carroll County seat, and southwest {{Convert|14|mi}} to [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]] in [[Germantown, Maryland|Germantown]]. [[Maryland Route 808]] follows the original route of Maryland Route 27 through downtown Mount Airy.\n\n===Climate===\nMount Airy is similar to Westminster in its position astride Parrs Ridge, and has a humid, temperate climate, more specifically a [[humid subtropical climate]] falling short of a [[humid continental climate]], with four rather well defined seasons. The general atmospheric flow is from west to east but alternate surges of cold air from the north and of warm humid air from the south occurs in the area, causing highly variable weather. Nearness to the Atlantic Coast allows coastal storms to make up any deficiency of precipitation resulting from the passage of weather systems over the mountains to the west.\n\nThe average annual temperature is approximately 54 degrees, with January generally the coldest month and July the warmest. Temperatures exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit an average of 27 days a year. The Town of Mount Airy is in the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a for an annual extreme minimum temperature of 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe average annual precipitation totals about 45 inches, with February the driest and August the wettest month. During the growing season, which averages about 177 days from April through to September, the last part of July through to the first part of August is the driest, with an average of 85-90 degrees.\n\nThe average seasonal snowfall is 28 inches.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Mount Airy, Maryland\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 77\n|Feb record high F = 79\n|Mar record high F = 85\n|Apr record high F = 93\n|May record high F = 96\n|Jun record high F = 100\n|Jul record high F = 103\n|Aug record high F = 103\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F = 92\n|Nov record high F = 83\n|Dec record high F = 78\n|year record high F = 103\n|Jan high F = 40\n|Feb high F = 44\n|Mar high F = 54\n|Apr high F = 65\n|May high F = 74\n|Jun high F = 83\n|Jul high F = 87\n|Aug high F = 85\n|Sep high F = 78\n|Oct high F = 67\n|Nov high F = 55\n|Dec high F = 44\n|year high F = 64.7\n|Jan low F = 20\n|Feb low F = 22\n|Mar low F = 30\n|Apr low F = 38\n|May low F = 48\n|Jun low F = 57\n|Jul low F = 62\n|Aug low F = 60\n|Sep low F = 53\n|Oct low F = 41\n|Nov low F = 32\n|Dec low F = 25\n|year low F = 40.7\n|Jan record low F = -22\n|Feb record low F = -20\n|Mar record low F = -9\n|Apr record low F = 15\n|May record low F = 25\n|Jun record low F = 33\n|Jul record low F = 39\n|Aug record low F = 35\n|Sep record low F = 26\n|Oct record low F = 14\n|Nov record low F = 5\n|Dec record low F = -12\n|year record low F = -22\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.37\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.62\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.63\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.38\n|May precipitation inch = 4.16\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.31\n|Jul precipitation inch = 3.53\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.22\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.87\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.49\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.63\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.19\n|year precipitation inch = 42.40\n|Jan snow inch =  9.8\n|Feb snow inch = 10.1\n|Mar snow inch =  3.2\n|Apr snow inch =   .2\n|May snow inch =    0\n|Jun snow inch =    0\n|Jul snow inch =    0\n|Aug snow inch =    0\n|Sep snow inch =    0\n|Oct snow inch =   .1\n|Nov snow inch =   .9\n|Dec snow inch =  3.7\n|year snow inch= 28.0\n|source 1 = [[The Weather Channel]]<ref name=TWC>{{cite web | url =\nhttp://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/grph/21771 | title = Average Weather for Mount Airy, MD - Temperature and precipitation | publisher=The Weather Channel | accessdate=November 14, 2014}}</ref>\n|date=November 2014\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 91\n|1900= 332\n|1910= 428\n|1920= 754\n|1930= 860\n|1940= 791\n|1950= 1061\n|1960= 1352\n|1970= 1825\n|1980= 2450\n|1990= 3730\n|2000= 6425\n|2010= 9288\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=9452\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212234628/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 9,288 people, 3,107 households, and 2,453 families residing in the city.
