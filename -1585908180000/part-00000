Mentioning re-runs in later years takes up too much space considering they are not really necessarily in the context of a programming list. It would also cause difficulties in trying to keep track of every year a particular film is aired, especially with the films that have not aired in a long time. The same practice is used for sections like \"Former original programming\" and \"Pilots and specials\" listed above, as Adult Swim tends to re-air things for years and years on a non-consistent basis after their original debut airings.

Mentioning re-runs in later years takes up too much space considering they are not really necessarily in the context of a programming list. It would also cause difficulties in trying to keep track of every year a particular film is aired, especially with the films that have not aired in a long time. The same practice is used for sections like \"Former original programming\" and \"Pilots and specials\" listed above, as Adult Swim tends to re-air things for years and years on a non-consistent basis after their original debut airings.

Each of these inventions is consistent with the modern definition of engineering, exploiting basic mechanical principles to develop useful [[tools]] and objects.\n\nThe term ''engineering'' itself has a much more recent etymology, deriving from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to 1325,\nwhen an ''engine\u2019er'' (literally, one who operates an ''engine'') originally referred to \"a constructor of military engines.\"<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]</ref> In this context, now obsolete, an \"engine\" referred to a military machine, ''i.&nbsp;e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]).

The development of this device gave rise to the [[industrial revolution]] in the coming decades, allowing for the beginnings of [[mass production]].\n\nWith the rise of engineering as a [[profession]] in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the [[mechanic arts]] became incorporated into engineering.\n\nThe following images are samples from a deck of cards illustrating engineering instruments in England in 1702.

Practitioners had created a global [[electric telegraph]] network and the first electrical engineering institutions to support the new discipline were founded in the UK and USA. Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, [[Francis Ronalds]] stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=July 2016|title=Francis Ronalds (1788-1873): The First Electrical Engineer?|url=|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571358|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe work of  [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[Electronics]].

Besides over 50 ingenious mechanical devices, [[Al-Jazari]] also developed and made innovations to segmental gears, mechanical controls, [[escapement]] mechanisms, clocks, robotics, and protocols for designing and manufacturing methods.\n\n==European Renaissance==\nThe first [[steam engine]] was built in 1698 by [[mechanical engineer]] [[Thomas Savery]]. The development of this device gave rise to the [[industrial revolution]] in the coming decades, allowing for the beginnings of [[mass production]].\n\nWith the rise of engineering as a [[profession]] in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the [[mechanic arts]] became incorporated into engineering.\n\nThe following images are samples from a deck of cards illustrating engineering instruments in England in 1702. They illustrate a range of engineering specializations, that would eventually become known as [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[geodesy]] and [[geomatics]], and so on.\n\nEach card includes a caption explaining the purpose of the instrument:\n<gallery>\nFile:Four of hearts Sea quadrant 1702.jpg|Four of hearts: Sea quadrant\nFile:1702 Nine of diamonds Dyals.jpg|Nine of diamonds: Dyals (dials)\nFile:Six_of_diamonds_Circumference.jpg|Six of diamonds: Circumferentor\nFile:Eight of diamonds the compass.jpg|Eight of diamonds: the Compass\nFile:King of spades- spheres.jpg|King of spades: Spheres\nFile:Knave of hearts Surveying wheel and chains 1702.jpg|Knave of hearts: Surveying wheel and chains\nFile:Knave of spades Leavell 1702.jpg|Knave of spades: Leavell\nFile:One of Diamonds Mathematical instruments 1702.jpg|One of diamonds: Mathematical instruments\nFile:Queen of Diamonds Projections of the sphere 1702.jpg|Queen of diamonds: Projections of the sphere\nFile:Queen of spades Astronomical quadrant (ca. 1702).jpg|Queen of spades: Astronomical quadrant\nFile:Three of diamonds Gauger 1702.jpg|Three of diamonds: Gauger (gauges)\nFile:Two of clubs Theodolet and semi circle 1702.jpg|Two of clubs: Theodolet and semi-circle\n</gallery>\n\n==Modern era==\nThe inventions of Thomas Savery and the Scottish engineer [[James Watt]] gave rise to modern [[Mechanical Engineering]]. The development of specialized machines and their maintenance tools during the industrial revolution led to the rapid growth of Mechanical Engineering both in its birthplace [[Great Britain|Britain]] and abroad.<ref name=\"ECPD Definition on Britannica\"/>\n\nThe discipline of [[Electrical Engineering]] was shaped by the experiments of [[Alessandro Volta]] in the 19th century, the experiments of [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]] and others and the invention of the [[electric motor]] in 1872. Electrical engineering became a profession late in the 19th century. Practitioners had created a global [[electric telegraph]] network and the first electrical engineering institutions to support the new discipline were founded in the UK and USA. Although it is impossible to precisely pinpoint a first electrical engineer, [[Francis Ronalds]] stands ahead of the field, who created the first working electric telegraph system in 1816 and documented his vision of how the world could be transformed by electricity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=July 2016|title=Francis Ronalds (1788-1873): The First Electrical Engineer?|url=|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571358|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe work of  [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[Electronics]].

They had no artillery or cavalry and had learned in past actions that a rapid advance into the enemy would sweep all before them. At Marignano, the battle began with a \u201c[[forlorn hope]]\u201d detaching from the Swiss vanguard phalanx, and with lowered pikes charging the grand battery in front of the King\u2019s position in the center.

The pursuing French horse were themselves routed by the oncoming Swiss mainbody. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nSmoke and the coming of night obscured the battle; in the moonlight and confusion, the outcome hung in the balance.

Many of the foremost French commanders were wounded or killed in the desperate night fighting, including the Prince of Tallemont, son of [[Louis II de la Tr\u00e9moille]], who died with sixty-two wounds on his body. The Black Legion counter-attacked and threw back the Swiss, only to be repulsed in turn. Bayard had to cut his way through the Swiss phalanx to rescue the Duke of Lorraine, stranded in the dark amongst his enemies. In the darkest hours, the fighting stopped, and both armies extracted themselves and reorganized. At dawn the battle commenced again. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn the French center, the grand battery had been reassembled. Opposing them, the Swiss had reformed their largest phalanx. Encouraged by the evening before, the Swiss once again lowered pikes and charged the French guns. This time the grand battery was ready for them. Massed cannon fire tore bloody furrows deep in their ranks, slowing the advance. But the undaunted Swiss continually closed ranks and pushed forward. Again, the defending German landsknechts were driven back; but the massed fire of the guns at point blank prevented the Swiss from pushing farther forward. Still another French cavalry charge, this time led by Bayard, forced the attacking Swiss to give ground.\n\nBaffled by the artillery but as yet undaunted, the Swiss refocused their assault against Alen\u00e7on\u2019s left-wing division.

Their attacks repulsed everywhere, their ranks in bloody shambles, they grudgingly gave ground and withdrew.\n\nThe battle was a decisive victory for Francis. This could be considered the expected outcome, seeing as the Swiss were heavily outnumbered and outgunned. But the Swiss during the preceding decades had almost habitually emerged victorious from such disadvantageous situations, and the French victory by no means came easily, the battle hanging in the balance until the arrival of the Venetian reinforcements.\n\nThe immediate causes of the Swiss defeat were their failure to capture the enemy artillery during the early phase of the battle and the arrival of the Venetians. But also contributing to the Swiss defeat were their lack of discipline and their ineffective command structure. Earlier in the same year of 1515, the [[Swiss diet]] had granted to each captain the authority to decide whether their company would continue their campaign or retreat. This made it impossible for the Swiss forces to act as a unity. The system of command consisted two captains elected as commanders-in-chief, besides the captains of the individual companies, as well as one representative elected by the men-at-arms of each canton. These commanders would vote on the policy of the Swiss army. In practice, this system broke down as soon as it was put to the test: the captains decided to honour the agreement not to attack, while the representatives of the troops, especially those of Uri, Schwyz and Glarus, decided to attack regardless, motivated by the prospect of rich spoils.\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Marignan.jpg|thumb|Contemporary depiction of the battle, attributed to the ''Ma\u00eetre \u00e0 la Rati\u00e8re'']]\n[[File:Hodler - Sterbender Krieger - 1897-98.jpg|300px|thumb|Dying Swiss, sketch by [[Ferdinand Hodler]] (ca. 1898) for his ''Retreat from Marignano'' fresco (1900).]]\n\n===French side===\n\u201cI have vanquished those whom only Caesar vanquished\u201d was printed on the medal King Francis ordered struck to commemorate the victory.<ref name=\"mcphee19831031\">{{cite news | url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=16248&startpage=page0000103#folio=050 | title=La Place de la Concorde Suisse-I | work=The New Yorker | date=1983-10-31 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | author=McPhee, John | pages=50}}</ref> Considering the battle his most cherished triumph, Francis requested that he himself be knighted on the battlefield, in the ancient style, by the hand of none other than the Chevalier Bayard. Marshal [[Gian Giacomo Trivulzio]], veteran of every war for the previous 40 years, praised Marignano as the \u201cbattle of giants\u201d and stated that compared to it, all previous battles in his lifetime had been \u201cchild\u2019s sport\u201d.\n\nMarignano established the superiority of French cast [[bronze]] [[artillery]] and [[Gendarme (historical)|gendarme]] [[cavalry]] over the heretofore invincible [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] tactics of the Swiss infantry. French success at Marignano, however, eventually galvanized opposition in the divided [[peninsula]] and turned the [[Europe]]an [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] against Francis I. In the meantime, however, Francis gained the city, and more importantly, the [[Castello Sforzesco]] within it, the strategic key to control of [[Lombardy]]. There [[Maximilian Sforza|Massimiliano Sforza]] and his Swiss mercenaries and the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]-[[bishop of Sion]] retreated, only submitting when French [[sapper]]s had placed mines under the foundations. The French regained Milan, and Massimiliano went into luxurious exile with a French purse of 30,000 ducats.<ref>[http://collections.ic.gc.ca/bulletin/num26/johnson2.html Canada's Digital Collections (collections.ic.gc.ca)]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217102821/http://collections.ic.gc.ca/bulletin/num26/johnson2.html |date=December 17, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n===Swiss side===\nThe retreating Swiss army retained control of their upper-Lombardy provinces of [[Bellinzona]] and [[Ennetbirgische Vogteien|adjacent valleys]], leaving a rearguard to preside over them.\n\nThe battle ended once and for all Swiss aspirations in Milan, and the Swiss Confederacy never again went to war against France or Milan.\nIn fact, the Confederacy never went to war again at all after 1525, and (apart from the conquest of [[Vaud]] by the [[canton of Berne]] acting on its own in 1536) there never was any Swiss military offensive against an external enemy again. [[Swiss historiography]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} has tended to attribute this to the \"lesson learned\" at Marignano, but {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} at least as effective was the division created by the [[Swiss Reformation]] in the 1520s, dividing the Confederacy into two factions which would be occupied with internal hostilities throughout the period of the [[European Wars of Religion]], as well as a number of painful defeats of Swiss mercenary regiments in the decade between 1515 and 1525 (at [[Battle of Bicocca|Bicocca]], Sesia and [[Battle of Pavia|Pavia]]).\n\n===Perpetual Peace===\nAfter lengthy negotiations, a peace treaty between the [[Thirteen Cantons]] and its allies ([[Abbey of Saint Gall#Under the Prince-Abbots|abbot]] and [[St. Gallen|city]] of St. Gallen, [[Three Leagues]], [[Valais]], [[Mulhouse]]) on one hand\nand Francis as both King of France and Duke of Milan on the other\nwas signed in [[Fribourg]] on 29 November 1516.\nIn the treaty of Fribourg,  known as  \"Perpetual Peace\" (''Ewiger Frieden'', ''Paix perp\u00e9tuelle''), the Swiss Confederacy renounced all claims to the protectorate of Milan. In return, France paid 700,000 [[\u00c9cu|gold crowns]] in compensation to the Confederacy.\nBoth parties agreed to abstain from giving any support to enemies of the other party (with the exception of pre-existing treaties) and agreed on an arrangement of arbitration in the case of future disputes.\nFrance offered another 300,000 crowns if the Swiss were willing to yield their [[Ennetbirgische Vogteien|transmontane territories]] (except for Bellinzona), but this offer was declined.  The treaty furthermore granted trade privileges to the Swiss, both in Milan and in [[Lyon]].<ref name=HLS8898>{{HLS|8898|Ewiger Frieden / Paix perp\u00e9tuelle|author= Andr\u00e9 Holenstein |date=2010}}</ref>\nOnly the [[Ossola]] valley was passed back to Milan, while the other transmontane bailiwicks of the Swiss Confederacy remain part of Switzerland to this day, since 1803 as the [[canton Ticino]] (while the Three Leagues lost control of the [[Valtellina]] in 1797).\n\nThe \"Perpetual Peace\" with France was indeed kept for the remainder of the lifetime of the [[Kingdom of France]], and was broken only during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], with the [[French invasion of Switzerland]] in 1798.\nIt opened a period of close ties between the Swiss Confederacy with France over the next [[Early Modern Switzerland|three centuries]] (while at the same time Switzerland moved away from its association with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]). A next step of rapprochemant to France was the service pact (''Soldb\u00fcndnis'') with France, concluded in 1521, which made [[Swiss mercenary]] regiments a regular part of the French armed forces (see ''[[Gardes Suisses]]'').\nThis arrangement also outlasted three centuries, with four Swiss regiments participating in Napoleon's [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in 1812, foreign military service of Swiss citizens being finally outlawed in 1848 with the formation of [[Switzerland as a federal state]].\n\n===Other===\nShortly after the battle, Francis met with [[Pope Leo X]] in [[Bologna]] to discuss the return of Milan to France {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} \u2013 a meeting at which [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was present{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. There, Francis persuaded Leonardo to accompany him back to France, and granted him the [[Clos Luc\u00e9]] manor.\n\nAlso present {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} at the battle was [[Huldrych Zwingli]], who since 1506 had been [[Jus patronatus|church patron]] at [[Glarus]]. In Glarus, there was political controversy on which side the young men seeking employment as mercenaries should take service, the side of France or that of the Holy Roman Empire and the [[Papal States]].\nThe aim was to prevent that men of Glarus took service on both sides of [[War of the League of Cambrai|the war]], which would result in the unhappy constellation of \"brothers fighting brothers\" on the battlefield, as had been the case [[Treason of Novara|at Novara]] in 1500.\nZwingli had supported the Pope before Marignano, and even after the battle, he opposed the peace with France and continued to support the side of the Papal States.\nSince public opinion in Glarus had shifted towards a clearly pro-French stance after the peace of 1516, Zwingli was forced to abandon his position in Glarus. He took employment at [[Einsiedeln]], and from 1519 in [[Z\u00fcrich]].\nBased on his experience in the Italian War, Zwingli became an outspoken opponent of mercenary service, arguing with [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] that \"war is sweet only to those who have not experienced it\" (''dulce bellum inexpertis''). He also blamed the warmongery on the part of [[Matth\u00e4us Schiner|cardinal Schiner]] for the disaster at Marignano and began to preach against the \"red caps\" (''rote h\u00fcetlin'', i.e. the high clergy), the first signs of his radicalization that would culminate in the [[Swiss Reformation]] during the decade following Marignano.\n\n==Legacy and commemoration==\nCommemorating the event are a [[bas-relief]] of the Battle of Marignano by [[Pierre Bontemps]], which decorates Francis I's tomb at [[Saint-Denis Basilica|Saint-Denis]]; a painting by [[Antoine Caron]] for [[Fontainebleau]] (now at the [[National Gallery of Canada]], Ottawa); and the most famous musical composition of [[Cl\u00e9ment Janequin]], the [[chanson]] ''La guerre''.

In practice, this system broke down as soon as it was put to the test: the captains decided to honour the agreement not to attack, while the representatives of the troops, especially those of Uri, Schwyz and Glarus, decided to attack regardless, motivated by the prospect of rich spoils.\n\n==Results==\n[[File:Marignan.jpg|thumb|Contemporary depiction of the battle, attributed to the ''Ma\u00eetre \u00e0 la Rati\u00e8re'']]\n[[File:Hodler - Sterbender Krieger - 1897-98.jpg|300px|thumb|Dying Swiss, sketch by [[Ferdinand Hodler]] (ca. 1898) for his ''Retreat from Marignano'' fresco (1900).]]\n\n===French side===\n\u201cI have vanquished those whom only Caesar vanquished\u201d was printed on the medal King Francis ordered struck to commemorate the victory.<ref name=\"mcphee19831031\">{{cite news | url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=16248&startpage=page0000103#folio=050 | title=La Place de la Concorde Suisse-I | work=The New Yorker | date=1983-10-31 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | author=McPhee, John | pages=50}}</ref> Considering the battle his most cherished triumph, Francis requested that he himself be knighted on the battlefield, in the ancient style, by the hand of none other than the Chevalier Bayard. Marshal [[Gian Giacomo Trivulzio]], veteran of every war for the previous 40 years, praised Marignano as the \u201cbattle of giants\u201d and stated that compared to it, all previous battles in his lifetime had been \u201cchild\u2019s sport\u201d.\n\nMarignano established the superiority of French cast [[bronze]] [[artillery]] and [[Gendarme (historical)|gendarme]] [[cavalry]] over the heretofore invincible [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] tactics of the Swiss infantry. French success at Marignano, however, eventually galvanized opposition in the divided [[peninsula]] and turned the [[Europe]]an [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] against Francis I. In the meantime, however, Francis gained the city, and more importantly, the [[Castello Sforzesco]] within it, the strategic key to control of [[Lombardy]]. There [[Maximilian Sforza|Massimiliano Sforza]] and his Swiss mercenaries and the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]-[[bishop of Sion]] retreated, only submitting when French [[sapper]]s had placed mines under the foundations. The French regained Milan, and Massimiliano went into luxurious exile with a French purse of 30,000 ducats.<ref>[http://collections.ic.gc.ca/bulletin/num26/johnson2.html Canada's Digital Collections (collections.ic.gc.ca)]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041217102821/http://collections.ic.gc.ca/bulletin/num26/johnson2.html |date=December 17, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n===Swiss side===\nThe retreating Swiss army retained control of their upper-Lombardy provinces of [[Bellinzona]] and [[Ennetbirgische Vogteien|adjacent valleys]], leaving a rearguard to preside over them.\n\nThe battle ended once and for all Swiss aspirations in Milan, and the Swiss Confederacy never again went to war against France or Milan.\nIn fact, the Confederacy never went to war again at all after 1525, and (apart from the conquest of [[Vaud]] by the [[canton of Berne]] acting on its own in 1536) there never was any Swiss military offensive against an external enemy again. [[Swiss historiography]] {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} has tended to attribute this to the \"lesson learned\" at Marignano, but {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} at least as effective was the division created by the [[Swiss Reformation]] in the 1520s, dividing the Confederacy into two factions which would be occupied with internal hostilities throughout the period of the [[European Wars of Religion]], as well as a number of painful defeats of Swiss mercenary regiments in the decade between 1515 and 1525 (at [[Battle of Bicocca|Bicocca]], Sesia and [[Battle of Pavia|Pavia]]).\n\n===Perpetual Peace===\nAfter lengthy negotiations, a peace treaty between the [[Thirteen Cantons]] and its allies ([[Abbey of Saint Gall#Under the Prince-Abbots|abbot]] and [[St. Gallen|city]] of St. Gallen, [[Three Leagues]], [[Valais]], [[Mulhouse]]) on one hand\nand Francis as both King of France and Duke of Milan on the other\nwas signed in [[Fribourg]] on 29 November 1516.\nIn the treaty of Fribourg,  known as  \"Perpetual Peace\" (''Ewiger Frieden'', ''Paix perp\u00e9tuelle''), the Swiss Confederacy renounced all claims to the protectorate of Milan. In return, France paid 700,000 [[\u00c9cu|gold crowns]] in compensation to the Confederacy.\nBoth parties agreed to abstain from giving any support to enemies of the other party (with the exception of pre-existing treaties) and agreed on an arrangement of arbitration in the case of future disputes.\nFrance offered another 300,000 crowns if the Swiss were willing to yield their [[Ennetbirgische Vogteien|transmontane territories]] (except for Bellinzona), but this offer was declined.  The treaty furthermore granted trade privileges to the Swiss, both in Milan and in [[Lyon]].<ref name=HLS8898>{{HLS|8898|Ewiger Frieden / Paix perp\u00e9tuelle|author= Andr\u00e9 Holenstein |date=2010}}</ref>\nOnly the [[Ossola]] valley was passed back to Milan, while the other transmontane bailiwicks of the Swiss Confederacy remain part of Switzerland to this day, since 1803 as the [[canton Ticino]] (while the Three Leagues lost control of the [[Valtellina]] in 1797).\n\nThe \"Perpetual Peace\" with France was indeed kept for the remainder of the lifetime of the [[Kingdom of France]], and was broken only during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], with the [[French invasion of Switzerland]] in 1798.\nIt opened a period of close ties between the Swiss Confederacy with France over the next [[Early Modern Switzerland|three centuries]] (while at the same time Switzerland moved away from its association with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]). A next step of rapprochemant to France was the service pact (''Soldb\u00fcndnis'') with France, concluded in 1521, which made [[Swiss mercenary]] regiments a regular part of the French armed forces (see ''[[Gardes Suisses]]'').\nThis arrangement also outlasted three centuries, with four Swiss regiments participating in Napoleon's [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in 1812, foreign military service of Swiss citizens being finally outlawed in 1848 with the formation of [[Switzerland as a federal state]].\n\n===Other===\nShortly after the battle, Francis met with [[Pope Leo X]] in [[Bologna]] to discuss the return of Milan to France {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} \u2013 a meeting at which [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was present{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. There, Francis persuaded Leonardo to accompany him back to France, and granted him the [[Clos Luc\u00e9]] manor.\n\nAlso present {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} at the battle was [[Huldrych Zwingli]], who since 1506 had been [[Jus patronatus|church patron]] at [[Glarus]]. In Glarus, there was political controversy on which side the young men seeking employment as mercenaries should take service, the side of France or that of the Holy Roman Empire and the [[Papal States]].\nThe aim was to prevent that men of Glarus took service on both sides of [[War of the League of Cambrai|the war]], which would result in the unhappy constellation of \"brothers fighting brothers\" on the battlefield, as had been the case [[Treason of Novara|at Novara]] in 1500.\nZwingli had supported the Pope before Marignano, and even after the battle, he opposed the peace with France and continued to support the side of the Papal States.\nSince public opinion in Glarus had shifted towards a clearly pro-French stance after the peace of 1516, Zwingli was forced to abandon his position in Glarus. He took employment at [[Einsiedeln]], and from 1519 in [[Z\u00fcrich]].\nBased on his experience in the Italian War, Zwingli became an outspoken opponent of mercenary service, arguing with [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] that \"war is sweet only to those who have not experienced it\" (''dulce bellum inexpertis''). He also blamed the warmongery on the part of [[Matth\u00e4us Schiner|cardinal Schiner]] for the disaster at Marignano and began to preach against the \"red caps\" (''rote h\u00fcetlin'', i.e. the high clergy), the first signs of his radicalization that would culminate in the [[Swiss Reformation]] during the decade following Marignano.\n\n==Legacy and commemoration==\nCommemorating the event are a [[bas-relief]] of the Battle of Marignano by [[Pierre Bontemps]], which decorates Francis I's tomb at [[Saint-Denis Basilica|Saint-Denis]]; a painting by [[Antoine Caron]] for [[Fontainebleau]] (now at the [[National Gallery of Canada]], Ottawa); and the most famous musical composition of [[Cl\u00e9ment Janequin]], the [[chanson]] ''La guerre''.  The Swiss hero Hans B\u00e4r appears in a fresco on the tower of the [[Basel]] City Hall.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{HLS|8896|Marignan, bataille de|author=Herv\u00e9 de Weck|date=2015}}\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Marignan, Battle of |volume=17 |pages=716\u2013717|short=1}}\n* W.

Green was also the lead singer for the hard rock and metal band \"Haddonfield.\"\n\n== Background ==\n\nGreen was born and raised in Holliston, Massachusetts. After graduating from high school in 1993, he left for [[New York (state)|New York]] to study film and television production at [[Hofstra University]] graduating in 1997 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree. After studies, Green worked in [[Boston]] making local commercials for [[Time Warner Cable]], where he met his future collaborator Will Barratt. In 1998, together they founded production company [[ArieScope Pictures]] and the following year made their first feature-length film \u2013 semi-biographic comedy ''Coffee & Donuts'' {{small|([[Adam Green (filmmaker)#Coffee & Donuts|see subsection]])}}. Encouraged by friends and success in small film festivals, in 2000, Green packed his belongings and drove out to [[Hollywood]]. However, the film did not receive much attention and for a few years the new filmmaker was struggling with urban life and career. He worked as DJ at the [[Rainbow Bar & Grill]], while also undertaking various supporting roles in media industry. Green describes experience: \"The next three years saw loads of struggle and disappointment as I did every odd job I could score in Hollywood and waited for something to pan out with C&D.\" During that period the upcoming director wrote the original installment of what would become the ''Hatchet'' franchise and met his future wife [[Rileah Vanderbilt]].{{refn|name=CD}}\n\n== Feature film and television career ==\nSteadily working within a small group of friend-actors, Green self-produced most of his 2000s projects. By 2013, he had released two seasons of television sitcom ''Holliston'' together with seven theatrical feature films, including horror ''Hatchet'' (2006) and thriller ''Frozen'' (2010). Consequently, director became a member of the [[Splat Pack]], \u2013 group of filmmakers, who brought back gore and splatter, containing [[Eli Roth]], [[Alexandre Aja]], [[Neil Marshall]], [[Rob Zombie]], [[Greg McLean]], [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], and [[James Wan]].\n\n=== ''Coffee & Donuts'' ===\n''Coffee & Donuts'' (2000){{sup|unpublished}} is a semi-biographic lighthearted romantic comedy about two friends, Adam and Steve, who strive to launch their morning radio program of the small town, while Adam concurrently struggles to overcome breakup. Green made the feature film for only $400 using equipment from the cable advertising facility, that he was working for at the time, and employing volunteers for everything from cast to crew. Creator starred in the lead role, while other parts were played by Steven C. DeWitt Jr., Katie Bove and Jeff Davison. This amateur production has not been widely released.{{refn|name=CD}}\n\nIn 2003, [[Touchstone Pictures]] bought ''Coffee & Donuts'', hired Green as a writer and remade the film into a sitcom for [[UPN]]. The pilot episode, being produced by [[Tom Shadyac|Tom Shadyac's]] Shady Acres, was rejected and for the next five years, the rights remained with Touchstone. After regaining the rights in 2009, there were efforts to sell it to another network. However, the sitcom got canceled again.

While Green cast authentic German speaking actors for all roles, the lead role of Adolf Hitler is portrayed by [[Joel David Moore]], who does not know how to speak German and purposely fakes his way through the film by using a combination of gibberish and random words thrown to him by Green, such as \"[[Boba Fett]]\", \"[[OshKosh B'Gosh]]\" and \"[[Goldie Hawn]]\".

Green wrote and directed the six episodes comprising season one of this show, mixing comedy, horror, romance, and described by the network as \"''Big Bang Theory'' meets ''Evil Dead 2''\".

On July 24, 2017 it was announced that Green had made \"Haddonfield\" fully active once again and that the band had signed with \"Megadeth\" bassist David Ellefson's EMP Label Group who would be putting out the band's debut record \"Ghosts Of Salem\" in conjunction with Green's own imprint label ArieScope Records.  \"Ghosts Of Salem\" was released digitally worldwide on September 15, 2017 with the physical CD version and a limited edition vinyl version arriving in stores just one month later on October 13, 2017.  \"Haddonfield\" celebrated the album release with a performance at the Worcester Palladium in Worcester, MA on October 14, 2017 on a bill that also featured \"Ministry,\" Superjoint Ritual,\" \"Devil Driver,\" and \"Motionless In White.\"\n\nOn July 11, 2019 \"Haddonfield's\" bass player Chris Permatteo died from natural causes. When Adam Green addressed Permatteo's sudden and tragic death on The Movie Crypt podcast the following Monday, he stated that \"Haddonfield\" would not continue on and that he would never perform their songs on stage again.\n\n==Discography==\n*''Ghosts Of Salem'' (2017)\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n=== Feature films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! colspan=\"4\" | Credited as\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! style=\"width:9em; font-size:90%\" | Director\n! style=\"width:9em; font-size:90%\" | Writer\n! style=\"width:9em; font-size:90%\" | Producer\n! style=\"width:9em; font-size:90%\" | Actor\n|-\n| 2000\n| ''Coffee & Donuts''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''[[Hatchet (film)|Hatchet]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2007\n| ''[[Spiral (2007 film)|Spiral]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| \n| \n| \n|\n|-\n| 2008\n| ''[[Gingerdead Man 2: Passion of the Crust]]''\n| \n| \n| \n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n| ''[[Grace (2009 film)|Grace]]''\n| \n| \n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2010\n| ''[[Frozen (2010 American film)|Frozen]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| \n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Hatchet II]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2011\n| ''[[Chillerama]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2013\n| ''[[Hatchet III]]''\n| \n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n| ''[[Digging Up the Marrow]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| also editor\n|-\n| 2015\n| ''[[Tales of Halloween]]''\n| \n| \n| \n| {{Yes}}\n| \n|-\n| 2017\n| ''[[Victor Crowley (film)|Victor Crowley]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| \n|-\n| 2018\n| ''For the Love of Halloween''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| also editor\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Television series ===\n* ''[[It's a Mall World]]'' (2007) short form mini-series, 13&nbsp;episodes\n* ''Winter Tales'' (2007) claymation mini-series, 5&nbsp;episodes\n* ''Cheerleader Camp'' (2007) half-hour comedy, pilot&nbsp;episode\n* ''Sexy Nightmare Slayers'' (2011) comedy, pilot&nbsp;episode\n* ''[[Holliston (TV series)|Holliston]]'' (2012-2013-2017)<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/fearnet-greenlights-first-original-series/38301 FearNet Greenlights First Original Series] ''Broadcasting & Cable August'' 8, 2011</ref> half-hour horror sitcom, 10+11+12&nbsp;episodes\n* ''Adam Green's Scary Sleepover'' (2015-2016-2017) biographical talk-show, 28&nbsp;episodes\n* ''Horrified'' (2015\u20132017) biographical talk-show, 44&nbsp;episodes\n\n=== Short films ===\n* ''A Voice Named Reason'' (1996)\n* ''Columbus Day Weekend'' (1998)\n* ''Stagefright'' (2000)\n* ''Oh, Sherrie'' (2001)\n* ''Steven's Room'' (2002)\n* ''The Real World Hollywood'' (2003)\n* ''Midnight'' (2004)\n* ''Trick or Treat'' (2005)\n* ''King in the Box'' (2006)\n* ''The Tiffany Problem'' (2007)\n* ''The Tivo'' (2008)\n* ''Fairy Tale Police'' (2008)\n* ''Saber'' (2009)\n* ''Jack Chop'' (2009)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34003/happy-halloween-ariescope-pictures-the-jack-chop|title=Happy Halloween from ArieScope Pictures: The Jack Chop}}</ref>\n* ''Just Take One'' (2010)\n* ''Anne Frankenstein'' (2011) <small>(segment from ''[[Chillerama]]'')</small>\n* ''Downloading and You'' (2011)\n* ''Driving Lessons'' (2012)\n* ''Halloween Hugs'' (2013)\n* ''Saber III'' (2014)\n* ''Turn Off Your Bloody Phone'' (2014)\n* ''Happy Halloween'' (2014)\n* ''Monster Problems'' (2015)\n* ''Don't Do It!''

Massachusetts]], Green earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Television and Film production at [[Hofstra University]] and founded ArieScope Pictures with fellow filmmaker [[Will Barratt]] in 1998.  Green was also the lead singer for the hard rock and metal band \"Haddonfield.\"\n\n== Background ==\n\nGreen was born and raised in Holliston, Massachusetts. After graduating from high school in 1993, he left for [[New York (state)|New York]] to study film and television production at [[Hofstra University]] graduating in 1997 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree. After studies, Green worked in [[Boston]] making local commercials for [[Time Warner Cable]], where he met his future collaborator Will Barratt. In 1998, together they founded production company [[ArieScope Pictures]] and the following year made their first feature-length film \u2013 semi-biographic comedy ''Coffee & Donuts'' {{small|([[Adam Green (filmmaker)#Coffee & Donuts|see subsection]])}}. Encouraged by friends and success in small film festivals, in 2000, Green packed his belongings and drove out to [[Hollywood]]. However, the film did not receive much attention and for a few years the new filmmaker was struggling with urban life and career. He worked as DJ at the [[Rainbow Bar & Grill]], while also undertaking various supporting roles in media industry. Green describes experience: \"The next three years saw loads of struggle and disappointment as I did every odd job I could score in Hollywood and waited for something to pan out with C&D.\" During that period the upcoming director wrote the original installment of what would become the ''Hatchet'' franchise and met his future wife [[Rileah Vanderbilt]].{{refn|name=CD}}\n\n== Feature film and television career ==\nSteadily working within a small group of friend-actors, Green self-produced most of his 2000s projects. By 2013, he had released two seasons of television sitcom ''Holliston'' together with seven theatrical feature films, including horror ''Hatchet'' (2006) and thriller ''Frozen'' (2010). Consequently, director became a member of the [[Splat Pack]], \u2013 group of filmmakers, who brought back gore and splatter, containing [[Eli Roth]], [[Alexandre Aja]], [[Neil Marshall]], [[Rob Zombie]], [[Greg McLean]], [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], and [[James Wan]].\n\n=== ''Coffee & Donuts'' ===\n''Coffee & Donuts'' (2000){{sup|unpublished}} is a semi-biographic lighthearted romantic comedy about two friends, Adam and Steve, who strive to launch their morning radio program of the small town, while Adam concurrently struggles to overcome breakup. Green made the feature film for only $400 using equipment from the cable advertising facility, that he was working for at the time, and employing volunteers for everything from cast to crew. Creator starred in the lead role, while other parts were played by Steven C. DeWitt Jr., Katie Bove and Jeff Davison. This amateur production has not been widely released.{{refn|name=CD}}\n\nIn 2003, [[Touchstone Pictures]] bought ''Coffee & Donuts'', hired Green as a writer and remade the film into a sitcom for [[UPN]]. The pilot episode, being produced by [[Tom Shadyac|Tom Shadyac's]] Shady Acres, was rejected and for the next five years, the rights remained with Touchstone. After regaining the rights in 2009, there were efforts to sell it to another network. However, the sitcom got canceled again. Eventually, the original concept was completely re-developed as ''Holliston'' and released by FEARnet {{small|([[Adam Green (filmmaker)#Holliston|see subsection]])}}. Green has since expressed his wish to independently distribute the original film, but also referred to issues such as the high price of clearing the soundtrack rights.{{refn|name=CD}}\n\n=== ''Hatchet'' ===\n''[[Hatchet (film)|Hatchet]]'' (2006) is the first feature of Green's successful franchise.{{refn|name=IndL|{{cite web|author1=Jack Foley|title=Hatchet-Review|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/hatchet-review|website=indielondon.co.uk|accessdate=April 28, 2015|date=}}}}{{refn|name=Trilogy|{{cite web|author1=Matt Molgaard |title=Analyzing the \u2018Hatchet\u2019 Trilogy |url=http://www.best-horror-movies.com/news?name=analyzing-the-hatchet-trilogy-asking-the-question-will-we-see-hatchet-4 |website=best-horror-movies.com |accessdate=April 28, 2015 |date=June 18, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000740/http://www.best-horror-movies.com/news?name=analyzing-the-hatchet-trilogy-asking-the-question-will-we-see-hatchet-4 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}}} The horror comedy, tributes old-school American slashers, and follows a group of tourists, who take a swamp boat ride and wind up pursued by the ghost of local legend Victor Crowley.

The parody \"Anne Frankenstein\" is shot in black and white and made entirely in German to look and feel like a lost 1940's foreign film. While Green cast authentic German speaking actors for all roles, the lead role of Adolf Hitler is portrayed by [[Joel David Moore]], who does not know how to speak German and purposely fakes his way through the film by using a combination of gibberish and random words thrown to him by Green, such as \"[[Boba Fett]]\", \"[[OshKosh B'Gosh]]\" and \"[[Goldie Hawn]]\". [[Kane Hodder]] portrays the film's hero Meshugannah \u2013 a Hassidic Jewish take on the classic Frankenstein Monster, who ultimately turns against his master and kills him.\n\n=== ''Holliston'' ===\nBased on Green's life and largely adapted from his romantic comedy ''Coffee & Donuts'', sitcom ''[[Holliston (TV series)|Holliston]]'' follows the lives of Adam (played by Green) and Joe (played by a fellow genre director and real-life best friend, Joe Lynch) \u2013 two aspiring horror filmmakers \u2013 living in the small town of Holliston, Massachusetts.

Green wrote and directed the six episodes comprising season one of this show, mixing comedy, horror, romance, and described by the network as \"''Big Bang Theory'' meets ''Evil Dead 2''\". The first season was filmed in September\u2013October 2011 and produced by ArieScope Pictures.

On July 24, 2017 it was announced that Green had made \"Haddonfield\" fully active once again and that the band had signed with \"Megadeth\" bassist David Ellefson's EMP Label Group who would be putting out the band's debut record \"Ghosts Of Salem\" in conjunction with Green's own imprint label ArieScope Records.  \"Ghosts Of Salem\" was released digitally worldwide on September 15, 2017 with the physical CD version and a limited edition vinyl version arriving in stores just one month later on October 13, 2017.  \"Haddonfield\" celebrated the album release with a performance at the Worcester Palladium in Worcester, MA on October 14, 2017 on a bill that also featured \"Ministry,\" Superjoint Ritual,\" \"Devil Driver,\" and \"Motionless In White.\"\n\nOn July 11, 2019 \"Haddonfield's\" bass player Chris Permatteo died from natural causes. When Adam Green addressed Permatteo's sudden and tragic death on The Movie Crypt podcast the following Monday, he stated that \"Haddonfield\" would not continue on and that he would never perform their songs on stage again.\n\n==Discography==\n*''Ghosts Of Salem'' (2017)\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n=== Feature films ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! colspan=\"4\" | Credited as\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! style=\"width:9em; font-size:90%\" | Director\n! style=\"width:9em; font-size:90%\" | Writer\n! style=\"width:9em; font-size:90%\" | Producer\n! style=\"width:9em; font-size:90%\" | Actor\n|-\n| 2000\n| ''Coffee & Donuts''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''[[Hatchet (film)|Hatchet]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2007\n| ''[[Spiral (2007 film)|Spiral]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| \n| \n| \n|\n|-\n| 2008\n| ''[[Gingerdead Man 2: Passion of the Crust]]''\n| \n| \n| \n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n| ''[[Grace (2009 film)|Grace]]''\n| \n| \n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2010\n| ''[[Frozen (2010 American film)|Frozen]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| \n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Hatchet II]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2011\n| ''[[Chillerama]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2013\n| ''[[Hatchet III]]''\n| \n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n|\n|-\n| 2014\n| ''[[Digging Up the Marrow]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| also editor\n|-\n| 2015\n| ''[[Tales of Halloween]]''\n| \n| \n| \n| {{Yes}}\n| \n|-\n| 2017\n| ''[[Victor Crowley (film)|Victor Crowley]]''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| \n|-\n| 2018\n| ''For the Love of Halloween''\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| {{Yes}}\n| also editor\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Television series ===\n* ''[[It's a Mall World]]'' (2007) short form mini-series, 13&nbsp;episodes\n* ''Winter Tales'' (2007) claymation mini-series, 5&nbsp;episodes\n* ''Cheerleader Camp'' (2007) half-hour comedy, pilot&nbsp;episode\n* ''Sexy Nightmare Slayers'' (2011) comedy, pilot&nbsp;episode\n* ''[[Holliston (TV series)|Holliston]]'' (2012-2013-2017)<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/fearnet-greenlights-first-original-series/38301 FearNet Greenlights First Original Series] ''Broadcasting & Cable August'' 8, 2011</ref> half-hour horror sitcom, 10+11+12&nbsp;episodes\n* ''Adam Green's Scary Sleepover'' (2015-2016-2017) biographical talk-show, 28&nbsp;episodes\n* ''Horrified'' (2015\u20132017) biographical talk-show, 44&nbsp;episodes\n\n=== Short films ===\n* ''A Voice Named Reason'' (1996)\n* ''Columbus Day Weekend'' (1998)\n* ''Stagefright'' (2000)\n* ''Oh, Sherrie'' (2001)\n* ''Steven's Room'' (2002)\n* ''The Real World Hollywood'' (2003)\n* ''Midnight'' (2004)\n* ''Trick or Treat'' (2005)\n* ''King in the Box'' (2006)\n* ''The Tiffany Problem'' (2007)\n* ''The Tivo'' (2008)\n* ''Fairy Tale Police'' (2008)\n* ''Saber'' (2009)\n* ''Jack Chop'' (2009)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34003/happy-halloween-ariescope-pictures-the-jack-chop|title=Happy Halloween from ArieScope Pictures: The Jack Chop}}</ref>\n* ''Just Take One'' (2010)\n* ''Anne Frankenstein'' (2011) <small>(segment from ''[[Chillerama]]'')</small>\n* ''Downloading and You'' (2011)\n* ''Driving Lessons'' (2012)\n* ''Halloween Hugs'' (2013)\n* ''Saber III'' (2014)\n* ''Turn Off Your Bloody Phone'' (2014)\n* ''Happy Halloween'' (2014)\n* ''Monster Problems'' (2015)\n* ''Don't Do It!''
