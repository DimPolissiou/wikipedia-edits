The [[Slieve Bloom Mountains]] are in the southern part of the county on the border with County Laois. Offaly has the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|24th highest county peak]] in Ireland. The highest point is [[Arderin]] ({{irish place name|Ard \u00c9ireann|}}) in the Slieve Blooms at {{convert|527|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The Slieve Bloom Mountains contain the county's highest points including [[Stillbrook Hill]] and [[Wolftrap Mountain]] which are the county's second and third highest peaks. [[Croghan Hill]] rises from the Bog of Allen and is located in northern Offaly. Although only 234 metres high, it is known for its view over the surrounding area and it stands out by itself.\n\nThe floodplain of the [[River Shannon]] is in the north-western part of the county. The [[River Camcor]] runs through the town of [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] and is a Wild Trout Conservation Area. The [[River Brosna]] runs across the county from [[Lough Owel]] in Westmeath to [[Shannon Harbour]]. [[Silver River (Ireland)|Silver River]] runs through several towns in the south of the county before joining [[River Brosna|Brosna]] near the town of [[Ferbane]]. The [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] also runs across the county from Edenderry on the north-east to Shannon Harbour before joining the [[River Shannon|Shannon]]. The county contains many small lakes from [[Lough Boora]] to [[Pallas Lough|Pallas Lake]] and it also contains 42 hectares of swamp land. There are a number [[Esker]]s in the counties landscape including [[Esker Riada]].\n\nOffaly largely comprises a flat landscape and is known for its extensive bog and peatlands. There are many large bogs in Offaly including the [[Bog of Allen]], [[Clara bog]], [[Boora bog]] and [[Raheenmore Bog]] which are spread out across the county with the Bog of Allen extending into four other counties. The county consists of approximately 42,000 hectares of peatlands which is 21% of Offaly's total land area.\n\nOffaly contains approximately {{convert|9000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of forest and woodland area, which only amounts to 4.5% of the county's land area.

It is today a significant tourist destination.\n\nThe county itself was formed following the [[Plantations of Ireland#Early Plantations (1556\u20131576)|Tudor plantations]] of Laois and Offaly in an attempt by the [[English Crown]] to expand its sphere of influence in Ireland which had declined following the [[Norman Conquest of Ireland]]. Both Laois (Leix) and Offaly (U\u00ed Failghe) were [[petty kingdom]]s in [[Gaelic Ireland]] located just outside the [[The Pale|Pale]] (a region around Dublin and the mid east of Ireland that remained loyal to the [[English Crown]] following the [[Norman Conquest]]). The older kingdoms of Leix and U\u00ed Failghe are not coterminous with the present day counties that were formed. The [[Kingdom of U\u00ed Failghe]] from which the name '''Offaly''' is derived, was ruled by the '''\u00d3 Conchobhair Failghe''' (anglicised as: O'Conor Faly) whose territory extended from the east of the county into north Kildare. The Kingdom of Firceall ruled by the '''O'Molloy''' clan constituted much of the centre of the county. The Kingdom of [[Firceall]] was part of the [[Kingdom of Meath]] while U\u00ed Failghe was part of the [[Kingdom of Leinster]]. Much of the south of the present day county (as well as northern [[County Tipperary]]) was ruled by '''\u00d3 Cearbhaill of [[\u00c9ile]]''' (anglicised as: O'Carroll Ely). Ely formed part of the [[Kingdom of Munster]].  These [[petty kingdom]]s were swept aside by the [[Plantations of Ireland#Early Plantations (1556\u20131576)|Tudor plantations]]. In 1556, an Act of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] created \"King's County\", named after [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], the then [[king of Ireland]].<ref>3 & 4 Phil & Mar, c.2 (1556)</ref> This replaced the old Kingdoms with [[Baronies of Ireland|Baronies]] and the present day County System.\n\nDespite the county's name being upheld as Offaly through the 2001 Local Government Act, no legislation was ever enacted after independence explicitly changing the name from King's County, the name formally established under the 1898 Local Government Act which continued to have legal effect. Legal transfers and assignments of [[Real property|land]] in the county still refer to it as \"King's County\".\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[File:Birr Castle, Offaly.jpg|right|thumb|[[Birr Castle]]]]\n[[File:Sunrise- 60 Degrees, Sky Train, December 28,2008 lo res.jpg|thumb|[[Sculpture in the Parklands|Sculpture Park]] at [[Boora Bog|Lough Boora]]]]\n* [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] in the south of the county is best known for its castle and gardens.

The population increased by 11.3% between 2002 and 2006 which was a greater rate than the national average rate of 8.2%. This may be attributed to the county's proximity to the [[Greater Dublin Area]], increased accessibility to [[Dublin]] ([[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6]], [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]], and improved rail services) and lower house prices than in Dublin.<ref name=\"DC\"/>\n\nThe population of many towns rose during the period 1996 to 2006: Birr +21.5%, Tullamore +28.8% and Edenderry +53.9%. The population of [[Portarlington, County Laois|Portarlington]] increased by 50.1% between 2002 and 2006.<ref name=\"DC\"/>\n\nThe population as of census 2016 was 77,961 people with 34.7% (27,085 people) under the age of 25 and 13.6% (10,951 people) over the age of 65.<ref name=cso2016/>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Bord na Mona - \"The Bog Train\" - At Edenderry, Co. Offaly, Ireland (14225837858).jpg|thumb|Commercial [[peat]] extraction was traditionally the largest industry in the county]]\nTraditionally, agriculture and industry have been the main driving force of the economy in the county. Offaly has extensive bogland, particularly in the northern parts of the county, that forms part of the [[Bog of Allen]]. [[Bord na M\u00f3na]] was founded in 1946 and provided employment to hundreds of people in Offaly by making peat briquettes (for home domestic use) and supplying peat to power stations operated by [[ESB Group|ESB]]. Peat briquettes are currently made at the Bord na M\u00f3na factory at Derrinlough near Birr. Power stations are operating at [[Shannonbridge]] and Edenderry. With the continuing depletion of the bogs a number of power stations have closed down in recent years. The ESB power station at Lumcloon, [[Ferbane]] was a major employer in the midlands but closed in 2001. [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]] power station closed down soon afterwards. These were major landmarks in Offaly with large [[cooling tower]]s that were visible for miles around Offaly and beyond, but were demolished soon after the stations closed. Many bogs are now used as wildlife reserves or for tourism activities such as Lough Boora.\n\nThe opening of the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] in the 18th century brought prosperity to towns such as [[Banagher]] and [[Tullamore]]. Both towns were important stops on the [[Dublin]] to [[Limerick]] navigation which supported a number of industries and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the county in that era.\n\nThe [[Celtic Tiger]] also brought an increase in economic activity to Offaly with business enterprise and industrial parks opening in Birr, Edenderry and [[Tullamore]]. Many people particularly in the east of the county are within an easy commuting distance to [[Dublin]] where many find employment.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Transport===\n====Rail====\n[[File:Clara Station - geograph.org.uk - 2236128.jpg|thumb|right|[[Clara railway station]]]]\nOffaly is well served by rail transport. Railway stations are located at [[Tullamore railway station|Tullamore]] and [[Clara railway station|Clara]]. Both stations are on the main [[Dublin-Westport/Galway railway line]] with regular trains serving the area especially for [[Dublin]] commuters. [[Portarlington railway station]] is located just over the [[County Laois]] border and is in a catchment area for the south east of the county. Portarlington railway station is on the main [[Dublin-Cork railway line]] with regular commuter services to [[Heuston Station]], Dublin and intercity services to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Killarney]] & [[Tralee]].\n\nThe [[Limerick-Ballybrophy railway line]] travels through the south of the county however there are no railway stations on the line in County Offaly. The nearest stations are located at [[Cloughjordan railway station|Cloughjordan]] and [[Roscrea railway station|Roscrea]] both just outside the county boundary. A railway line from Birr connected to the line at Roscrea until it was closed in the 1960s. A controversial railway line also connected Birr to [[Portumna]] between 1868 and 1878, and became something of a folk legend.\n\n====Road====\n[[File:OffalyRoadMap.png|thumb|right|Road network of Offaly]]\nThree main national secondary routes pass through the county. The [[N52 road (Ireland)|N52 road]] passes from [[Kilbeggan]] to Tullamore and Birr which then continues to [[Nenagh]] where it intersects with the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]]. The [[N62 road (Ireland)|N62]] from [[Athlone]] passes through [[Ferbane]] and Birr and continues onto [[Roscrea]] and [[Thurles]]. The [[N80 road (Ireland)|N80]] route starts in Tullamore and continues to the south east passing through [[Portlaoise]] and [[Carlow]]. There are no main national primary routes in the county, however, the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6]] skirts the county to the north and the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]] skirts the county to the south through [[Moneygall]]. Road infrastructure has improved with the completion of the Tullamore bypass in 2009 and improved access to regional cities following completion of the intercity motorway network.\n\n====Bus====\n[[Bus \u00c9ireann]] provide public transport services throughout the county with regular bus services to [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] from Athlone bus station. Other private bus coach services provide direct bus services from Birr to [[Dublin]] such as Kearns bus service who run several services daily. Slieve Bloom Coaches run services from Tullamore and Portarlington to Dublin.\n[[File:Ballycommon Radio Mast Offaly.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Radio transmitter in [[Ballycommon]]]]\n====Waterway====\nThe [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] connecting Dublin to the river Shannon was constructed through the towns of Edenderry and Tullamore and joins the Shannon at [[Shannon Harbour]]. Traditionally this was an important route for transport, communication and trade between Dublin, Limerick and the midlands of Ireland. The route fell into decline as road transport became more popular. Much of the route is now used for [[boating]] and leisure activities.\n\n===Media===\n====Radio====\n[[Midlands 103]] (originally Midlands Radio 3) which broadcasts to Laois, Offaly and Westmeath is based in Tullamore and has studios across the midlands. \nRT\u00c9's [[medium wave transmitter]] broadcasting [[RT\u00c9 Radio 1]] was also located in Tullamore but transmission stopped in 2008.\n\n====Print====\nA number of local newspapers are published in Offaly. The [[Offaly Independent]] and Tullamore Tribune are based in Tullamore. The Midland Tribune based in Birr covers local news in the west and south of the county as well as parts of northern Tipperary including the towns of Birr, [[Roscrea]] and [[Nenagh]] and surrounding areas. The [[Offaly Express]] was a former newspaper based in Tullamore. It closed down in July 2012 after 29 years in operation. It is now an on line news platform for the county at www.offalyexpress.ie [http://www.offalyexpress.ie]\n\n==Sport==\n===GAA===\n[[File:Seir Kieran, Offaly JHC champions 1937 and IHC champions 1938.png|thumb|right|[[Seir Kieran GAA]] [[hurling|hurlers]], 1938]]\n[[Gaelic games]] are popular in the county. [[Offaly GAA]] consists of some 44 clubs playing [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] in communities throughout the county. [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] is generally considered a hurling stronghold with [[Birr GAA]] winning four [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]]s. County teams have also had national success in both hurling and football, winning the [[Liam MacCarthy Cup]] four times and the [[Sam Maguire Cup]] three times. The football team is perhaps best known for the [[Seamus Darby]] goal in the \ndying minutes of the [[1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1982 football final]] when Offaly took the title by one point denying [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] an historic five All-Ireland titles in a row. \nTraditionally, west Offaly has been the hurling stronghold with clubs like [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]], [[Coolderry]], And [[Kilcormac/Killoughey]] enjoying success in the [[Leinster]] and All-Ireland Championships\n\nFamous hurlers from Offaly include:\n*Brian Whelahan, [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]\n*The Dooley Brothers, [[Clareen]]\n*Brian Carroll, [[Coolderry]]\n*Rory Hanniffy, [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]\n*Shane Dooley, [[Tullamore]]\n*Michael Duignan, [[Banagher]]\n[[File:Shane Lowry 8107.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[2019 Open Championship]] winner [[Shane Lowry (golfer)|Shane Lowry]]]]\nFamous Footballers from Offaly include:\n*Matt Conor, [[Walsh Island]]\n*Richie Conor, [[Walsh Island]]\n*Ciar\u00e1n McManus, [[Tubber, County Offaly|Tubber]]\n*Niall McNamee, [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]]\n*Martin Furlong, [[Tullamore]]\n*Seamus Darby, [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]]\n*Mick Brady, [[Edenderry]]\n*Finbarr Cullen, [[Edenderry]]\n\n===Association football===\n[[Tullamore Town F.C.]] play at [[Leah Victoria Park]].

Offaly borders seven counties: [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Roscommon|Roscommon]], [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], [[County Laois|Laois]], [[County Westmeath|Westmeath]], [[County Kildare|Kildare]] and [[County Meath|Meath]]. The [[Slieve Bloom Mountains]] are in the southern part of the county on the border with County Laois. Offaly has the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|24th highest county peak]] in Ireland. The highest point is [[Arderin]] ({{irish place name|Ard \u00c9ireann|}}) in the Slieve Blooms at {{convert|527|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The Slieve Bloom Mountains contain the county's highest points including [[Stillbrook Hill]] and [[Wolftrap Mountain]] which are the county's second and third highest peaks. [[Croghan Hill]] rises from the Bog of Allen and is located in northern Offaly. Although only 234 metres high, it is known for its view over the surrounding area and it stands out by itself.\n\nThe floodplain of the [[River Shannon]] is in the north-western part of the county. The [[River Camcor]] runs through the town of [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] and is a Wild Trout Conservation Area. The [[River Brosna]] runs across the county from [[Lough Owel]] in Westmeath to [[Shannon Harbour]]. [[Silver River (Ireland)|Silver River]] runs through several towns in the south of the county before joining [[River Brosna|Brosna]] near the town of [[Ferbane]]. The [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] also runs across the county from Edenderry on the north-east to Shannon Harbour before joining the [[River Shannon|Shannon]]. The county contains many small lakes from [[Lough Boora]] to [[Pallas Lough|Pallas Lake]] and it also contains 42 hectares of swamp land. There are a number [[Esker]]s in the counties landscape including [[Esker Riada]].\n\nOffaly largely comprises a flat landscape and is known for its extensive bog and peatlands. There are many large bogs in Offaly including the [[Bog of Allen]], [[Clara bog]], [[Boora bog]] and [[Raheenmore Bog]] which are spread out across the county with the Bog of Allen extending into four other counties. The county consists of approximately 42,000 hectares of peatlands which is 21% of Offaly's total land area.\n\nOffaly contains approximately {{convert|9000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of forest and woodland area, which only amounts to 4.5% of the county's land area. This includes woodlands within the Slieve Blooms and the Lough Boora Parklands. Roughly 75% of Offaly's forested area is [[Pinophyta|Conifer High Forest]].\n\n===Baronies===\n[[File:Baronies of Offaly.jpg|300px|thumb|Baronies of Offaly]]\nThe following are the historical baronies of County Offaly:\n*[[Ballyboy (barony)|Ballyboy]]\n*[[Ballybrit]]\n*[[Ballycowan (barony)|Ballycowan]]\n*[[Clonlisk]]\n*[[Coolestown]]\n*[[Eglish (barony)|Eglish]]\n*[[Garrycastle]]\n*[[Geashill (barony)|Geashill]]\n*[[Kilcoursey]]\n*[[Lower Philipstown]]\n*[[Upper Philipstown]]\n*[[Warrenstown]]\n\n=== Towns and villages ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Ballinagar]]\n* [[Ballyboy]]\n* [[Ballycumber]]\n* [[Banagher]]\n* [[Belmont, County Offaly|Belmont]]\n* [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]\n* [[Bracknagh]]\n* [[Cadamstown]]\n* [[Clara, County Offaly|Clara]]\n* [[Clareen]]\n* [[Cloghan, County Offaly|Cloghan]]\n* [[Clonygowan]]\n* [[Clonbullogue]]\n* [[Clonmacnoise]]\n* [[Coolderry]]\n* [[Crinkill]]\n* [[Croghan (village), County Offaly|Croghan]]\n* [[Daingean]]\n* [[Dunkerrin]]\n* [[Edenderry]]\n* [[Ferbane]]\n* [[Geashill]]\n* [[Horseleap]]\n* [[Kilcormac]]\n* [[Killeigh]]\n* [[Killoughey]]\n* [[Kinnitty]]\n* [[Lusmagh]]\n* [[Moneygall]]\n* [[Mountbolus]]\n* [[Mucklagh]]\n* [[Pullough]]\n* [[Portarlington, County Laois|Portarlington]]\n* [[Rahan, County Offaly|Rahan]]\n* [[Rath, County Offaly|Rath]]\n* [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]]\n* [[Shannonbridge]]\n* [[Shannon Harbour]]\n* [[Shinrone]]\n* [[Tullamore]]\n* [[Tubber, County Offaly|Tubber]]\n* [[Walsh Island]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Local government and politics==\n[[Offaly County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county.

It is today a significant tourist destination.\n\nThe county itself was formed following the [[Plantations of Ireland#Early Plantations (1556\u20131576)|Tudor plantations]] of Laois and Offaly in an attempt by the [[English Crown]] to expand its sphere of influence in Ireland which had declined following the [[Norman Conquest of Ireland]]. Both Laois (Leix) and Offaly (U\u00ed Failghe) were [[petty kingdom]]s in [[Gaelic Ireland]] located just outside the [[The Pale|Pale]] (a region around Dublin and the mid east of Ireland that remained loyal to the [[English Crown]] following the [[Norman Conquest]]). The older kingdoms of Leix and U\u00ed Failghe are not coterminous with the present day counties that were formed. The [[Kingdom of U\u00ed Failghe]] from which the name '''Offaly''' is derived, was ruled by the '''\u00d3 Conchobhair Failghe''' (anglicised as: O'Conor Faly) whose territory extended from the east of the county into north Kildare. The Kingdom of Firceall ruled by the '''O'Molloy''' clan constituted much of the centre of the county. The Kingdom of [[Firceall]] was part of the [[Kingdom of Meath]] while U\u00ed Failghe was part of the [[Kingdom of Leinster]]. Much of the south of the present day county (as well as northern [[County Tipperary]]) was ruled by '''\u00d3 Cearbhaill of [[\u00c9ile]]''' (anglicised as: O'Carroll Ely). Ely formed part of the [[Kingdom of Munster]].  These [[petty kingdom]]s were swept aside by the [[Plantations of Ireland#Early Plantations (1556\u20131576)|Tudor plantations]]. In 1556, an Act of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] created \"King's County\", named after [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], the then [[king of Ireland]].<ref>3 & 4 Phil & Mar, c.2 (1556)</ref> This replaced the old Kingdoms with [[Baronies of Ireland|Baronies]] and the present day County System.\n\nDespite the county's name being upheld as Offaly through the 2001 Local Government Act, no legislation was ever enacted after independence explicitly changing the name from King's County, the name formally established under the 1898 Local Government Act which continued to have legal effect. Legal transfers and assignments of [[Real property|land]] in the county still refer to it as \"King's County\".\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[File:Birr Castle, Offaly.jpg|right|thumb|[[Birr Castle]]]]\n[[File:Sunrise- 60 Degrees, Sky Train, December 28,2008 lo res.jpg|thumb|[[Sculpture in the Parklands|Sculpture Park]] at [[Boora Bog|Lough Boora]]]]\n* [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] in the south of the county is best known for its castle and gardens.

The population of [[Portarlington, County Laois|Portarlington]] increased by 50.1% between 2002 and 2006.<ref name=\"DC\"/>\n\nThe population as of census 2016 was 77,961 people with 34.7% (27,085 people) under the age of 25 and 13.6% (10,951 people) over the age of 65.<ref name=cso2016/>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Bord na Mona - \"The Bog Train\" - At Edenderry, Co. Offaly, Ireland (14225837858).jpg|thumb|Commercial [[peat]] extraction was traditionally the largest industry in the county]]\nTraditionally, agriculture and industry have been the main driving force of the economy in the county. Offaly has extensive bogland, particularly in the northern parts of the county, that forms part of the [[Bog of Allen]]. [[Bord na M\u00f3na]] was founded in 1946 and provided employment to hundreds of people in Offaly by making peat briquettes (for home domestic use) and supplying peat to power stations operated by [[ESB Group|ESB]]. Peat briquettes are currently made at the Bord na M\u00f3na factory at Derrinlough near Birr. Power stations are operating at [[Shannonbridge]] and Edenderry. With the continuing depletion of the bogs a number of power stations have closed down in recent years. The ESB power station at Lumcloon, [[Ferbane]] was a major employer in the midlands but closed in 2001. [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]] power station closed down soon afterwards. These were major landmarks in Offaly with large [[cooling tower]]s that were visible for miles around Offaly and beyond, but were demolished soon after the stations closed. Many bogs are now used as wildlife reserves or for tourism activities such as Lough Boora.\n\nThe opening of the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] in the 18th century brought prosperity to towns such as [[Banagher]] and [[Tullamore]]. Both towns were important stops on the [[Dublin]] to [[Limerick]] navigation which supported a number of industries and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the county in that era.\n\nThe [[Celtic Tiger]] also brought an increase in economic activity to Offaly with business enterprise and industrial parks opening in Birr, Edenderry and [[Tullamore]]. Many people particularly in the east of the county are within an easy commuting distance to [[Dublin]] where many find employment.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Transport===\n====Rail====\n[[File:Clara Station - geograph.org.uk - 2236128.jpg|thumb|right|[[Clara railway station]]]]\nOffaly is well served by rail transport. Railway stations are located at [[Tullamore railway station|Tullamore]] and [[Clara railway station|Clara]]. Both stations are on the main [[Dublin-Westport/Galway railway line]] with regular trains serving the area especially for [[Dublin]] commuters. [[Portarlington railway station]] is located just over the [[County Laois]] border and is in a catchment area for the south east of the county. Portarlington railway station is on the main [[Dublin-Cork railway line]] with regular commuter services to [[Heuston Station]], Dublin and intercity services to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Killarney]] & [[Tralee]].\n\nThe [[Limerick-Ballybrophy railway line]] travels through the south of the county however there are no railway stations on the line in County Offaly. The nearest stations are located at [[Cloughjordan railway station|Cloughjordan]] and [[Roscrea railway station|Roscrea]] both just outside the county boundary. A railway line from Birr connected to the line at Roscrea until it was closed in the 1960s. A controversial railway line also connected Birr to [[Portumna]] between 1868 and 1878, and became something of a folk legend.\n\n====Road====\n[[File:OffalyRoadMap.png|thumb|right|Road network of Offaly]]\nThree main national secondary routes pass through the county. The [[N52 road (Ireland)|N52 road]] passes from [[Kilbeggan]] to Tullamore and Birr which then continues to [[Nenagh]] where it intersects with the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]]. The [[N62 road (Ireland)|N62]] from [[Athlone]] passes through [[Ferbane]] and Birr and continues onto [[Roscrea]] and [[Thurles]]. The [[N80 road (Ireland)|N80]] route starts in Tullamore and continues to the south east passing through [[Portlaoise]] and [[Carlow]]. There are no main national primary routes in the county, however, the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6]] skirts the county to the north and the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]] skirts the county to the south through [[Moneygall]]. Road infrastructure has improved with the completion of the Tullamore bypass in 2009 and improved access to regional cities following completion of the intercity motorway network.\n\n====Bus====\n[[Bus \u00c9ireann]] provide public transport services throughout the county with regular bus services to [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] from Athlone bus station. Other private bus coach services provide direct bus services from Birr to [[Dublin]] such as Kearns bus service who run several services daily. Slieve Bloom Coaches run services from Tullamore and Portarlington to Dublin.\n[[File:Ballycommon Radio Mast Offaly.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Radio transmitter in [[Ballycommon]]]]\n====Waterway====\nThe [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] connecting Dublin to the river Shannon was constructed through the towns of Edenderry and Tullamore and joins the Shannon at [[Shannon Harbour]]. Traditionally this was an important route for transport, communication and trade between Dublin, Limerick and the midlands of Ireland. The route fell into decline as road transport became more popular. Much of the route is now used for [[boating]] and leisure activities.\n\n===Media===\n====Radio====\n[[Midlands 103]] (originally Midlands Radio 3) which broadcasts to Laois, Offaly and Westmeath is based in Tullamore and has studios across the midlands. \nRT\u00c9's [[medium wave transmitter]] broadcasting [[RT\u00c9 Radio 1]] was also located in Tullamore but transmission stopped in 2008.\n\n====Print====\nA number of local newspapers are published in Offaly. The [[Offaly Independent]] and Tullamore Tribune are based in Tullamore. The Midland Tribune based in Birr covers local news in the west and south of the county as well as parts of northern Tipperary including the towns of Birr, [[Roscrea]] and [[Nenagh]] and surrounding areas. The [[Offaly Express]] was a former newspaper based in Tullamore. It closed down in July 2012 after 29 years in operation. It is now an on line news platform for the county at www.offalyexpress.ie [http://www.offalyexpress.ie]\n\n==Sport==\n===GAA===\n[[File:Seir Kieran, Offaly JHC champions 1937 and IHC champions 1938.png|thumb|right|[[Seir Kieran GAA]] [[hurling|hurlers]], 1938]]\n[[Gaelic games]] are popular in the county. [[Offaly GAA]] consists of some 44 clubs playing [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] in communities throughout the county. [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] is generally considered a hurling stronghold with [[Birr GAA]] winning four [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]]s. County teams have also had national success in both hurling and football, winning the [[Liam MacCarthy Cup]] four times and the [[Sam Maguire Cup]] three times. The football team is perhaps best known for the [[Seamus Darby]] goal in the \ndying minutes of the [[1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1982 football final]] when Offaly took the title by one point denying [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] an historic five All-Ireland titles in a row. \nTraditionally, west Offaly has been the hurling stronghold with clubs like [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]], [[Coolderry]], And [[Kilcormac/Killoughey]] enjoying success in the [[Leinster]] and All-Ireland Championships\n\nFamous hurlers from Offaly include:\n*Brian Whelahan, [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]\n*The Dooley Brothers, [[Clareen]]\n*Brian Carroll, [[Coolderry]]\n*Rory Hanniffy, [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]\n*Shane Dooley, [[Tullamore]]\n*Michael Duignan, [[Banagher]]\n[[File:Shane Lowry 8107.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[2019 Open Championship]] winner [[Shane Lowry (golfer)|Shane Lowry]]]]\nFamous Footballers from Offaly include:\n*Matt Conor, [[Walsh Island]]\n*Richie Conor, [[Walsh Island]]\n*Ciar\u00e1n McManus, [[Tubber, County Offaly|Tubber]]\n*Niall McNamee, [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]]\n*Martin Furlong, [[Tullamore]]\n*Seamus Darby, [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]]\n*Mick Brady, [[Edenderry]]\n*Finbarr Cullen, [[Edenderry]]\n\n===Association football===\n[[Tullamore Town F.C.]] play at [[Leah Victoria Park]].

Birr Golf Club and Esker Hills Golf Club near Tullamore are popular. Irish golfer [[Shane Lowry (golfer)|Shane Lowry]] is a member of Esker Hills. He is from the town of Clara outside Tullamore.  As an amateur, he won the 2009 Irish Open. In 2019, Lowry won The Open Championship in Royal Portrush Golf Club, becoming the first Offaly man to win one of the golfing majors.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Tullamore_DEW_and_Rocks_Tumbler.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Tullamore Dew]], the second best-selling global brand of [[Irish whiskey]]]]\n===People===\n*[[George Brent]], Hollywood actor\n*[[Ged Corcoran]], Irish [[rugby league]] footballer\n*[[Brian Cowen]], former [[Taoiseach]], born in Clara, 10 January 1960 and now living on the outskirts of Tullamore\n*[[Neil Delamere]], comedian\n*[[Barry Glendenning]], journalist\n*[[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]], Hollywood [[silent film]] director, born in [[Dublin]] but lived in [[Kinnitty]]\n*[[John Joly]], scientist, born at [[Bracknagh]] in 1857\n*[[Shane Lowry (golfer)|Shane Lowry]], golfer\n*[[Mundy]], musician\n*[[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|William Parsons]], 3rd [[Earl of Rosse]], astronomer; also the father of [[Charles Algernon Parsons]] who invented the [[steam turbine]]. \n*[[George Johnstone Stoney]] (1826 - 1911) Physicist.

[[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] played Victoria at the MCG in August of that year, on their way to Great Britain for what became known as the [[1908\u201309 Australia rugby union tour of Britain|First Wallabies Tour]].\n\nOf the seven clubs comprising the new Union in 1909, Melbourne, East Melbourne, South Melbourne and University were the first to compete for the [[Dewar Shield]], a trophy which is still awarded today to the premier first grade team. Competition ceased during the First World War and recommenced under a re-established VRU in 1926.\n\nThe subsequent decade later became known as the Golden Years of Victorian Rugby and included the selection of the first Victorian-born player to represent Australia, [[Edward Dunlop|Sir Edward \"Weary\" Dunlop]], in 1932.

That's a lot cheaper than Apple's entry-level iPad Mini 2, with a 7.9 inch screen and $269 price tag.\n-->\n\nForrester says its definition of tablets \"is relatively narrow\" while IDC says it includes some tablets by Amazon \u2014 but not all.[..]\n<!--\nThis year e-tailer Amazon turned a lot of heads by drastically lowering the price of tablets, offering the 7-inch Fire for $49.99. In its roster of holiday best sellers, Amazon said this Fire was its best-selling tablet in December.\n\nFor consumers, buying a new tablet was \"an impulse purchase,\" says Doherty. If your kid sits on the tablet and breaks it, you wouldn\u2019t dream of getting it fixed \u2014 they\u2019re so cheap, you just buy a new one.\"\n-->\n\nThe top tech purchase of the year continued to be the smartphone, with an expected 1.5 billion sold worldwide, according to projections from researcher IDC. Last year saw some 1.2 billion sold.[..]\n\nComputers didn\u2019t fare as well, despite the introduction of Microsoft's latest software upgrade, Windows 10, and the expected but not realized bump it would provide for consumers looking to skip the upgrade and just get a new computer instead.\n\nSome 281 million PCs were expected to be sold, according to IDC, down from 308 million in 2014. Folks tend to be happy with the older computers and keep them for longer, as more of our daily computing activities have moved to the smartphone.[..]\n\nWhile Windows 10 got good reviews from tech critics, only 11% of the 1-billion-plus Windows user base opted to do the upgrade, according to Microsoft. This suggests Microsoft has a ways to go before the software gets \"hit\" status.

other desktop operating systems (not just to mobile) with the slide very noticeable in the US, where macOS usage has more than tripled from 2009 to 2017, with Windows down to 72.76% and Chrome OS at

shipments of desktop and laptop computers. Gartner publishes estimates, but the way the estimates are calculated is not openly published. Another source of market share of various operating systems is [[StatCounter]]<ref>https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201508-201508-bar StatCounter</ref> basing its estimate on web use (although this may not be [[Usage share of web browsers#Accuracy|very accurate]]). Also, sales may overstate usage. Most computers are sold with a [[Pre-installed software|pre-installed operating system]], with some users replacing that OS with a different one due to personal preference, or installing another OS alongside it and using both. Conversely, sales underestimate usage by not counting unauthorized copies. For example, in 2009, approximately 80% of software sold in China consisted of illegitimate copies.<ref>{{cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/business/global/19iht-windows.html|title= Software Pirates in China Beat Microsoft to the Punch | work= The New York Times | date=19 October 2009}}</ref> In 2007, the statistics from an automated update of IE7 for registered Windows computers differed with the observed web browser share, leading one writer to estimate that 25\u201335% of all Windows&nbsp;XP installations were unlicensed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|title=Around 25\u201335% of Windows XP systems are pirated (calculations included)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063513/http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe usage share of Microsoft's latest client operating system{{snd}} [[Windows&nbsp;10]]{{snd}} has been slowly increasing since July/August 2016 (while [[Windows&nbsp;7]] has had a slight decrease at the same time), reaching around 27.15% in December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-weekly-201406-201641|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201511-201610|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWeb analysis shows significant variation in different parts of the world.

In its roster of holiday best sellers, Amazon said this Fire was its best-selling tablet in December.\n\nFor consumers, buying a new tablet was \"an impulse purchase,\" says Doherty. If your kid sits on the tablet and breaks it, you wouldn\u2019t dream of getting it fixed \u2014 they\u2019re so cheap, you just buy a new one.\"\n-->\n\nThe top tech purchase of the year continued to be the smartphone, with an expected 1.5 billion sold worldwide, according to projections from researcher IDC. Last year saw some 1.2 billion sold.[..]\n\nComputers didn\u2019t fare as well, despite the introduction of Microsoft's latest software upgrade, Windows 10, and the expected but not realized bump it would provide for consumers looking to skip the upgrade and just get a new computer instead.\n\nSome 281 million PCs were expected to be sold, according to IDC, down from 308 million in 2014.

other desktop operating systems (not just to mobile) with the slide very noticeable in the US, where macOS usage has more than tripled from 2009 to 2017, with Windows down to 72.76% and Chrome OS at 3.33%, plus traditional Linux at 1.46%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america/#monthly-200901-201905|title=Desktop Operating System Market

shipments of desktop and laptop computers. Gartner publishes estimates, but the way the estimates are calculated is not openly published. Another source of market share of various operating systems is [[StatCounter]]<ref>https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201508-201508-bar StatCounter</ref> basing its estimate on web use (although this may not be [[Usage share of web browsers#Accuracy|very accurate]]). Also, sales may overstate usage. Most computers are sold with a [[Pre-installed software|pre-installed operating system]], with some users replacing that OS with a different one due to personal preference, or installing another OS alongside it and using both. Conversely, sales underestimate usage by not counting unauthorized copies. For example, in 2009, approximately 80% of software sold in China consisted of illegitimate copies.<ref>{{cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/business/global/19iht-windows.html|title= Software Pirates in China Beat Microsoft to the Punch | work= The New York Times | date=19 October 2009}}</ref> In 2007, the statistics from an automated update of IE7 for registered Windows computers differed with the observed web browser share, leading one writer to estimate that 25\u201335% of all Windows&nbsp;XP installations were unlicensed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|title=Around 25\u201335% of Windows XP systems are pirated (calculations included)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063513/http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe usage share of Microsoft's latest client operating system{{snd}} [[Windows&nbsp;10]]{{snd}} has been slowly increasing since July/August 2016 (while [[Windows&nbsp;7]] has had a slight decrease at the same time), reaching around 27.15% in December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-weekly-201406-201641|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201511-201610|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWeb analysis shows significant variation in different parts of the world.
