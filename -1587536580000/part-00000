It designed as a conventional small car to help Reliant move away from purely three wheeler production. It was considered a rival to the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] [[Mini]] and [[Hillman Imp]].\n\nIt was marketed as the smart alternative, because it had a rust-free glass-fibre body, a robust chassis and frugal fuel economy.

Williams, the founder of Reliant. Wiggin believed that people in the future would be less likely to drive three-wheeled vehicles, such as Reliant's [[Reliant Regal|Regal]], so Reliant engineers, after working on the development of the four-wheeled Sabra Carmel with [[Autocars Co.|Autocars]] of Haifa, Israel<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Complete Catalog of British Cars 1895-1975.|last=Culshaw|first=David|last2=Horribin|first2=Peter|publisher=Veloce Publishing PLC|year=1997|isbn=9781874105930|location=Dorchester, England, UK|pages=241}}</ref> decided to modify the then-current Regal 3/25 to create a four-wheel vehicle.\n\nThey built a rolling chassis, using many parts from other countries, with a conventional front engine, steering and suspension. But they felt that Reliant's 598cc engine wouldn't pull the weight of a finished car. Consequently, the engineers skimmed the cylinder head and fitted larger valves, giving it better [[torque]] to cope with the car's extra weight. The engine was specific to the Rebel.\n\nReliant asked [[Ogle Design]] to design the Rebel, with the idea that it should look completely different from the Regal, but should save production costs by retaining some of the Regal's parts, such as its doors and windscreen. The resulting car was 138 in. (3505&nbsp;mm) in length, 58 in. (1473&nbsp;mm) in width, and had an 89 in. (2261&nbsp;mm) wheelbase.

These vehicles were only produced in two production batches in the Tamworth factory in November/December totaling in only around 100 original Rebel built. These vehicles are mostly seen as pre-production as they were built for dealer demonstrations only and the specification changed between each vehicle as the factory tested different fabrics and materials for the interior. The main differences in these early models were the interior which used the dashboard and steering wheel from the regal 3/25, bonnet hinges hidden in the body work, the spare wheel that was fitted under the bonnet and the interior having minimal carpeting and black gel coat.\n\nRebel prototypes had a larger front grille, after testing it was found to make the cars run too cool so on early cars the grille was not cut out of the molding leaving a \"dummy grille\" as some people call it.\n\n==600==\n\nOnly 6 months later after the Rebel's launch in 1965, Reliant relaunched the Rebel but calling it the Rebel Deluxe (but never actually using this name again). The car was updated with a new dashboard design using different instruments, thicker seats for greater comfort and five leaf springs in the rear instead of seven for a softer ride. The top half of the grill was deleted completely and filled in smooth, orange front indicators replaced the original clear units and a unique steering wheel was added. This model in later years was simply named the Rebel 600.\n\n==700==\n\nThe Rebel 700, introduced in October 1967,<ref name=\":0\" /> had several major changes from the 600, including a full chassis redesign using stronger steel and construction, a new engine of 701cc, a move to negative earth and many other specification changes. At the Earl's Court Motor Show the estate model was shown for the first time and also announced it was on sale now. The estate used longer rear windows and a large side hinged rear door. Combined with the new fold-flat rear seat this made the Rebel estate incredibly practical, and within two years it was the best-selling model.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later, side windows that slid open could be ordered. In 1971, a van version of the Rebel was introduced after many Rebel estate buyers' enquiries. The van model was basically the estate but without windows.

The Rebel 1600 GT was a working road legal prototype and had it been given the go-ahead would have been launched in around 1968, but was never put into production as Reliant Management found out the Rebel 1600 GT could not only out perform the bigger Scimitar models (around the factory as Engineers had been racing them), but also reputedly featured a power-to-weight ratio of 204&nbsp;bhp per ton which would have exceeded that of many modern sportscars.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Reliant}}\n\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1964]]\n[[Category:Reliant vehicles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2017}}\n{{Distinguish|AMC Rebel}}{{More citations needed|date=October 2018}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image        = Reliant Rebel 700 WPC 92G - 1969 (5675362439).jpg\n| caption = Rebel registered January 1969\n|name         = Reliant Rebel\n|manufacturer =[[Reliant]]\n|production   =1964\u20131974<br>2600 made\n|class        =\n|body_style   =2-door [[sedan (car)|saloon]]<br>2-door [[estate car]]<br>van\n|successor    =[[Reliant Kitten]]\n| transmission = 4 speed manual\n| length = {{convert|138|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} \n| width = {{convert|58|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}    \n| height = {{convert|55.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}    \n| wheelbase = {{convert|89|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <ref name=DlyExpressLonMoShoRev1966>{{cite book |last=Cardew|first=Basil |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Daily Express Review of the 1966 Motor Show|year=1966 |publisher=Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd |location=London |id=}}</ref>\n| track = \n| related = [[Reliant Regal]]\n|weight       = 538.8\u2013-603.3 kg\n|engine       = 598 cc/700 cc/748 cc [[Straight-4]] \n|designer     =\n}}\n\nThe '''Reliant Rebel''' is a small four-wheeled car that was produced by [[Reliant]] between 1964 and 1974.

Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, [[industrial accident]]s, [[oil spills]], [[terrorist attacks]], \n[[nuclear explosion]]s/[[nuclear radiation]]. [[War]] and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category.\n\nOther types of induced disasters include the more cosmic scenarios of catastrophic [[global warming]], [[nuclear war]], and [[bioterrorism]].\n\nOne opinion argues that all disasters can be seen as human-made, due to human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.<ref name=atrisk>Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis & Ben Wisner.

''The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld''. New York: Basic Books, 2002, p.104.</ref> Its nine block area was centered on a three block stretch of Pacific Street, now Pacific Avenue, between Montgomery and Stockton Streets. Pacific Street was the first street to cut through the hills of San Francisco, starting near [[Portsmouth Square]] and continuing east to the first shipping docks at Buena Vista Cove.\n\nThe Barbary Coast was born during the [[California Gold Rush|California Gold Rush of 1849]], when the population of San Francisco was growing at an exponential rate due to the rapid influx of tens of thousands of miners trying to find gold.  The early decades of the Barbary Coast would be marred by persistent lawlessness, [[gambling]], administrative graft, [[Frontier justice|vigilante justice]], and [[prostitution]];<ref name=\"auto6\"/> however with the passage of time the city's government would gain strength and competence, and the Barbary Coast's maturing entertainment scene of [[dance hall]]s and [[jazz]] clubs would influence American culture.<ref name=\"auto12\"/> The Barbary Coast's century-long evolution would pass through many substantial incarnations due to the city's rapid cultural development during the transition to the 20th century. Its former location is now overlapped by [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], and [[Jackson Square, San Francisco|Jackson Square]].\n\n== Gold Rush and a first decade ==\n[[Image:SanFrancisco1851a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Portsmouth Square]], looking north to [[Telegraph Hill, San Francisco|Telegraph Hill]], 1851.]]\nSan Francisco's Barbary Coast arose from the massive infusion of treasure hunters, called [[Gold Rush of 1849#Forty-niners|''49-ers'']], seeking their fortunes by panning for gold as they searched for a potential gold mine.\n\n=== Gold Rush of 1849 ===\n{{Main|Gold Rush of 1849}}\nBefore the [[Gold Rush of 1849]] there were only a few hundred people living in tents and wooden shanties within [[San Francisco]]. However, after the gold rush the population of San Francisco would increase fifty-fold in just two years\u2014from 492 in 1847 to over 25,000 in 1849.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |title=San Francisco Population |accessdate=February 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004055802/http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }} ''San Francisco Population'', SFgenealogy, 2014, p. 1</ref> That extreme growth combined with a lack of strong government would create many opportunities for criminals, corrupt politicians, and brothel owners.<ref name=\"auto\">Secrest, William: Dark and Tangled Threads of Crime \u2013 San Francisco's Famous Police Detective, Isaiah W. Lees, Quill Driver Books, 2004, p. 153</ref> For many decades murderers and robbers could commit their crimes without punishment, sometimes boldly in public view. As a result, the Barbary Coast became a wild area representative of the [[Old west|Old West]], and had many problems with political corruption, gambling, crime, and violence.\n\nAround 1848 a group of volunteers from the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] were eventually discharged and settled in San Francisco.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 40</ref> Many of them were from [[New York City]] gangs from the [[Five Points, Manhattan|Five Points]] and [[Bowery]] districts. About sixty of them organized into a gang called the ''Hounds'', paraded around as if they were military, and even creating a headquarters named Tammany Hall within a tent on Kearney Street.<ref name=\"auto1\">Lukas 2010, p. 239</ref> In 1849, these thugs began to call themselves the ''Regulators'' as they harassed Mexicans and those of Spanish origin, and extorted money from local businesses for protection services.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Anyone who would not pay was likely to lose a nose, ear, or suffer greater bodily injury. However, after a group of 230 men organized into a militia and confronted the Hounds with possible arrest, they quickly fled from San Francisco.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 43</ref>\n\n=== Sydney Town ===\nThe Hounds was not the only group of criminals to set up business on San Francisco's Barbary Coast. By the end of 1849, several ships from [[Australia]] brought former members of [[Great Britain]]'s penal colony \u2013 including ex-convicts, [[ticket of leave|ticket-of-leave]] men, and criminals \u2013 to San Francisco, where they would become known as the ''[[Sydney Ducks]]''.<ref name=\"auto2\">Montanarelli 2005, p. 92</ref> These Australian immigrants had become so numerous that they dominated the neighborhood.<ref name=\"auto3\">Asbury 1933, p. 111</ref> They opened boarding houses and various types of groggeries which had prostitutes affiliated with their businesses.<ref name=\"auto4\">Pryor 2002, p. 61</ref> People who entered these groggeries and brothels were frequently later beaten and robbed.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nA newspaper of the day, the [[San Francisco Herald]], states of Sydney Town:\n\n<blockquote>The upper part of Pacific Street, after dark, is crowded by thieves, gamblers, low women, drunken sailors, and similar characters...  Unsuspecting sailors and miners are entrapped by the dexterous thieves and swindlers that are always on the lookout, into these dens, where they are filled with liquor \u2013 drugged if necessary, until insensibility coming upon them, they fall an easy victim to their tempters... When the habitues of this quarter have a reason to believe a man has money, they will follow him for days, and employ every device to get him into their clutches... These dance-groggeries are outrageous nuisances and nurseries of crime.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 51</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen looting San Francisco's neighborhoods, the Sydney Ducks even set fire to San Francisco six times between 1849 and 1851 in order to distract citizens from their pillaging and murdering.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Whenever they planned to start a fire, they waited for south westerly winds so that Sydney Town would not also catch fire. The citizens of San Francisco became enraged and in 1851 they formed a first Vigilance Committee.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 73</ref> Two of the Sydney Ducks, Samuel Whittaker and Robert McKenzie, were then arrested for arson, robbery, and burglary. The vigilantes then held a quick trial, and later hanged them.<ref>Pryor 2002, p. 64</ref> [[Vigilante]]s, unauthorized individuals who use trials and lynchings to punish criminals, were not uncommon in the [[Old west|Old West]] but San Francisco's Vigilance Committees were the largest and most organized of America's history.<ref>Benson, Michael: Inside Secret Societies \u2013 What They Don't Want You to Know, Citadel Press Books, 2005, p. 223</ref> The hangings scared the remaining Sydney Ducks into fleeing the city. Within two weeks after the hangings, Sydney Town had but only a few dance halls, saloons, and brothels remaining.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 74</ref> That relative peace would only last for two years before criminals started to once again return to the Barbary Coast.<ref name=\"auto5\">Lukas 2010, p. 241</ref>\n\n=== More vigilante justice ===\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, San Francisco saw administrative graft, boss politics, and a persistent lawlessness.<ref name=\"auto6\">Boyd 1997, p. 77</ref> For a while after the hangings of Whittaker and McKenzie, San Francisco functioned as a law-abiding city.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 75</ref> The hangings frightened corrupt judges and government officials, who then began to do their duties with a rare diligence, not seen so far in San Francisco. This new competency in government would not last long, and by 1852 corrupt government officials developed a system of high salaries and expensive projects with political kickbacks that would drain the city's treasury to near bankruptcy.<ref name=\"auto7\">Asbury 1933, p. 76</ref> This financial crisis at city hall would create a great strain on commerce and also affect individual businesses.\n\nThe looting of the city's treasury could not have happened without the help of the most powerful man in San Francisco, [[David Broderick]], who was a state senator and held tight control over San Francisco from 1851 until his death in 1859.<ref name=\"auto7\"/> Broderick's corruption was such that no man could be elected to public office unless he made a deal with Broderick to share half the profits from his office.<ref name=\"auto8\">Asbury 1933, p. 77</ref> As a result of these backroom deals, Broderick accumulated a large amount of wealth which further strengthened his position as a powerful city boss. As news of the treasury's financial crisis became known, another even larger uprising of enraged citizenry would occur.<ref name=\"auto8\"/>\n\nJames King, a popular journalist and publisher, vehemently protested the administrative graft of Broderick which angered one of Broderick's biggest supporters, a supervisor named James Casey. While King was standing in front of his newspaper's building Casey shot King in the chest, causing a mortal wound which would ultimately launch the formation of a second Vigilance Committee in May 1856.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Within two hours after Casey's shooting of King, a mob of 10,000 people surrounded the jail where Casey was being held.<ref>Asbury 1933, pp. 86 - 87</ref> The vigilantes then demanded that the jail release James Casey into their custody, and the badly out-numbered jail guards acquiesced to their demands.<ref>Asbury 1933, pp. 90-91</ref> King died six days after being shot, and subsequently Casey was put on trial by the Vigilance Committee. King's funeral attracted over 15,000 people, but by the time the funeral had ended Casey had already been convicted and hanged by the vigilantes.<ref name=\"auto9\">Asbury 1933, pp. 92-93</ref> Now energized by wide public support, the Vigilance Committee set up shop in a large building near the wharf which included jail cells, court rooms, a surrounding wall to resist any military intervention, and was nicknamed Fort Gunnybags.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> During the two months that followed the hanging of Casey there was not a single murder in San Francisco, and less than a half dozen robberies.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 96</ref> In August 1856 the vigilance committee decided to disband and give control back to the elected officials.\n\n== District defined ==\nIt was not until the 1860s when sailors gave the district its name, and began to refer to it as the ''Barbary Coast''.<ref>Barker, Malcolm: More San Francisco Memoirs,1852-1899  \u2013 The Ripening Years, Londonborn Publications, 1996, p. 46</ref> The term \"Barbary Coast' is borrowed from the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary Coast of North Africa]] where [[Barbary pirates|local pirates]] and [[Slavery on the Barbary Coast|slave traders]] launched raids on nearby coastal towns and vessels. That African region was also notorious for the same kind of predatory [[Dive bar|dives]] which would target sailors, as had been done on San Francisco's Barbary Coast.<ref>WPA Guide 2011, p. 214</ref> Miners, sailors, and sojourners hungry for female companionship and bawdy entertainment continued to stream into San Francisco in the 1850s and 1860s, becoming the Barbary Coast's primary clientele. During its early days [[San Francisco]] had become a \"wide\" open city where police had little to no control in stopping the activities of gambling, drinking, drugs, drag, and [[prostitution]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|title=Sexing the city: The sexual production of non-heterosexual space in Belfast, Manchester and San Francisco|journal=City|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=205\u2013218|doi=10.1080/1360481022000011155|year=2002}}</ref> The fact that [[San Francisco]] functioned as a port city meant that it was able to sustain large transient populations that were less likely to conform to social rules and regulations. \n  \n{{quote|The Barbary Coast is the haunt of the low and the vile of every kind.

At that time Police Chief Crowley said in his annual report that there was only one officer for every 1,445 inhabitants, while [[New York City]] had one in 464 and [[London]] had one for every 303 residents.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nEntertaining the miners, entrepreneurs, and sailors would be a huge business and resulted in varied, inventive, and occasionally bizarre forms of entertainment.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> Except for a couple of restaurants, that three block stretch of Pacific Street was almost wall to wall with drinking establishments.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 104</ref> They included dance halls, concert saloons which had entertainment and dancing, melodeons, cheap groggeries, and ''deadfalls'' which were dismal beer and wine dens. Initially the melodeons had mechanical [[Pump organ|reed organs]] which played music, however they quickly transformed into a kind of [[cabaret]] which had theatrical entertainment but no dance floor.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 105</ref> The only women allowed in the melodeons were the waitresses and performers. Their shows usually contained songs, bawdy skits, and often featured [[can-can]] dancers. The deadfalls were the lowest of the establishments and had hard benches, damp sawdust on the floors, the bar was rough boards laid atop of barrels, had no entertainment, and their wine was often raw alcohol with an added coloring.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 284</ref>\n\nThe ''Coast'' as it was called, also invented its own kind of dance hall, called a [[Taxi dance hall#Barbary Coast dance hall|Barbary Coast Dance Hall]].<ref>Cressey 1932, p.179</ref> It was different than most dance halls in that the only women there were the female employees who were paid to dance with the customers, and received commissions on the drinks that they could encourage their male customers to buy. Lawlessness was so bad in the Barbary Coast district that police did not patrol alone, but chose to walk their beats in pairs and sometimes in groups. There was usually a murder every night and scores of robberies.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 106</ref> And even while inside drinking establishments, a customer's property and life were still never safe.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Prostitution was so common on the Barbary Coast that it was referred to as ''the Paris of America''. Drug addicts of the district could even buy [[cocaine]] or [[morphine]] at an all night [[Grant Avenue|Grant Street]] drugstore for only two or three times the price of a beer.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 121</ref> During the 1890s, San Francisco hit its peak alcohol consumption in having over 3000 licensed bars, and another 2000 unlicensed bars.<ref>Lukas 2010, p. 242</ref>\n\nThe waitresses were a major attraction for the saloons and were nicknamed the ''pretty waiter girls'', though they were not always attractive or young.<ref>Montanarelli 2005, p. 105</ref> They were scantily clothed in gaudy outfits while they sold drinks and danced with customers for money.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 107</ref> The saloons hired women to exploit the men, instructed to pick customers' pockets and then give half that money back to the management.<ref name=\"auto11\">Boyd 1997, p. 78</ref> The pretty waiter girls earned about $20 per week plus a commission on any drinks and dances that they sold. Small grog houses and deadfalls hired only handful of pretty waiter girls, but the larger dance halls and concert saloons employed up to fifty women.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> However some of the concert saloons, like the Eureka and Bella Union, made an effort to have notable Barbary Coast performers appear in their shows and actually had attractive women for their pretty waiter girls.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 122</ref>\n\nIt was not unusual for the pretty waiter girls to put drugs into the customers' drinks, so they could later be more easily robbed and sometimes clubbed unconscious.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Sailors, who were frequently the targets of the pretty waiter girls, had cause to dread the area because the art of [[shanghaiing]] was perfected here. Many a sailor woke up after a night's leave to find himself unexpectedly on another ship bound for some faraway port. The verb to \"[[Shanghaiing|shanghai]]\" was first coined on the Barbary Coast.<ref>Asbury 1933, p.199</ref>\n\n=== After the 1906 earthquake ===\n{{Main|Terrific Street}}\nMost of the buildings on that stretch of Pacific Street were destroyed by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake and fire of 1906]]. However the city's financial boosters then saw an opportunity to clean up the tone of the Barbary Coast, and transform it into an entertainment area which would be acceptable for every-day San Franciscans. Possessing a new sense of civic pride, the boosters invested heavily in reconstruction and within three months over a dozen dance halls and a dozen bars were rebuilt and operating.<ref name=\"auto12\">Boyd 1997, p. 79</ref> This new incarnation of Pacific Street would be gentrified and tame compared to the lawless pre-earthquake version of the Barbary Coast.<ref>Montanarelli 2005, p. 111</ref> However prostitution still persisted in the district and it was not until 1917 that [[Mayor James Rudolf]] made a declaration that he would close every brothel in San Francisco.<ref>Asbury 1933, p.309</ref> Same-sex [[Prostitution]] and entertainment which featured [[female impersonators]] briefly existed in a bar on the Barbary Coast as early as the spring of 1908 when ''The Dash'' opened on Pacific Street. The Dash employed some female impersonators, and patrons could purchase homosexual sex in its booths.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 283</ref> The Dash closed near the end of that same year.\n\nThe thriving district also got a new nickname, ''Terrific Street''. The term \"Terrific Street\" was first used by musicians in describing the quality of music at the Pacific Street clubs, and indeed the first [[jazz]] clubs of San Francisco would occur on Terrific Street and attract national talents like [[Sophie Tucker]], Sid LeProtti, and [[Jelly Roll Morton]].<ref name=\"auto13\">Fleming, E.J.: Carole Landis \u2013 A Tragic Life in Hollywood, McFarland & Company, 2005, p. 20</ref> It was at this time that the Barbary Coast gained a wider appeal and its large dance halls drew tremendous crowds.<ref name=\"auto12\"/>\n\nThe principal attraction of Terrific Street was dancing and many nationally known dance steps like the [[Texas Tommy (dance)|Texas Tommy]] and the [[Turkey trot (dance)|Turkey Trot]], would be invented on Terrific Street.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 287</ref> At night, its brightly lit block could be seen from across the bay in Oakland despite the fact that neon lights had not yet been invented.<ref name=\"auto13\"/>\n\n=== Demise ===\nAn extreme shift in political policy came about in 1911 when a new mayor, [[James Rolph|James \"Sunny Jim\" Rolph]], was elected to the first of ten terms. Rolph, along with a new group of city supervisors and the business sector, was committed to reforming the Barbary Coast district.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 299</ref> Just before election time in September 1913, [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s newspaper the [[The San Francisco Examiner|''Examiner'']], started a major crusade against the Barbary Coast and in a full page editorial suggested that it \"should be wiped out.\"<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 302</ref>\n\nTen days later the Police Commission adopted resolutions that no dancing would be allowed in any establishment of the district which served alcohol, that no women \u2013 employees or patrons \u2013 would be permitted in any saloon of the district, and that even electric signs would be forbidden.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 303</ref> As a result, some drinking establishments fired their female employees and became ''straight saloons'', while others closed their businesses. Some of the larger dance halls moved to other districts and managed to survive for several more years by masquerading as dance academies or [[Taxi dance hall#Closed dance hall|''closed dance halls'']], but they never regained their previous popularity.<ref>Cressey 1932, p. 181</ref><ref>WPA Guide 2011, p. 216</ref> In 1917 the brothels were eventually closed down due to the [[Red Light Abatement Act]], but by that time all the excitement of Terrific Street had long since vanished.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 307</ref> Following the Red Light Abatement Act, prostitution zones and prostitutes were forced to outskirt areas such as the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]] and [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] as shopping centers took over.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wide-Open Town: a history of queer San Francisco to 1965|last=Boyd|first=Nan Alamilla|publisher=Univ of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520244740|location=|pages=25\u201362|quote=|via=Google Scholar}}</ref>\n\n== Later eras of the Pacific Street District ==\n\n=== International Settlement ===\n[[Image:International_Settlement_1940s_San_Francisco_Pacific_Street_FaceWest_Crp1.jpg    |upright=1.2|thumb|International Settlement, 1940s, Pacific Street <br>from Montgomery Street towards Kearney Street. <br>(San Francisco History Center, [[San Francisco Public Library]])]]\n{{Main|International Settlement (San Francisco)}}\nWhen [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was adopted in 1920 and stopped the flow of alcohol to the bars, Terrific Street's block lost much excitement and its dance halls and concert saloons were gradually replaced by offices, hotels, and warehouses. However, after Prohibition was repealed in 1933 and liquor was again available, an attempt was made to revive its entertainment scene. The police commission quashed these efforts when, on February 27, 1934, it announced that no dance permits for the area would be issued. This action followed \"the withdrawal by the California state board of equalization of state liquor permits for the district.\" Protests by women's groups and church organizations influenced these decisions.<ref>Associated Press, \"Dull Future Faced By BarBary Coast\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 28 February 1934, Volume 40, page 3.</ref>  Still later, during World War II, in an attempt to revitalize the district, it was renamed [[International Settlement (San Francisco)|International Settlement]], and a pair of large promotional arched overhead signs,<ref>[http://sflib1.sfpl.org:82/search?/dDistricts+--+International+Settlement./ddistricts+international+settlement/-3,-1,0,E/2exact&FF=ddistricts+international+settlement&1,6, Districts -- International Settlement. -- Historical Photographs - SF Public Library]</ref> which read, ''International Settlement'', were constructed on either end of that Pacific Street block.<ref>[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v470/bananaphone5000/GoGoGorilla5/SF-1-24-43-InternationalSettlement.jpg SF-1-24-43-InternationalSettlement.jpg]</ref> In the same way that the post-Barbary Coast establishments of Terrific Street attempted to draw customers and tourists with a reference to the Coast's nefarious past before the earthquake, International Settlement also tried to also draw tourists with a reference to that lost era.\n\n=== The Broadway Scene ===\n[[File:Oscar Peterson - 1950.JPG|upright|thumb|Jazz pianist, composer, and vocalist <br>Oscar Peterson]]\n{{Main|North Beach, San Francisco}}\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, the entertainment scene and dancing would spread one block north to Broadway, which is parallel to Pacific Street.

The early decades of the Barbary Coast would be marred by persistent lawlessness, [[gambling]], administrative graft, [[Frontier justice|vigilante justice]], and [[prostitution]];<ref name=\"auto6\"/> however with the passage of time the city's government would gain strength and competence, and the Barbary Coast's maturing entertainment scene of [[dance hall]]s and [[jazz]] clubs would influence American culture.<ref name=\"auto12\"/> The Barbary Coast's century-long evolution would pass through many substantial incarnations due to the city's rapid cultural development during the transition to the 20th century.

At that time Police Chief Crowley said in his annual report that there was only one officer for every 1,445 inhabitants, while [[New York City]] had one in 464 and [[London]] had one for every 303 residents.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nEntertaining the miners, entrepreneurs, and sailors would be a huge business and resulted in varied, inventive, and occasionally bizarre forms of entertainment.<ref name=\"auto6\"/> Except for a couple of restaurants, that three block stretch of Pacific Street was almost wall to wall with drinking establishments.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 104</ref> They included dance halls, concert saloons which had entertainment and dancing, melodeons, cheap groggeries, and ''deadfalls'' which were dismal beer and wine dens. Initially the melodeons had mechanical [[Pump organ|reed organs]] which played music, however they quickly transformed into a kind of [[cabaret]] which had theatrical entertainment but no dance floor.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 105</ref> The only women allowed in the melodeons were the waitresses and performers. Their shows usually contained songs, bawdy skits, and often featured [[can-can]] dancers. The deadfalls were the lowest of the establishments and had hard benches, damp sawdust on the floors, the bar was rough boards laid atop of barrels, had no entertainment, and their wine was often raw alcohol with an added coloring.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 284</ref>\n\nThe ''Coast'' as it was called, also invented its own kind of dance hall, called a [[Taxi dance hall#Barbary Coast dance hall|Barbary Coast Dance Hall]].<ref>Cressey 1932, p.179</ref> It was different than most dance halls in that the only women there were the female employees who were paid to dance with the customers, and received commissions on the drinks that they could encourage their male customers to buy. Lawlessness was so bad in the Barbary Coast district that police did not patrol alone, but chose to walk their beats in pairs and sometimes in groups. There was usually a murder every night and scores of robberies.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 106</ref> And even while inside drinking establishments, a customer's property and life were still never safe.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Prostitution was so common on the Barbary Coast that it was referred to as ''the Paris of America''. Drug addicts of the district could even buy [[cocaine]] or [[morphine]] at an all night [[Grant Avenue|Grant Street]] drugstore for only two or three times the price of a beer.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 121</ref> During the 1890s, San Francisco hit its peak alcohol consumption in having over 3000 licensed bars, and another 2000 unlicensed bars.<ref>Lukas 2010, p. 242</ref>\n\nThe waitresses were a major attraction for the saloons and were nicknamed the ''pretty waiter girls'', though they were not always attractive or young.<ref>Montanarelli 2005, p. 105</ref> They were scantily clothed in gaudy outfits while they sold drinks and danced with customers for money.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 107</ref> The saloons hired women to exploit the men, instructed to pick customers' pockets and then give half that money back to the management.<ref name=\"auto11\">Boyd 1997, p. 78</ref> The pretty waiter girls earned about $20 per week plus a commission on any drinks and dances that they sold. Small grog houses and deadfalls hired only handful of pretty waiter girls, but the larger dance halls and concert saloons employed up to fifty women.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> However some of the concert saloons, like the Eureka and Bella Union, made an effort to have notable Barbary Coast performers appear in their shows and actually had attractive women for their pretty waiter girls.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 122</ref>\n\nIt was not unusual for the pretty waiter girls to put drugs into the customers' drinks, so they could later be more easily robbed and sometimes clubbed unconscious.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Sailors, who were frequently the targets of the pretty waiter girls, had cause to dread the area because the art of [[shanghaiing]] was perfected here. Many a sailor woke up after a night's leave to find himself unexpectedly on another ship bound for some faraway port. The verb to \"[[Shanghaiing|shanghai]]\" was first coined on the Barbary Coast.<ref>Asbury 1933, p.199</ref>\n\n=== After the 1906 earthquake ===\n{{Main|Terrific Street}}\nMost of the buildings on that stretch of Pacific Street were destroyed by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake and fire of 1906]]. However the city's financial boosters then saw an opportunity to clean up the tone of the Barbary Coast, and transform it into an entertainment area which would be acceptable for every-day San Franciscans. Possessing a new sense of civic pride, the boosters invested heavily in reconstruction and within three months over a dozen dance halls and a dozen bars were rebuilt and operating.<ref name=\"auto12\">Boyd 1997, p. 79</ref> This new incarnation of Pacific Street would be gentrified and tame compared to the lawless pre-earthquake version of the Barbary Coast.<ref>Montanarelli 2005, p. 111</ref> However prostitution still persisted in the district and it was not until 1917 that Mayor James Rudolf made a declaration that he would close every brothel in San Francisco.<ref>Asbury 1933, p.309</ref> Same-sex [[Prostitution]] and entertainment which featured [[female impersonators]] briefly existed in a bar on the Barbary Coast as early as the spring of 1908 when ''The Dash'' opened on Pacific Street. The Dash employed some female impersonators, and patrons could purchase homosexual sex in its booths.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 283</ref> The Dash closed near the end of that same year.\n\nThe thriving district also got a new nickname, ''Terrific Street''. The term \"Terrific Street\" was first used by musicians in describing the quality of music at the Pacific Street clubs, and indeed the first [[jazz]] clubs of San Francisco would occur on Terrific Street and attract national talents like [[Sophie Tucker]], Sid LeProtti, and [[Jelly Roll Morton]].<ref name=\"auto13\">Fleming, E.J.: Carole Landis \u2013 A Tragic Life in Hollywood, McFarland & Company, 2005, p. 20</ref> It was at this time that the Barbary Coast gained a wider appeal and its large dance halls drew tremendous crowds.<ref name=\"auto12\"/>\n\nThe principal attraction of Terrific Street was dancing and many nationally known dance steps like the [[Texas Tommy (dance)|Texas Tommy]] and the [[Turkey trot (dance)|Turkey Trot]], would be invented on Terrific Street.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 287</ref> At night, its brightly lit block could be seen from across the bay in Oakland despite the fact that neon lights had not yet been invented.<ref name=\"auto13\"/>\n\n=== Demise ===\nAn extreme shift in political policy came about in 1911 when a new mayor, [[James Rolph|James \"Sunny Jim\" Rolph]], was elected to the first of ten terms. Rolph, along with a new group of city supervisors and the business sector, was committed to reforming the Barbary Coast district.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 299</ref> Just before election time in September 1913, [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s newspaper the [[The San Francisco Examiner|''Examiner'']], started a major crusade against the Barbary Coast and in a full page editorial suggested that it \"should be wiped out.\"<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 302</ref>\n\nTen days later the Police Commission adopted resolutions that no dancing would be allowed in any establishment of the district which served alcohol, that no women \u2013 employees or patrons \u2013 would be permitted in any saloon of the district, and that even electric signs would be forbidden.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 303</ref> As a result, some drinking establishments fired their female employees and became ''straight saloons'', while others closed their businesses. Some of the larger dance halls moved to other districts and managed to survive for several more years by masquerading as dance academies or [[Taxi dance hall#Closed dance hall|''closed dance halls'']], but they never regained their previous popularity.<ref>Cressey 1932, p. 181</ref><ref>WPA Guide 2011, p. 216</ref> In 1917 the brothels were eventually closed down due to the [[Red Light Abatement Act]], but by that time all the excitement of Terrific Street had long since vanished.<ref>Asbury 1933, p. 307</ref> Following the Red Light Abatement Act, prostitution zones and prostitutes were forced to outskirt areas such as the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]] and [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] as shopping centers took over.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wide-Open Town: a history of queer San Francisco to 1965|last=Boyd|first=Nan Alamilla|publisher=Univ of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520244740|location=|pages=25\u201362|quote=|via=Google Scholar}}</ref>\n\n== Later eras of the Pacific Street District ==\n\n=== International Settlement ===\n[[Image:International_Settlement_1940s_San_Francisco_Pacific_Street_FaceWest_Crp1.jpg    |upright=1.2|thumb|International Settlement, 1940s, Pacific Street <br>from Montgomery Street towards Kearney Street. <br>(San Francisco History Center, [[San Francisco Public Library]])]]\n{{Main|International Settlement (San Francisco)}}\nWhen [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] was adopted in 1920 and stopped the flow of alcohol to the bars, Terrific Street's block lost much excitement and its dance halls and concert saloons were gradually replaced by offices, hotels, and warehouses. However, after Prohibition was repealed in 1933 and liquor was again available, an attempt was made to revive its entertainment scene. The police commission quashed these efforts when, on February 27, 1934, it announced that no dance permits for the area would be issued. This action followed \"the withdrawal by the California state board of equalization of state liquor permits for the district.\" Protests by women's groups and church organizations influenced these decisions.<ref>Associated Press, \"Dull Future Faced By BarBary Coast\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 28 February 1934, Volume 40, page 3.</ref>  Still later, during World War II, in an attempt to revitalize the district, it was renamed [[International Settlement (San Francisco)|International Settlement]], and a pair of large promotional arched overhead signs,<ref>[http://sflib1.sfpl.org:82/search?/dDistricts+--+International+Settlement./ddistricts+international+settlement/-3,-1,0,E/2exact&FF=ddistricts+international+settlement&1,6, Districts -- International Settlement. -- Historical Photographs - SF Public Library]</ref> which read, ''International Settlement'', were constructed on either end of that Pacific Street block.<ref>[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v470/bananaphone5000/GoGoGorilla5/SF-1-24-43-InternationalSettlement.jpg SF-1-24-43-InternationalSettlement.jpg]</ref> In the same way that the post-Barbary Coast establishments of Terrific Street attempted to draw customers and tourists with a reference to the Coast's nefarious past before the earthquake, International Settlement also tried to also draw tourists with a reference to that lost era.\n\n=== The Broadway Scene ===\n[[File:Oscar Peterson - 1950.JPG|upright|thumb|Jazz pianist, composer, and vocalist <br>Oscar Peterson]]\n{{Main|North Beach, San Francisco}}\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, the entertainment scene and dancing would spread one block north to Broadway, which is parallel to Pacific Street.

{"title_page": "Ring announcer", "text_new": "{{short description|Sport announcer}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2017}}\nA '''ring announcer''' is an in-ring (and sometimes on-camera) employee or contractor for a [[boxing]], [[professional wrestling]] or [[mixed martial arts]] event or promotion, who introduces the competitors to the audience.\n\nIn boxing and mixed martial arts bouts, introductions occur after both fighters have entered the ring or cage. Along with each fighter's name, the announcer typically also announces their height, weight, town, nickname, win/loss record and any current or past titles the fighter has won. In MMA, the fighting discipline is usually announced. In professional wrestling, wrestlers are similarly introduced, though usually before or as they come to the ring (the weight of each female wrestler is unannounced in most promotions). In-ring introductions are sometimes used for title matches or other major bouts, to add a \"big fight feel\".\n\nThe ring announcer often states the rules of the match. In boxing and MMA, this is usually limited to the number of scheduled rounds and the length of each round. In professional wrestling, the [[Professional wrestling match types|variations are much more numerous]] and so the announcer may have to explain significantly more to the audience.\n\nWhen an MMA or boxing bout concludes, the ring announcer announces the winner, time of finish and method. If the fight lasts all scheduled rounds, the announcer will read the fight judges' scorecard totals, before announcing a unanimous, majority, or split decision victory for one of the fighters, or a draw.

Along with each fighter's name, the announcer typically also announces their height, weight, town, nickname, win/loss record and any current or past titles the fighter has won. In MMA, the fighting discipline is usually announced. In professional wrestling, wrestlers are similarly introduced, though usually before or as they come to the ring (the weight of each female wrestler is unannounced in most promotions). In-ring introductions are sometimes used for title matches or other major bouts, to add a \"big fight feel\".\n\nThe ring announcer often states the rules of the match. In boxing and MMA, this is usually limited to the number of scheduled rounds and the length of each round. In professional wrestling, the [[Professional wrestling match types|variations are much more numerous]] and so the announcer may have to explain significantly more to the audience.\n\nWhen an MMA or boxing bout concludes, the ring announcer announces the winner, time of finish and method. If the fight lasts all scheduled rounds, the announcer will read the fight judges' scorecard totals, before announcing a unanimous, majority, or split decision victory for one of the fighters, or a draw. This is typically done from inside the ring or cage.\n\nIn professional wrestling, the announcement is usually performed outside the ring, and typically doesn't mention the time or method of victory; however, as professional wrestling shows do incorporate an official timekeeper at ringside, much like boxing and MMA, some ring announcers may be informed of the time of the fall at the match's conclusion and will relay that information to the audience as well.\n\nEven further to this, some professional wrestling matches will stipulate a time limit, the confines within which a wrestler must win if he wishes to avoid a time-limit draw.

A team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at [[Cardiff University]] used modern computer [[x-ray]] [[tomography]] and high resolution surface scanning to image inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine.\n\nDetailed imaging of the mechanism suggests that it had 37 gear wheels enabling it to follow the movements of the Moon and the Sun through the zodiac, to predict eclipses and even to model the [[Lunar month#Anomalistic month|irregular orbit of the Moon]], where the Moon's velocity is higher in its [[Apsis|perigee than in its apogee]]. This motion was studied in the 2nd century BC by astronomer [[Hipparchus]] of [[Rhodes]], and it is speculated that he may have been consulted in the machine's construction.<ref name=sample-06/>\n\nThe knowledge of this technology was lost at some point in [[Late Antiquity|antiquity]].

Other fragments may still be in storage, undiscovered since their initial recovery; Fragment F came to light in that way in 2005. Of the 82 known fragments, seven are mechanically significant and contain the majority of the mechanism and inscriptions. There are also 16 smaller parts that contain fractional and incomplete inscriptions.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=wright-07/>\n\n===Major fragments===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Fragment\n!Size [mm]\n!Weight [g]\n!Gears\n!Inscriptions\n!Notes\n|- align=center\n| A ||180&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;150 ||369.1 ||27 ||Yes\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | The main fragment contains the majority of the known mechanism. Clearly visible on the front is the large b1 gear, and under closer inspection further gears behind said gear (parts of the l, m, c, and d trains are clearly visible as gears to the naked eye). The crank mechanism socket and the side-mounted gear that meshes with b1 is on ''Fragment A''. The back of the fragment contains the rearmost e and k gears for synthesis of the moon anomaly, noticeable also is the pin and slot mechanism of the k train. It is noticed from detailed scans of the fragment that all gears are very closely packed and have sustained damage and displacement due to their years in the sea. The fragment is approximately 30&nbsp;mm thick at its thickest point.\n\nFragment A also contains divisions of the upper left quarter of the Saros spiral and 14 inscriptions from said spiral. The fragment also contains inscriptions for the Exeligmos dial and visible on the back surface the remnants of the dial face. Finally, this fragment contains some back door inscriptions.\n|- align=center\n| B ||125&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;60 ||99.4 ||1 ||Yes\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Contains approximately the bottom right third of the Metonic spiral and inscriptions of both the spiral and back door of the mechanism. The Metonic scale would have consisted of 235 cells of which 49 have been deciphered from fragment B either in whole or partially. The rest so far are assumed from knowledge of the [[Metonic cycle]]. This fragment also contains a single gear (o1) used in the Olympic train.\n|- align=center\n| C ||120&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;110 ||63.8 ||1 ||Yes\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Contains parts of the upper right of the front dial face showing calendar and zodiac inscriptions.

Fragment 19 contains significant back door inscriptions including one reading \"...&nbsp;76 years&nbsp;...\" which refers to the [[Callippic cycle]]. Other inscriptions seem to describe the function of the back dials. In addition to this important minor fragment, 15 further minor fragments have remnants of inscriptions on them.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|7}}\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[Image:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|right|Schematic of the arte<!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling -->fact's known mechanism]]\n\nInformation on the specific data gleaned from the ruins by the latest inquiries is detailed in the supplement to Freeth's 2006 ''Nature'' article.<ref name=\"freeth-06\" />\nA Youtuber by the name \"Clickspring\" has made several videos on the possible manufacturing techniques of the antikythera mechanism.\n\n===Operation===\nOn the front face of the mechanism there is a fixed ring dial representing the [[ecliptic]], the twelve [[zodiac]]al signs marked off with equal 30-degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the [[constellation]] boundaries were variable. Outside of that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic [[Egyptian calendar]], twelve months of 30 days plus five [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the [[Greek alphabet]]. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a [[crown gear]] to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian [[ephemeris]] tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], the [[Lunar phase|moon phase]], [[eclipse]], and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System#Planets|planets]].<ref name=freeth-09/>\n\nThe operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a \"follower\" that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer's follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|10}}\n\n===Faces===\n[[File:Computer graphic for front of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated front panel of the Freeth model]]\n\n====Front face====\nThe front dial has two concentric circular scales that represent the path of the [[ecliptic]] through the heavens. The outer ring is marked off with the days of the 365-day [[Egyptian civil calendar]]. On the inner ring, a second dial marks the Greek signs of the [[Zodiac]], with division into degrees. The mechanism predates the [[Julian calendar]] reform, but the [[Sothic cycle|Sothic]] and [[Callippic cycle]]s had already pointed to a {{frac|365|1|4}}-day solar year, as seen in [[Ptolemy III]]'s [[Decree of Canopus|abortive calendrical reform]] of 238{{nbsp}}BC. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed [[leap day]] ([[Egyptian intercalary month|Epag.]] 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter-day in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years.\n\nThe position of the Sun on the ecliptic corresponds to the current date in the year. The orbits of the Moon and the five planets known to the Greeks are close enough to the ecliptic to make it a convenient reference for defining their positions as well.\n\nThe following three [[Egyptian calendar#Months|Egyptian months]] are inscribed in [[History of the Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] on the surviving pieces of the outer ring:<ref>{{citation |last=Jones |first=Alexander |title=A Portable Cosmos |p=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bl3ODQAAQBAJ&pg=PT97|date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780190618599 }}.</ref>\n* \u03a0\u0391\u03a7\u03a9\u039d ([[Pachon]])\n* \u03a0\u0391\u03a5\u039d\u0399 ([[Payni]])\n* \u0395\u03a0\u0399\u03a6\u0399 ([[Epiphi]])\n\nThe other months have been reconstructed, although some reconstructions of the mechanism omit the five days of the Egyptian intercalary month.

indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated the position of the Moon, and a mean Sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The Moon position was not a simple mean Moon indicator that would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the Moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of [[epicyclic gearing]].\n\nIt also tracked the precession of the elliptical orbit around the ecliptic in an 8.88-year cycle. The mean Sun position is, by definition, the current date. It is speculated that since such pains were taken to get the position of the Moon correct,<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|20, 24}} then there also was likely to have been a \"true sun\" pointer in addition to the mean Sun pointer likewise, to track the elliptical anomaly of the Sun (the orbit of Earth around the Sun), but there is no evidence of it among the ruins of the mechanism found to date.<ref name=freeth-12 /> Similarly, neither is there the evidence of planetary orbit pointers for the five planets known to the Greeks among the ruins. See [[#Proposed planet indication gearing schemes|Proposed planet indication gearing schemes]] below.\n\nFinally, mechanical engineer Michael Wright has demonstrated that there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position.<ref name=wright-05 /> The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the Sun and Moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential gear]], a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs.\n\n====Rear face====\n[[File:Computer graphic for back of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated back panel]]\nIn July 2008, scientists reported new findings in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' showing that the mechanism not only tracked the [[Metonic calendar]] and predicted [[solar eclipses]], but also calculated the timing of several panhellenic athletic games, including the [[Ancient Olympic Games]].<ref name=freeth-08/> Inscriptions on the instrument closely match the names of the months that are used on calendars from [[Epirus]] in northwestern Greece and with the island of [[Corfu]], which in antiquity was known as Corcyra.<ref name=wilford-08/><ref name=connor-08/><ref>Paul Iversen, \"The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148\u2013168.</ref>\n\nOn the back of the mechanism, there are five dials: the two large displays, the [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] and the [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]], and three smaller indicators, the so-called Olympiad Dial,<ref name=freeth-08/> which has recently been renamed the Games dial as it did not track Olympiad years (the four-year cycle it tracks most closely is the Halieiad),<ref name=\"Paul Iversen 2017\"/> the [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]], and the [[Exeligmos]].<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|11}}\n\nThe Metonic Dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several physical units, is 235 [[month#Synodic month|synodic months]], which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in five rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the [[Hellenic calendars#Corinthian|Corinthian month names]].<ref name=freeth-08 /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Freeth | first1 = T | year = 2009 | title = Decoding an Ancient Computer | journal = Scientific American | volume = 301 | issue = 6| pages = 76\u201383 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1209-76 | pmid=20058643|bibcode = 2009SciAm.301f..76F }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Paul Iversen, \"The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148-164.</ref>\n\n# \u03a6\u039f\u0399\u039d\u0399\u039a\u0391\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Phoinikaios)\n# \u039a\u03a1\u0391\u039d\u0395\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Kraneios)\n# \u039b\u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a4\u03a1\u039f\u03a0\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Lanotropios)\n# \u039c\u0391\u03a7\u0391\u039d\u0395\u03a5\u03a3 (Machaneus, ''\"mechanic\"'', referring to [[Zeus]] the inventor)\n# \u0394\u03a9\u0394\u0395\u039a\u0391\u03a4\u0395\u03a5\u03a3 (Dodekateus)\n# \u0395\u03a5\u039a\u039b\u0395\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Eukleios)\n# \u0391\u03a1\u03a4\u0395\u039c\u0399\u03a3\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Artemisios)\n# \u03a8\u03a5\u0394\u03a1\u0395\u03a5\u03a3 (Psydreus)\n# \u0393\u0391\u039c\u0395\u0399\u039b\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Gameilios)\n# \u0391\u0393\u03a1\u0399\u0391\u039d\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Agrianios)\n# \u03a0\u0391\u039d\u0391\u039c\u039f\u03a3 (Panamos)\n# \u0391\u03a0\u0395\u039b\u039b\u0391\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (Apellaios)\n\nThus, setting the correct solar time (in days) on the front panel indicates the current lunar month on the back panel, with resolution to within a week or so.\n\nBased on the fact that the calendar month names are consistent with all the evidence of the Epirote calendar and that the Games dial mentions the very minor Naa games of Dodona (in Epirus), it has recently been argued that the calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism is likely to be the Epirote calendar, and that this calendar was probably adopted from a Corinthian colony in Epirus, possibly Ambracia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> It has also been argued that the first month of the calendar, Phoinikaios, was ideally the month in which the autumn equinox fell, and that the start-up date of the calendar began shortly after the astronomical new moon of 23 August 205 BC.<ref>Paul Iversen, \"The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 165\u2013185.</ref>\n\nThe Callippic dial is the left secondary upper dial, which follows a 76-year cycle.

It is defined as the cycle of repetition of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict them&nbsp;\u2014 not only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read:{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n* \u03a3 = \u03a3\u0395\u039b\u0397\u039d\u0397 (\"Selene\", Moon)\n* \u0397 = \u0397\u039b\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (\"Helios\", Sun)\n* H\\M = \u0397\u039c\u0395\u03a1\u0391\u03a3 (\"Hemeras\", of the day)\n* \u03c9\\\u03c1 = \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1 (\"hora\", hour)\n* N\\Y = \u039d\u03a5\u039a\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 (\"Nuktos\", of the night)\n\nThe glyphs show whether the designated eclipse is solar or lunar, and give the day of the month and hour. Solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|6}} In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros dial indicate the start of a new [[full moon cycle]]. Based on the distribution of the times of the eclipses, it has recently been argued that the start-up date of the Saros dial was shortly after the astronomical new moon of 28 April 205 BC.<ref>Carman, Christi\u00e1n C.; Evans, James (15 November 2014). \"On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor\".

The [[Exeligmos]] cycle is a 54-year triple Saros cycle that is 19,756 days long. Since the length of the Saros cycle is to a third of a day (eight hours), so a full Exeligmos cycle returns counting to integer days, hence the inscriptions. The labels on its three divisions are:<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|10}}\n* Blank or o ? (representing the number zero, assumed, not yet observed)\n* H (number 8) means add 8 hours to the time mentioned in the display\n* I\u03db (number 16) means add 16 hours to the time mentioned in the display\n\nThus the dial pointer indicates how many hours must be added to the glyph times of the Saros dial in order to calculate the exact eclipse times.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Doors===\nThe mechanism has a wooden casing with a front and a back door, both containing inscriptions.<ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=freeth-06-1/> The back door appears to be the \"instruction manual\". On one of its fragments is written \"76 years, 19 years\" representing the [[Callippic]] and [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] cycles. Also written is \"223\" for the Saros cycle. On another one of its fragments, it is written \"on the spiral subdivisions 235\" referring to the Metonic dial.\n\n===Gearing===\nThe mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested that the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.<ref name=freeth-09/>\n\nThere is much debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted for\u2014with the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise unaccounted for in fragment D.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe purpose of the front face was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the [[celestial sphere]] along the [[ecliptic]], in reference to the observer's position on the Earth. That is irrelevant to the question of whether that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the Solar System; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism.\n\nThe epicyclic Solar System of [[Ptolemy]] (c. 100 \u2013 170 AD) \u2013 still 300 years in the future from the apparent date of the mechanism \u2013 carried forward with more epicycles, and was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] (1473 \u2013 1543 AD), until [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] (1571 \u2013 1630 AD) introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.<ref name=amrp-07-2/>\n\nEvans et al. suggest that to display the mean positions of the five [[classical planets]] would require only 17 further gears that could be positioned in front of the large driving gear and indicated using individual circular dials on the face.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nTony Freeth and Alexander Jones have modelled and published details of a version using several gear trains mechanically-similar to the lunar anomaly system allowing for indication of the positions of the planets as well as synthesis of the Sun anomaly. Their system, they claim, is more authentic than Wright's model as it uses the known skill sets of the Greeks of that period and does not add excessive complexity or internal stresses to the machine.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe gear teeth were in the form of [[equilateral triangle]]s with an average circular pitch of 1.6&nbsp;mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4&nbsp;mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2&nbsp;mm. The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even.<ref name=\"freeth-12\"/> Due to advances in imaging and [[X-ray computed tomography|X-ray]] technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|8}}\n\nA table of the gears, their teeth, and the expected and computed rotations of various important gears follows. The gear functions come from Freeth et al. (2008)<ref name=freeth-08/> and those for the lower half of the table from Freeth and Jones 2012.<ref name=freeth-12/> The computed values start with 1 year/revolution for the b1 gear, and the remainder are computed directly from gear teeth ratios.

The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is not known. There is no coaxial system but only for the Moon. Fragment D that is an epicycloidal system is considered as a planetary gear for Jupiter (Moussas, 2011, 2012, 2014) or a gear for the motion of the Sun (University of Thessaloniki group).\n'''The Sun gear''' is operated from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean Sun gear, b1) and in turn drives the rest of the gear sets. The Sun gear is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, \"true sun\" pointer that displayed the Sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on the basis of the gear ratios of the gears named.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The Moon train''' starts with gear b1 and proceeds through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 to the Moon pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear system]]; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back and forth in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others.  Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the Moon, in consequence of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Position as a function of time|Kepler's second and third laws]]. The modelled rotational period of the Moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the [[moon]] of 8.85 years.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\nThe system also models the [[lunar phase|phases of the Moon]]. The Moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the Sun pointer at B0 (the connection between B0 and the rest of B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean Sun pointer or a hypothetical true Sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the Moon, but is also geared to the Sun&nbsp;\u2014 the effect is to perform a [[differential gear]] operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the Sun and Moon pointers.  The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the Moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] train''' is driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is connected to the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the pointer is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Olympiad]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n2, and o1, which mounts the pointer.  It has a computed modelled rotational period of exactly four years, as expected. Incidentally, it is the only pointer on the mechanism that rotates counter-clockwise; all of the others rotate clockwise.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n3, p1, p2, and q1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of 27758 days, while the modern value is 27758.8 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, and g1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Saros pointer is 1646.3 days (in four rotations along the spiral pointer track); the modern value is 1646.33 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Exeligmos]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, g1, g2, h1, h2, and i1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Exeligmos pointer is 19,756 days; the modern value is 19755.96 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\nApparently, gears m3, n1-3, p1-2, and q1 did not survive in the wreckage. The functions of the pointers were deduced from the remains of the dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed, and is generally accepted.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n====Proposed gear schemes====\nBecause of the large space between the mean Sun gear and the front of the case and the size of and mechanical features on the mean Sun gear it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship.<ref name=freeth-12/> This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, because of the lack of evidence many solutions have been put forward.\n\n{{multiple image| direction = vertical| width = 150| image1 = Antikythera-proposed-4.svg| caption1  = Wright proposal| image2 = Antikythera-proposed-1.svg| caption2 = Evans et al. proposal| image3 = Antikythera-proposed-3.svg| caption3 = Freeth et al. proposal}}\n\n'''[[Michael T. Wright|Michael Wright]]''' was the first person to design and build a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eUibFQKJqI model] with not only the known mechanism, but also, with his emulation of a potential [[planetarium]] system. He suggested that along with the lunar anomaly, adjustments would have been made for the deeper, more basic solar anomaly (known as the \"first anomaly\"). He included pointers for this \"true sun\", Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in addition to the known \"mean sun\" (current time) and lunar pointers.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\n'''Evans, Carman, and Thorndike''' published a solution with significant differences from Wright's.<ref name=cte-10/> Their proposal centred on what they observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to them seemed to indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They also suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system would lead to a much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright's model.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nTheir proposal used simple meshed gear trains and accounted for the previously unexplained 63 toothed gear in fragment D. They proposed two face plate layouts, one with evenly spaced dials, and another with a gap in the top of the face to account for criticism regarding their not using the apparent fixtures on the b1 gear. They proposed that rather than bearings and pillars for gears and axles, they simply held weather and seasonal icons to be displayed through a window.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nIn a paper published in 2012 Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed a system of epicyclic gearing with pin and slot followers.<ref name=cte-12/>\n\n'''Freeth and Jones''' published their proposal in 2012 after extensive research and work. They came up with a compact and feasible solution to the question of planetary indication. They also propose indicating the solar anomaly (that is, the sun's apparent position in the zodiac dial) on a separate pointer from the date pointer, which indicates the mean position of the Sun, as well as the date on the month dial. If the two dials are synchronised correctly, their front panel display is essentially the same as Wright's. Unlike Wright's model however, this model has not been built physically, and is only a 3-D computer model.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\n[[Image:Gearing Relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism.svg|thumb|upright|Internal gearing relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism, based on the Freeth and Jones proposal]]\n\nThe system to synthesise the solar anomaly is very similar to that used in Wright's proposal. Three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the Sun spindle, the second fixed on one of the spokes (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one, the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean Sun wheel turns.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe inferior planet mechanism includes the Sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus.<ref name=freeth-12/> For each of the three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the Sun and all the planets\u2014excepting only the Moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, out in front of the front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe superior planet systems\u2014Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn\u2014all follow the same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism.<ref name=freeth-12/> Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.\n\nIn total, there are eight coaxial spindles of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, seven gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for a grand total of 54 gears, three bars, and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones' design.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nOn the visual representation Freeth supplies in the paper, the pointers on the front zodiac dial have small, round identifying stones. He mentions a quote from an ancient papyrus:\n\n{{quote|...a voice comes to you speaking. Let the stars be set upon the board in accordance with [their] nature except for the Sun and Moon.

This is not due to inaccuracies in gearing ratios in the mechanism, but rather to inadequacies in the Greek theory of planetary movements. The accuracy could not have been improved until first Ptolemy put forth his [[Almagest|Planetary Hypotheses]] in the second half of the second century AD (particularly adding the concept of the [[equant]] to his theory) and then finally by the introduction of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler's Second Law]] in the early 17th century.<ref name=freeth-12 />\n\n{{quote|In short, the Antikythera Mechanism was a machine designed to predict celestial phenomena according to the sophisticated astronomical theories current in its day, the sole witness to a lost history of brilliant engineering, a conception of pure genius, one of the great wonders of the ancient world\u2014but it didn't really work very well!<ref name=freeth-12 />}}\n\nIn addition to theoretical accuracy, there is the matter of mechanical accuracy.

They were both built by [[Archimedes]] and brought to Rome by the Roman general [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the death of Archimedes at the [[Siege of Syracuse (214\u2013212 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in 212 BC. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes and one of these machines was the only item he kept from the siege (the second was placed in the [[Temple of Honor and Virtue|Temple of Virtue]]). The device was kept as a family heirloom, and Cicero has Philus (one of the participants in a conversation that Cicero imagined had taken place in a villa belonging to [[Scipio Aemilianus]] in the year 129 BC) saying that [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] (consul with [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 166 BC)|Marcellus's nephew]] in 166 BC, and credited by [[Pliny the Elder]] as the first Roman to have written a book explaining solar and lunar eclipses) gave both a \"learned explanation\" and a working demonstration of the device.\n\n{{cquote|I had often heard this celestial globe or sphere mentioned on account of the great fame of Archimedes. Its appearance, however, did not seem to me particularly striking. There is another, more elegant in form, and more generally known, moulded by the same Archimedes, and deposited by the same Marcellus, in the Temple of Virtue at Rome. But as soon as Gallus had begun to explain, by his sublime science, the composition of this machine, I felt that the Sicilian geometrician must have possessed a genius superior to any thing we usually conceive to belong to our nature. Gallus assured us, that the solid and compact globe, was a very ancient invention, and that the first model of it had been presented by [[Thales of Miletus]]. That afterwards [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], a disciple of [[Plato]], had traced on its surface the stars that appear in the sky, and that many years subsequent, borrowing from Eudoxus this beautiful design and representation, Aratus had illustrated them in his verses, not by any science of astronomy, but the ornament of poetic description. He added, that the figure of the sphere, which displayed the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the five planets, or wandering stars, could not be represented by the primitive solid globe. And that in this, the invention of Archimedes was admirable, because he had calculated how a single revolution should maintain unequal and diversified progressions in dissimilar motions.\n\nWhen Gallus moved this globe it showed the relationship of the Moon with the Sun, and there were exactly the same number of turns on the bronze device as the number of days in the real globe of the sky. Thus it showed the same eclipse of the Sun as in the globe [of the sky], as well as showing the Moon entering the area of the Earth's shadow when the Sun is in line&nbsp;... [missing text] [i.e. It showed both solar and lunar eclipses.]<ref name=cicero/>}}\n\n[[Pappus of Alexandria]] stated that Archimedes had written a now lost manuscript on the construction of these devices entitled ''On Sphere-Making''.<ref name=rorres-11/><ref name=fildes-10/> The surviving texts from ancient times describe many of his creations, some even containing simple drawings. One such device is his [[odometer]], the exact model later used by the Romans to place their [[mile marker]]s (described by [[Vitruvius]], [[Heron of Alexandria]] and in the time of Emperor [[Commodus]]).<ref name=needham/> The drawings in the text appeared functional, but attempts to build them as pictured had failed. When the gears pictured, which had square teeth, were replaced with gears of the type in the Antikythera mechanism, which were angled, the device was perfectly functional.<ref name=sleeswyk-81/>\n\nIf Cicero's account is correct, then this technology existed as early as the 3rd century BC. Archimedes' device is also mentioned by later Roman era writers such as [[Lactantius]] (''Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII''), [[Claudian]] (''In sphaeram Archimedes''), and [[Proclus]] (''Commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements of Geometry'') in the 4th and 5th centuries.\n\nCicero also said that another such device was built \"recently\" by his friend [[Posidonius]], \"... each one of the revolutions of which brings about the same movement in the Sun and Moon and five wandering stars [planets] as is brought about each day and night in the heavens&nbsp;...\"<ref name=cicero-1/>\n\nIt is unlikely that any one of these machines was the Antikythera mechanism found in the shipwreck since both the devices fabricated by Archimedes and mentioned by Cicero were located in Rome at least 30 years later than the estimated date of the shipwreck, and the third device was almost certainly in the hands of Posidonius by that date. The scientists who have reconstructed the Antikythera mechanism also agree that it was too sophisticated to have been a unique device.\n\nThis evidence that the Antikythera mechanism was not unique adds support to the idea that there was an ancient Greek tradition of complex mechanical technology that was later, at least in part, transmitted to the Byzantine and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic worlds]], where mechanical devices which were complex, albeit simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, were built during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=charette-06/> Fragments of a geared calendar attached to a sundial, from the 5th or 6th century [[Byzantine Empire]], have been found; the calendar may have been used to assist in telling time.<ref name=madison-85/> In the Islamic world, [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]]'s ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices|Kitab al-Hiyal]]'', or ''Book of Ingenious Devices'', was commissioned by the [[Caliph of Baghdad]] in the early 9th century AD. This text described over a hundred mechanical devices, some of which may date back to ancient Greek texts preserved in [[Monastery|monasteries]].

Clearly visible on the front is the large b1 gear, and under closer inspection further gears behind said gear (parts of the l, m, c, and d trains are clearly visible as gears to the naked eye). The crank mechanism socket and the side-mounted gear that meshes with b1 is on ''Fragment A''. The back of the fragment contains the rearmost e and k gears for synthesis of the moon anomaly, noticeable also is the pin and slot mechanism of the k train. It is noticed from detailed scans of the fragment that all gears are very closely packed and have sustained damage and displacement due to their years in the sea. The fragment is approximately 30&nbsp;mm thick at its thickest point.\n\nFragment A also contains divisions of the upper left quarter of the Saros spiral and 14 inscriptions from said spiral. The fragment also contains inscriptions for the Exeligmos dial and visible on the back surface the remnants of the dial face.

Fragment 19 contains significant back door inscriptions including one reading \"...&nbsp;76 years&nbsp;...\" which refers to the [[Callippic cycle]]. Other inscriptions seem to describe the function of the back dials. In addition to this important minor fragment, 15 further minor fragments have remnants of inscriptions on them.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|7}}\n\n==Mechanism==\n[[Image:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|right|Schematic of the arte<!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling -->fact's known mechanism]]\n\nInformation on the specific data gleaned from the ruins by the latest inquiries is detailed in the supplement to Freeth's 2006 ''Nature'' article.<ref name=\"freeth-06\" />\n\n===Operation===\nOn the front face of the mechanism there is a fixed ring dial representing the [[ecliptic]], the twelve [[zodiac]]al signs marked off with equal 30-degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the [[constellation]] boundaries were variable. Outside of that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic [[Egyptian calendar]], twelve months of 30 days plus five [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the [[Greek alphabet]]. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a [[crown gear]] to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian [[ephemeris]] tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], the [[Lunar phase|moon phase]], [[eclipse]], and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System#Planets|planets]].<ref name=freeth-09/>\n\nThe operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a \"follower\" that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer's follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|10}}\n\n===Faces===\n[[File:Computer graphic for front of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated front panel of the Freeth model]]\n\n====Front face====\nThe front dial has two concentric circular scales that represent the path of the [[ecliptic]] through the heavens. The outer ring is marked off with the days of the 365-day [[Egyptian civil calendar]]. On the inner ring, a second dial marks the Greek signs of the [[Zodiac]], with division into degrees. The mechanism predates the [[Julian calendar]] reform, but the [[Sothic cycle|Sothic]] and [[Callippic cycle]]s had already pointed to a {{frac|365|1|4}}-day solar year, as seen in [[Ptolemy III]]'s [[Decree of Canopus|abortive calendrical reform]] of 238{{nbsp}}BC. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed [[leap day]] ([[Egyptian intercalary month|Epag.]] 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter-day in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years.\n\nThe position of the Sun on the ecliptic corresponds to the current date in the year.

indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated the position of the Moon, and a mean Sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The Moon position was not a simple mean Moon indicator that would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the Moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of [[epicyclic gearing]].\n\nIt also tracked the precession of the elliptical orbit around the ecliptic in an 8.88-year cycle. The mean Sun position is, by definition, the current date. It is speculated that since such pains were taken to get the position of the Moon correct,<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|20, 24}} then there also was likely to have been a \"true sun\" pointer in addition to the mean Sun pointer likewise, to track the elliptical anomaly of the Sun (the orbit of Earth around the Sun), but there is no evidence of it among the ruins of the mechanism found to date.<ref name=freeth-12 /> Similarly, neither is there the evidence of planetary orbit pointers for the five planets known to the Greeks among the ruins. See [[#Proposed planet indication gearing schemes|Proposed planet indication gearing schemes]] below.\n\nFinally, mechanical engineer Michael Wright has demonstrated that there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position.<ref name=wright-05 /> The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the Sun and Moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential gear]], a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs.\n\n====Rear face====\n[[File:Computer graphic for back of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated back panel]]\nIn July 2008, scientists reported new findings in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' showing that the mechanism not only tracked the [[Metonic calendar]] and predicted [[solar eclipses]], but also calculated the timing of several panhellenic athletic games, including the [[Ancient Olympic Games]].<ref name=freeth-08/> Inscriptions on the instrument closely match the names of the months that are used on calendars from [[Epirus]] in northwestern Greece and with the island of [[Corfu]], which in antiquity was known as Corcyra.<ref name=wilford-08/><ref name=connor-08/><ref>Paul Iversen, \"The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148\u2013168.</ref>\n\nOn the back of the mechanism, there are five dials: the two large displays, the [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] and the [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]], and three smaller indicators, the so-called Olympiad Dial,<ref name=freeth-08/> which has recently been renamed the Games dial as it did not track Olympiad years (the four-year cycle it tracks most closely is the Halieiad),<ref name=\"Paul Iversen 2017\"/> the [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]], and the [[Exeligmos]].<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|11}}\n\nThe Metonic Dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several physical units, is 235 [[month#Synodic month|synodic months]], which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in five rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral.

It is defined as the cycle of repetition of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict them&nbsp;\u2014 not only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read:{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n* \u03a3 = \u03a3\u0395\u039b\u0397\u039d\u0397 (\"Selene\", Moon)\n* \u0397 = \u0397\u039b\u0399\u039f\u03a3 (\"Helios\", Sun)\n* H\\M = \u0397\u039c\u0395\u03a1\u0391\u03a3 (\"Hemeras\", of the day)\n* \u03c9\\\u03c1 = \u03c9\u03c1\u03b1 (\"hora\", hour)\n* N\\Y = \u039d\u03a5\u039a\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 (\"Nuktos\", of the night)\n\nThe glyphs show whether the designated eclipse is solar or lunar, and give the day of the month and hour. Solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|6}} In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros dial indicate the start of a new [[full moon cycle]]. Based on the distribution of the times of the eclipses, it has recently been argued that the start-up date of the Saros dial was shortly after the astronomical new moon of 28 April 205 BC.<ref>Carman, Christi\u00e1n C.; Evans, James (15 November 2014). \"On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor\".

The [[Exeligmos]] cycle is a 54-year triple Saros cycle that is 19,756 days long. Since the length of the Saros cycle is to a third of a day (eight hours), so a full Exeligmos cycle returns counting to integer days, hence the inscriptions. The labels on its three divisions are:<ref name=freeth-06 />{{rp|10}}\n* Blank or o ?

On one of its fragments is written \"76 years, 19 years\" representing the [[Callippic]] and [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] cycles. Also written is \"223\" for the Saros cycle. On another one of its fragments, it is written \"on the spiral subdivisions 235\" referring to the Metonic dial.\n\n===Gearing===\nThe mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested that the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.<ref name=freeth-09/>\n\nThere is much debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted for\u2014with the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise unaccounted for in fragment D.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe purpose of the front face was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the [[celestial sphere]] along the [[ecliptic]], in reference to the observer's position on the Earth. That is irrelevant to the question of whether that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the Solar System; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism.\n\nThe epicyclic Solar System of [[Ptolemy]] (c. 100 \u2013 170 AD) \u2013 still 300 years in the future from the apparent date of the mechanism \u2013 carried forward with more epicycles, and was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] (1473 \u2013 1543 AD), until [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] (1571 \u2013 1630 AD) introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.<ref name=amrp-07-2/>\n\nEvans et al. suggest that to display the mean positions of the five [[classical planets]] would require only 17 further gears that could be positioned in front of the large driving gear and indicated using individual circular dials on the face.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nTony Freeth and Alexander Jones have modelled and published details of a version using several gear trains mechanically-similar to the lunar anomaly system allowing for indication of the positions of the planets as well as synthesis of the Sun anomaly. Their system, they claim, is more authentic than Wright's model as it uses the known skill sets of the Greeks of that period and does not add excessive complexity or internal stresses to the machine.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe gear teeth were in the form of [[equilateral triangle]]s with an average circular pitch of 1.6&nbsp;mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4&nbsp;mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2&nbsp;mm. The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even.<ref name=\"freeth-12\"/> Due to advances in imaging and [[X-ray computed tomography|X-ray]] technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.<ref name=freeth-06-1 />{{rp|8}}\n\nA table of the gears, their teeth, and the expected and computed rotations of various important gears follows. The gear functions come from Freeth et al. (2008)<ref name=freeth-08/> and those for the lower half of the table from Freeth and Jones 2012.<ref name=freeth-12/> The computed values start with 1 year/revolution for the b1 gear, and the remainder are computed directly from gear teeth ratios.

The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is not known. There is no coaxial system but only for the Moon. Fragment D that is an epicycloidal system is considered as a planetary gear for Jupiter (Moussas, 2011, 2012, 2014) or a gear for the motion of the Sun (University of Thessaloniki group).\n'''The Sun gear''' is operated from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean Sun gear, b1) and in turn drives the rest of the gear sets. The Sun gear is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, \"true sun\" pointer that displayed the Sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on the basis of the gear ratios of the gears named.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The Moon train''' starts with gear b1 and proceeds through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 to the Moon pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear system]]; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back and forth in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others.  Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the Moon, in consequence of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Position as a function of time|Kepler's second and third laws]]. The modelled rotational period of the Moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the [[moon]] of 8.85 years.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\nThe system also models the [[lunar phase|phases of the Moon]]. The Moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the Sun pointer at B0 (the connection between B0 and the rest of B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean Sun pointer or a hypothetical true Sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the Moon, but is also geared to the Sun&nbsp;\u2014 the effect is to perform a [[differential gear]] operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the Sun and Moon pointers.  The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the Moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] train''' is driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is connected to the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the pointer is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Olympiad]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n2, and o1, which mounts the pointer.

Incidentally, it is the only pointer on the mechanism that rotates counter-clockwise; all of the others rotate clockwise.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n3, p1, p2, and q1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of 27758 days, while the modern value is 27758.8 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, and g1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Saros pointer is 1646.3 days (in four rotations along the spiral pointer track); the modern value is 1646.33 days.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n'''The [[Exeligmos]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, g1, g2, h1, h2, and i1, which mounts the pointer.

The functions of the pointers were deduced from the remains of the dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed, and is generally accepted.<ref name=freeth-06/><ref name=freeth-08/><ref name=ieeecomp1/>\n\n====Proposed gear schemes====\nBecause of the large space between the mean Sun gear and the front of the case and the size of and mechanical features on the mean Sun gear it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship.<ref name=freeth-12/> This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, because of the lack of evidence many solutions have been put forward.\n\n{{multiple image| direction = vertical| width = 150| image1 = Antikythera-proposed-4.svg| caption1  = Wright proposal| image2 = Antikythera-proposed-1.svg| caption2 = Evans et al. proposal| image3 = Antikythera-proposed-3.svg| caption3 = Freeth et al. proposal}}\n\n'''[[Michael T. Wright|Michael Wright]]''' was the first person to design and build a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eUibFQKJqI model] with not only the known mechanism, but also, with his emulation of a potential [[planetarium]] system. He suggested that along with the lunar anomaly, adjustments would have been made for the deeper, more basic solar anomaly (known as the \"first anomaly\"). He included pointers for this \"true sun\", Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in addition to the known \"mean sun\" (current time) and lunar pointers.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\n'''Evans, Carman, and Thorndike''' published a solution with significant differences from Wright's.<ref name=cte-10/> Their proposal centred on what they observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to them seemed to indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They also suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system would lead to a much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright's model.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nTheir proposal used simple meshed gear trains and accounted for the previously unexplained 63 toothed gear in fragment D. They proposed two face plate layouts, one with evenly spaced dials, and another with a gap in the top of the face to account for criticism regarding their not using the apparent fixtures on the b1 gear. They proposed that rather than bearings and pillars for gears and axles, they simply held weather and seasonal icons to be displayed through a window.<ref name=cte-10/>\n\nIn a paper published in 2012 Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed a system of epicyclic gearing with pin and slot followers.<ref name=cte-12/>\n\n'''Freeth and Jones''' published their proposal in 2012 after extensive research and work. They came up with a compact and feasible solution to the question of planetary indication. They also propose indicating the solar anomaly (that is, the sun's apparent position in the zodiac dial) on a separate pointer from the date pointer, which indicates the mean position of the Sun, as well as the date on the month dial. If the two dials are synchronised correctly, their front panel display is essentially the same as Wright's. Unlike Wright's model however, this model has not been built physically, and is only a 3-D computer model.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\n[[Image:Gearing Relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism.svg|thumb|upright|Internal gearing relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism, based on the Freeth and Jones proposal]]\n\nThe system to synthesise the solar anomaly is very similar to that used in Wright's proposal. Three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the Sun spindle, the second fixed on one of the spokes (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one, the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean Sun wheel turns.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe inferior planet mechanism includes the Sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus.<ref name=freeth-12/> For each of the three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the Sun and all the planets\u2014excepting only the Moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, out in front of the front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nThe superior planet systems\u2014Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn\u2014all follow the same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism.<ref name=freeth-12/> Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.\n\nIn total, there are eight coaxial spindles of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, seven gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for a grand total of 54 gears, three bars, and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones' design.<ref name=freeth-12/>\n\nOn the visual representation Freeth supplies in the paper, the pointers on the front zodiac dial have small, round identifying stones. He mentions a quote from an ancient papyrus:\n\n{{quote|...a voice comes to you speaking. Let the stars be set upon the board in accordance with [their] nature except for the Sun and Moon. And let the Sun be golden, the Moon silver, Kronos [Saturn] of obsidian, Ares [Mars] of reddish onyx, Aphrodite [Venus] lapis lazuli veined with gold, Hermes [Mercury] turquoise; let Zeus [Jupiter] be of (whitish?) stone, crystalline (?)...<ref name=papyrus/>}}\n\n===Accuracy===\nInvestigations by Freeth and Jones reveal that their simulated mechanism is not particularly accurate, the Mars pointer being up to 38\u00b0 off at times (these inaccuracies occur at the nodal points of Mars' retrograde motion, and the error recedes at other locations in the orbit). This is not due to inaccuracies in gearing ratios in the mechanism, but rather to inadequacies in the Greek theory of planetary movements. The accuracy could not have been improved until first Ptolemy put forth his [[Almagest|Planetary Hypotheses]] in the second half of the second century AD (particularly adding the concept of the [[equant]] to his theory) and then finally by the introduction of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler's Second Law]] in the early 17th century.<ref name=freeth-12 />\n\n{{quote|In short, the Antikythera Mechanism was a machine designed to predict celestial phenomena according to the sophisticated astronomical theories current in its day, the sole witness to a lost history of brilliant engineering, a conception of pure genius, one of the great wonders of the ancient world\u2014but it didn't really work very well!<ref name=freeth-12 />}}\n\nIn addition to theoretical accuracy, there is the matter of mechanical accuracy.

They were both built by [[Archimedes]] and brought to Rome by the Roman general [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the death of Archimedes at the [[Siege of Syracuse (214\u2013212 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in 212 BC. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes and one of these machines was the only item he kept from the siege (the second was placed in the [[Temple of Honor and Virtue|Temple of Virtue]]). The device was kept as a family heirloom, and Cicero has Philus (one of the participants in a conversation that Cicero imagined had taken place in a villa belonging to [[Scipio Aemilianus]] in the year 129 BC) saying that [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] (consul with [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 166 BC)|Marcellus's nephew]] in 166 BC, and credited by [[Pliny the Elder]] as the first Roman to have written a book explaining solar and lunar eclipses) gave both a \"learned explanation\" and a working demonstration of the device.\n\n{{cquote|I had often heard this celestial globe or sphere mentioned on account of the great fame of Archimedes. Its appearance, however, did not seem to me particularly striking. There is another, more elegant in form, and more generally known, moulded by the same Archimedes, and deposited by the same Marcellus, in the Temple of Virtue at Rome. But as soon as Gallus had begun to explain, by his sublime science, the composition of this machine, I felt that the Sicilian geometrician must have possessed a genius superior to any thing we usually conceive to belong to our nature. Gallus assured us, that the solid and compact globe, was a very ancient invention, and that the first model of it had been presented by [[Thales of Miletus]]. That afterwards [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], a disciple of [[Plato]], had traced on its surface the stars that appear in the sky, and that many years subsequent, borrowing from Eudoxus this beautiful design and representation, Aratus had illustrated them in his verses, not by any science of astronomy, but the ornament of poetic description. He added, that the figure of the sphere, which displayed the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the five planets, or wandering stars, could not be represented by the primitive solid globe. And that in this, the invention of Archimedes was admirable, because he had calculated how a single revolution should maintain unequal and diversified progressions in dissimilar motions.\n\nWhen Gallus moved this globe it showed the relationship of the Moon with the Sun, and there were exactly the same number of turns on the bronze device as the number of days in the real globe of the sky. Thus it showed the same eclipse of the Sun as in the globe [of the sky], as well as showing the Moon entering the area of the Earth's shadow when the Sun is in line&nbsp;... [missing text] [i.e. It showed both solar and lunar eclipses.]<ref name=cicero/>}}\n\n[[Pappus of Alexandria]] stated that Archimedes had written a now lost manuscript on the construction of these devices entitled ''On Sphere-Making''.<ref name=rorres-11/><ref name=fildes-10/> The surviving texts from ancient times describe many of his creations, some even containing simple drawings. One such device is his [[odometer]], the exact model later used by the Romans to place their [[mile marker]]s (described by [[Vitruvius]], [[Heron of Alexandria]] and in the time of Emperor [[Commodus]]).<ref name=needham/> The drawings in the text appeared functional, but attempts to build them as pictured had failed. When the gears pictured, which had square teeth, were replaced with gears of the type in the Antikythera mechanism, which were angled, the device was perfectly functional.<ref name=sleeswyk-81/>\n\nIf Cicero's account is correct, then this technology existed as early as the 3rd century BC. Archimedes' device is also mentioned by later Roman era writers such as [[Lactantius]] (''Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII''), [[Claudian]] (''In sphaeram Archimedes''), and [[Proclus]] (''Commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements of Geometry'') in the 4th and 5th centuries.\n\nCicero also said that another such device was built \"recently\" by his friend [[Posidonius]], \"... each one of the revolutions of which brings about the same movement in the Sun and Moon and five wandering stars [planets] as is brought about each day and night in the heavens&nbsp;...\"<ref name=cicero-1/>\n\nIt is unlikely that any one of these machines was the Antikythera mechanism found in the shipwreck since both the devices fabricated by Archimedes and mentioned by Cicero were located in Rome at least 30 years later than the estimated date of the shipwreck, and the third device was almost certainly in the hands of Posidonius by that date. The scientists who have reconstructed the Antikythera mechanism also agree that it was too sophisticated to have been a unique device.\n\nThis evidence that the Antikythera mechanism was not unique adds support to the idea that there was an ancient Greek tradition of complex mechanical technology that was later, at least in part, transmitted to the Byzantine and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic worlds]], where mechanical devices which were complex, albeit simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, were built during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=charette-06/> Fragments of a geared calendar attached to a sundial, from the 5th or 6th century [[Byzantine Empire]], have been found; the calendar may have been used to assist in telling time.<ref name=madison-85/> In the Islamic world, [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]]'s ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices|Kitab al-Hiyal]]'', or ''Book of Ingenious Devices'', was commissioned by the [[Caliph of Baghdad]] in the early 9th century AD. This text described over a hundred mechanical devices, some of which may date back to ancient Greek texts preserved in [[Monastery|monasteries]]. A geared calendar similar to the Byzantine device was described by the scientist [[al-Biruni]] around 1000, and a surviving 13th-century [[astrolabe]] also contains a similar clockwork device.<ref name=madison-85/> It is possible that this medieval technology may have been transmitted to Europe and contributed to the development of mechanical clocks there.<ref name=marchant-06/>\n\n== Popular culture ==\nOn 17 May 2017, [[Google]] marked the 115th anniversary of the discovery with a [[Google Doodle|Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff |title=115 Anniversary of the Antikythera Mechanism Discovery |url=https://www.google.com/doodles/115th-anniversary-of-the-antikythera-mechanisms-discovery |date=17 May 2017 |work=[[Google]] |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Reiss |title=What is the Antikythera mechanism?

Devraj, the son of a former crime boss, declares himself the next leader of the crime syndicate; he is supported by some members but opposed by the rest. Ibrahim reveals to Kalki, legal advisor of the Roy group that Roy's family has been killed and he has been raising a secret for 25 years when he was alive. The secret was that he had a son who survived named Vishwank. Vishwank foils Devraj's plans by succeeding his father as the next boss. Vishwank is also determined to unmask his father's murderer and sets out to lead Waaji City.\n\nRoy had to set up a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant in India but was opposed by the external affairs minister of India. However, he manages to get the permission signature on a letter from him. Then, the gangsters' money is on a ship that gets destroyed in a bomb blast.\n\nThe story then turns to India, where a mastermind steals about two trillion [[Indian rupee|rupees]] with ease. A nationwide manhunt ensues to find the culprit. Undercover agent Ashok Chakravarthy is assigned as head of the manhunt task-force. Although he initially refuses, he relents after finding out that Amritha Nair, a woman whom he is [[infatuation|infatuated]] with, will also be on the task-force. The task-force uncovers the whereabouts of a thief named Jai and traps him during his next robbery, after Amritha and Ashok fall in love. They let Jai take a black box that Vishwank introduces to Kalki and others and that can open his locker containing treasures at a secure building in Waaji City.\n\nLater, there is a chase in which Amritha, Ashok, and David (a hacker) confront Jai at a bridge. It is then revealed that the thief was real Ashok and the officer who was with them is  Saaho, who is the actual person committing the robberies and Jai was actually the undercover police officer Ashok Chakravarthy. As Saaho escapes with his partner David, Amritha, along with the entire Indian police department, is stunned.\n\nAfterward, it is revealed that Devraj killed Roy in order to gain power and that the money of the gangsters is with him and that he was the one who planned the blast. Amritha then tracks Saaho and pretends that she is still in love with him but is actually helping Ashok. Meanwhile, Amritha actually falls for Saaho and betrays Ashok. Saaho takes Amritha to different places, which are nothing but the drawings in Amrita's book which Saaho saw when they were in [[Mumbai]]. Even after this, Amrita feels that they are opposite and can never be one but Saaho clears that and when he tries to kiss her, she is shot and taken away by Devraj. Saaho is forced by Devraj to give him the black box but later betrays him as he strikes a deal and gives the black box to Vishwank. Saaho also destroys Devraj's building and steals the money that he had with him. Amritha is then subsequently saved by Ibrahim, one of Vishwank's associates. Saaho is then chased by Ashok and the police, with Amritha in a helicopter with a sniper. As the sniper is shooting him, Amritha tries to save Saaho by distracting the sniper, but the sniper pushes her towards the very end of the helicopter. Saaho saves her with a [[jet pack]] but is later arrested by the police.\n\nKalki who was with Vishwank the whole time is revealed to be on Devraj's side. She goes to the vault and opens it with Vishwank's fingerprint which she had stolen it earlier. She accesses the vault with the black box and finds pictures of Roy and his son. She also finds a copy of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', thus revealing Roy's two most precious things in the vault, meanwhile Amritha locates and chases Alex, a man who ran away seeing her in a bar in [[Mumbai]]  and Ashok meets up with Vishwank.\n\nSaaho is taken to Karana village by Shinde, where he battles with Devraj's goons and defeats them easily. Devraj arrives, and Saaho reveals to him that he is Siddhant Nandan Saaho, the real son of Roy. He also reveals to Devraj that he did this to avenge his father's death. Vishwank and Alex also reveal this to Ashok and Amritha, respectively. Kalki also witnesses a portrait of Roy and Saaho inside the vault, thereby shocking all of them. After all of this, Saaho kills Devraj, thereby avenging Roy's death.\n\nIbrahim reveals that Vishwank was not Roy's son, but was his own son and his real name was Iqbal. He then tells them that Iqbal was there to save Roy's throne. He also reveals Saaho's real identity to the gang members, and Saaho becomes the next king of the underworld. Months later, Saaho locates Amritha in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] and confesses his love for her; they share a kiss and hug each other. In a distance, a sniper aims at Saaho as he opens his eye to the danger, hinting at a potential sequel for the movie.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prabhas]] as Ashok Chakravarthy/Siddhant Nandan Saaho\n* [[Shraddha Kapoor]] as Amritha Nair\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Narantak Roy \n* [[Neil Nitin Mukesh]] as Jai/Ashok Chakravarthy \n* [[Arun Vijay]] as Vishwank Roy/Iqbal\n* [[Chunky Pandey]] as Devraj \n* [[Vennela Kishore]] as Goswami\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as David\n* [[Lal (actor)|Lal]] as Ibrahim\n* [[Supreeth]] as Alex Fernandes\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Kalki\n* [[Prakash Belawadi]] as Shinde\n* [[Evelyn Sharma]] as Jennifer\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Prince \n* [[Tinnu Anand]] as Prithviraj \n* [[Ravi Varma (actor)|Ravi Varma]] as Ajay\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as IG\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Mani\n* Sasha Chettri\n* Girish Garladinne\n* Damini Chopra<ref>{{cite news |title= Saaho actress Damini Chopra's gorgeous looks|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/gorgeous-alert-saaho-debutante-damini-chopra-is-a-dazzling-bombshell-on-instagram/photostory/68080477.cms|accessdate=20 February 2019 |work=Times of India |date=20 February 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* Kumar Raja Venati\n* Naveen Varma Ganapathiraju\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as an item number in the song \"Bad Boy\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Jacqueline and Prabhas sizzle in Saaho's Bad Boy|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/jacqueline-and-prabhas-sizzle-in-saahos-bad-boy/articleshow/70723531.cms|accessdate=19 August 2019 |work=Times of India |date=19 August 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Indian external affairs minister Ramaswamy Allagadda (cameo)\n{{colend}}\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as sub police\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced on a budget of {{INR}}350 [[crore]].<ref name=\"Budget\"/> The film was shot in [[Austria]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Romania]], and other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e.telugurajyam.com/team-saaho-lands-in-austria-for-crucial-scenes/|title=Team Saaho lands in Austria for crucial scenes|date=17 June 2019|website=telugurajyam|language=en-US|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/saaho-prabhas-and-shraddha-kapoor-chill-in-austria-after-shoot-see-viral-pics-1555557-2019-06-25|title=Saaho: Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor chill in Austria after shoot.

Devraj, the son of a former crime boss, declares himself the next leader of the crime syndicate; he is supported by some members but opposed by the rest. Ibrahim reveals to Kalki, legal advisor of the Roy group that Roy's family has been killed and he has been raising a secret for 25 years when he was alive. The secret was that he had a son who survived named Vishwank. Vishwank foils Devraj's plans by succeeding his father as the next boss. Vishwank is also determined to unmask his father's murderer and sets out to lead Waaji City.\n\nRoy had to set up a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant in India but was opposed by the external affairs minister of India. However, he manages to get the permission signature on a letter from him. Then, the gangsters' money is on a ship that gets destroyed in a bomb blast.\n\nThe story then turns to India, where a mastermind steals about two trillion [[Indian rupee|rupees]] with ease. A nationwide manhunt ensues to find the culprit. Undercover agent Ashok Chakravarthy is assigned as head of the manhunt task-force. Although he initially refuses, he relents after finding out that Amritha Nair, a woman whom he is [[infatuation|infatuated]] with, will also be on the task-force. The task-force uncovers the whereabouts of a thief named Jai and traps him during his next robbery, after Amritha and Ashok fall in love. They let Jai take a black box that Vishwank introduces to Kalki and others and that can open his locker containing treasures at a secure building in Waaji City.\n\nLater, there is a chase in which Amritha, Ashok, and David (a hacker) confront Jai at a bridge. It is then revealed that the thief was real Ashok and the officer who was with them is  Saaho, who is the actual person committing the robberies and Jai was actually the undercover police officer Ashok Chakravarthy. As Saaho escapes with his partner David, Amritha, along with the entire Indian police department, is stunned.\n\nAfterward, it is revealed that Devraj killed Roy in order to gain power and that the money of the gangsters is with him and that he was the one who planned the blast. Amritha then tracks Saaho and pretends that she is still in love with him but is actually helping Ashok. Meanwhile, Amritha actually falls for Saaho and betrays Ashok. Saaho takes Amritha to different places, which are nothing but the drawings in Amrita's book which Saaho saw when they were in [[Mumbai]]. Even after this, Amrita feels that they are opposite and can never be one but Saaho clears that and when he tries to kiss her, she is shot and taken away by Devraj. Saaho is forced by Devraj to give him the black box but later betrays him as he strikes a deal and gives the black box to Vishwank. Saaho also destroys Devraj's building and steals the money that he had with him. Amritha is then subsequently saved by Ibrahim, one of Vishwank's associates. Saaho is then chased by Ashok and the police, with Amritha in a helicopter with a sniper. As the sniper is shooting him, Amritha tries to save Saaho by distracting the sniper, but the sniper pushes her towards the very end of the helicopter. Saaho saves her with a [[jet pack]] but is later arrested by the police.\n\nKalki who was with Vishwank the whole time is revealed to be on Devraj's side. She goes to the vault and opens it with Vishwank's fingerprint which she had stolen it earlier. She accesses the vault with the black box and finds pictures of Roy and his son. She also finds a copy of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', thus revealing Roy's two most precious things in the vault, meanwhile Amritha locates and chases Alex, a man who ran away seeing her in a bar in [[Mumbai]]  and Ashok meets up with Vishwank.\n\nSaaho is taken to Karana village by Shinde, where he battles with Devraj's goons and defeats them easily. Devraj arrives, and Saaho reveals to him that he is Siddhant Nandan Saaho, the real son of Roy. He also reveals to Devraj that he did this to avenge his father's death. Vishwank and Alex also reveal this to Ashok and Amritha, respectively. Kalki also witnesses a portrait of Roy and Saaho inside the vault, thereby shocking all of them. After all of this, Saaho kills Devraj, thereby avenging Roy's death.\n\nIbrahim reveals that Vishwank was not Roy's son, but was his own son and his real name was Iqbal. He then tells them that Iqbal was there to save Roy's throne. He also reveals Saaho's real identity to the gang members, and Saaho becomes the next king of the underworld. Months later, Saaho locates Amritha in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] and confesses his love for her; they share a kiss and hug each other. In a distance, a sniper aims at Saaho as he opens his eye to the danger, hinting at a potential sequel for the movie.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prabhas]] as Ashok Chakravarthy/Siddhant Nandan Saaho\n* [[Shraddha Kapoor]] as Amritha Nair\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Narantak Roy \n* [[Neil Nitin Mukesh]] as Jai/Ashok Chakravarthy \n* [[Arun Vijay]] as Vishwank Roy/Iqbal\n* [[Chunky Pandey]] as Devraj \n* [[Vennela Kishore]] as Goswami\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as David\n* [[Lal (actor)|Lal]] as Ibrahim\n* [[Supreeth]] as Alex Fernandes\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Kalki\n* [[Prakash Belawadi]] as Shinde\n* [[Evelyn Sharma]] as Jennifer\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Prince \n* [[Tinnu Anand]] as Prithviraj \n* [[Ravi Varma (actor)|Ravi Varma]] as Ajay\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as IG\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Mani\n* Sasha Chettri\n* Girish Garladinne\n* Damini Chopra<ref>{{cite news |title= Saaho actress Damini Chopra's gorgeous looks|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/gorgeous-alert-saaho-debutante-damini-chopra-is-a-dazzling-bombshell-on-instagram/photostory/68080477.cms|accessdate=20 February 2019 |work=Times of India |date=20 February 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* Kumar Raja Venati\n* Naveen Varma Ganapathiraju\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as an item number in the song \"Bad Boy\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Jacqueline and Prabhas sizzle in Saaho's Bad Boy|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/jacqueline-and-prabhas-sizzle-in-saahos-bad-boy/articleshow/70723531.cms|accessdate=19 August 2019 |work=Times of India |date=19 August 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Indian external affairs minister Ramaswamy Allagadda (cameo)\n{{colend}}\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as sub police\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced on a budget of {{INR}}350 [[crore]].<ref name=\"Budget\"/> The film was shot in [[Austria]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Romania]], and other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e.telugurajyam.com/team-saaho-lands-in-austria-for-crucial-scenes/|title=Team Saaho lands in Austria for crucial scenes|date=17 June 2019|website=telugurajyam|language=en-US|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/saaho-prabhas-and-shraddha-kapoor-chill-in-austria-after-shoot-see-viral-pics-1555557-2019-06-25|title=Saaho: Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor chill in Austria after shoot.
