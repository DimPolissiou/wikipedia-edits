Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.\n\nMathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''\u0127k''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].\n\nIn [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|\u03a8}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Lalo\u00eb |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n===Wave mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\">{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] <math>\\Psi(x,t)</math>. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''<sub>0</sub> or momentum ''p''<sub>0</sub> is\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nThe [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is\n\n:<math> \\operatorname P [a \\leq X \\leq b] = \\int_a^b |\\psi(x)|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x ~.</math>\n\nIn the case of the single-moded plane wave, <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. \n\nOn the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto \\sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\\hbar}~, </math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\hbar}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi(p) \\cdot e^{i p x/\\hbar} \\, dp ~, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi(p)</math> representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that <math>\\varphi(p)</math> is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of <math>\\psi(x)</math> and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.\n\nOne way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&nbsp;''\u03c3''. Since <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.\n\nThe precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced \u03c3<sub>x</sub>, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased \u03c3<sub>p</sub>. Another way of stating this is that \u03c3<sub>x</sub> and \u03c3<sub>p</sub> have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound.

A similar result would hold for ''any'' pair of conjugate variables.\n|}\n\n===Matrix mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\"/>) \n{{Main article|Matrix mechanics}}\nIn matrix mechanics, observables such as position and momentum are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s. When considering pairs of observables,  an important quantity is the ''[[commutator]]''. For a pair of operators {{mvar|\u00c2}} and {{mvar|B\u0302}},  one defines their commutator as\n:<math>[\\hat{A},\\hat{B}]=\\hat{A}\\hat{B}-\\hat{B}\\hat{A}.</math>\nIn the case of position and momentum, the commutator is the [[canonical commutation relation]]\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}]=i \\hbar.</math>\n\nThe physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum [[eigenstate]]s. Let <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}. By definition, this means that <math>\\hat{x}|\\psi\\rangle = x_0 |\\psi\\rangle.</math> Applying the commutator to <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> yields\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}] | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x}\\hat{p}-\\hat{p}\\hat{x}) | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) \\hat{p} \\, | \\psi \\rangle = i \\hbar | \\psi \\rangle,</math>\nwhere {{mvar|\u00ce}} is  the [[identity matrix|identity operator]].\n\nSuppose, for the sake of [[proof by contradiction]], that <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> is also a right eigenstate of momentum, with constant eigenvalue {{mvar|''p''<sub>0</sub>}}. If this were true, then  one could write\n:<math>(\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) \\hat{p} \\, | \\psi \\rangle = (\\hat{x} - x_0 \\hat{I}) p_0 \\, | \\psi \\rangle = (x_0 \\hat{I} - x_0 \\hat{I})  p_0 \\, | \\psi \\rangle=0.</math>\nOn the other hand, the above canonical commutation relation requires that\n:<math>[\\hat{x},\\hat{p}] | \\psi \\rangle=i \\hbar | \\psi \\rangle \\ne 0.</math>\nThis implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate.\n\nWhen a state is measured, it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable. For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate. This means that the state is ''not'' a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented  as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates. In other words, the momentum must be less precise. This precision may be quantified by the [[standard deviation]]s,  \n:<math>\\sigma_x=\\sqrt{\\langle \\hat{x}^2 \\rangle-\\langle \\hat{x}\\rangle^2}</math>\n:<math>\\sigma_p=\\sqrt{\\langle \\hat{p}^2 \\rangle-\\langle \\hat{p}\\rangle^2}.</math>\n\nAs in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.\n\n==Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger uncertainty relations==\nThe most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the ''[[Howard Percy Robertson|Robertson]] uncertainty relation''.<ref name=\"Robertson1929\">{{Citation|last=Robertson|first=H.

A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.\n* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] <math>[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar</math> implies the Kennard inequality from above:\n:: <math>\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.</math>\n* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:\n:: <math>\\sigma_{J_i} \\sigma_{J_j} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\big|\\langle J_k\\rangle\\big|,</math>\n: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes angular momentum along the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for <math>[J_x, J_y] = i \\hbar \\varepsilon_{xyz} J_z</math>, a choice <math>\\hat{A} = J_x</math>, <math>\\hat{B} = J_y</math>, in angular momentum multiplets, ''\u03c8'' = |''j'', ''m''\u3009, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, <math>\\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \\rangle</math>) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) \u2265 ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j''\u00a0\u2265\u00a0''m'', among others.\n*{{anchor|Time\u2013energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]].

Although the second factor in the left-hand side has dimension of time, it is different from the time parameter that enters the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]. It is a ''lifetime'' of the state {{mvar|\u03c8}} with respect to the observable ''B'': In other words, this is the ''time interval'' (\u0394''t'') after which the expectation value <math>\\langle\\hat B\\rangle</math> changes appreciably.\n: An informal, heuristic meaning of the principle is the following: A state that only exists for a short time cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time\u2013energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.<ref>The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

The energy\u2013time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:<ref name=\"Heisenberg_1927\"/><ref name=\"Heisenberg_1930\"/>\n\n::<math> \\Delta E \\Delta t \\gtrsim h,</math>\n\nbut it was not always obvious what <math>\\Delta t</math> precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked \"To violate the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!\"<ref name=\"C Jansson\">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008</ref>\n\nOne ''false'' formulation of the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy <math>\\Delta E</math> requires a time interval <math>\\Delta t > h/\\Delta E</math>. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.<ref>http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf</ref> The time <math>\\Delta t</math> in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.\n\nAnother common misconception is that the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated\u2014energy can be \"borrowed\" from the universe as long as it is \"returned\" within a short amount of time.<ref name=\"Griffiths2005\"/>   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron\u2013positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.\n\nIn 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of \"events\".<ref>see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/</ref>\n-->\n\n===A counterexample===\nSuppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable <math>\\theta</math>, which we may take to lie in the interval <math>[0,2\\pi]</math>.

The definition of <math>\\hat{A}</math> depends on our choice to have <math>\\theta</math> range from 0 to <math>2\\pi</math>. These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators, <math>[\\hat{A},\\hat{B}]=i\\hbar</math>.<ref>More precisely, <math>\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\psi-\\hat{B}\\hat{A}\\psi=i\\hbar\\psi</math> whenever both <math>\\hat{A}\\hat{B}\\psi</math> and <math>\\hat{B}\\hat{A}\\psi</math> are defined, and the space of such <math>\\psi</math> is a dense subspace of the quantum Hilbert space.

These states are normalizable, unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line. Also the operator <math>\\hat{A}</math> is bounded, since <math>\\theta</math> ranges over a bounded interval.

A few remarks on these inequalities. First, the choice of [[base e]] is a matter of popular convention in physics. The logarithm can alternatively be in any base, provided that it be consistent on both sides of the inequality.  Second, recall the [[Shannon entropy]] has been used, ''not'' the quantum [[von Neumann entropy]].  Finally, the normal distribution saturates the inequality, and it is the only distribution with this property, because it is the [[maximum entropy probability distribution]] among those with fixed variance (cf. [[differential entropy#Maximization in the normal distribution|here]] for proof).\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"70%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Entropic uncertainty of the normal distribution\n|-\n|We demonstrate this method on the ground state of the QHO, which as discussed above saturates the usual uncertainty based on standard deviations.

The basic result, which follows from \"Benedicks's theorem\", below, is that a function cannot be both [[time limited]] and [[band limited]] (a function and its Fourier transform cannot both have bounded domain)\u2014see [[Bandlimiting#Bandlimited versus timelimited|bandlimited versus timelimited]].

In practice, the Gabor limit limits the ''simultaneous'' time\u2013frequency resolution one can achieve without interference; it is possible to achieve higher resolution, but at the cost of different components of the signal interfering with each other.\n\nAs a result, in order to analyze signals where the transients are important, the [[Wavelet Transform|wavelet transform]] is often used instead of the Fourier.\n\n===DFT-Uncertainty principle===\nThere is an uncertainty principle that uses signal sparsity (or the number of non-zero coefficients).<ref name=\"Donoho\">{{cite journal |last1=Donoho |first1=D.L. |last2=Stark |first2=P.B |year=1989 |title=Uncertainty principles and signal recovery |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=906\u2013931 |doi=10.1137/0149053}}</ref>\n\nLet <math>\\left \\{ \\mathbf{ x_n } \\right \\} := x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{N-1}</math> be a sequence of ''N'' complex numbers and <math>\\left \\{ \\mathbf{X_k} \\right \\} := X_0, X_1, \\ldots, X_{N-1},</math> its [[discrete Fourier transform]].\n\nDenote by <math>\\|x\\|_0</math> the number of non-zero elements in the time sequence <math>x_0,x_1,\\ldots,x_{N-1}</math> and by <math>\\|X\\|_0</math> the number of non-zero elements in the frequency sequence <math>X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{N-1}</math>.

The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.\n\nHeisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.\n\nIn March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}</ref> Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously\u2014the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.

One way in which Heisenberg originally illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by utilizing the [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] of  an imaginary microscope as a measuring device.<ref name=\"Heisenberg_1930\"/>\n\nHe imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an [[electron]] by shooting a [[photon]] at it.<ref name=GreensteinZajonc2006>{{cite book|author1=George Greenstein|author2=Arthur Zajonc|title=The Quantum Challenge: Modern Research on the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics|year=2006|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning|isbn=978-0-7637-2470-2}}</ref>{{rp|49\u201350}}\n:Problem 1 \u2013 If the photon has a short [[wavelength]], and therefore, a large momentum, the position can be measured accurately. But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron.

If a small aperture is used, the accuracy of both resolutions is the other way around.\n\nThe combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to [[Planck's constant]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Tipler |first=Paul A. |first2=Ralph A. |last2=Llewellyn |title=Modern Physics |edition=3rd |publisher=W.

According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the [[quantum state]] describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results. There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.\n\n===The ideal of the detached observer===\n[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle \"the ideal of the detached observer\" (phrase translated from the German):\n{{blockquote|\"Like the moon has a definite position\" Einstein said to me last winter, \"whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\" I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.\n*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955<ref>{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&pg=PA43}}</ref>}}\n===Einstein's slit===\nThe first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:\n\n:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.\n\nBohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|\u0394''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|\u0394''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.\n\nA similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2\u20132</ref>\n\n===Einstein's box===\nBohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that \"Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]].\"<ref name=\"Gamow\">Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.</ref> Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. \"We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.</ref> \"Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle.\"<ref name=\"Gamow\" />\n\nBohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, \"since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,\"<ref>Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260\u2013261.</ref> because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].\n\"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.</ref>\n\n===EPR paradox for entangled particles===\nBohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.<ref>{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=[https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 452] |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 }}</ref>\n\nBut Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the \"natural basic assumption\" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from \"locally changing deterministic quantities\" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.\n\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be \"hidden\" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's \"basic assumption\" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.\n\nWhile it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables were not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption\u2014that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.<ref>[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Popper's criticism ===\n{{main article|Popper's experiment}}\n[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].<ref name=\"Popper1959\">{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | publisher = Hutchinson & Co. | year = 1959| title-link = The Logic of Scientific Discovery }}</ref> He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as \"statistical scatter relations\".<ref name=\"Popper1959\" /><ref name=\"Jarvie2006\">{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}</ref> In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory.

Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle. The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract [[matrix mechanics]] picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.\n\nMathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] in [[Hilbert space]] are [[Fourier transforms]] of one another (i.e., position and momentum are [[conjugate variables]]). A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized. A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a [[Dirac delta function|sharp spike]] at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave. In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a [[matter wave]], and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''\u0127k''}}, where {{mvar|k}} is the [[wavenumber]].\n\nIn [[matrix mechanics]], the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics]], any pair of non-[[commutator|commuting]] [[self-adjoint operator]]s representing [[observable]]s are subject to similar uncertainty limits. An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue). For example, if a measurement of an observable {{mvar|A}} is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate {{mvar|\u03a8}} of that observable. However, the particular eigenstate of the observable {{mvar|A}} need not be an eigenstate of another observable {{mvar|B}}: If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |author2=Bernard Diu |author3=Franck Lalo\u00eb |title=Quantum mechanics|year=1996|publisher=Wiley|location=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-56952-7|pages=231\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n===Wave mechanics interpretation===\n(Ref <ref name=\"L&L\">{{cite book\n |author=[[Lev Landau|L.D.

The position of the particle is described by a [[wave function]] <math>\\Psi(x,t)</math>. The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber ''k''<sub>0</sub> or momentum ''p''<sub>0</sub> is\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto e^{ik_0 x} = e^{ip_0 x/\\hbar} ~.</math>\n\nThe [[Born rule]] states that this should be interpreted as a [[probability density function|probability density amplitude function]] in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between ''a'' and ''b'' is\n\n:<math> \\operatorname P [a \\leq X \\leq b] = \\int_a^b |\\psi(x)|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}x ~.</math>\n\nIn the case of the single-moded plane wave, <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]. In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet. \n\nOn the other hand, consider a wave function that is a [[superposition principle|sum of many waves]], which we may write this as\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) \\propto \\sum_n A_n e^{i p_n x/\\hbar}~, </math>\nwhere ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> represents the relative contribution of the mode ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> to the overall total. The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized. We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an [[integral]] over all possible modes\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\hbar}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi(p) \\cdot e^{i p x/\\hbar} \\, dp ~, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi(p)</math> representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in [[momentum space]]. In mathematical terms, we say that <math>\\varphi(p)</math> is the ''[[Fourier transform]]'' of <math>\\psi(x)</math> and that ''x'' and ''p'' are [[conjugate variables]]. Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.\n\nOne way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the [[standard deviation]]&nbsp;''\u03c3''. Since <math>|\\psi(x)|^2</math> is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.\n\nThe precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced \u03c3<sub>x</sub>, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased \u03c3<sub>p</sub>. Another way of stating this is that \u03c3<sub>x</sub> and \u03c3<sub>p</sub> have an [[inverse relationship]] or are at least bounded from below. This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound.

A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.\n* For position and linear momentum, the [[canonical commutation relation]] <math>[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar</math> implies the Kennard inequality from above:\n:: <math>\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.</math>\n* For two orthogonal components of the [[angular momentum|total angular momentum]] operator of an object:\n:: <math>\\sigma_{J_i} \\sigma_{J_j} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\big|\\langle J_k\\rangle\\big|,</math>\n: where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are distinct, and ''J''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes angular momentum along the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> axis. This relation implies that unless all three components vanish together, only a single component of a system's angular momentum can be defined with arbitrary precision, normally the component parallel to an external (magnetic or electric) field. Moreover, for <math>[J_x, J_y] = i \\hbar \\varepsilon_{xyz} J_z</math>, a choice <math>\\hat{A} = J_x</math>, <math>\\hat{B} = J_y</math>, in angular momentum multiplets, ''\u03c8'' = |''j'', ''m''\u3009, bounds the [[Casimir invariant]] (angular momentum squared, <math>\\langle J_x^2+ J_y^2 + J_z^2 \\rangle</math>) from below and thus yields useful constraints such as {{nobr|''j''(''j'' + 1) \u2265 ''m''(''m'' + 1)}}, and hence ''j''\u00a0\u2265\u00a0''m'', among others.\n*{{anchor|Time\u2013energy uncertainty relation}} In non-relativistic mechanics, time is privileged as an [[independent variable]].

To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in [[Electromagnetic spectroscopy|spectroscopy]], excited states have a finite lifetime. By the time\u2013energy uncertainty principle, they do not have a definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the [[Spectral linewidth|''natural linewidth'']]. Fast-decaying states have a broad linewidth, while slow-decaying states have a narrow linewidth.<ref>The broad linewidth of fast-decaying states makes it difficult to accurately measure the energy of the state, and researchers have even used detuned microwave cavities to slow down the decay rate, to get sharper peaks. {{Citation |last=Gabrielse |first=Gerald |author2=H.

The energy\u2013time uncertainty relation is not, however, an obvious consequence of the general Robertson\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger relation. Since energy bears the same relation to time as momentum does to space in [[special relativity]], it was clear to many early founders, [[Niels Bohr]] among them, that the following relation should hold:<ref name=\"Heisenberg_1927\"/><ref name=\"Heisenberg_1930\"/>\n\n::<math> \\Delta E \\Delta t \\gtrsim h,</math>\n\nbut it was not always obvious what <math>\\Delta t</math> precisely meant. The problem is that the time at which the particle has a given state is not an operator belonging to the particle, it is a parameter describing the evolution of the system. As [[Lev Landau]] once joked \"To violate the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation all I have to do is measure the energy very precisely and then look at my watch!\"<ref name=\"C Jansson\">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/0802.3625 The GMc-interpretation of Quantum Mechanics], by Christian Jansson, February 25, 2008</ref>\n\nOne ''false'' formulation of the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that measuring the energy of a quantum system to an accuracy <math>\\Delta E</math> requires a time interval <math>\\Delta t > h/\\Delta E</math>. This formulation is similar to the one alluded to in Landau's joke, and was explicitly invalidated by [[Yakir Aharonov|Y. Aharonov]] and [[David Bohm|D. Bohm]] in 1961.<ref>http://148.216.10.84/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Aharonov%20a.pdf</ref> The time <math>\\Delta t</math> in the uncertainty relation is the time during which the system exists unperturbed, not the time during which the experimental equipment is turned on, whereas the position in the other version of the principle refers to where the particle has some probability to be and not where the observer might look.\n\nAnother common misconception is that the energy\u2013time uncertainty principle says that the [[conservation of energy]] can be temporarily violated\u2014energy can be \"borrowed\" from the universe as long as it is \"returned\" within a short amount of time.<ref name=\"Griffiths2005\"/>   Although this agrees with the ''spirit'' of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], it is based on the false axiom that the energy of the universe is an exactly known parameter at all times. More accurately, when events transpire at shorter time intervals, there is a greater uncertainty in the energy of these events. Therefore it is not that the conservation of energy is ''violated'' when [[quantum field theory]] uses temporary electron\u2013positron pairs in its calculations, but that the energy of quantum systems is not known with enough precision to limit their behavior to a single, simple history. Thus the influence of ''all histories'' must be incorporated into quantum calculations, including those with much greater or much less energy than the mean of the measured/calculated energy distribution.\n\nIn 1932 Dirac offered a precise definition and derivation of the time\u2013energy uncertainty relation in a relativistic quantum theory of \"events\".<ref>see here, and the linked references: http://www.springerlink.com/content/nwq557633112kxk2/</ref>\n-->\n\n===A counterexample===\nSuppose we consider a quantum [[particle in a ring|particle on a ring]], where the wave function depends on an angular variable <math>\\theta</math>, which we may take to lie in the interval <math>[0,2\\pi]</math>.

The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as [[electron]]s in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits. Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the [[Fourier transform]] of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.\n\nHeisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion. Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact [[trajectory]], so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.\n\nIn March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-[[commutativity]] implies the uncertainty principle. This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Niels |last=Bohr |year=1958 |title=Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |page=38 |isbn= |bibcode=1958AmJPh..26..596B |volume=26 |journal=American Journal of Physics |doi=10.1119/1.1934707 |issue=8 |last2=Noll |first2=Waldemar }}</ref> Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously\u2014the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.

There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while [[Niels Bohr]] believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform. [[Bohr\u2013Einstein debates|Einstein and Bohr debated]] the uncertainty principle for many years.\n\n===The ideal of the detached observer===\n[[Wolfgang Pauli]] called Einstein's fundamental objection to the uncertainty principle \"the ideal of the detached observer\" (phrase translated from the German):\n{{blockquote|\"Like the moon has a definite position\" Einstein said to me last winter, \"whether or not we look at the moon, the same must also hold for the atomic objects, as there is no sharp distinction possible between these and macroscopic objects. Observation cannot ''create'' an element of reality like a position, there must be something contained in the complete description of physical reality which corresponds to the ''possibility'' of observing a position, already before the observation has been actually made.\" I hope, that I quoted Einstein correctly; it is always difficult to quote somebody out of memory with whom one does not agree. It is precisely this kind of postulate which I call the ideal of the detached observer.\n*Letter from Pauli to Niels Bohr, February 15, 1955<ref>{{cite book|editor=Enz, Charles P.|editor2=Meyenn, Karl von|title=Writings on physics and philosophy by Wolfgang Pauli|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1994|page=43|postscript=; translated by Robert Schlapp|isbn=3-540-56859-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueTd4g7pc5MC&pg=PA43}}</ref>}}\n===Einstein's slit===\nThe first of Einstein's [[thought experiment]]s challenging the uncertainty principle went as follows:\n\n:Consider a particle passing through a slit of width {{mvar|d}}. The slit introduces an uncertainty in momentum of approximately {{mvar|{{sfrac|h|d}}}} because the particle passes through the wall. But let us determine the momentum of the particle by measuring the recoil of the wall. In doing so, we find the momentum of the particle to arbitrary accuracy by conservation of momentum.\n\nBohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy {{math|\u0394''p''}}, the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through. This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''h''|\u0394''p''}}}}, and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.\n\nA similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>Feynman lectures on Physics, vol 3, 2\u20132</ref>\n\n===Einstein's box===\nBohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as [[Einstein's box]]. Einstein argued that \"Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to [[Planck's constant]].\"<ref name=\"Gamow\">Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p.260.</ref> Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely. The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape. \"We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 282.</ref> \"Now, weigh the box again. The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light. In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle.\"<ref name=\"Gamow\" />\n\nBohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed. He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, \"since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table. ... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock,\"<ref>Gamow, G., ''The great physicists from Galileo to Einstein'', Courier Dover, 1988, p. 260\u2013261.</ref> because of Einstein's own theory of [[Gravitational time dilation|gravity's effect on time]].\n\"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape.\"<ref>Kumar, M., ''Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality'', Icon, 2009, p. 287.</ref>\n\n===EPR paradox for entangled particles===\nBohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein. In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see [[EPR paradox]]) published an analysis of widely separated [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] particles. Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed. This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.<ref>{{Citation |first=Walter |last=Isaacson |year=2007 |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=[https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 452] |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/einsteinhislifeu0000isaa/page/452 }}</ref>\n\nBut Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment. He believed the \"natural basic assumption\" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from \"locally changing deterministic quantities\" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.\n\nIn 1964, [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments. Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his ''hidden variables''. These hidden variables may be \"hidden\" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.  This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.  This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.  Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.  Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking....Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophy of [[Falsifiability|invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments]]. That is to say, here Einstein's \"basic assumption\" became falsified by [[Bell test experiments|experiments based on Bell's inequalities]]. For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.\n\nWhile it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact [[David Bohm]] invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables were not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption\u2014that the [[size of the observable universe]] puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a [[quantum computer]] would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially [[Shor's algorithm|achievable task]] in quantum mechanics.<ref>[[Gerardus 't Hooft]] has at times advocated this point of view.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Popper's criticism ===\n{{main article|Popper's experiment}}\n[[Karl Popper]] approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and [[Philosophical realism|metaphysical realist]].<ref name=\"Popper1959\">{{Citation | last1 = Popper | first1 = Karl | authorlink1 = Karl Popper | title = The Logic of Scientific Discovery | publisher = Hutchinson & Co. | year = 1959| title-link = The Logic of Scientific Discovery }}</ref> He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to [[Quantum ensemble|ensembles]] of identically prepared particles, referring to them as \"statistical scatter relations\".<ref name=\"Popper1959\" /><ref name=\"Jarvie2006\">{{Citation | last1 = Jarvie | first1 = Ian Charles | last2 = Milford | first2 = Karl | last3 = Miller | first3 = David W | title = Karl Popper: a centenary assessment | volume = 3 | publisher = Ashgate Publishing | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-7546-5712-5}}</ref> In this statistical interpretation, a ''particular'' measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory. This directly contrasts with the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which is [[Determinism|non-deterministic]] but lacks local hidden variables.\n\nIn 1934, Popper published ''Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen'' (''Critique of the Uncertainty Relations'') in ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'',<ref name=\"Popper1934\">{{Citation | title = Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen (Critique of the Uncertainty Relations) | journal = Naturwissenschaften | year = 1934 | first = Karl | last = Popper | author2 = Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker | volume = 22 | issue = 48 | pages = 807\u2013808 | doi=10.1007/BF01496543|bibcode = 1934NW.....22..807P | postscript = . }}</ref> and in the same year ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|Logik der Forschung]]'' (translated and updated by the author as ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' in 1959), outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation. In 1982, he further developed his theory in ''Quantum theory and the schism in Physics'', writing:\n<blockquote>[Heisenberg's] formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable ''statistical formulae'' of the quantum theory. But they have been ''habitually misinterpreted'' by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the ''precision of our measurements''.

His mother was Djouber Azzouz, and his father was Ahmed Haddouche. Ahmed was a soldier in the French army during the [[Algerian war]], and in 1962, like many [[harkis]], Ahmed was evacuated with his family to France. In Beauvais, [[Oise]], he found a job as a specialized worker at the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] factory, where, after becoming alcoholic and very violent, was dismissed from his job. Jacquy was born on February 19, 1964, in a family where he was the third of twelve children. He was educated at George Sand College, and was considered intelligent and sensitive, but also unstable, aggressive, impulsive, intolerant, manipulative and unable to take frustration.</span><ref name=\"parisien6\">[http://www.leparisien.fr/oise/l-itineraire-cauchemardesque-de-jacquy-haddouche-24-04-2008-3298458234.php \"The nightmare itinerary of Jacquy Haddouche\"] Article by David Livois published on April 24, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien Le Parisien]''</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the juvenile judge placed him in a guarded education center in [[M\u00e9ru]], where he escaped regularly to join the family housing. It is there that at sixteen, he lived through a traumatic scene. Unable to support his wife's divorce proceedings, Ahmed Haddouche committed suicide by shooting himself in the head in front of Jacquy.<ref name=\"parisien4\">[http://www.leparisien.fr/oise/un-proces-fleuve-pour-jacquy-haddouche-23-04-2008-3298456175.php \"A river trial for Jacquy Haddouche\"] Article published on April 23, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien Le Parisien]''</ref> He was splashed by his father's blood and his father's body fell on him. Traumatized, he then left school, sunk into delinquency and became a substance abuser.\n\nCondemned and incarcerated several times, Jacquy Haddouche married in 1988, in [[Liancourt]], at the instigation of his mother, which allowed him to obtain a reduction of his sentence. His ex-wife regretted the eight months that their marriage lasted.\n\n== Early crimes ==\nIn 1981, he committed a gang rape with a legionnaire older than him. He was sentenced to five years in prison by the cour d'assises for minors.\n\nIn 1986, he was sentenced to eight years in prison for a violent robbery.\n\nIn 1993, he was sentenced to six months in prison for burglary.\n\nIn 1996, he was sentenced to three months, four months and six months in prison for theft, aggravated theft and counterfeiting.\n\nIn 1997, he was sentenced to two years in prison for fraud and aggravated theft.\n\nIn 1998, he was sentenced to six years in prison for robbery, his victim surviving poisoning with drugs.\n\n== Facts and investigation ==\nOn November 30, 1992, in the early evening, in Beauvais, Haddouche met in an elevator 45-year-old Gilles Canette, a divorced and depressed French teacher. They talked for a bit, and Canette invited Haddouche in his apartment. Around 19:00, two boys, pupils of Gilles, came to talk to him. The teenagers noticed that Haddouche behaved oddly, seemingly inspecting the rooms of the apartment. They left around 20:00. Haddouche spent the evening with Gilles, eventually poisoning him with an [[antidepressant]], [[cyamemazine]], and then asphyxiating him. At midnight, the credit card of Gilles Canette was used at a vending machine, which was odd, considering that when Gilles wanted money from his account, he would always withdraw it at the bank counter, and he never used his card to the distributor. Early in the morning of December 1, 1992, Haddouche went to see the two teenagers at their home and threatened them to deny seeing him at Gilles' the night before. On December 1, 1992, Gilles was discovered naked on his bed by his cleaning lady. Police found a fingerprint of Haddouche on a bottle of strawberry syrup, and he was suspected of murder. He admitted to having gone to Canette's house, but not on the date of the murder. On December 13, 1993, Haddouche was taken into custody, but denied the accusations and declared that he was in the [[Paris]] region with his companion: Clo\u00e9. Clo\u00e9 arrived conveniently at the police station and confirmed the alibi. When the police asked her for clarification, she refused to answer questions and left the police station. In his cell in custody, Haddouche made a suicide attempt by hurting his veins with his lighter and was hospitalized. The period of custody being over and the police not having enough evidence to convict Haddouche, the court abandoned the prosecution against him and closed the case.\n\nAt the end of May 1995, at the ''Charlie Brown'' bar on Guy Patin street in Beauvais, Francine C., a pedagogical director in a medical-educational institute, was with a group of friends. Haddouche joined the group and befriended them. At the beginning of June 1995, Haddouche went to Francine on Nicolas Pastour Street, but she refused to let him in. He knocked on the front door so hard that she finally decided to open it and let him in. He told her that he was exhausted because he had just finished a guard at [[M\u00e9ru]]'s hospital. Compassionate, she offered him some coffee which he asked for. When he finished, she told him to leave, but Haddouche refused, and told him that Clo\u00e9, his now former companion, was with Frederick, a former friend. He took her to the room, raped her and left. She threw the sheets and washed with bleach the places where Haddouche was at her place. During the following weeks, Haddouche harassed her on the phone and kept watch in front of her door. She did not dare to complain and sunk into depression.<ref name=\"obsbeauv4\">[http://www.lobservateurdebeauvais.fr/2008/05/09/proces-haddouche-le-viol-commis-a-beauvais-en-1995/ \"Haddouche trial: The rape committed in Beauvais in 1995\"] Article published on May 9, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Observateur_de_Beauvais L'Observateur de Beauvais]''</ref>\n\nIn June 2002 in Beauvais, Haddouche reconnected with Isabelle, whom he had originally met in 1991 and pretended he was a doctor, and they began a brief relationship. One evening, an alcoholic Haddouche struck Isabelle in the face in the presence of her daughter. He called her the next day and asked her to bring him some heart medicine, claiming that he was dying. When Isabelle arrived, he raped her.<ref name=\"parisien7\">[http://www.leparisien.fr/oise/jacquy-haddouche-un-homme-seducteur-et-violent-26-04-2008-3298462776.php \"Jacquy Haddouche, a seductive man...and violent\"] Article by David Livois published on April 26, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien Le Parisien]''</ref>\n\nOn June 20, 2002, around 7pm, Haddouche entered the SONACOTRA home on d'Anjou Street in the Argentinian district of Beauvais. Around 8 pm, he forced open the door to the studio of L\u00e9o Capon, a 73-year-old retiree. Haddouche attacked and slaughtered Leo Capon, searching the apartment and stealing objects of little value. Nervous, L\u00e9o's daughter, Daniele, went to her mother's house. She was surprised that the front door was unlocked. When she entered, everything had been searched and all the objects were upside down. There were many traces of blood on the floor, and garbage bags filled with various objects near the front door. Capon was lying on her back, in the bathroom, her face covered with pieces of cardboard. On the video surveillance strips of the building, a balding man carrying full bags in each hand and a cap hiding his face was visible. Because of the poor quality images, he could not be identified. Male DNA was discovered on various objects at L\u00e9o's house, but it was not listed in [[FNAEG]]. Capon was disfigured by the blows she had received, and forensic scientists established that she had died by choking on her own blood.\n\nOn July 4, 2002, in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], Haddouche entered the apartment of Liliane D, the owner of a bar. He hit and tried to rape her, but was unsuccessful.\n\nOn July 15, 2002, at the bar  ''L'endroit'' in [[Saint-Etienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]], Sylvain Rome, a 32-year-old cameraman, sympathized with Haddouche at the counter. Around 16h, they left the bar together, Sylvain later buying drinks at the [[superette]] next to his home. Around 17h, David Sabido, a friend of Sylvain, rang at his apartment, but Sylvain made him understand that he's bothering him and refused to let Sabido in. Haddouche later poisoned Sylvain with [[Bromazepam]] and stabbed him. He cleaned the apartment, stole a checkbook, the mobile phone, Sylvain's identity papers and the keys to the apartment. On July 27, 2002, Sylvain Rome's father discovered him lying on his stomach on his bed.\n\nThe investigators established that Sylvain had a high blood alcohol level, was not depressed and did not consume antidepressants. A [[facial composite]] was made thanks to the descriptions of the bartender and Lucien Florent, a customer of the bar, with whom Haddouche discussed a little before meeting Sylvain.\n\nAt the end of August 2002, Haddouche seduced Nathalie, a young beneficiary of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|RMI]], to whom he introduced himself as a doctor at the hospital center of Beauvais where hosted. After a week, while they were drinking, Haddouche drugged, without Nathalie's knowledge, her second glass of [[Kir (cocktail)|kir]]. She became uncomfortable and was hospitalized. He stole her bank card and the amount of Nathalie's RMI.\n\nIn September 2002, Haddouche tried to make contact with Francine, whom  had decided to file a complaint against him for the 1995 rape.\n\nOn September 13, 2002, in the Argentinean district of Beauvais, Liliane Michaud, 82, was returning from the supermarket ''[[Intermarch\u00e9]]'' with her [[Walker (mobility)|walker]]. Arriving at her pavilion, Haddouche attacked her, savagely beating her and stealing her wallet. When the investigators described the abuser to the supermarket security agents, they positively identified Jacquy Haddouche.\n\nOn September 30, 2002, the police filed a convocation against Haddouche, who did not attend.\n\n== Arrest ==\nOn October 2, 2002, a little after 11pm, in [[Gard]], Haddouche tried to break into the station by breaking a window. A security guard noticed him and alerted police officers on patrol. They later spotted the drunk Haddouche, who resisted their arrest. He claimed to be a [[kinesiotherapist]] and that his name was Sa\u00efd Haddouche. By passing his fingerprints to the automated fingerprint file, the police discovered that his first name is Jacquy, not Sa\u00efd. By passing his name to the wanted persons file, the police learned that he was wanted for murder in Beauvais.\n\nLater, Liliane Michaud formally recognized Jacquy Haddouche.\n\nOn December 3, 2002, Haddouche was indicted for the murder of L\u00e9o Capon, but he denied it. Objects stolen from her home were found by the police when they searched his home. Haddouche then accused his roommate of being the murderer.\n\nIn 2003, Clo\u00e9 confessed to the investigating judge that she had lied, because in December 1992, she did not know Haddouche yet. She only met him while she was studying in Beauvais.\n\nThe telephone records showed that Haddouche's mobile phone was detected by the [[cell site]] that covered the area where Sylvain Rome's apartment was on the date of the murder. In custody in St. Etienne, Haddouche recognized that it was mid July 2002 came to visit members of his family. In 2003, during the [[police lineup]] behind a [[beam splitter]], Lucien Florent formally identified Haddouche. He finally admitted that he met Sylvain at the bar, but said that he had never been to his house.\n\nHaddouche admitted to having met Francine C. at the bar ''Charlie Brown'', but denied having gone to her home. He declared that the complaint for rape against him was a revenge on the part of the latter, because he did not give her the narcotics which she had ordered from him for an amount of 30 000 francs.\n\n== List of known victims ==\n{| class=\"wikitable centre\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Date\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Place\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Identity\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\" |Age\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Profession / Activity\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Facts\n! scope=\"col\" |Discovery\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |November 30, 1992\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |December 1, 1992\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |[[Beauvais]]\n| style=\"background:LightSalmon\" |Gilles Canette\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |45\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |French teacher\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |June 1995\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |September 2002\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Beauvais\n|Francine C.\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |?\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Educational Director of an IME\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |June 20, 2002\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |June 21, 2002\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Beauvais\n| style=\"background:LightSalmon\" |L\u00e9o Capon\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |73\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Retired\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |July 4, 2002\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |2002\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |[[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]\n|Liliane D.\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |?\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Bar owner\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |July 15, 2002\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |July 27, 2002\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |[[Saint-\u00c9tienne]]\n| style=\"background:LightSalmon\" |Sylvain Rome\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |32\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Cameraman\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |September 13, 2002\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |September 13, 2002\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Beauvais\n|Liliane Michaud\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |82\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Retired\n|}\n\n== Trial and conviction ==\nJacquy Haddouche was sentenced by the [[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|tribunal correctionnel]] to 8 years in prison, for the attack on Liliane Michaud.\n\nThe defense of Jacquy Haddouche was provided by lawyers Karim Beylouni and Julien Vernet.\n\nIn 2007, the trial of Jacquy Haddouche began at the cour d'assises of the Loire in Saint-Etienne.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Buffard was the lawyer of the family of Sylvain Rome.\n\nIn March 2007, Jacquy Haddouche was sentenced to 30 years in prison, with a 20-year lock-in period for the murder of Sylvain Rome.

He was convicted of three murders committed between 1992 and 2002, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 22-year lock-in period.<ref name=\"parisien16\">[http://www.leparisien.fr/oise-60/le-tueur-en-serie-meurt-en-prison-27-10-2010-1125184.php \"The serial killer dies in prison] Article published on October 27, 2010, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien Le Parisien]''</ref><ref name=\"obsbeauv6\">[http://www.lobservateurdebeauvais.fr/2010/10/27/beauvais-mort-de-jacquy-haddouche-en-prison/ \"Beauvais: death of Jacquy Haddouche in prison\"] Article published on October 27, 2010, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Observateur_de_Beauvais L'Observateur de Beauvais]''</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n<span class=\"cx-segment\" data-segmentid=\"156\">Haddouche was born to [[Algeria]]n parents. His mother was Djouber Azzouz, and his father was Ahmed Haddouche. Ahmed was a soldier in the French army during the [[Algerian war]], and in 1962, like many [[harkis]], Ahmed was evacuated with his family to France. In Beauvais, [[Oise]], he found a job as a specialized worker at the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] factory, where, after becoming alcoholic and very violent, was dismissed from his job. Jacquy was born on February 19, 1964, in a family where he was the third of twelve children. He was educated at George Sand College, and was considered intelligent and sensitive, but also unstable, aggressive, impulsive, intolerant, manipulative and unable to take frustration.</span><ref name=\"parisien6\">[http://www.leparisien.fr/oise/l-itineraire-cauchemardesque-de-jacquy-haddouche-24-04-2008-3298458234.php \"The nightmare itinerary of Jacquy Haddouche\"] Article by David Livois published on April 24, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien Le Parisien]''</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the juvenile judge placed him in a guarded education center in [[M\u00e9ru]], where he escaped regularly to join the family housing. It is there that at sixteen, he lived through a traumatic scene. Unable to support his wife's divorce proceedings, Ahmed Haddouche committed suicide by shooting himself in the head in front of Jacquy.<ref name=\"parisien4\">[http://www.leparisien.fr/oise/un-proces-fleuve-pour-jacquy-haddouche-23-04-2008-3298456175.php \"A river trial for Jacquy Haddouche\"] Article published on April 23, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien Le Parisien]''</ref> He was splashed by his father's blood and his father's body fell on him. Traumatized, he then left school, sunk into delinquency and became a substance abuser.\n\nCondemned and incarcerated several times, Jacquy Haddouche married in 1988, in [[Liancourt]], at the instigation of his mother, which allowed him to obtain a reduction of his sentence. His ex-wife regretted the eight months that their marriage lasted.\n\n== Early crimes ==\nIn 1981, he committed a gang rape with a legionnaire older than him. He was sentenced to five years in prison by the cour d'assises for minors.\n\nIn 1986, he was sentenced to eight years in prison for a violent robbery.\n\nIn 1993, he was sentenced to six months in prison for burglary.\n\nIn 1996, he was sentenced to three months, four months and six months in prison for theft, aggravated theft and counterfeiting.\n\nIn 1997, he was sentenced to two years in prison for fraud and aggravated theft.\n\nIn 1998, he was sentenced to six years in prison for robbery, his victim surviving poisoning with drugs.\n\n== Facts and investigation ==\nOn November 30, 1992, in the early evening, in Beauvais, Haddouche met in an elevator 45-year-old Gilles Canette, a divorced and depressed French teacher. They talked for a bit, and Canette invited Haddouche in his apartment. Around 19:00, two boys, pupils of Gilles, came to talk to him. The teenagers noticed that Haddouche behaved oddly, seemingly inspecting the rooms of the apartment. They left around 20:00. Haddouche spent the evening with Gilles, eventually poisoning him with an [[antidepressant]], [[cyamemazine]], and then asphyxiating him. At midnight, the credit card of Gilles Canette was used at a vending machine, which was odd, considering that when Gilles wanted money from his account, he would always withdraw it at the bank counter, and he never used his card to the distributor. Early in the morning of December 1, 1992, Haddouche went to see the two teenagers at their home and threatened them to deny seeing him at Gilles' the night before. On December 1, 1992, Gilles was discovered naked on his bed by his cleaning lady. Police found a fingerprint of Haddouche on a bottle of strawberry syrup, and he was suspected of murder. He admitted to having gone to Canette's house, but not on the date of the murder. On December 13, 1993, Haddouche was taken into custody, but denied the accusations and declared that he was in the [[Paris]] region with his companion: Clo\u00e9. Clo\u00e9 arrived conveniently at the police station and confirmed the alibi. When the police asked her for clarification, she refused to answer questions and left the police station. In his cell in custody, Haddouche made a suicide attempt by hurting his veins with his lighter and was hospitalized. The period of custody being over and the police not having enough evidence to convict Haddouche, the court abandoned the prosecution against him and closed the case.\n\nAt the end of May 1995, at the ''Charlie Brown'' bar on Guy Patin street in Beauvais, Francine C., a pedagogical director in a medical-educational institute, was with a group of friends. Haddouche joined the group and befriended them. At the beginning of June 1995, Haddouche went to Francine on Nicolas Pastour Street, but she refused to let him in. He knocked on the front door so hard that she finally decided to open it and let him in. He told her that he was exhausted because he had just finished a guard at [[M\u00e9ru]]'s hospital. Compassionate, she offered him some coffee which he asked for. When he finished, she told him to leave, but Haddouche refused, and told him that Clo\u00e9, his now former companion, was with Frederick, a former friend. He took her to the room, raped her and left. She threw the sheets and washed with bleach the places where Haddouche was at her place. During the following weeks, Haddouche harassed her on the phone and kept watch in front of her door. She did not dare to complain and sunk into depression.<ref name=\"obsbeauv4\">[http://www.lobservateurdebeauvais.fr/2008/05/09/proces-haddouche-le-viol-commis-a-beauvais-en-1995/ \"Haddouche trial: The rape committed in Beauvais in 1995\"] Article published on May 9, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Observateur_de_Beauvais L'Observateur de Beauvais]''</ref>\n\nIn June 2002 in Beauvais, Haddouche reconnected with Isabelle, whom he had originally met in 1991 and pretended he was a doctor, and they began a brief relationship. One evening, an alcoholic Haddouche struck Isabelle in the face in the presence of her daughter. He called her the next day and asked her to bring him some heart medicine, claiming that he was dying. When Isabelle arrived, he raped her.<ref name=\"parisien7\">[http://www.leparisien.fr/oise/jacquy-haddouche-un-homme-seducteur-et-violent-26-04-2008-3298462776.php \"Jacquy Haddouche, a seductive man...and violent\"] Article by David Livois published on April 26, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien Le Parisien]''</ref>\n\nOn June 20, 2002, around 7pm, Haddouche entered the SONACOTRA home on d'Anjou Street in the Argentinian district of Beauvais. Around 8 pm, he forced open the door to the studio of L\u00e9o Capon, a 73-year-old retiree. Haddouche attacked and slaughtered Leo Capon, searching the apartment and stealing objects of little value. Nervous, L\u00e9o's daughter, Daniele, went to her mother's house. She was surprised that the front door was unlocked. When she entered, everything had been searched and all the objects were upside down. There were many traces of blood on the floor, and garbage bags filled with various objects near the front door. Capon was lying on her back, in the bathroom, her face covered with pieces of cardboard. On the video surveillance strips of the building, a balding man carrying full bags in each hand and a cap hiding his face was visible. Because of the poor quality images, he could not be identified. Male DNA was discovered on various objects at L\u00e9o's house, but it was not listed in [[FNAEG]]. Capon was disfigured by the blows she had received, and forensic scientists established that she had died by choking on her own blood.\n\nOn July 4, 2002, in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], Haddouche entered the apartment of Liliane D, the owner of a bar. He hit and tried to rape her, but was unsuccessful.\n\nOn July 15, 2002, at the bar  ''L'endroit'' in [[Saint-Etienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]], Sylvain Rome, a 32-year-old cameraman, sympathized with Haddouche at the counter. Around 16h, they left the bar together, Sylvain later buying drinks at the [[superette]] next to his home. Around 17h, David Sabido, a friend of Sylvain, rang at his apartment, but Sylvain made him understand that he's bothering him and refused to let Sabido in. Haddouche later poisoned Sylvain with [[Bromazepam]] and stabbed him. He cleaned the apartment, stole a checkbook, the mobile phone, Sylvain's identity papers and the keys to the apartment. On July 27, 2002, Sylvain Rome's father discovered him lying on his stomach on his bed.\n\nThe investigators established that Sylvain had a high blood alcohol level, was not depressed and did not consume antidepressants. A [[facial composite]] was made thanks to the descriptions of the bartender and Lucien Florent, a customer of the bar, with whom Haddouche discussed a little before meeting Sylvain.\n\nAt the end of August 2002, Haddouche seduced Nathalie, a young beneficiary of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|RMI]], to whom he introduced himself as a doctor at the hospital center of Beauvais where hosted. After a week, while they were drinking, Haddouche drugged, without Nathalie's knowledge, her second glass of [[Kir (cocktail)|kir]]. She became uncomfortable and was hospitalized. He stole her bank card and the amount of Nathalie's RMI.\n\nIn September 2002, Haddouche tried to make contact with Francine, whom  had decided to file a complaint against him for the 1995 rape.\n\nOn September 13, 2002, in the Argentinean district of Beauvais, Liliane Michaud, 82, was returning from the supermarket ''[[Intermarch\u00e9]]'' with her [[Walker (mobility)|walker]]. Arriving at her pavilion, Haddouche attacked her, savagely beating her and stealing her wallet. When the investigators described the abuser to the supermarket security agents, they positively identified Jacquy Haddouche.\n\nOn September 30, 2002, the police filed a convocation against Haddouche, who did not attend.\n\n== Arrest ==\nOn October 2, 2002, a little after 11pm, in [[Gard]], Haddouche tried to break into the station by breaking a window. A security guard noticed him and alerted police officers on patrol. They later spotted the drunk Haddouche, who resisted their arrest. He claimed to be a [[kinesiotherapist]] and that his name was Sa\u00efd Haddouche. By passing his fingerprints to the automated fingerprint file, the police discovered that his first name is Jacquy, not Sa\u00efd. By passing his name to the wanted persons file, the police learned that he was wanted for murder in Beauvais.\n\nLater, Liliane Michaud formally recognized Jacquy Haddouche.\n\nOn December 3, 2002, Haddouche was indicted for the murder of L\u00e9o Capon, but he denied it. Objects stolen from her home were found by the police when they searched his home. Haddouche then accused his roommate of being the murderer.\n\nIn 2003, Clo\u00e9 confessed to the investigating judge that she had lied, because in December 1992, she did not know Haddouche yet. She only met him while she was studying in Beauvais.\n\nThe telephone records showed that Haddouche's mobile phone was detected by the [[cell site]] that covered the area where Sylvain Rome's apartment was on the date of the murder. In custody in St. Etienne, Haddouche recognized that it was mid July 2002 came to visit members of his family. In 2003, during the [[police lineup]] behind a [[beam splitter]], Lucien Florent formally identified Haddouche. He finally admitted that he met Sylvain at the bar, but said that he had never been to his house.\n\nHaddouche admitted to having met Francine C. at the bar ''Charlie Brown'', but denied having gone to her home. He declared that the complaint for rape against him was a revenge on the part of the latter, because he did not give her the narcotics which she had ordered from him for an amount of 30 000 francs.\n\n== List of known victims ==\n{| class=\"wikitable centre\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Date\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Place\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Identity\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\" |Age\n! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Profession / Activity\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Facts\n! scope=\"col\" |Discovery\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |November 30, 1992\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |December 1, 1992\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |[[Beauvais]]\n| style=\"background:LightSalmon\" |Gilles Canette\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |45\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |French teacher\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |June 1995\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |September 2002\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Beauvais\n|Francine C.\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |?\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Educational Director of an IME\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |June 20, 2002\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |June 21, 2002\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Beauvais\n| style=\"background:LightSalmon\" |L\u00e9o Capon\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |73\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Retired\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |July 4, 2002\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |2002\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |[[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]\n|Liliane D.\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |?\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Bar owner\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |July 15, 2002\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |July 27, 2002\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |[[Saint-\u00c9tienne]]\n| style=\"background:LightSalmon\" |Sylvain Rome\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |32\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Cameraman\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |September 13, 2002\n| scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |September 13, 2002\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Beauvais\n|Liliane Michaud\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |82\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" |Retired\n|}\n\n== Trial and conviction ==\nJacquy Haddouche was sentenced by the [[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|tribunal correctionnel]] to 8 years in prison, for the attack on Liliane Michaud.\n\nThe defense of Jacquy Haddouche was provided by lawyers Karim Beylouni and Julien Vernet.\n\nIn 2007, the trial of Jacquy Haddouche began at the cour d'assises of the Loire in Saint-Etienne.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Buffard was the lawyer of the family of Sylvain Rome.\n\nIn March 2007, Jacquy Haddouche was sentenced to 30 years in prison, with a 20-year lock-in period for the murder of Sylvain Rome.

Masters]] (a pseudonym used by different writers), originally published from 1983\u20131985, by Meadowbrook Press.  The series was republished in 1992, 2006-2007 by Spotlight (ABDO Publishing Company) and most recently in 2013 by Meadowbrook Press as '''Can You Solve The Mystery?'''.\n\n==Style==\nSimilar in style to [[Encyclopedia Brown]], readers are given clues in the form of narration.  An important distinction from the Encyclopedia Brown series is the graphical picture included for each story, presented as a sketch by \"Hawkeye\" Collins of the [[crime scene|scene of the crime]], which provide the necessary hint to solve the puzzle.\n\nCollins and Adams are neighbours who live across from each other on Crestview Drive in the fictional town of Lakewood Hills, [[Minnesota]].  Collins is described as having excellent observation prowess and able to carry out a quick but comprehensive sketch of the scene of the crime which capture vital clues to solving the mystery.  Adams is an athletic red-haired girl who is described as \"quick of mind, quick of feet and quick of temper\".\n\nIt was mentioned that Hawkeye's father is a lawyer and his mother a real-estate agent.

The articles were shown to be from page 2A and 4A of the publication, dated Thursday, March 17, 1983.\n\nThe article narrated the backgrounds of Hawkeye and Amy, specifying they were 12 years old attending sixth grade in Lakewood Hills Elementary.  Hawkeye's father was named as attorney Peter Collins, and his mother real-estate agent Linda Collins.\n\nThe story went on to report Hawkeye and Amy started in the detective business the year before, solving a crime in their own school, and impressing police sergeant Treadwell.\n\nThe next page showed a letter from Hawkeye and Amy inviting readers to solve the mysteries in the book by reading carefully, and then to look closely at the picture provided.\n\nThe solutions to the mysteries are found at the end of the book, printed in mirror image.\n\nWhile most of the books in the series are self-contained and composed of mini-mysteries, several of the books contained different portions of the same case.

He is also fond of snacking, despite being told to go on a diet several times by his doctor, Amy's mother.\n*'''Mrs. Ratchet''' - a grumpy woman who hated any form of intrusion to her residence.  Unfortunately, her house is across the park and has been the deliberate or unwitting target of numerous trespasses, and the cause of a number of puzzles for Hawkeye and Amy.\n* '''Nosey''' - Hawkeye's female [[golden retriever]].\n\n==Places/Organizations==\n* '''Bytes of Data Computer Club''' - The computer club of Lakewood Hills Elementary, which both Hawkeye and Amy were members of.\n\n==Books in the series==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ '''Can you solve the mystery? : Hawkeye Collins & Amy Adams in ...'''\n|-\n!No.\n!Title\n!Cases\n!Year published\n!ISBN\n|-\n| 01 || The Secret of the Long-Lost Cousin & other mysteries ||\n# The Secret of the Long-Lost Cousin\n# The Case of the Disappearing Diamonds\n# The Mystery of the Helpful Professor\n# The Case of the Daisy Dispute\n# The Case of the Bouncing Check\n# The Mystery of the Hardware Heist\n# The Case of Lucy's Lost Lemonade\n# The Mystery of the Missing Money\n# The Case of the Bashed Boss\n# The Secret of the Ancient Treasure.

In addition, consideration will be given to arrangements whereby private and other national air assets could be employed where appropriate or necessary.''</blockquote>\n\n==History==\nAfter commissioning in 1994 the first aircraft of the force were six Cessna 02A donated by the United States government. The [[US]] also offered two advisors to train four pilots, six co-pilots and seven Namibian Mechanics.<ref>https://www.namibian.com.na/archive_pdf_19851990/1994_TheNamibian/21%20December%201994.pdf</ref> In December 1994 a total of  four Cheetah and Chetak light utility helicopters bought from [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited|HAL]] where delivered to the then Air Wing at [[Eros Airport]]. The Indian air force also provided a chief engineer, five technicians and two pilots to train Namibian crews for at least six months. Two [[Harbin]] Y-12's  were delivered in December 1997.\n\n==Aircraft==\n[[File:Namibian Air Force F7 (cropped).jpg |thumb|right| An F-7 on take off]]\n[[File:Namibian Air Force - Harbin Y12-II.jpg|thumb|right| A Harbin Y12 on final approach]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\"|Aircraft\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left; background:#acc;\"|Variant\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\"|In service\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"|Notes\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | [[Military aircraft#Combat aircraft|Combat Aircraft]]\n|-\n| [[Chengdu J-7|Chengdu F-7]]\n| [[China]]\n|fighter\n| \n| 6<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\">{{cite web |last = |first = |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-world-air-forces-maintaining-strength-443655/|title = World Air Forces 2018 |work= |publisher= Flightglobal Insight |year= 2018 |doi = |accessdate= 7 November 2018}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | [[Military transport aircraft|Transport]]\n|-\n|[[Harbin Y-12]]\n| [[China]]\n|transport\n|\n|2<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/> \n|\n|-\n|[[Antonov An-12]]\n|[[Ukraine]]\n|transport\n|\n|1<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n|\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | [[Helicopters]]\n|-\n|[[Mil Mi-8]]\n| [[Russia]]\n|utility / transport\n|\n|2<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n|\n|-\n|[[Mil Mi-24]]\n|[[Russia]]\n|attack\n|\n|2<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n| \n|-\n|[[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II]]\n| [[France]]\n|liaison / utility\n|\n|1<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n|\n|-\n|[[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III]]\n| [[France]]\n|liaison / utility\n|\n|3<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n|\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | [[Trainer (aircraft)|Trainer Aircraft]]\n|-\n| [[Hongdu JL-8]]\n| [[China]] / [[Pakistan]]\n|jet trainer\n|[[Hongdu JL-8#Variants|K-8]]\n| 9<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n| \n|-\n| [[Chengdu J-7|Chengdu F-7]]\n| [[People's Republic of China]]\n| jet trainer\n| [[Chengdu J-7#Variants|FT-7]]\n| 11<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n|license-built [[MiG-21]]\n|}\n\n===Aircraft Accidents===\n\nThe Air Force has suffered a number of aircraft incidents and accidents.

neuralgia]]\nThis disorder is characterized by episodes of severe facial pain along the trigeminal nerve divisions. The trigeminal nerve is a paired [[cranial nerve]] that has three major branches: the [[ophthalmic nerve]] (V<sub>1</sub>), the [[maxillary nerve]] (V<sub>2</sub>), and the [[mandibular nerve]] (V<sub>3</sub>). One, two, or all three branches of the nerve may be affected. Trigeminal neuralgia most commonly involves the middle branch (the [[maxillary nerve]] or V<sub>2</sub>) and lower branch ([[mandibular nerve]] or V<sub>3</sub>) of the trigeminal nerve.<ref>[http://www.neurosurgery.ufl.edu/clinical-specialties/images/trigeminal_neuralgia_brochure_for_web.pdf Trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215115952/http://www.neurosurgery.ufl.edu/clinical-specialties/images/trigeminal_neuralgia_brochure_for_web.pdf |date=February 15, 2012 }} by UF&Shands \u2013 The University of Florida Health System. Retrieved Mars 2012</ref>\n\nAn individual attack usually lasts from a few seconds to several minutes or hours, but these can repeat for hours with very short intervals between attacks. In other instances, only 4-10 attacks are experienced daily. The episodes of intense pain may occur [[paroxysm]]ally. To describe the pain sensation, people often describe a trigger area on the face so sensitive that touching or even air currents can trigger an episode; however, in many people, the pain is generated spontaneously without any apparent stimulation. It affects lifestyle as it can be triggered by common activities such as eating, talking, shaving and brushing teeth. The wind, chewing, and talking can aggravate the condition in many patients. The attacks are said by those affected to feel like stabbing [[electric shock]]s, burning, sharp, pressing, crushing, exploding or shooting pain that becomes intractable.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe pain also tends to occur in cycles with remissions lasting months or even years. 1\u20136% of cases occur on both sides of the face but extremely rare for both to be affected at the same time. This normally indicates problems with both trigeminal nerves, since one serves strictly the left side of the face and the other serves the right side.

The pain is usually constant and can also give off a tingling, numbness sensation. This pain is due to unintentional damage to one or more of the trigeminal nerves from trauma, oral surgery, dentistry work, etc. It is difficult to treat but sufferers are usually given the same anticonvulsant and tricyclics antidepressant medicines as with the other types of neuralgias. Surgical options are DREZ (dorsal root entry zone) lesion and MCS or Motor Cortex Stimulation.\n\nTN needs to be distinguished from other forms of unilateral pain which may be related to damage to the trigeminal nerve by trauma from surgery, accidents or - in rare cases - dental extractions. This is often termed painful trigeminal neuropathy or post-traumatic neuropathy as some sensory changes can be noted e.g. decrease in pain sensation or temperature. This is important as different care pathways are used.  Trigeminal pain can also occur after an attack of herpes zoster, and post-herpetic neuralgia has the same manifestations as in other parts of the body. Trigeminal deafferentation pain (TDP), also termed anesthesia dolorosa, is from intentional damage to a trigeminal nerve following attempts to surgically fix a nerve problem. This pain is usually constant with a burning sensation and numbness. TDP is very difficult to treat as further surgeries are usually ineffective and possibly detrimental to the person.\n\n==Causes==\nThe trigeminal nerve is a mixed cranial nerve responsible for sensory data such as [[tactition]] (pressure), [[thermoception]] (temperature), and [[nociception]] (pain) originating from the face above the jawline; it is also responsible for the motor function of the [[muscles of mastication]], the muscles involved in chewing but not facial expression.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nSeveral theories exist to explain the possible causes of this [[pain]] syndrome. It was once believed that the nerve was compressed in the opening from the inside to the outside of the skull; but leading research indicates that it is an enlarged or lengthened blood vessel \u2013 most commonly the [[superior cerebellar artery]] \u2013 compressing or throbbing against the microvasculature of the trigeminal nerve near its connection with the [[pons]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nurmikko|first1=T.

neuralgia]]\nThis disorder is characterized by episodes of severe facial pain along the trigeminal nerve divisions. The trigeminal nerve is a paired [[cranial nerve]] that has three major branches: the [[ophthalmic nerve]] (V<sub>1</sub>), the [[maxillary nerve]] (V<sub>2</sub>), and the [[mandibular nerve]] (V<sub>3</sub>). One, two, or all three branches of the nerve may be affected. Trigeminal neuralgia most commonly involves the middle branch (the [[maxillary nerve]] or V<sub>2</sub>) and lower branch ([[mandibular nerve]] or V<sub>3</sub>) of the trigeminal nerve.<ref>[http://www.neurosurgery.ufl.edu/clinical-specialties/images/trigeminal_neuralgia_brochure_for_web.pdf Trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215115952/http://www.neurosurgery.ufl.edu/clinical-specialties/images/trigeminal_neuralgia_brochure_for_web.pdf |date=February 15, 2012 }} by UF&Shands \u2013 The University of Florida Health System. Retrieved Mars 2012</ref>\n\nAn individual attack usually lasts from a few seconds to several minutes or hours, but these can repeat for hours with very short intervals between attacks. In other instances, only 4-10 attacks are experienced daily. The episodes of intense pain may occur [[paroxysm]]ally. To describe the pain sensation, people often describe a trigger area on the face so sensitive that touching or even air currents can trigger an episode; however, in many people, the pain is generated spontaneously without any apparent stimulation. It affects lifestyle as it can be triggered by common activities such as eating, talking, shaving and brushing teeth. The wind, chewing, and talking can aggravate the condition in many patients. The attacks are said by those affected to feel like stabbing [[electric shock]]s, burning, sharp, pressing, crushing, exploding or shooting pain that becomes intractable.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe pain also tends to occur in cycles with remissions lasting months or even years. 1\u20136% of cases occur on both sides of the face but extremely rare for both to be affected at the same time. This normally indicates problems with both trigeminal nerves, since one serves strictly the left side of the face and the other serves the right side. Pain attacks are known to worsen in frequency or severity over time, in some people. Pain may migrate to other branches over time but in some people remains very stable.<ref name=\"Bayer1979\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Bayer DB, Stenger TG |title=Trigeminal neuralgia: an overview|journal=Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol|volume=48|issue=5|pages=393\u20139|year=1979|pmid=226915|doi=10.1016/0030-4220(79)90064-1}}</ref>\n\nRapid spreading of the pain, bilateral involvement or simultaneous participation with other major nerve trunks (such as Painful Tic Convulsif of nerves V & VII or occurrence of symptoms in the V and IX nerves) may suggest a systemic cause.

The pain is usually constant and can also give off a tingling, numbness sensation. This pain is due to unintentional damage to one or more of the trigeminal nerves from trauma, oral surgery, dentistry work, etc. It is difficult to treat but sufferers are usually given the same anticonvulsant and tricyclics antidepressant medicines as with the other types of neuralgias. Surgical options are DREZ (dorsal root entry zone) lesion and MCS or Motor Cortex Stimulation.\n\nTN needs to be distinguished from other forms of unilateral pain which may be related to damage to the trigeminal nerve by trauma from surgery, accidents or - in rare cases - dental extractions. This is often termed painful trigeminal neuropathy or post-traumatic neuropathy as some sensory changes can be noted e.g. decrease in pain sensation or temperature. This is important as different care pathways are used.  Trigeminal pain can also occur after an attack of herpes zoster, and post-herpetic neuralgia has the same manifestations as in other parts of the body. Trigeminal deafferentation pain (TDP), also termed anesthesia dolorosa, is from intentional damage to a trigeminal nerve following attempts to surgically fix a nerve problem. This pain is usually constant with a burning sensation and numbness. TDP is very difficult to treat as further surgeries are usually ineffective and possibly detrimental to the person.\n\n==Causes==\nThe trigeminal nerve is a mixed cranial nerve responsible for sensory data such as [[tactition]] (pressure), [[thermoception]] (temperature), and [[nociception]] (pain) originating from the face above the jawline; it is also responsible for the motor function of the [[muscles of mastication]], the muscles involved in chewing but not facial expression.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nSeveral theories exist to explain the possible causes of this [[pain]] syndrome. It was once believed that the nerve was compressed in the opening from the inside to the outside of the skull; but leading research indicates that it is an enlarged or lengthened blood vessel \u2013 most commonly the [[superior cerebellar artery]] \u2013 compressing or throbbing against the microvasculature of the trigeminal nerve near its connection with the [[pons]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nurmikko|first1=T.

This can lead to pain attacks at the slightest stimulation of any area served by the nerve as well as hinder the nerve's ability to shut off the pain signals after the stimulation ends.
