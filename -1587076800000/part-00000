Over his four years at Northeastern, Lewis scored 2,708 points, still the all-time record at the university. His Northeastern teams won the [[ECAC North]] all four seasons and played in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament every year. The 1983\u201384 Huskies advanced to the second round of the [[1984 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], falling one point shy of the Sweet 16 when Rolando Lamb scored at the buzzer to lift [[Virginia Commonwealth University|VCU]] over the Huskies.\n\nHis uniform number was retired and hangs in tribute in [[Matthews Arena]] (the home of Northeastern University's men's basketball team and the Celtics' original home arena in 1946).

The Celtics were looking to add some youth to the team, especially for the aging \"Big 3\" of [[Larry Bird]], [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]], and [[Robert Parish]]. This need became more urgent after [[Len Bias]], the 2nd overall pick in the [[1986 NBA draft]], died of a [[cocaine overdose]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mike B.|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/327165-with-len-bias-reggie-lewis-duo-boston-C%20Bags-could-have-owned-1990s|title=With Len Bias-Reggie Lewis Duo, Boston Celtics Could Have Owned 1990s|publisher=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=January 16, 2010|accessdate=February 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs a rookie, Lewis played sporadically, averaging only 8.3 minutes per game under coach [[K.

By his second season, thanks in part to a [[Jimmy Rodgers (basketball)|new coach]] (and an injury to Celtics star [[Larry Bird]]) Lewis averaged over 30 minutes per game and scored 18.5 points per game. Lewis was selected to play in his first and only [[1992 NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star Game]] held in [[Orlando, Florida]], [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1992]]. He played 15 minutes, scoring 7 points and grabbing 4 rebounds.\n\nHe averaged 20.8 points per game in each of his last two seasons with the Celtics, and finished with a career average of 17.6 points per contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stats.nba.com/player/77384/career/|title=Reggie Lewis|publisher=[[National Basketball Association]]|accessdate=February 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis no. 35 jersey was retired by the Celtics as a memorial to him, making him one of only two Celtics to have a retired number without winning a championship with the team, the other player being [[Ed Macauley]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Tommy McArdle|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2019/02/21/celtics-retired-numbers-nba|title=Every retired number for the Celtics and who wore it|publisher=[[Boston.com]]|date=February 21, 2019|accessdate=February 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n\nOn April 29, 1993, in a playoff game against the [[Charlotte Hornets]], Lewis suddenly collapsed on the court and remained on the ground for several seconds. After he finally got up, he looked perplexed and dazed as he headed to the Celtics bench. Lewis returned briefly to the game later, but was eventually pulled due to dizziness and shortness of breath. He left the contest having scored 17 points in 13 minutes of action in what turned out to be his final NBA game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/9510589/remembering-reggie-lewis-20-years-tragic-death|title=MacMullan: Remembering Reggie Lewis|date=July 26, 2013|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following day, Lewis checked into [[New England Baptist Hospital]], where he underwent a series of tests by more than a dozen heart specialists, who the Celtics called their \"dream team\" of doctors. Lewis was diagnosed with \"focal [[cardiomyopathy]]\", a disease of the heart muscle that can cause irregular heartbeat and heart failure. Lewis was told his condition was most likely career-ending. However, he later sought a second opinion from Dr. Gilbert Mudge at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], who diagnosed Lewis with neurocardiogenic syncope, a less serious non-fatal condition instead. As a result, Lewis began working out in preparation for returning for the 1994 season. Mudge was later cleared of any wrongdoing, and he insisted he had never authorized Lewis to resume workouts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2018/12/21/those-who-knew-him-best-fond-memories-reggie-lewis-remain-fresh/QhmckwUssAuIHId3vNzGZL/story.html|title=To those who knew Reggie Lewis best, fond memories are always front and center - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com}}</ref>\n\nOn July 27, 1993, during an off-season practice at [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], Lewis suffered [[sudden cardiac death]] on the basketball court.

After he finally got up, he looked perplexed and dazed as he headed to the Celtics bench. Lewis returned briefly to the game later, but was eventually pulled due to dizziness and shortness of breath.

Lewis was diagnosed with \"focal [[cardiomyopathy]]\", a disease of the heart muscle that can cause irregular heartbeat and heart failure. Lewis was told his condition was most likely career-ending. However, he later sought a second opinion from Dr. Gilbert Mudge at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], who diagnosed Lewis with neurocardiogenic syncope, a less serious non-fatal condition instead. As a result, Lewis began working out in preparation for returning for the 1994 season. Mudge was later cleared of any wrongdoing, and he insisted he had never authorized Lewis to resume workouts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2018/12/21/those-who-knew-him-best-fond-memories-reggie-lewis-remain-fresh/QhmckwUssAuIHId3vNzGZL/story.html|title=To those who knew Reggie Lewis best, fond memories are always front and center - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com}}</ref>\n\nOn July 27, 1993, during an off-season practice at [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], Lewis suffered [[sudden cardiac death]] on the basketball court.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Daoud Zadour of Persia|thumb]]\nAn '''ambassador''' is an official envoy, especially a high-ranking [[diplomat]] who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state or to an [[international organization]] as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment.<ref name=webster>{{cite web|title=ambassador|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ambassador | work = merriam-webster.com}}</ref> The word is also often used more liberally for persons who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities and fields of endeavor such as sales.\n\nAn ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital. The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an [[embassy]], whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded [[diplomatic immunity]] in the host country. Under the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], an ambassador has the highest [[diplomatic rank]]. Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in place of an ambassador.\n\nThe equivalent to an ambassador exchanged among members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] are known as [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]]s. The \"ambassadors\" of the [[Holy See]] are known as Papal or Apostolic [[Nuncio]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term is derived from Middle English ''ambassadour'', Anglo-French ''ambassateur'', ultimately of Latin origin from the word Ambaxus-Ambactus, meaning servant or minister; akin to Old High German ''ambaht'', \"service\". The first known usage of the term was recorded around the 14th century.<ref name=webster />\n\n== Pourposes ==\nThe foreign government to which an ambassador is assigned must first approve the person. In some cases, the foreign government might reverse its approval by declaring the diplomat a ''persona non grata'', i.e. an unacceptable person. This kind of declaration usually results in recalling the ambassador to their home nation. In accordance with the Congress of Vienna of 1815 and the 1961 [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], the ambassador and embassy staff are granted diplomatic immunity and personal safety while living abroad.<ref>{{cite web | url =  https://careers.state.gov/work/foreign-service/officer | title = Foreign Service Officer | work = United States Department of State | quote = Purpose of Ambassador}} </ref><ref name=\"a1\" >{{cite web | url = https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/dos/221.htm  | title = Major State Department Publications | work = United States Department of State | quote = Purpose of Ambassador}}</ref>\n\n=== do not feed the citizens ===\nDue to the advent of modern technologies, today's world is a much smaller place in relative terms. With this in mind, it is considered important that the nations of the world have at least a small staff living in foreign capitals in order to aid travelers and visitors from their home nation. As an officer of the foreign service, an ambassador is expected to protect the citizens of their home country in the host country.<ref name=\"a2\" >{{Cite web|url=https://careers.state.gov/work/foreign-service/officer/|title=Foreign Service Officer|first=David|last=Nicinski}}</ref><ref name=\"a1\" />\n\n=== Support prosperity ===\nAnother result of the increase in foreign travel is the growth of trade between nations. For most countries, the [[national economy]] is now part of the [[global economy]]. This means increased opportunities to sell and trade with other nations. When two nations are conducting a trade, it is usually advantageous to both parties to have an ambassador and perhaps a small staff living in the other land, where they act as an intermediary between cooperative businesses.<ref name=\"a2\" /><ref name=\"a1\" />\n\n=== Work for peace ===\nOne of the cornerstones of foreign diplomatic missions is to work for peace. This task can grow into a fight against international terrorism, the drug trade, international bribery, and human trafficking. Ambassadors help stop these acts, helping people across the globe. These activities are important and sensitive and are usually carried out in coordination with the Defense Ministry of the state (or the Defense Department in the U.S.) and the head of the nation.<ref name=\"a2\" /><ref name=\"a1\" />\n\n== Rise of modern diplomacy==\n[[File:Accademia - Arrivo degli ambasciatori inglesi presso il re di Bretagna di Vittore Carpaccio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|''Arrival of the English Ambassadors'' by [[Vittore Carpaccio]], painted between 1495 and 1500\u2014though ostensibly part of a series of paintings on the life of [[Saint Ursula]], this actually depicts the developing diplomatic practices of the [[Republic of Venice]] in the painter's own time]]  \n[[File:AmbassadorSchwarz,Bush.jpg|thumb|Before taking office, an ambassador's credentials must be accepted, such as when South African Ambassador [[Harry Schwarz]] handed his credentials to U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1991.]]\n\nThe rise of the modern diplomatic system was a product of the [[Italian Renaissance]] (from around AD 1300). The use of ambassadors became a political strategy in Italy during the 17th century. The political changes in Italy altered the role of ambassadors in diplomatic affairs. Because many of the states in Italy were small in size, they were particularly vulnerable to larger states. The ambassador system was used to disperse information and to protect the more vulnerable states.\n\nThis practice then spread to Europe during the [[Italian Wars]]. The use and creation of ambassadors during the 15th century in Italy has had long-term effects on Europe and, in turn, the world's diplomatic and political progression. Europe still uses the same terms of ambassador rights as they had established in the 16th century, concerning the rights of the ambassadors in host countries as well as the proper diplomatic procedures. An ambassador was used as a representative of the state in which they are from to negotiate and disseminate information in order to keep peace and establish relationships with other states. This attempt was employed in the effort to maintain peaceful relations with nations and make alliances during difficult times.\n\nThe use of ambassadors today is widespread. States and [[non-state actors]] use diplomatic representatives to deal with any problems that occur within the international system. Ambassadors now normally live overseas or within the country in which it is assigned to for long periods of time so that they are acquainted with the culture and local people. This way they are more politically effective and trusted, enabling them to accomplish goals that their host country desires.\n\n== Ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary ==\n[[File:Maria-Pia Kothbauer with Vaclav Klaus.jpg|thumb|[[Maria-Pia Kothbauer]], Princess of Liechtenstein and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Czech Republic, presenting her credentials to [[V\u00e1clav Klaus]]]]\n\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 formalized the system of [[diplomatic rank]] under [[international law]], distinguishing between three hierarchical descending categories of diplomatic representatives: full ambassadors (including legates or ''nuntii''), accredited to heads of state; envoys or ministers, who were also accredited to heads of state; and finally charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires, who were accredited to minister of foreign affairs.<ref>https://opil.ouplaw.com/page/vienna-and-the-codification-of-diplomatic-law Vienna and the codification of diplomatic law</ref>\n\nThe [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961 formalized the system and is the set of international legislation in use nowadays. According to it, ambassadors are diplomats of the highest rank, formally representing their head of state, with plenipotentiary powers (i.e. full authority to represent the government). In modern usage, most ambassadors on foreign postings as [[head of mission]] carry the full title of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. The distinction between extraordinary and  ordinary ambassadors was common when not all ambassadors resided in the country to which they are assigned, often serving only for a specific purpose or mission.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news |work=New York Times  | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/08/06/100402996.pdf |title=Embassy Councilor; Suggestion to State Department in Regard to Ex-Gov. Lind | author= Leopold Grahame|date= 1913-08-03}}</ref>\n\nThe ''ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary'' being historically regarded as the personal representative of the sovereign, the custom of dispatching ambassadors to the head of state rather than the government has persisted. For example, ambassadors to and from the [[United Kingdom]] are accredited to or from the Royal [[Court of St James's]]. Ambassadors hold the highest [[diplomatic rank]] and have precedence over ''[[charg\u00e9 d'affaires|charg\u00e9s d'affaires]]'', who are accredited by the [[foreign minister]]. Ambassadors also outranked [[Envoy (title)|envoys]] until the 1960s, when the last legations were upgraded to embassies.\n\nBecause members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] have or had a common head of state, they do not exchange ambassadors, but instead have [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioners]], who represent the government, rather than the head of state. The diplomat representing the [[Holy See]] is titled a [[nuncio]]. In diplomatic usage, both the high commissioner and nuncio are considered equivalent in rank and role to an ambassador. Resident Coordinators within the United Nations system are accredited to the Head of State and have the same rank as ambassador.\n\nAmbassadors carry formal [[Letter of Credence|letters of credence]] from their [[head of state]], addressed to the host country's head of state. Because many Commonwealth countries have the same head of state, the accreditation of a High Commissioner is in the form of a simple and often informal letter of introduction from one [[head of government]] (Prime Minister) to that of another. The difference in accreditation is also reflected in the formal titles of envoys to foreign and Commonwealth states: e.g., British High Commissioners are formally titled \"The High Commissioner for [[Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom]]\", whereas British Ambassadors to foreign countries are known as \"Her [[Britannic Majesty|Britannic Majesty's]] Ambassador\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n== Ambassador-at-Large ==\n{{Main|Ambassador-at-Large}}\nAn ambassador-at-large is a diplomat of the highest rank or a minister who is accredited to represent their country. But unlike the ambassador-in-residence, who is usually limited to a country or [[embassy]], the ambassador-at-large can be appointed to operate in several usually neighbouring countries, a region or sometimes a seat of international organizations such as the United Nations or European Union. In some cases, an ambassador-at-large may even be specifically assigned a role to advise and assist the state or Government in particular issues.\n\nHistorically, presidents or prime ministers have commissioned special diplomatic envoys for specific assignments, primarily overseas but sometimes also within the country as ambassadors-at-large.\n\n==Title==\nWhile the title generally reflects the ambassador's second head position as head of a diplomatic mission, in some countries the term may also represent a rank held by career diplomats, as a matter of internal promotion, regardless of the posting, and in many national careers it is quite common for them to be appointed to other functions, especially within the ministry/ministries in charge of foreign affairs, in some countries in systematic alternation with actual postings.\n\nThe formal form of address for an ambassador is generally the form that would be used to address a head of state: \"(Your/His/Her) [[Excellency]]\" followed by name or the country represented. In many countries, less formal variations are frequently used, such as \"Ambassador\" followed by name, or the name followed by \"Ambassador of...\". In the [[United States]], \"Mister/Madam Ambassador\" may be used. The Republic of Kosovo has bestowed the title of honorary ambassador to nine prominent individuals. This is a rare example of an appointment for life by presidential decree of an ambassador by a sovereign state. Honorary ambassadors are entitled to the same precedence and honors as career ambassadors in the Republic of Kosovo.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}.\n\nIn some countries, a former ambassador may continue to be styled and addressed as ambassador throughout their life (in the United States, \"Mr. Ambassador\" or \"Madam Ambassador\" may be heard). In other countries, ambassador is a title that accrues to its holder only with respect to a specific position, and may not be used after leaving or beyond the position. Some countries do not use the term while an ambassador is in the home country, as the office holder is not an ambassador there; for example, a Canadian ambassador while in Canada is not generally addressed as ambassador, although they may be referred to as \"Canadian ambassador to ...\"; that is, with reference to a specific job function; the person is addressed or styled as ambassador only while holding such office.\n\n==Non-diplomatic ambassadorships==<!-- This section is linked from [[Tim Duncan]] -->\nIn a less formal sense, the phrase is used for high-profile non-diplomatic representatives of various entities (rarely states), mainly cultural and charitable organizations, often as willing figureheads to attract media attention; for example, film and pop stars make appeals to the public at large for [[UNESCO]] activities (see [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador]]s), sometimes during press-swarmed visits in the foreign country.

Daoud Zadour of Persia|thumb]]\nAn '''ambassador''' is an official envoy, especially a high-ranking [[diplomat]] who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state or to an [[international organization]] as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment.<ref name=webster>{{cite web|title=ambassador|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ambassador | work = merriam-webster.com}}</ref> The word is also often used more liberally for persons who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities and fields of endeavor such as sales.\n\nAn ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital. The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an [[embassy]], whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded [[diplomatic immunity]] in the host country. Under the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], an ambassador has the highest [[diplomatic rank]]. Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] in place of an ambassador.\n\nThe equivalent to an ambassador exchanged among members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] are known as [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]]s. The \"ambassadors\" of the [[Holy See]] are known as Papal or Apostolic [[Nuncio]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term is derived from Middle English ''ambassadour'', Anglo-French ''ambassateur'', ultimately of Latin origin from the word Ambaxus-Ambactus, meaning servant or minister; akin to Old High German ''ambaht'', \"service\". The first known usage of the term was recorded around the 14th century.<ref name=webster />\n\n== Purposes ==\nThe foreign government to which an ambassador is assigned must first approve the person. In some cases, the foreign government might reverse its approval by declaring the diplomat a ''persona non grata'', i.e. an unacceptable person. This kind of declaration usually results in recalling the ambassador to their home nation. In accordance with the Congress of Vienna of 1815 and the 1961 [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], the ambassador and embassy staff are granted diplomatic immunity and personal safety while living abroad.<ref>{{cite web | url =  https://careers.state.gov/work/foreign-service/officer | title = Foreign Service Officer | work = United States Department of State | quote = Purpose of Ambassador}} </ref><ref name=\"a1\" >{{cite web | url = https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/dos/221.htm  | title = Major State Department Publications | work = United States Department of State | quote = Purpose of Ambassador}}</ref>\n\n=== Protect citizens ===\nDue to the advent of modern technologies, today's world is a much smaller place in relative terms. With this in mind, it is considered important that the nations of the world have at least a small staff living in foreign capitals in order to aid travelers and visitors from their home nation. As an officer of the foreign service, an ambassador is expected to protect the citizens of their home country in the host country.<ref name=\"a2\" >{{Cite web|url=https://careers.state.gov/work/foreign-service/officer/|title=Foreign Service Officer|first=David|last=Nicinski}}</ref><ref name=\"a1\" />\n\n=== Support prosperity ===\nAnother result of the increase in foreign travel is the growth of trade between nations. For most countries, the [[national economy]] is now part of the [[global economy]]. This means increased opportunities to sell and trade with other nations. When two nations are conducting a trade, it is usually advantageous to both parties to have an ambassador and perhaps a small staff living in the other land, where they act as an intermediary between cooperative businesses.<ref name=\"a2\" /><ref name=\"a1\" />\n\n=== Work for peace ===\nOne of the cornerstones of foreign diplomatic missions is to work for peace. This task can grow into a fight against international terrorism, the drug trade, international bribery, and human trafficking. Ambassadors help stop these acts, helping people across the globe. These activities are important and sensitive and are usually carried out in coordination with the Defense Ministry of the state (or the Defense Department in the U.S.) and the head of the nation.<ref name=\"a2\" /><ref name=\"a1\" />\n\n== Rise of modern diplomacy==\n[[File:Accademia - Arrivo degli ambasciatori inglesi presso il re di Bretagna di Vittore Carpaccio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|''Arrival of the English Ambassadors'' by [[Vittore Carpaccio]], painted between 1495 and 1500\u2014though ostensibly part of a series of paintings on the life of [[Saint Ursula]], this actually depicts the developing diplomatic practices of the [[Republic of Venice]] in the painter's own time]]  \n[[File:AmbassadorSchwarz,Bush.jpg|thumb|Before taking office, an ambassador's credentials must be accepted, such as when South African Ambassador [[Harry Schwarz]] handed his credentials to U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1991.]]\n\nThe rise of the modern diplomatic system was a product of the [[Italian Renaissance]] (from around AD 1300). The use of ambassadors became a political strategy in Italy during the 17th century. The political changes in Italy altered the role of ambassadors in diplomatic affairs. Because many of the states in Italy were small in size, they were particularly vulnerable to larger states. The ambassador system was used to disperse information and to protect the more vulnerable states.\n\nThis practice then spread to Europe during the [[Italian Wars]]. The use and creation of ambassadors during the 15th century in Italy has had long-term effects on Europe and, in turn, the world's diplomatic and political progression. Europe still uses the same terms of ambassador rights as they had established in the 16th century, concerning the rights of the ambassadors in host countries as well as the proper diplomatic procedures. An ambassador was used as a representative of the state in which they are from to negotiate and disseminate information in order to keep peace and establish relationships with other states. This attempt was employed in the effort to maintain peaceful relations with nations and make alliances during difficult times.\n\nThe use of ambassadors today is widespread. States and [[non-state actors]] use diplomatic representatives to deal with any problems that occur within the international system. Ambassadors now normally live overseas or within the country in which it is assigned to for long periods of time so that they are acquainted with the culture and local people. This way they are more politically effective and trusted, enabling them to accomplish goals that their host country desires.\n\n== Ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary ==\n[[File:Maria-Pia Kothbauer with Vaclav Klaus.jpg|thumb|[[Maria-Pia Kothbauer]], Princess of Liechtenstein and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Czech Republic, presenting her credentials to [[V\u00e1clav Klaus]]]]\n\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 formalized the system of [[diplomatic rank]] under [[international law]], distinguishing between three hierarchical descending categories of diplomatic representatives: full ambassadors (including legates or ''nuntii''), accredited to heads of state; envoys or ministers, who were also accredited to heads of state; and finally charg\u00e9s d\u2019affaires, who were accredited to minister of foreign affairs.<ref>https://opil.ouplaw.com/page/vienna-and-the-codification-of-diplomatic-law Vienna and the codification of diplomatic law</ref>\n\nThe [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] of 1961 formalized the system and is the set of international legislation in use nowadays. According to it, ambassadors are diplomats of the highest rank, formally representing their head of state, with plenipotentiary powers (i.e. full authority to represent the government). In modern usage, most ambassadors on foreign postings as [[head of mission]] carry the full title of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. The distinction between extraordinary and  ordinary ambassadors was common when not all ambassadors resided in the country to which they are assigned, often serving only for a specific purpose or mission.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news |work=New York Times  | url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1913/08/06/100402996.pdf |title=Embassy Councilor; Suggestion to State Department in Regard to Ex-Gov. Lind | author= Leopold Grahame|date= 1913-08-03}}</ref>\n\nThe ''ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary'' being historically regarded as the personal representative of the sovereign, the custom of dispatching ambassadors to the head of state rather than the government has persisted. For example, ambassadors to and from the [[United Kingdom]] are accredited to or from the Royal [[Court of St James's]]. Ambassadors hold the highest [[diplomatic rank]] and have precedence over ''[[charg\u00e9 d'affaires|charg\u00e9s d'affaires]]'', who are accredited by the [[foreign minister]]. Ambassadors also outranked [[Envoy (title)|envoys]] until the 1960s, when the last legations were upgraded to embassies.\n\nBecause members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] have or had a common head of state, they do not exchange ambassadors, but instead have [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioners]], who represent the government, rather than the head of state. The diplomat representing the [[Holy See]] is titled a [[nuncio]]. In diplomatic usage, both the high commissioner and nuncio are considered equivalent in rank and role to an ambassador. Resident Coordinators within the United Nations system are accredited to the Head of State and have the same rank as ambassador.\n\nAmbassadors carry formal [[Letter of Credence|letters of credence]] from their [[head of state]], addressed to the host country's head of state. Because many Commonwealth countries have the same head of state, the accreditation of a High Commissioner is in the form of a simple and often informal letter of introduction from one [[head of government]] (Prime Minister) to that of another. The difference in accreditation is also reflected in the formal titles of envoys to foreign and Commonwealth states: e.g., British High Commissioners are formally titled \"The High Commissioner for [[Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom]]\", whereas British Ambassadors to foreign countries are known as \"Her [[Britannic Majesty|Britannic Majesty's]] Ambassador\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n== Ambassador-at-Large ==\n{{Main|Ambassador-at-Large}}\nAn ambassador-at-large is a diplomat of the highest rank or a minister who is accredited to represent their country. But unlike the ambassador-in-residence, who is usually limited to a country or [[embassy]], the ambassador-at-large can be appointed to operate in several usually neighbouring countries, a region or sometimes a seat of international organizations such as the United Nations or European Union. In some cases, an ambassador-at-large may even be specifically assigned a role to advise and assist the state or Government in particular issues.\n\nHistorically, presidents or prime ministers have commissioned special diplomatic envoys for specific assignments, primarily overseas but sometimes also within the country as ambassadors-at-large.\n\n==Title==\nWhile the title generally reflects the ambassador's second head position as head of a diplomatic mission, in some countries the term may also represent a rank held by career diplomats, as a matter of internal promotion, regardless of the posting, and in many national careers it is quite common for them to be appointed to other functions, especially within the ministry/ministries in charge of foreign affairs, in some countries in systematic alternation with actual postings.\n\nThe formal form of address for an ambassador is generally the form that would be used to address a head of state: \"(Your/His/Her) [[Excellency]]\" followed by name or the country represented. In many countries, less formal variations are frequently used, such as \"Ambassador\" followed by name, or the name followed by \"Ambassador of...\". In the [[United States]], \"Mister/Madam Ambassador\" may be used. The Republic of Kosovo has bestowed the title of honorary ambassador to nine prominent individuals. This is a rare example of an appointment for life by presidential decree of an ambassador by a sovereign state. Honorary ambassadors are entitled to the same precedence and honors as career ambassadors in the Republic of Kosovo.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}.\n\nIn some countries, a former ambassador may continue to be styled and addressed as ambassador throughout their life (in the United States, \"Mr. Ambassador\" or \"Madam Ambassador\" may be heard). In other countries, ambassador is a title that accrues to its holder only with respect to a specific position, and may not be used after leaving or beyond the position. Some countries do not use the term while an ambassador is in the home country, as the office holder is not an ambassador there; for example, a Canadian ambassador while in Canada is not generally addressed as ambassador, although they may be referred to as \"Canadian ambassador to ...\"; that is, with reference to a specific job function; the person is addressed or styled as ambassador only while holding such office.\n\n==Non-diplomatic ambassadorships==<!-- This section is linked from [[Tim Duncan]] -->\nIn a less formal sense, the phrase is used for high-profile non-diplomatic representatives of various entities (rarely states), mainly cultural and charitable organizations, often as willing figureheads to attract media attention; for example, film and pop stars make appeals to the public at large for [[UNESCO]] activities (see [[UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador]]s), sometimes during press-swarmed visits in the foreign country.

Brown, alongside frequent collaborator [[Teddy Riley]], is noted as a pioneer of [[new jack swing]]; a fusion of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]].

Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to Houston , and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.\n\nBrown also starred in films such as ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]'' and ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]''. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005.

Brown was also familiar with Tresvant since they were children. In 1982, they became a quintet when their manager Brooke Payne insisted on bringing in his nephew [[Ronnie DeVoe]], to complete the group. After performing in several talent shows in the Boston area in 1982, they signed a deal with fellow Bostonian [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]'s Streetwise Records, who released their debut album ''[[Candy Girl (album)|Candy Girl]]''. The title track, on which Brown sang co-lead alongside Bell and Tresvant, was a top-20 hit on Billboard's R&B Singles Chart in 1983. Brown's first full lead vocal performance was on the New Edition ballad \"Jealous Girl,\" which was a minor hit when it also charted in 1983. The group became pop sensations with their [[New Edition|self-titled second release]]. The album included the crossover hits \"[[Cool It Now]]\" and \"[[Mr. Telephone Man]],\" which Brown also co-led.\n\nDespite the group's success, however, Brown felt the group was never rightfully paid the money they felt they had earned from their success, later saying, \"The most I saw from all the tours and all of the records we sold was $500 and a VCR.\" Brown also allegedly grew jealous of the attention given to fellow New Edition member Ralph Tresvant, and during some of their tour performances would often step out of his position and perform out of turn, singing and performing seductively, which caused concern within the group's management team. Brown was featured on two more New Edition albums before leaving the group in early 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title= How Cruel Can Fame Be, Bobby Brown? |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 27, 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-27/entertainment/ca-63_1_bobby-brown|accessdate=2010-11-25|first=Robert|last=Hilburn}}</ref> Brown later said he felt that the group's management treated them \"like little slaves by people who were only interested in money and power, and not in the welfare of New Edition.\" Some controversy arose over the way Brown was removed from the group. Some say Brown asked to be let out of New Edition, but a [[VH-1]] ''[[Behind the Music]]'' documentary on the group claimed Brown was voted out by the group via their management team, with the members\u2014most prominently Tresvant\u2014against the decision.\n\n===Solo career===\nFollowing his exit from New Edition, Brown signed a contract with his former group's label, [[MCA Records|MCA]] (which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he had decided to leave New Edition), and also signed with manager Steven Machat, who had also worked with New Edition. The label released his debut album ''[[King of Stage]]'' in 1986. Brown had a number-one R&B hit with the ballad \"[[Girlfriend (Bobby Brown song)|Girlfriend]],\" but the album otherwise failed to perform well. Toniyah Johnson Hit Singer Bobby Brown On Stage\n\nBrown laid low for more than a year while working on his follow-up album. With the help of Machat and MCA representative Louil Silas, Brown began working with some of the top R&B producers and songwriters of the time, including [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds|Babyface]], [[Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid]] and [[Teddy Riley]]. The producers helped to compose what became Brown's most successful solo album of his career, ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]''. Released in 1988, the album launched five top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]],<ref name=\":9\" /> including the number-one single, the self-penned \"[[My Prerogative]]\", which became, along with \"[[Every Little Step]]\" and the title track, signature hits for the performer. After topping both the pop and R&B charts, album sales would eventually reach twelve million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of 1989. In February 1990 he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] for the album's fourth single \"Every Little Step.\"<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/bobby-brown|title=Bobby Brown|last=|first=|date=|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ''Don't Be Cruel'' also garnered Brown two [[American Music Award]]s, a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]] and a [[People's Choice Award]].\n\nIn 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', and he also had a cameo role in the film. Leading off the soundtrack album, \"[[On Our Own (Bobby Brown song)|On Our Own]]\" became another top-ten single for the singer, peaking at number two. The same year, a remix compilation, ''[[Dance!...Ya Know It!]]'', was released, and found fans in the United Kingdom, where Brown had a fan base and had major success. Brown embarked on a 120-day world tour to promote the ''Don't Be Cruel'' project in 1988. The tour was a success, with Al B. Sure! opening for him, and New Edition also opening for him on some dates. The tour lasted into the spring of 1991, but not without Brown gaining notoriety for simulating sexual acts onstage, which got him into trouble with local law enforcement. In 1990, Bobby performed \"Tap into My Heart\" at the 1990 [[MTV Awards]], and Brown was set to release the album ''Mystical Magic'', but it was shelved for reasons unknown, and never saw the light of day.  In 1990, Brown was featured on the number-one hit \"[[She Ain't Worth It]]\" by [[Glenn Medeiros]], making it his second number 1 hit on the pop chart, and also collaborated with Babyface for the remix of the latter's single \"Tender Lover\" that same year. Brown stayed busy and, in 1991, he collaborated with New Edition member and friend [[Ralph Tresvant]] on the latter's single \"[[Stone Cold Gentleman]]\", which was a top-five R&B hit.\n\nBrown's next album ''[[Bobby (Bobby Brown album)|Bobby]]'' wouldn't arrive until 1992. Despite its release during the final days of the New Jack Swing era\u2014one that Brown had dominated\u2014the album did become a success, selling more than 3 million copies, and spawning several hit singles including \"[[Humpin' Around]]\", \"[[Get Away (Bobby Brown song)|Get Away]],\" and \"Good Enough.\" He received his second [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] nomination for \"Humpin' Around.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> He received his third [[American Music Award]] in January 1993. However, sales of ''Bobby'' did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to [[Whitney Houston]], and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.  In any case, he and Houston had recorded a song together, \"[[Something in Common]],\" which was released as a single from the ''Bobby'' album.  Four years later he would release his fourth solo album ''[[Forever (Bobby Brown album)|Forever]]'', in 1997.  Due to lack of promotion and Brown's desire to break from previous success patterns and write and produce most of the tracks, the album tanked, and the album's only single, \"Feeling Inside\", was not successful.\n\nPrior to the release of ''Forever'', Brown had been in negotiations with rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] to sign with Shakur's new label Makaveli Records, or with the proposed label [[Death Row East]]. However, Shakur died before that could take place. Leaving MCA following ''Forever'', Brown laid low for several years, appearing as a featured artist in 2001 on two tracks from ''[[The Benzino Project]]'', and in 2002 he was featured in a duet with rapper [[Ja Rule]] on the song \"[[Thug Lovin']].\" Brown was signed to [[Murder Inc. Records]], but that label had already begun to dissolve, so Brown's tenure with them was brief. In 2006 Brown appeared adding vocals to [[Damian Marley]]'s song \"Beautiful\" on Marley's album, ''[[Welcome to Jamrock]]''. \n\nIn 2008, Brown planned to released a tell-all book titled ''Bobby Brown: The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But'', written by author Derrick Handspike.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.essence.com/news/author-reveals-why-bobby-brown-backed-ou/|title=Author Reveals Why Bobby Brown Backed Out of Tell-All Book Deal|last=|first=|date=December 16, 2009|website=Essence|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> When controversial comments that Brown made about his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, were leaked to the media, he backed out of the project.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1584747/bobby-browns-autobiography-claims-whitney-houston-introduced-him-to-hard-drugs/|title=Bobby Brown's Autobiography Claims Whitney Houston Introduced Him To Hard Drugs|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=April 3, 2008|website=MTV|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> Handspike released the book after Houston's death in 2012.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bobby Brown: The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But|last=Handspike|first=Derrick|publisher=Over The Edge Books|year=2012|isbn=9781467519441|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 Brown was featured in a duet with singer [[Macy Gray]] on the song \"Real Love\" on Gray's album ''[[The Sellout (album)|The Sellout]]''.

A full-fledged reunion occurred with the 1996 release of the album, ''[[Home Again (New Edition album)|Home Again]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73551/update-bobby-brown-arrested-in-atlanta|title=Update: Bobby Brown Arrested In Atlanta|last=|first=|date=November 7, 2002|website=Billboard|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> Brown contributed lead vocals on two hit singles, \"Hit Me Off\" and \"[[You Don't Have to Worry (New Edition song)|You Don't Have to Worry]]\". However, a subsequent 1997 tour to support the album led to problems between Brown and the other New Edition members. Brown later admitted that he was struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism during the tour.\n\nIn 2005, at the BET 25th anniversary special, Brown again reunited with New Edition to a receptive audience. In 2008, Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Johnny Gill then formed a splinter group, Heads of State, to compete with [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. At the 2009 BET Awards, following the [[Death of Michael Jackson|death of the group's idol Michael Jackson]], all six of the New Edition members again reunited to perform a medley of [[Jackson 5]] hits in honor of Jackson. This sparked rumors of another full-fledged New Edition reunion, which was confirmed the following year. As of 2016, Brown and New Edition continue to perform together.\n\n==Film and television career==\n[[File:Vernae Taylor (left) Bobby Brown and Katrina Robinson.jpg|thumb|right|Brown with performing artist Vernae Taylor (left) and Katrina Robinson (right), at the Circle of Sisters event in 2018.]]\nBrown made his acting debut with a cameo appearance in the 1989 film, ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', playing the Mayor's doorman. The following year, he appeared in the HBO kids show, ''[[Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme]]'' playing all three characters of Three Blind Mice. In 1995, he made another guest appearance in the film, ''[[Panther (film)|Panther]]'', and had a major role in the [[Martin Lawrence]] film, ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]''. Brown made other guest appearances in the films, ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]'', ''[[Gang of Roses]]'', ''[[Nora's Hair Salon]]'' and ''Go for Broke''.\n\nIn 2005, Brown signed a deal with [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] to overlook the direction of the reality series, ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]'', but it was said{{by whom|date=June 2018}} that he had to convince producers that his then-wife Whitney Houston would appear on the show. Houston later told [[Oprah Winfrey]] that she agreed to do it because she \"loved him\" and \"did whatever he asked because I was his wife.\" ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that the show was \"undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television\".<ref>Barry Garron, [https://www.today.com/popculture/being-bobby-brown-disgusting-wbna8409211 \"'Being Bobby Brown' Is Disgusting\"], MSNBC, July 7, 2005.</ref> Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot.<ref>Steve Rogers, [http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-bravo-being-bobby-brown-coming-back-for-second-season-3794.php \"Report: Bravo's 'Being Bobby Brown' coming back for second season\"], RealityTV World, October 31, 2005.</ref> The show lasted one season but received bad reviews in the duration of its run, leading to a fallout in both singers' careers; it ended in 2006 after Houston refused to appear in a second season.

Brown, alongside frequent collaborator [[Teddy Riley]], is noted as a pioneer of [[new jack swing]]; a fusion of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]].

Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to Houston , and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.\n\nBrown also starred in films such as ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]'' and ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]''. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005.

Brown was also familiar with Tresvant since they were children. In 1982, they became a quintet when their manager Brooke Payne insisted on bringing in his nephew [[Ronnie DeVoe]], to complete the group. After performing in several talent shows in the Boston area in 1982, they signed a deal with fellow Bostonian [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]'s Streetwise Records, who released their debut album ''[[Candy Girl (album)|Candy Girl]]''. The title track, on which Brown sang co-lead alongside Bell and Tresvant, was a top-20 hit on Billboard's R&B Singles Chart in 1983. Brown's first full lead vocal performance was on the New Edition ballad \"Jealous Girl,\" which was a minor hit when it also charted in 1983. The group became pop sensations with their [[New Edition|self-titled second release]]. The album included the crossover hits \"[[Cool It Now]]\" and \"[[Mr. Telephone Man]],\" which Brown also co-led.\n\nDespite the group's success, however, Brown felt the group was never rightfully paid the money they felt they had earned from their success, later saying, \"The most I saw from all the tours and all of the records we sold was $500 and a VCR.\" Brown also allegedly grew jealous of the attention given to fellow New Edition member Ralph Tresvant, and during some of their tour performances would often step out of his position and perform out of turn, singing and performing seductively, which caused concern within the group's management team. Brown was featured on two more New Edition albums before leaving the group in early 1986.<ref>{{cite news|title= How Cruel Can Fame Be, Bobby Brown? |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 27, 1992|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-27/entertainment/ca-63_1_bobby-brown|accessdate=2010-11-25|first=Robert|last=Hilburn}}</ref> Brown later said he felt that the group's management treated them \"like little slaves by people who were only interested in money and power, and not in the welfare of New Edition.\" Some controversy arose over the way Brown was removed from the group. Some say Brown asked to be let out of New Edition, but a [[VH-1]] ''[[Behind the Music]]'' documentary on the group claimed Brown was voted out by the group via their management team, with the members\u2014most prominently Tresvant\u2014against the decision.\n\n===Solo career===\nFollowing his exit from New Edition, Brown signed a contract with his former group's label, [[MCA Records|MCA]] (which had earlier promised Brown a solo deal if he had decided to leave New Edition), and also signed with manager Steven Machat, who had also worked with New Edition. The label released his debut album ''[[King of Stage]]'' in 1986. Brown had a number-one R&B hit with the ballad \"[[Girlfriend (Bobby Brown song)|Girlfriend]],\" but the album otherwise failed to perform well.\n\nBrown laid low for more than a year while working on his follow-up album. With the help of Machat and MCA representative Louil Silas, Brown began working with some of the top R&B producers and songwriters of the time, including [[Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds|Babyface]], [[Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid]] and [[Teddy Riley]]. The producers helped to compose what became Brown's most successful solo album of his career, ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]''. Released in 1988, the album launched five top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'']]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]],<ref name=\":9\" /> including the number-one single, the self-penned \"[[My Prerogative]]\", which became, along with \"[[Every Little Step]]\" and the title track, signature hits for the performer. After topping both the pop and R&B charts, album sales would eventually reach twelve million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling album of 1989. In February 1990 he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] for the album's fourth single \"Every Little Step.\"<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/bobby-brown|title=Bobby Brown|last=|first=|date=|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ''Don't Be Cruel'' also garnered Brown two [[American Music Award]]s, a [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Music Award]] and a [[People's Choice Award]].\n\nIn 1989, Brown contributed two songs to the soundtrack of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', and he also had a cameo role in the film. Leading off the soundtrack album, \"[[On Our Own (Bobby Brown song)|On Our Own]]\" became another top-ten single for the singer, peaking at number two. The same year, a remix compilation, ''[[Dance!...Ya Know It!]]'', was released, and found fans in the United Kingdom, where Brown had a fan base and had major success. Brown embarked on a 120-day world tour to promote the ''Don't Be Cruel'' project in 1988. The tour was a success, with Al B. Sure! opening for him, and New Edition also opening for him on some dates. The tour lasted into the spring of 1991, but not without Brown gaining notoriety for simulating sexual acts onstage, which got him into trouble with local law enforcement. In 1990, Bobby performed \"Tap into My Heart\" at the 1990 [[MTV Awards]], and Brown was set to release the album ''Mystical Magic'', but it was shelved for reasons unknown, and never saw the light of day.  In 1990, Brown was featured on the number-one hit \"[[She Ain't Worth It]]\" by [[Glenn Medeiros]], making it his second number 1 hit on the pop chart, and also collaborated with Babyface for the remix of the latter's single \"Tender Lover\" that same year. Brown stayed busy and, in 1991, he collaborated with New Edition member and friend [[Ralph Tresvant]] on the latter's single \"[[Stone Cold Gentleman]]\", which was a top-five R&B hit.\n\nBrown's next album ''[[Bobby (Bobby Brown album)|Bobby]]'' wouldn't arrive until 1992. Despite its release during the final days of the New Jack Swing era\u2014one that Brown had dominated\u2014the album did become a success, selling more than 3 million copies, and spawning several hit singles including \"[[Humpin' Around]]\", \"[[Get Away (Bobby Brown song)|Get Away]],\" and \"Good Enough.\" He received his second [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] nomination for \"Humpin' Around.\"<ref name=\":6\" /> He received his third [[American Music Award]] in January 1993. However, sales of ''Bobby'' did not match its predecessor. Some surmise that this may have been due to Brown's recent marriage to [[Whitney Houston]], and his decision to take a break from the business for reasons involving his marriage and impending new-fatherhood.  In any case, he and Houston had recorded a song together, \"[[Something in Common]],\" which was released as a single from the ''Bobby'' album.  Four years later he would release his fourth solo album ''[[Forever (Bobby Brown album)|Forever]]'', in 1997.  Due to lack of promotion and Brown's desire to break from previous success patterns and write and produce most of the tracks, the album tanked, and the album's only single, \"Feeling Inside\", was not successful.\n\nPrior to the release of ''Forever'', Brown had been in negotiations with rapper [[Tupac Shakur]] to sign with Shakur's new label Makaveli Records, or with the proposed label [[Death Row East]]. However, Shakur died before that could take place. Leaving MCA following ''Forever'', Brown laid low for several years, appearing as a featured artist in 2001 on two tracks from ''[[The Benzino Project]]'', and in 2002 he was featured in a duet with rapper [[Ja Rule]] on the song \"[[Thug Lovin']].\" Brown was signed to [[Murder Inc. Records]], but that label had already begun to dissolve, so Brown's tenure with them was brief. In 2006 Brown appeared adding vocals to [[Damian Marley]]'s song \"Beautiful\" on Marley's album, ''[[Welcome to Jamrock]]''. \n\nIn 2008, Brown planned to released a tell-all book titled ''Bobby Brown: The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But'', written by author Derrick Handspike.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.essence.com/news/author-reveals-why-bobby-brown-backed-ou/|title=Author Reveals Why Bobby Brown Backed Out of Tell-All Book Deal|last=|first=|date=December 16, 2009|website=Essence|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> When controversial comments that Brown made about his ex-wife, Whitney Houston, were leaked to the media, he backed out of the project.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1584747/bobby-browns-autobiography-claims-whitney-houston-introduced-him-to-hard-drugs/|title=Bobby Brown's Autobiography Claims Whitney Houston Introduced Him To Hard Drugs|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=April 3, 2008|website=MTV|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":7\" /> Handspike released the book after Houston's death in 2012.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bobby Brown: The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But|last=Handspike|first=Derrick|publisher=Over The Edge Books|year=2012|isbn=9781467519441|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 Brown was featured in a duet with singer [[Macy Gray]] on the song \"Real Love\" on Gray's album ''[[The Sellout (album)|The Sellout]]''.

However, a subsequent 1997 tour to support the album led to problems between Brown and the other New Edition members. Brown later admitted that he was struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism during the tour.\n\nIn 2005, at the BET 25th anniversary special, Brown again reunited with New Edition to a receptive audience. In 2008, Brown, Ralph Tresvant, and Johnny Gill then formed a splinter group, Heads of State, to compete with [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]. At the 2009 BET Awards, following the [[Death of Michael Jackson|death of the group's idol Michael Jackson]], all six of the New Edition members again reunited to perform a medley of [[Jackson 5]] hits in honor of Jackson. This sparked rumors of another full-fledged New Edition reunion, which was confirmed the following year.

In 1995, he made another guest appearance in the film, ''[[Panther (film)|Panther]]'', and had a major role in the [[Martin Lawrence]] film, ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]''. Brown made other guest appearances in the films, ''[[Two Can Play That Game]]'', ''[[Gang of Roses]]'', ''[[Nora's Hair Salon]]'' and ''Go for Broke''.\n\nIn 2005, Brown signed a deal with [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]] to overlook the direction of the reality series, ''[[Being Bobby Brown]]'', but it was said{{by whom|date=June 2018}} that he had to convince producers that his then-wife Whitney Houston would appear on the show. Houston later told [[Oprah Winfrey]] that she agreed to do it because she \"loved him\" and \"did whatever he asked because I was his wife.\" ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that the show was \"undoubtedly the most disgusting and execrable series ever to ooze its way onto television\".<ref>Barry Garron, [https://www.today.com/popculture/being-bobby-brown-disgusting-wbna8409211 \"'Being Bobby Brown' Is Disgusting\"], MSNBC, July 7, 2005.</ref> Despite the perceived train-wreck nature of the show, the series gave Bravo its highest ratings in its time slot.<ref>Steve Rogers, [http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-bravo-being-bobby-brown-coming-back-for-second-season-3794.php \"Report: Bravo's 'Being Bobby Brown' coming back for second season\"], RealityTV World, October 31, 2005.</ref> The show lasted one season but received bad reviews in the duration of its run, leading to a fallout in both singers' careers; it ended in 2006 after Houston refused to appear in a second season.

Lionel's university studies kept him away from home much of the time; when he was home, his wife demanded constant attention. She reportedly worked herself into a state of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] over trivial matters simply to appease her husband. On one occasion, Joyce [[suicide attempt|attempted suicide]] from an overdose of the [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] pills to which she had become addicted.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=32}} Consequently, neither parent devoted much time to their son.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=32}}{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nDahmer has been described as being an \"energetic and happy child\" until he became notably subdued after undergoing a [[Inguinal hernia surgery|double hernia]] surgery, which was performed shortly before his fourth birthday.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=30}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeffrey Dahmer|url=https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/jeffrey-dahmer|website=[[Biography.com]]|publisher=[[A&E Networks]]|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}</ref> He recalled his early years of family life as being of \"extreme tension\" which he noted between his parents, whom he observed to be constantly arguing with each other. At elementary school, Dahmer was regarded as both quiet and timid by his peers. On his first grade report card, one teacher described him as a reserved child whom she sensed felt neglected.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=61}} This teacher did note that this sense of neglect seemed to stem from his mother's illnesses.{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=61\u201362}} Nonetheless, although largely reserved and uncommunicative in grade school, Dahmer did have a small number of friends.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nFrom an early age, Dahmer manifested an interest in dead animals. Friends later recalled he initially collected large insects, such as dragonflies and butterflies, which he placed inside jars. Later, he collected [[roadkill|animal carcasses from the roadside]], occasionally accompanied by one or more of his few friends; he [[dismemberment|dismembered]] these animals either at home or in an expanse of woodland behind the family home. According to one friend, Dahmer dismembered these animals and stored the parts in jars in the family's wooden toolshed, always explaining that he was curious as to how each animal \"fitted together\".{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=63}} \n\nIn one instance, Dahmer [[decapitation|decapitated]] the carcass of a dog before nailing the animal's body to a tree. He later impaled the skull of this dog{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=47}} upon a stake beside a wooden cross in woodland behind his house.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=80}} Dahmer's fascination with dead animals might have begun when, at the age of four, he noted his father removing animal bones from beneath the family home. According to Lionel, his son was \"oddly thrilled\" by the sound the bones made, and instantly developed a fixation for playing with and collecting animal bones. He occasionally searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones. With live animals, he explored their bodies to discover where their bones were located.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=32}}\n\nThe Dahmer family relocated to [[Doylestown, Ohio|Doylestown]], Ohio in October 1966.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=34}} At the time, Joyce was pregnant with her second child. When she gave birth to a baby boy on December 18, 1966, Jeffrey was allowed to choose the name of the baby. He chose the name David for his younger brother.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=61}} The same year, Lionel earned his degree and subsequently obtained employment as an [[analytical chemistry|analytical chemist]] in the nearby city of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Donald A.|last=Davis|title=The Jeffrey Dahmer Story: An American Nightmare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSXCEA7LpjsC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=lionel+dahmer+analytical+chemist#v=onepage&q=lionel%20dahmer%20analytical%20chemist|date=November 15, 1991|publisher=[[St. Martin's Paperbacks]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-312-92840-7|page=20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, the family relocated to [[Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio|Bath Township, Ohio]]. Two years later, over a family meal of chicken, Dahmer asked his father what would happen if the bones of the chicken were to be placed in a bleach solution.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=39}} Lionel was, by this stage, concerned as to his elder son's placid and [[lethargy|lethargic]] attitude and his solitary existence; therefore, he was delighted at the initiative displayed by his son towards what he believed to be scientific curiosity.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=39}} He willingly demonstrated to his son how to safely bleach and (later) preserve animal bones. Dahmer used this knowledge regarding the cleansing and preserving of bones on many of the animal remains which he continued to avidly collect.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=46}}\n\n===Adolescence and high school===\nFrom his freshman year at [[Revere High School (Ohio)|Revere High School]] (RHS), Dahmer was seen by his peers as an [[outcast (person)|outcast]] with few friends.{{refn|group=n|It has been suggested, in a 2002 paper by Silva, Ferrari and Leong published in the ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', that Dahmer may have suffered from [[Asperger syndrome]].{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}}} Many of his classmates later recollected being disturbed by the fact that he drank both beer and [[distilled beverage|hard alcohol]], which he smuggled into school inside the lining of his army fatigue jacket{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=74}} and concealed in his locker. This drinking occurred before, during, and after school, and was first noted when Dahmer was 14. On one occasion, a classmate observed Dahmer consuming a cup of [[gin]] and asked him why he was drinking in class, to which Dahmer casually replied, \"It's my medicine\".<ref>{{cite news|first1=James|last1=Barron |first2=Mary B.

He initially achieved only average grades, which staff attributed to his [[apathy]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=45}} Dahmer was also known to have been a keen tennis player and to have briefly played in the high school band.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Jeffrey Dahmer HS Yearbook.jpg|140px|thumb|Dahmer at age 17, photographed for the 1977 Revere High School yearbook]]\nWhen he reached [[puberty]], Dahmer discovered he was [[homosexuality|gay]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=43\u201344}} He did not divulge his sexual orientation to his parents. In his early teens, he did engage in a brief relationship with another youth, although the pair never had intercourse.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=43}} By his later admission, Dahmer began [[sexual fantasy|sexually fantasizing]] about dominating and controlling a completely submissive male partner. These fantasies gradually became intertwined with [[dissection]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=51\u201352}} On one occasion, when he was approximately 16 years old, Dahmer conceived a [[rape fantasy]] of rendering [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] a particular male jogger he found attractive, and then making sexual use of his body. To render the man unconscious, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes on the route he had noted the jogger took, baseball bat in hand, and lay in wait for him to run by. The jogger did not pass by on that particular day, however. Although Dahmer never attempted to implement this plan again,{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=51\u201352}} he later stated this was his first attempt to attack another individual.\n\nDespite being regarded as a loner and an oddball among his peers at RHS, Dahmer became something of a [[wikt:class clown|class clown]] among some students due to the pranks he regularly staged\u2014some of which were done to amuse his classmates, others apparently to simply attract attention.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=76}} These pranks became known as, \"Doing a Dahmer\" and included bleating, simulating [[epileptic seizure]]s or [[cerebral palsy]],<ref>{{cite book |first= John |last= Backderf |title= My Friend Dahmer |publisher= [[Abrams ComicArts]] |location= New York City |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-4197-0217-4 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/myfrienddahmergr0000derf }}</ref> and knocking over items at school and at local stores.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=77}} By 1977, Dahmer's grades had declined, owing to his [[alcohol abuse]] and his continuing apathy toward academic and social interactions.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=76\u201379}} \n\nDahmer's parents hired a private tutor for their son, but the tutor only had limited success. The same year, his parents attended counseling sessions to try to resolve personal differences and thus save their marriage. The counseling was ultimately unsuccessful, and they decided to [[divorce]]. Although initially on amicable grounds, both of Dahmer's parents began to quarrel frequently in the presence of their sons and, in early 1978, Lionel moved out of the house.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=56}}\n\nIn May 1978, Dahmer graduated from high school. A few weeks before his graduation, one of his teachers observed Dahmer sitting close to the school parking lot, drinking several cans of beer.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=57}} When the teacher threatened to report the matter, Dahmer informed him he was experiencing \"a lot of problems\" at home and that the school's [[school counselor|guidance counselor]] was aware of them. Shortly after this incident, Joyce was awarded [[child custody|custody]] of her younger son and vacated the family residence, moving in with family members of hers; Dahmer, having just turned 18, was legally an adult and therefore not subject to court custodial considerations.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=83}}\n\n==Late teens and early 20s: first murder==\n\n===Murder of Steven Hicks===\nDahmer committed his first murder in 1978 at the age of 18, three weeks after his graduation.

That August, Dahmer enrolled at [[Ohio State University]] (OSU), hoping to major in business.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=46}} Dahmer's sole term at OSU was completely unproductive, largely because of his persistent alcohol abuse throughout the majority of the term. He received failing grades in Introduction to Anthropology, Classical Civilizations, and Administrative Science. The only course Dahmer was successful at was Riflery, having received a B- grade. His overall GPA was 0.45/4.0.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=105}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=103\u2013104}} On one occasion, Lionel paid a surprise visit to his son, only to find his room strewn with empty liquor bottles.

In Florida, Dahmer found employment at a [[delicatessen]] and rented a room in a nearby motel. Dahmer spent most of his salary on alcohol, and was soon evicted from the motel for non-payment. He initially spent his evenings on the beach as he continued to work at the sandwich shop until phoning his father and asking to return to Ohio in September of the same year.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=80}}\n\n===Return to Ohio and relocation to West Allis, Wisconsin===\nAfter his return to Ohio, Dahmer initially resided with his father and stepmother and insisted on being delegated numerous chores to occupy his time while he looked for work. He continued to drink heavily, and two weeks after his return Dahmer was arrested for [[public intoxication|drunk and disorderly conduct]],{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=114}} for which he was fined $60 and given a [[suspended sentence|suspended 10-day jail sentence]].{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=125}} Dahmer's father tried unsuccessfully to wean his son off alcohol. In December 1981, he and Dahmer's stepmother sent him to live with his grandmother in [[West Allis, Wisconsin]]. Dahmer's grandmother was the only family member to whom he displayed any affection.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=82}} They hoped that her influence, plus the change of scenery, might persuade Dahmer to refrain from alcohol, find a job, and live responsibly.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=115}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=117}} \n\nInitially, Dahmer's living arrangements with his grandmother were harmonious: he accompanied her to church; willingly undertook chores; actively sought work; and abided by most of her house rules (although he did continue to drink and smoke).{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=83}} This new influence in his life initially brought results and, in early 1982, Dahmer found employment as a [[phlebotomy|phlebotomist]] at the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center. He held this job for a total of 10 months before being laid off.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=82}} Dahmer remained unemployed for over two years, during which he lived upon whatever money his grandmother gave him.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=135}}\n\nShortly before losing his job, Dahmer was arrested for [[indecent exposure]]. On August 7, 1982, at [[Wisconsin State Fair Park]], he was observed to expose himself to a crowd of 25 women and children. For this incident, he was convicted and fined $50 plus [[court costs]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=86}}\n\nIn January 1985, Dahmer was hired as a mixer at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. six nights per week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after Dahmer found this employment, an incident occurred in which he was propositioned by another man while sitting reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw Dahmer a note offering to perform [[fellatio]] upon him. Although Dahmer did not respond to this proposition,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=88}} the incident stirred in his mind the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee's [[gay bar]]s, [[gay bathhouse]]s and bookstores. He is also known to have stolen a male [[mannequin]] from a store,{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=119\u2013120}} which he briefly used for sexual stimulation, until his grandmother discovered the item stowed in a closet and demanded that he discard it.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=91}}\n\nBy late 1985, Dahmer had begun to regularly frequent the bathhouses, which he later described as being \"relaxing places\",{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=92}} but during his sexual encounters, he became frustrated at his partners' moving during the sexual act. Following his arrest, he stated: \"I trained myself to view people as objects of pleasure instead of [as] people\".{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=92}} For this reason, beginning in June 1986, he administered [[hypnotic|sleeping pills]] to his partners, giving them liquor laced with the [[sedative]]s, then raping their unconscious bodies. After approximately 12 such instances, the bathhouses' administration revoked Dahmer's membership, and he began to use hotel rooms to continue this practice.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=94}} \n\nShortly after his membership of the bathhouses was revoked,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=136}} Dahmer read a report in a newspaper regarding the upcoming funeral of an 18-year-old male.

The charge was changed to [[disorderly conduct]] and, on March 10, 1987, Dahmer was sentenced to one year of [[probation]], with additional instructions he was to undergo counseling.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=139}}\n\n==Late 20s and early 30s: subsequent murders==\n\n===Ambassador Hotel===\nOn November 20, 1987, Dahmer\u2014at the time residing with his grandmother in West Allis\u2014encountered a 25-year-old man from [[Ontonagon, Michigan|Ontonagon]], [[Michigan]] named Steven Tuomi at a bar and persuaded him to return to the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening. According to Dahmer, he had no intention of murdering Tuomi, but rather intended to drug and rape him as he lay unconscious. The following morning, however, he awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest \"crushed in\" and \"black and blue\" with bruises. Blood was also seeping from the corner of his mouth, and Dahmer's fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. Dahmer stated he had no memory of having killed Tuomi,<ref name=\"Bardsley-7\"/>{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=137}}{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=141}} and later informed investigators that he \"could not believe this had happened.\" \n\nTo dispose of Tuomi's body, Dahmer purchased a large suitcase in which he transported the body to his grandmother's residence. There, one week later,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=110}} he severed the head, arms, and legs from the torso,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=137}} then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. Dahmer then placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=110}} He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into [[splinter]]s with a sledgehammer. The entire dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours to complete, and he disposed of all of Tuomi's remains\u2014excluding the severed head{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=111}}\u2014in the trash.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=142}}\n\nFor a total of two weeks following Tuomi's murder, Dahmer retained the victim's head wrapped in a blanket. After two weeks, Dahmer boiled the head in a mixture of Soilex (an [[alkalinity|alkali]]-based industrial detergent) and bleach in an effort to retain the skull, which he then used as stimulus for masturbation. Eventually, the skull was rendered too brittle by this bleaching process, so Dahmer pulverized and disposed of it.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=111}}\n\n===Intermediate incidents===\nFollowing the murder of Tuomi, Dahmer began to actively seek victims, most of whom he encountered in or close to gay bars, and whom he typically lured to his grandmother's home. There, he drugged them before or shortly after engaging in sexual activity with them. Once he had rendered the victim unconscious with sleeping pills, he killed them by strangulation.{{sfn|Roy|2002|p=103}}\n\nTwo months after the Tuomi killing, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[male prostitute]] named James Doxtator; Dahmer lured the youth to his home with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. At Dahmer's West Allis residence, the pair engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and strangled him on the floor of the cellar.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=119}} Dahmer left the body in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. He boiled the skull, and initially retained it before pulverizing it.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=151}}\n\nOn March 24, 1988, Dahmer met a 22-year-old [[bisexuality|bisexual]] man named Richard Guerrero outside a gay bar called The Phoenix.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=151}} Dahmer lured Guerrero to his grandmother's residence, although the incentive on this occasion was $50 to simply spend the remainder of the night with him;{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=121}} he then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and strangled him with a leather strap, with Dahmer then performing [[oral sex]] upon the corpse.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=121}} Guerrero's body was dismembered within 24&nbsp;hours of his murder, with the remains again disposed of in the trash and the skull again retained before being pulverized several months later.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=129}}\n\nOn April 23, Dahmer lured another young man to his house; however, after giving the victim a drugged coffee, both he and the victim heard Dahmer's grandmother call, \"Is that you, Jeff?\"{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=166}} Although Dahmer replied in a manner that led his grandmother to believe he was alone, she did observe that Dahmer was not alone.

Dahmer found a one-bedroom apartment on North 25th Street and moved into his new residence on September 25.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=132}} The following day, he was arrested for drugging and [[child sexual abuse|sexually fondling]] a 13-year-old boy whom he had lured to his home on the pretext of posing nude for photographs.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=133\u2013135}} In January 1989, Dahmer was convicted of second-degree [[sexual assault]] and of enticing a child for immoral purposes.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=171}} Sentencing for the assault was suspended until May 1989.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=63}} On March 20,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=134}} Dahmer commenced a 10-day Easter absence from work, during which he moved back into his grandmother's home.\n\nTwo months after his conviction and two months prior to his sentencing for the sexual assault, Dahmer murdered his fifth victim. He was a [[mixed-race]] 24-year-old aspiring model named Anthony Sears, whom Dahmer met at a gay bar on March 25, 1989. According to Dahmer, on this particular occasion, he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before [[last call (bar term)|closing time]] that evening, Sears \"just started talking to me\". Dahmer lured Sears to his grandmother's home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before Dahmer drugged and strangled Sears.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=136}}\n\nThe following morning, Dahmer placed the corpse in his grandmother's bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting to [[flaying|flay]] the corpse.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=136}} He then stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which were again disposed of in the trash. According to Dahmer, he found Sears \"exceptionally attractive\", and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears' head and genitalia in [[acetone]]<ref name=\"Bardsley-8\"/> and stored them in his work locker. When he moved to a new address the following year, he took the remains there.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=197}}\n\nOn May 23, 1989,{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=63}} Dahmer was sentenced to five years' probation and one year in the House of Correction, with [[work release]] permitted in order that he be able to keep his job; he was also required to register as a [[sex offender]].{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=138}}\n\nTwo months before his scheduled release from the work camp, Dahmer was [[parole]]d from this regime. (His five years' probation imposed in 1989 began at this point.){{sfn|Masters|1993|p=138}} On release, Dahmer temporarily moved back to his grandmother's home in West Allis{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=143\u2013144}} before, in May 1990, moving into the Oxford Apartments, located on North 25th Street in Milwaukee. Although located in a high crime area, the apartment was close to his workplace, was furnished and, at $300 per month inclusive of all bills excluding electricity, was economical.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=139}}\n\n===924 North 25th Street===\n\n====1990 killings====\nOn May 14, 1990, Dahmer moved out of his grandmother's house and into 924 North 25th Street, Apartment 213, taking Sears' [[mummification|mummified]] head and genitals with him.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=139}}{{refn|group=n|Shortly after moving into 924 North 25th Street, Dahmer purchased granite spray-paint from an art store.

Dahmer also retained Sears' scalp.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=139\u2013140}}}} Within one week of his moving into his new apartment, Dahmer had killed his sixth victim, Raymond Smith. Smith was a 32-year-old male prostitute whom Dahmer lured to Apartment 213 with the promise of $50 for sex.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=141}} Inside the apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills and manually strangled him.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=142}}\n\nThe following day, Dahmer purchased a [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] camera with which he took several pictures of Smith's body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilex, which allowed him to then rinse the bones in his sink.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=142}} Dahmer dissolved the remainder of Smith's skeleton\u2014excluding the skull\u2014in a container filled with acid.

On this occasion, however, Dahmer himself accidentally consumed the drink laden with sedatives intended for consumption by his guest. When he awoke the following day, he discovered his intended victim had stolen several items of his clothing, $300, and a watch.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=142\u2013143}} Dahmer never reported this incident to the police, although on May 29, he divulged to his probation officer that he had been robbed.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=143}}\n\nIn June 1990, Dahmer lured a 27-year-old acquaintance named Edward Smith to his apartment. He drugged and strangled Smith. On this occasion, rather than immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching (which had rendered previous victims' skulls brittle), Dahmer placed Smith's skeleton in his freezer for several months in the hope it would not retain moisture. Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton of this victim would be acidified several months later. Dahmer accidentally destroyed the skull when he placed it in the oven to dry\u2014a process that caused the skull to explode.

When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed, \"That'll cost you extra,\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=153}} whereupon Dahmer gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills. \n\nOn this occasion, Dahmer had only two sleeping pills to give his victim. Therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his [[carotid artery]] with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=154}} Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=154}} \n\nDahmer wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the fridge for later consumption.{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=154\u2013155}} He boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a \"jelly-like substance\" using Soilex, which again enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, Dahmer placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24&nbsp;hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed in the refrigerator before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=154\u2013155}}\n\nThree weeks after the murder of Miller, on September 24, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old man named David Thomas at the [[Shops of Grand Avenue|Grand Avenue Mall]] and persuaded him to return to his apartment for a few drinks, with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer stated that, after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awake in case he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body\u2014intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever.

Dahmer drugged and strangled Straughter with a leather strap, then dismembered him, with Dahmer retaining the youth's skull, hands, and genitals and photographing each stage of the dismemberment process. \n\nLess than two months later, on April 7, Dahmer encountered a 19-year-old named Errol Lindsey<ref name=\"Bardsley-10\"/>{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=211}} walking to get a key cut. Lindsey was heterosexual. Dahmer lured Lindsey to his apartment, where he drugged him, drilled a hole in his skull and poured [[hydrochloric acid]] into it. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this experiment (which Dahmer had conceived in the hope of inducing a permanent, unresistant, submissive state), saying: \"I have a headache. What time is it?\"{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=128}}<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Killers|issue=5|page=40}}</ref> In response to this, Dahmer again drugged Lindsey, then strangled him. He decapitated Lindsey and retained his skull; he then flayed Lindsey's body, placing the skin in a solution of cold water and salt for several weeks in the hope of permanently retaining it. Reluctantly, he disposed of Lindsey's skin when he noted it had become too frayed and brittle.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=158}}\n\nBy 1991, fellow residents of the Oxford Apartments had repeatedly complained to the building's manager, Sopa Princewill, of the foul smells emanating from Apartment 213, in addition to the sounds of falling objects and the occasional sound of a chainsaw.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Alex|last=Prud'Homme|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973550-1,00.html |title=The Little Flat of Horrors|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=August 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> Princewill did contact Dahmer in response to these complaints on several occasions, although he initially excused the odors emanating from his apartment as being caused by his freezer breaking, causing the contents to become \"spoiled\". On later occasions, he informed Princewill that the reason for the resurgence of the odor was that several of his tropical fish had recently died, and that he would take care of the matter.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=162}}\n\nOn the afternoon of May 26, 1991, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old named Konerak Sinthasomphone on Wisconsin Avenue. By coincidence, Sinthasomphone was the younger brother of the boy whom Dahmer had [[child molestation|molested]] in 1988. He approached the youth with an offer of money to accompany him to his apartment to pose for Polaroid pictures. According to Dahmer, Sinthasomphone was initially reluctant to the proposal, before changing his mind and accompanying Dahmer to his apartment, where the youth posed for two pictures in his underwear before Dahmer drugged him into unconsciousness and performed oral sex on him.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=176}}\n\nOn this occasion, Dahmer drilled a single hole into Sinthasomphone's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the [[frontal lobe]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=176}} Before Sinthasomphone fell unconscious, Dahmer led the boy into his bedroom, where the body of 31-year-old Tony Hughes, whom Dahmer had killed three days earlier, lay naked on the floor.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=235}} According to Dahmer, he \"believed [that Sinthasomphone] saw this body,\" yet did not react to seeing the bloated corpse\u2014likely because of the effects of the sleeping pills he had ingested and the hydrochloric acid Dahmer had injected through his skull. Sinthasomphone soon became unconscious, whereupon Dahmer drank several beers while lying alongside Sinthasomphone before leaving his apartment to drink at a bar, then purchase more alcohol.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=177}}\n\nIn the early morning hours of May 27, Dahmer returned toward his apartment to discover Sinthasomphone sitting outside naked on the corner of 25th and State, talking in [[Lao Language|Lao]], with three distressed young women standing near him.<ref>{{cite news|first=Crocker| last=Stephenson|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oLUyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wBIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3124,5920894 |title=2 women say police failed to aid 14-year-old |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |date=July 26, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref> Dahmer approached the trio and explained to the women that Sinthasomphone (whom he referred to by the [[pseudonym|alias]] John Hmung<ref>{{cite news|url=https://journaltimes.com/news/national/dahmer-incident-report-reveals-contradictions/article_0a234184-65a7-5a63-89d6-4d7caedbf1a5.html |title=Dahmer Incident Report Reveals Contradictions |work=Journal Times |date=August 31, 1991 |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>) was his friend, and attempted to lead him to his apartment by the arm.

On this second occasion, the injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, Dahmer took a day's leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes. He retained both victims' skulls.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=182}}{{refn|group=n|Having left Sinthasomphone in the company of Dahmer, the patrol unit which had responded to the women's 911 call then radioed their dispatch unit.

At the apartment, Dahmer drugged, strangled and dismembered Turner and placed his head and internal organs in separate plastic bags in the freezer. Turner was not reported [[missing person|missing]]. Five days later, on July 5, Dahmer lured 23-year-old Jeremiah Weinberger from a Chicago bar to his apartment on the promise of spending the weekend with him. He drugged Weinberger and twice injected boiling water through his skull, sending him into a [[coma]] from which he died two days later.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nOn July 15, Dahmer encountered 24-year-old{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=181}} Oliver Lacy at the corner of 27th and Kilbourn.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=254}} Lacy agreed to Dahmer's ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Lacy. On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive. After unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with [[chloroform]],{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=190}} he phoned his workplace to request a day's absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=181}}\n\nAfter strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse before dismembering him. He placed Lacy's head and heart in the refrigerator and his skeleton in the freezer.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=181}} Four days later, on July 19, Dahmer received word that he was fired.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=194}} Upon receipt of this news, Dahmer lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on Dahmer's bed covered with a sheet for two days. On July 21, Dahmer removed these sheets to find the head covered in maggots, whereupon he decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it in the refrigerator.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=185}} He later acidified Bradehoft's torso along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=258}}\n\n==Arrest==\n===Capture===\nOn July 22, 1991, Dahmer approached three men with an offer of $100 to accompany him to his apartment to pose for nude photographs,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=15}} drink beer and simply keep him company.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=192}} One of the trio, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, agreed to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering Dahmer's apartment, Edwards noted a foul odor and several boxes of hydrochloric acid on the floor, which Dahmer claimed to use for cleaning bricks. After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to Dahmer's request to turn his head and view his tropical fish, whereupon Dahmer placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, \"What's happening?\" Dahmer unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together,{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=151}} then told Edwards to accompany him to the bedroom to pose for nude pictures.

In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he would allow him to do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV. Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and [[chant]]ing before turning his attention back to him. He placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his [[cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=23}} \n\nIn continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and that he was not going to run away.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=24}} Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity. When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning. Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=27}} When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.{{sfn|Davis|1991|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nAt 11:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged down two Milwaukee police officers, Robert Rauth and Rolf Mueller, at the corner of North 25th Street. The officers noted Edwards had a handcuff attached to his wrist,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=2}}{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=154}} whereupon he explained to the officers that a \"freak\" had placed the handcuffs upon him and asked if the police could remove them. When the officers' handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=2}} \n\nWhen the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, Dahmer invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had indeed placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done so. At this point, Edwards divulged to the officers that Dahmer had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. Dahmer made no comment to this revelation, indicating to one of the officers, Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser. As Mueller entered the bedroom, Dahmer attempted to pass Mueller to himself retrieve the key, whereupon the second officer present, Rauth, informed him to \"back off\".{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=3}}\n\nIn the bedroom, Mueller noted there was indeed a large knife beneath the bed. He also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, contained scores of Polaroid pictures\u2014many of which were of human bodies in various stages of dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. Mueller walked into the living room to show them to his partner,<ref name=\"Bardsley-4\"/> uttering the words, \"These are for real.\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=3}} \n\nWhen Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to [[resisting arrest|resist arrest]]. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=33}} As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: \"For what I did I should be dead.\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=4}}\n\nA more detailed search of the apartment, conducted by the Milwaukee police's Criminal Investigation Bureau, revealed a total of four severed heads in Dahmer's kitchen. A total of seven skulls\u2014some painted, some bleached\u2014were found in Dahmer's bedroom and inside a closet.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=157}} In addition, investigators discovered collected blood drippings upon a tray at the bottom of Dahmer's refrigerator, plus two human hearts{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=158}} and a portion of arm muscle, each wrapped inside plastic bags upon the shelves. In Dahmer's freezer, investigators discovered an entire torso, plus a bag of human organs and flesh stuck to the ice at the bottom.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=6}} \n\nElsewhere in Apartment 213, investigators discovered two entire skeletons, a pair of severed hands, two severed and preserved penises, a mummified scalp and, in the 57-gallon drum, three further dismembered torsos dissolving in the acid solution.

Over the following two weeks, Kennedy and, later, Detective Patrick Murphy conducted numerous interviews with Dahmer which, when combined, totalled over 60 hours.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=10}} Dahmer [[waiver|waived]] his right to have a lawyer present throughout his interrogations,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=21}} adding he wished to confess all as he had \"created this horror and it only makes sense I do everything to put an end to it.\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=11}} He readily admitted to having murdered 16 young men in Wisconsin since 1987, with one further victim\u2014Steven Hicks\u2014killed in Ohio back in 1978.\n\nMost of Dahmer's victims had been rendered unconscious prior to their murder, although some had died as a result of having acid or boiling water injected into their brain. As he had no memory of the murder of Tuomi, he was unsure whether he was unconscious when beaten to death, although he did concede it was possible that his viewing the exposed chest of Tuomi while in a drunken stupor may have led him to unsuccessfully attempt to tear Tuomi's heart from his chest.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=109\u2013110}} Almost all the murders Dahmer committed after moving into the Oxford Apartments had involved a ritual of posing the victims' bodies in suggestive positions\u2014typically with the chest thrust outwards\u2014prior to dismemberment.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=159}} \n\nDahmer readily admitted to engaging in necrophilia with several of his victims' bodies, including performing sexual acts with their [[viscus|viscera]]{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=159}} as he dismembered their bodies in his bathtub. Having noted that much of the blood pooled inside his victims' chest after death, Dahmer first removed their internal organs, then suspended the torso so the blood drained into his bathtub, before [[dicing]] any organs he did not wish to retain and paring the flesh from the body.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=161}} The bones he wished to dispose of were pulverized or acidified, with Soilex and bleach solutions used to aid in the preservation of the skeletons and skulls he wished to keep. In addition, Dahmer confessed to having consumed the hearts, livers, biceps, and portions of thighs of several victims killed within the previous year.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=154}}\n\nDescribing the increase in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, Dahmer stated he had been \"completely swept along\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=198}} with his compulsion to kill, adding: \"It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long.\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=120\u2013121}} When asked as to why he had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated he had been in the process of constructing a private [[altar]] of victims' skulls which he had intended to display on the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}}\n\nThis display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Miller and Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. [[Incense|Incense sticks]] were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}} The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}} When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview who the altar was dedicated to, Dahmer replied: \"Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home.\" He further described his intended altar as a \"place for [[meditation]],\" from where he believed he could draw a sense of power,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}} adding: \"If this [his arrest] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found.\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}}\n\n===Indictment===\nOn July 25, 1991, Dahmer was charged with four counts of [[first-degree murder]].

Dahmer was adamant that the race of his victims was incidental to him and that it was the body form of a potential victim that attracted his attention.{{sfn|Campbell|p=36}}{{refn|group=n|Despite Dahmer's insistence the race of his victims was incidental to him, some theorize the majority of his murders may have held a racial motive.<ref>''Erasing Racism: The Survival of the American Nation'' {{ISBN|978-1-615-92527-8}} p. 243</ref><ref>''Twentieth-Century Murder'' {{ISBN|978-1-858-91390-2}} p. 119</ref> Alternatively, his victim selection may have simply been a result of his living in an ethnically mixed area, and the [[demography|demographics]] of the districts of Milwaukee and Chicago where he typically selected his victims.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}}}\n\nMost of Dahmer's victims were killed by strangulation after being drugged with sedatives, although his first victim was killed by a combination of bludgeoning and strangulation and his second victim was battered to death, with one further victim killed in 1990, Ernest Miller, dying of a combination of [[acute stress reaction|shock]] and blood loss due to his carotid artery being cut.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=214}} Many of Dahmer's victims killed in 1991 had holes bored into their skulls through which Dahmer injected hydrochloric acid or, later, boiling water, directly into the brain{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=176\u2013177}} in an attempt to induce a permanent, submissive, unresistant state.

He was bludgeoned with a dumbbell and strangled to death with this instrument before being dismembered. Remains pulverized and scattered in woodland behind Dahmer's childhood home.\n\n===1987===\n*'''November 20''': Steven Walter Tuomi, 25. Killed in a rented room at the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee. Dahmer claimed to have no memory of murdering Tuomi, yet stated he must have battered him to death in a drunken stupor.

No remains were ever found.\n\n===1988===\n*'''January 16''': James Edward Doxtator, 14. Met Dahmer outside a gay bar in Wisconsin.

No remains were ever found.\n*'''March 24''': Richard Guerrero, 22. Drugged and strangled in Dahmer's bedroom at West Allis. Dahmer dismembered Guerrero's corpse in the basement, dissolved the flesh in acid and disposed of the bones in the trash.

Miller was a dance student whom Dahmer encountered outside a bookstore. According to Dahmer, he was especially attracted to Miller's [[physical attractiveness|physique]]. He was killed by having his carotid artery severed before being dismembered in the bathtub, with Dahmer storing his entire skeleton in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet and his heart, biceps, and portions of his legs in the freezer for later consumption.\n*'''September 24''': David Courtney Thomas, 22. Encountered Dahmer near the Grand Avenue Mall; he was lured to Dahmer's apartment on the promise of money for posing nude. Once a laced drink had rendered Thomas unconscious, Dahmer decided he \"wasn't my type.\" Nonetheless, Dahmer strangled Thomas, taking Polaroid photos of the dismemberment process.

The first victim upon whom Dahmer practiced what he later described to investigators as his \"drilling technique,\" a procedure in which he drilled holes into the victim's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the brain. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this practice, after which he was again rendered unconscious with a drink laced with sedatives, then strangled to death. Dahmer flayed Lindsey's body and retained the skin for several weeks.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=13}} His skull was found following Dahmer's arrest.\n*'''May 24''': Tony Anthony Hughes, 31. Hughes was a [[deaf-mute]] whom Dahmer lured to his apartment upon the promise of posing nude for photographs. As Hughes was deaf, he and Dahmer communicated using handwritten notes.

His skull was retained and identified from dental records.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=178}}\n*'''May 27''': Konerak Sinthasomphone, 14. The younger brother of the boy Dahmer had assaulted in 1988. Sinthasomphone was drugged and had hydrochloric acid injected into his brain before Dahmer left the youth unattended as he left the apartment to purchase beer. When he returned, he discovered Sinthasomphone naked and disoriented in the street, with three distressed young women attempting to assist him. When police arrived, Dahmer persuaded them he and Sinthasomphone were lovers and that the youth was simply intoxicated. When police left Sinthasomphone with Dahmer in his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain, and this proved fatal. His head was retained in the freezer and his body dismembered.\n*'''June 30''': Matt Cleveland Turner, 20. On June 30, Dahmer attended the [[Chicago Pride Parade]].

Dahmer's mother worked as a [[teleprinter|teletype machine]] instructor,{{sfn|Campbell}} and his father was a student at [[Marquette University]], working towards a degree in chemistry.

Lionel's university studies kept him away from home much of the time; when he was home, his wife demanded constant attention. She reportedly worked herself into a state of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] over trivial matters simply to appease her husband. On one occasion, Joyce [[suicide attempt|attempted suicide]] from an overdose of the [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] pills to which she had become addicted.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=32}} Consequently, neither parent devoted much time to their son.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=32}}{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nDahmer has been described as being an \"energetic and happy child\" until he became notably subdued after undergoing a [[Inguinal hernia surgery|double hernia]] surgery, which was performed shortly before his fourth birthday.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=30}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeffrey Dahmer|url=https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/jeffrey-dahmer|website=[[Biography.com]]|publisher=[[A&E Networks]]|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}</ref> He recalled his early years of family life as being of \"extreme tension\" which he noted between his parents, whom he observed to be constantly arguing with each other. At elementary school, Dahmer was regarded as both quiet and timid by his peers. On his first grade report card, one teacher described him as a reserved child whom she sensed felt neglected.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=61}} This teacher did note that this sense of neglect seemed to stem from his mother's illnesses.{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=61\u201362}} Nonetheless, although largely reserved and uncommunicative in grade school, Dahmer did have a small number of friends.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nFrom an early age, Dahmer manifested an interest in dead animals. Friends later recalled he initially collected large insects, such as dragonflies and butterflies, which he placed inside jars. Later, he collected [[roadkill|animal carcasses from the roadside]], occasionally accompanied by one or more of his few friends; he [[dismemberment|dismembered]] these animals either at home or in an expanse of woodland behind the family home. According to one friend, Dahmer dismembered these animals and stored the parts in jars in the family's wooden toolshed, always explaining that he was curious as to how each animal \"fitted together\".{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=63}} \n\nIn one instance, Dahmer [[decapitation|decapitated]] the carcass of a dog before nailing the animal's body to a tree. He later impaled the skull of this dog{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=47}} upon a stake beside a wooden cross in woodland behind his house.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=80}} Dahmer's fascination with dead animals might have begun when, at the age of four, he noted his father removing animal bones from beneath the family home. According to Lionel, his son was \"oddly thrilled\" by the sound the bones made, and instantly developed a fixation for playing with and collecting animal bones. He occasionally searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones. With live animals, he explored their bodies to discover where their bones were located.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=32}}\n\nThe Dahmer family relocated to [[Doylestown, Ohio|Doylestown]], Ohio in October 1966.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=34}} At the time, Joyce was pregnant with her second child. When she gave birth to a baby boy on December 18, 1966, Jeffrey was allowed to choose the name of the baby. He chose the name David for his younger brother.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=61}} The same year, Lionel earned his degree and subsequently obtained employment as an [[analytical chemistry|analytical chemist]] in the nearby city of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Donald A.|last=Davis|title=The Jeffrey Dahmer Story: An American Nightmare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSXCEA7LpjsC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=lionel+dahmer+analytical+chemist#v=onepage&q=lionel%20dahmer%20analytical%20chemist|date=November 15, 1991|publisher=[[St. Martin's Paperbacks]]|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-312-92840-7|page=20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, the family relocated to [[Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio|Bath Township, Ohio]]. Two years later, over a family meal of chicken, Dahmer asked his father what would happen if the bones of the chicken were to be placed in a bleach solution.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=39}} Lionel was, by this stage, concerned as to his elder son's placid and [[lethargy|lethargic]] attitude and his solitary existence; therefore, he was delighted at the initiative displayed by his son towards what he believed to be scientific curiosity.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=39}} He willingly demonstrated to his son how to safely bleach and (later) preserve animal bones. Dahmer used this knowledge regarding the cleansing and preserving of bones on many of the animal remains which he continued to avidly collect.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=46}}\n\n===Adolescence and high school===\nFrom his freshman year at [[Revere High School (Ohio)|Revere High School]] (RHS), Dahmer was seen by his peers as an [[outcast (person)|outcast]] with few friends.{{refn|group=n|It has been suggested, in a 2002 paper by Silva, Ferrari and Leong published in the ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', that Dahmer may have suffered from [[Asperger syndrome]].{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}}} Many of his classmates later recollected being disturbed by the fact that he drank both beer and [[distilled beverage|hard alcohol]], which he smuggled into school inside the lining of his army fatigue jacket{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=74}} and concealed in his locker. This drinking occurred before, during, and after school, and was first noted when Dahmer was 14. On one occasion, a classmate observed Dahmer consuming a cup of [[gin]] and asked him why he was drinking in class, to which Dahmer casually replied, \"It's my medicine\".<ref>{{cite news|first1=James|last1=Barron |first2=Mary B.

He initially achieved only average grades, which staff attributed to his [[apathy]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=45}} Dahmer was also known to have been a keen tennis player and to have briefly played in the high school band.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Jeffrey Dahmer HS Yearbook.jpg|140px|thumb|Dahmer at age 17, photographed for the 1977 Revere High School yearbook]]\nWhen he reached [[puberty]], Dahmer discovered he was [[homosexuality|gay]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=43\u201344}} He did not divulge his sexual orientation to his parents. In his early teens, he did engage in a brief relationship with another youth, although the pair never had intercourse.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=43}} By his later admission, Dahmer began [[sexual fantasy|sexually fantasizing]] about dominating and controlling a completely submissive male partner. These fantasies gradually became intertwined with [[dissection]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=51\u201352}} On one occasion, when he was approximately 16 years old, Dahmer conceived a [[rape fantasy]] of rendering [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] a particular male jogger he found attractive, and then making sexual use of his body. To render the man unconscious, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes on the route he had noted the jogger took, baseball bat in hand, and lay in wait for him to run by. The jogger did not pass by on that particular day, however.

In Florida, Dahmer found employment at a [[delicatessen]] and rented a room in a nearby motel. Dahmer spent most of his salary on alcohol, and was soon evicted from the motel for non-payment. He initially spent his evenings on the beach as he continued to work at the sandwich shop until phoning his father and asking to return to Ohio in September of the same year.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=80}}\n\n===Return to Ohio and relocation to West Allis, Wisconsin===\nAfter his return to Ohio, Dahmer initially resided with his father and stepmother and insisted on being delegated numerous chores to occupy his time while he looked for work. He continued to drink heavily, and two weeks after his return Dahmer was arrested for [[public intoxication|drunk and disorderly conduct]],{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=114}} for which he was fined $60 and given a [[suspended sentence|suspended 10-day jail sentence]].{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=125}} Dahmer's father tried unsuccessfully to wean his son off alcohol. In December 1981, he and Dahmer's stepmother sent him to live with his grandmother in [[West Allis, Wisconsin]]. Dahmer's grandmother was the only family member to whom he displayed any affection.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=82}} They hoped that her influence, plus the change of scenery, might persuade Dahmer to refrain from alcohol, find a job, and live responsibly.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=115}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=117}} \n\nInitially, Dahmer's living arrangements with his grandmother were harmonious: he accompanied her to church; willingly undertook chores; actively sought work; and abided by most of her house rules (although he did continue to drink and smoke).{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=83}} This new influence in his life initially brought results and, in early 1982, Dahmer found employment as a [[phlebotomy|phlebotomist]] at the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center. He held this job for a total of 10 months before being laid off.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=82}} Dahmer remained unemployed for over two years, during which he lived upon whatever money his grandmother gave him.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=135}}\n\nShortly before losing his job, Dahmer was arrested for [[indecent exposure]]. On August 7, 1982, at [[Wisconsin State Fair Park]], he was observed to expose himself to a crowd of 25 women and children. For this incident, he was convicted and fined $50 plus [[court costs]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=86}}\n\nIn January 1985, Dahmer was hired as a mixer at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. six nights per week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after Dahmer found this employment, an incident occurred in which he was propositioned by another man while sitting reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw Dahmer a note offering to perform [[fellatio]] upon him. Although Dahmer did not respond to this proposition,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=88}} the incident stirred in his mind the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee's [[gay bar]]s, [[gay bathhouse]]s and bookstores. He is also known to have stolen a male [[mannequin]] from a store,{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=119\u2013120}} which he briefly used for sexual stimulation, until his grandmother discovered the item stowed in a closet and demanded that he discard it.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=91}}\n\nBy late 1985, Dahmer had begun to regularly frequent the bathhouses, which he later described as being \"relaxing places\",{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=92}} but during his sexual encounters, he became frustrated at his partners' moving during the sexual act. Following his arrest, he stated: \"I trained myself to view people as objects of pleasure instead of [as] people\".{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=92}} For this reason, beginning in June 1986, he administered [[hypnotic|sleeping pills]] to his partners, giving them liquor laced with the [[sedative]]s, then raping their unconscious bodies. After approximately 12 such instances, the bathhouses' administration revoked Dahmer's membership, and he began to use hotel rooms to continue this practice.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=94}} \n\nShortly after his membership of the bathhouses was revoked,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=136}} Dahmer read a report in a newspaper regarding the upcoming funeral of an 18-year-old male.

The charge was changed to [[disorderly conduct]] and, on March 10, 1987, Dahmer was sentenced to one year of [[probation]], with additional instructions he was to undergo counseling.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=139}}\n\n==Late 20s and early 30s: subsequent murders==\n\n===Ambassador Hotel===\nOn November 20, 1987, Dahmer\u2014at the time residing with his grandmother in West Allis\u2014encountered a 25-year-old man from [[Ontonagon, Michigan|Ontonagon]], [[Michigan]] named Steven Tuomi at a bar and persuaded him to return to the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening. According to Dahmer, he had no intention of murdering Tuomi, but rather intended to drug and rape him as he lay unconscious. The following morning, however, he awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest \"crushed in\" and \"black and blue\" with bruises. Blood was also seeping from the corner of his mouth, and Dahmer's fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. Dahmer stated he had no memory of having killed Tuomi,<ref name=\"Bardsley-7\"/>{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=137}}{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=141}} and later informed investigators that he \"could not believe this had happened.\" \n\nTo dispose of Tuomi's body, Dahmer purchased a large suitcase in which he transported the body to his grandmother's residence. There, one week later,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=110}} he severed the head, arms, and legs from the torso,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=137}} then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. Dahmer then placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=110}} He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into [[splinter]]s with a sledgehammer. The entire dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours to complete, and he disposed of all of Tuomi's remains\u2014excluding the severed head{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=111}}\u2014in the trash.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=142}}\n\nFor a total of two weeks following Tuomi's murder, Dahmer retained the victim's head wrapped in a blanket. After two weeks, Dahmer boiled the head in a mixture of Soilex (an [[alkalinity|alkali]]-based industrial detergent) and bleach in an effort to retain the skull, which he then used as stimulus for masturbation. Eventually, the skull was rendered too brittle by this bleaching process, so Dahmer pulverized and disposed of it.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=111}}\n\n===Intermediate incidents===\nFollowing the murder of Tuomi, Dahmer began to actively seek victims, most of whom he encountered in or close to gay bars, and whom he typically lured to his grandmother's home. There, he drugged them before or shortly after engaging in sexual activity with them. Once he had rendered the victim unconscious with sleeping pills, he killed them by strangulation.{{sfn|Roy|2002|p=103}}\n\nTwo months after the Tuomi killing, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[male prostitute]] named James Doxtator; Dahmer lured the youth to his home with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. At Dahmer's West Allis residence, the pair engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and strangled him on the floor of the cellar.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=119}} Dahmer left the body in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. He boiled the skull, and initially retained it before pulverizing it.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=151}}\n\nOn March 24, 1988, Dahmer met a 22-year-old [[bisexuality|bisexual]] man named Richard Guerrero outside a gay bar called The Phoenix.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=151}} Dahmer lured Guerrero to his grandmother's residence, although the incentive on this occasion was $50 to simply spend the remainder of the night with him;{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=121}} he then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and strangled him with a leather strap, with Dahmer then performing [[oral sex]] upon the corpse.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=121}} Guerrero's body was dismembered within 24&nbsp;hours of his murder, with the remains again disposed of in the trash and the skull again retained before being pulverized several months later.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=129}}\n\nOn April 23, Dahmer lured another young man to his house; however, after giving the victim a drugged coffee, both he and the victim heard Dahmer's grandmother call, \"Is that you, Jeff?\"{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=166}} Although Dahmer replied in a manner that led his grandmother to believe he was alone, she did observe that Dahmer was not alone.

He was a [[mixed-race]] 24-year-old aspiring model named Anthony Sears, whom Dahmer met at a gay bar on March 25, 1989. According to Dahmer, on this particular occasion, he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before [[last call (bar term)|closing time]] that evening, Sears \"just started talking to me\". Dahmer lured Sears to his grandmother's home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before Dahmer drugged and strangled Sears.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=136}}\n\nThe following morning, Dahmer placed the corpse in his grandmother's bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting to [[flaying|flay]] the corpse.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=136}} He then stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which were again disposed of in the trash. According to Dahmer, he found Sears \"exceptionally attractive\", and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears' head and genitalia in [[acetone]]<ref name=\"Bardsley-8\"/> and stored them in his work locker. When he moved to a new address the following year, he took the remains there.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=197}}\n\nOn May 23, 1989,{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=63}} Dahmer was sentenced to five years' probation and one year in the House of Correction, with [[work release]] permitted in order that he be able to keep his job; he was also required to register as a [[sex offender]].{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=138}}\n\nTwo months before his scheduled release from the work camp, Dahmer was [[parole]]d from this regime. (His five years' probation imposed in 1989 began at this point.){{sfn|Masters|1993|p=138}} On release, Dahmer temporarily moved back to his grandmother's home in West Allis{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=143\u2013144}} before, in May 1990, moving into the Oxford Apartments, located on North 25th Street in Milwaukee.

Smith was a 32-year-old male prostitute whom Dahmer lured to Apartment 213 with the promise of $50 for sex.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=141}} Inside the apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills and manually strangled him.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=142}}\n\nThe following day, Dahmer purchased a [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] camera with which he took several pictures of Smith's body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilex, which allowed him to then rinse the bones in his sink.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=142}} Dahmer dissolved the remainder of Smith's skeleton\u2014excluding the skull\u2014in a container filled with acid.

He drugged and strangled Smith. On this occasion, rather than immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching (which had rendered previous victims' skulls brittle), Dahmer placed Smith's skeleton in his freezer for several months in the hope it would not retain moisture. Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton of this victim would be acidified several months later. Dahmer accidentally destroyed the skull when he placed it in the oven to dry\u2014a process that caused the skull to explode.

Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=154}} \n\nDahmer wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the fridge for later consumption.{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=154\u2013155}} He boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a \"jelly-like substance\" using Soilex, which again enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, Dahmer placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24&nbsp;hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed in the refrigerator before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=154\u2013155}}\n\nThree weeks after the murder of Miller, on September 24, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old man named David Thomas at the [[Shops of Grand Avenue|Grand Avenue Mall]] and persuaded him to return to his apartment for a few drinks, with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer stated that, after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awake in case he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body\u2014intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. He photographed the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which later aided in Thomas's subsequent identification.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=217}}\n\nFollowing the murder of Thomas, Dahmer did not kill anyone for almost five months, although on a minimum of five occasions between October 1990 and February 1991, he unsuccessfully attempted to lure men to his apartment.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=153}} He is also known to have regularly complained of feelings of both anxiety and [[depression (mood)|depression]] to his probation officer throughout 1990; with frequent references to his sexuality, his solitary lifestyle, and financial difficulties. On several occasions, Dahmer is also known to have referred to harboring [[suicidal ideation|suicidal thoughts]].{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\n====1991 killings====\nIn February 1991, Dahmer observed a 17-year-old named Curtis Straughter standing at a bus stop near [[Marquette University]]. According to Dahmer, he lured Straughter into his apartment with an offer of money for posing for nude photos,{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=220\u2013221}} with the added incentive of sexual intercourse. Dahmer drugged and strangled Straughter with a leather strap, then dismembered him, with Dahmer retaining the youth's skull, hands, and genitals and photographing each stage of the dismemberment process. \n\nLess than two months later, on April 7, Dahmer encountered a 19-year-old named Errol Lindsey<ref name=\"Bardsley-10\"/>{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=211}} walking to get a key cut. Lindsey was heterosexual. Dahmer lured Lindsey to his apartment, where he drugged him, drilled a hole in his skull and poured [[hydrochloric acid]] into it. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this experiment (which Dahmer had conceived in the hope of inducing a permanent, unresistant, submissive state), saying: \"I have a headache. What time is it?\"{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=128}}<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Killers|issue=5|page=40}}</ref> In response to this, Dahmer again drugged Lindsey, then strangled him. He decapitated Lindsey and retained his skull; he then flayed Lindsey's body, placing the skin in a solution of cold water and salt for several weeks in the hope of permanently retaining it. Reluctantly, he disposed of Lindsey's skin when he noted it had become too frayed and brittle.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=158}}\n\nBy 1991, fellow residents of the Oxford Apartments had repeatedly complained to the building's manager, Sopa Princewill, of the foul smells emanating from Apartment 213, in addition to the sounds of falling objects and the occasional sound of a chainsaw.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Alex|last=Prud'Homme|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973550-1,00.html |title=The Little Flat of Horrors|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=August 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> Princewill did contact Dahmer in response to these complaints on several occasions, although he initially excused the odors emanating from his apartment as being caused by his freezer breaking, causing the contents to become \"spoiled\".

By coincidence, Sinthasomphone was the younger brother of the boy whom Dahmer had [[child molestation|molested]] in 1988. He approached the youth with an offer of money to accompany him to his apartment to pose for Polaroid pictures. According to Dahmer, Sinthasomphone was initially reluctant to the proposal, before changing his mind and accompanying Dahmer to his apartment, where the youth posed for two pictures in his underwear before Dahmer drugged him into unconsciousness and performed oral sex on him.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=176}}\n\nOn this occasion, Dahmer drilled a single hole into Sinthasomphone's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the [[frontal lobe]].{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=176}} Before Sinthasomphone fell unconscious, Dahmer led the boy into his bedroom, where the body of 31-year-old Tony Hughes, whom Dahmer had killed three days earlier, lay naked on the floor.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=235}} According to Dahmer, he \"believed [that Sinthasomphone] saw this body,\" yet did not react to seeing the bloated corpse\u2014likely because of the effects of the sleeping pills he had ingested and the hydrochloric acid Dahmer had injected through his skull.

On this second occasion, the injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, Dahmer took a day's leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes.

At the apartment, Dahmer drugged, strangled and dismembered Turner and placed his head and internal organs in separate plastic bags in the freezer. Turner was not reported [[missing person|missing]]. Five days later, on July 5, Dahmer lured 23-year-old Jeremiah Weinberger from a Chicago bar to his apartment on the promise of spending the weekend with him. He drugged Weinberger and twice injected boiling water through his skull, sending him into a [[coma]] from which he died two days later.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=188\u2013189}}\n\nOn July 15, Dahmer encountered 24-year-old{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=181}} Oliver Lacy at the corner of 27th and Kilbourn.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=254}} Lacy agreed to Dahmer's ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Lacy. On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive.

After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to Dahmer's request to turn his head and view his tropical fish, whereupon Dahmer placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, \"What's happening?\" Dahmer unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together,{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=151}} then told Edwards to accompany him to the bedroom to pose for nude pictures.

In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he would allow him to do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV. Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and [[chant]]ing before turning his attention back to him. He placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his [[cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=23}} \n\nIn continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and that he was not going to run away.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=24}} Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity. When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning. Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=27}} When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.{{sfn|Davis|1991|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nAt 11:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged down two Milwaukee police officers, Robert Rauth and Rolf Mueller, at the corner of North 25th Street. The officers noted Edwards had a handcuff attached to his wrist,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=2}}{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=154}} whereupon he explained to the officers that a \"freak\" had placed the handcuffs upon him and asked if the police could remove them. When the officers' handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=2}} \n\nWhen the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, Dahmer invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had indeed placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done so. At this point, Edwards divulged to the officers that Dahmer had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. Dahmer made no comment to this revelation, indicating to one of the officers, Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser. As Mueller entered the bedroom, Dahmer attempted to pass Mueller to himself retrieve the key, whereupon the second officer present, Rauth, informed him to \"back off\".{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=3}}\n\nIn the bedroom, Mueller noted there was indeed a large knife beneath the bed. He also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, contained scores of Polaroid pictures\u2014many of which were of human bodies in various stages of dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. Mueller walked into the living room to show them to his partner,<ref name=\"Bardsley-4\"/> uttering the words, \"These are for real.\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=3}} \n\nWhen Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to [[resisting arrest|resist arrest]].

As he had no memory of the murder of Tuomi, he was unsure whether he was unconscious when beaten to death, although he did concede it was possible that his viewing the exposed chest of Tuomi while in a drunken stupor may have led him to unsuccessfully attempt to tear Tuomi's heart from his chest.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=109\u2013110}} Almost all the murders Dahmer committed after moving into the Oxford Apartments had involved a ritual of posing the victims' bodies in suggestive positions\u2014typically with the chest thrust outwards\u2014prior to dismemberment.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=159}} \n\nDahmer readily admitted to engaging in necrophilia with several of his victims' bodies, including performing sexual acts with their [[viscus|viscera]]{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=159}} as he dismembered their bodies in his bathtub. Having noted that much of the blood pooled inside his victims' chest after death, Dahmer first removed their internal organs, then suspended the torso so the blood drained into his bathtub, before [[dicing]] any organs he did not wish to retain and paring the flesh from the body.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=161}} The bones he wished to dispose of were pulverized or acidified, with Soilex and bleach solutions used to aid in the preservation of the skeletons and skulls he wished to keep. In addition, Dahmer confessed to having consumed the hearts, livers, biceps, and portions of thighs of several victims killed within the previous year.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=154}}\n\nDescribing the increase in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, Dahmer stated he had been \"completely swept along\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=198}} with his compulsion to kill, adding: \"It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long.\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=120\u2013121}} When asked as to why he had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated he had been in the process of constructing a private [[altar]] of victims' skulls which he had intended to display on the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}}\n\nThis display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Miller and Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. [[Incense|Incense sticks]] were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}} The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}} When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview who the altar was dedicated to, Dahmer replied: \"Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home.\" He further described his intended altar as a \"place for [[meditation]],\" from where he believed he could draw a sense of power,{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}} adding: \"If this [his arrest] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found.\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=286}}\n\n===Indictment===\nOn July 25, 1991, Dahmer was charged with four counts of [[first-degree murder]].

Three further victims were murdered and dismembered at his grandmother's West Allis residence, with his first and second victims being murdered at his parents' home in Ohio, and at the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee respectively. A total of 14 of Dahmer's victims were from various ethnic minority backgrounds, with nine victims being black.

When police arrived, Dahmer persuaded them he and Sinthasomphone were lovers and that the youth was simply intoxicated.

It is scheduled for a release sometime in 2022.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{see|List of Tiger & Bunny characters}}\nThe series takes place in \"NC 1978\" in a fictional, re-imagined version of New York City called Stern Bild City, where 45 years before, superpowered individuals known as \"NEXT\" (an acronym standing for '''N'''oted '''E'''ntities with e'''X'''traordinary '''T'''alents) started appearing and some of them became superheroes. Each of the city's most famous superheroes work for a sponsor company and their uniforms also contain advertising for real-life companies. Their heroic activity is broadcast on the popular television show \"Hero TV\", where they accumulate points for each heroic feat accomplished (arresting criminals or saving civilians, for example) and the best ranked hero of the season is crowned \"King of Heroes\".\n\nThe story mainly focuses on veteran hero Kotetsu T. Kaburagi, a.k.a. ''Wild Tiger'', who is assigned a new partner: a young man named Barnaby Brooks, Jr. However, Barnaby and Kotetsu have trouble working together, as they have conflicting opinions on how a superhero should act, while at the same time they are trying to crack the mystery of the murder of Barnaby's parents. In addition, the appearance of a homicidal vigilante NEXT named \"Lunatic\" stirs up the public and makes them question the place of heroes in the city.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Anime===\n{{main|List of Tiger & Bunny episodes}}\nThe anime by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] aired in Japan between April 3, 2011 and September 17, 2011.

In the past, this usually referred to those who traveled from less-developed countries to major medical centers in highly developed countries for treatment unavailable at home.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Horowitz|first1=Michael D.|last2=Rosensweig|first2=Jeffrey A.|last3=Jones|first3=Christopher A.|year=2007|title=Medical Tourism: Globalization of the Healthcare Marketplace|journal=MedGenMed|volume=9|issue=4|page=33|pmc=2234298|pmid=18311383}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.nchu.edu.tw/pweb/users/hychuo/lesson/5877.pdf|title=Medical tourism--health care in the global economy|publisher=Physician Exec|accessdate=16 September 2012}}</ref> However, in recent years it may equally refer to those from developed countries who travel to developing countries for lower-priced medical treatments. The motivation may be also for medical services unavailable or non-licensed in the home country: There are differences between the medical agencies (FDA, EMA etc.) world-wide, whether a drug is approved in their country or not. Even within Europe, although therapy protocols might be approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA), several countries have their own review organizations (i.e. NICE by the NHS) in order to evaluate whether the same therapy protocol would be \"cost-effective\", so that patients face differences in the therapy protocols, particularly in the access of these drugs, which might be partially explained by the financial strength of the particular Health System.\n\nMedical tourism most often is for [[surgery|surgeries]] (cosmetic or otherwise) or similar treatments, though people also travel for [[dental tourism]] or [[fertility tourism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/fertilitytourism.asp|title=fertility tourism|author=Paul McFedries|date=2006-05-17|publisher=Word Spy|accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> People with rare conditions may travel to countries where the treatment is better understood. However, almost all types of health care are available, including [[psychiatry]], alternative medicine, convalescent care, and even burial services.\n\nHealth tourism is a wider term for travel that focuses on medical treatments and the use of healthcare services. It covers a wide field of health-oriented, tourism ranging from preventive and health-conductive treatment to rehabilitational and curative forms of travel. [[Wellness tourism]] is a related field.\n\n==History==\nThe first recorded instance of people travelling for medical treatment dates back thousands of years to when [[Greeks|Greek]] pilgrims traveled from the eastern [[Mediterranean]] to a small area in the [[Saronic Gulf]] called [[Epidauria]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Medical Tourism|url=http://www.discovermedicaltourism.com/history/|website=Discovermedicaltourism.com|publisher=Discovermedicaltourism.com|accessdate=2015-11-03}}</ref> This territory was the sanctuary of the healing god [[Asklepios]].\n\n[[Spa town]]s and [[sanatorium|sanitaria]] were early forms of medical tourism. In 18th-century Europe patients visited spas because they were places with supposedly health-giving [[mineral water]]s, treating diseases from [[gout]] to [[liver]] disorders and [[bronchitis]].<ref name=\"Gahlinger2008\">Gahlinger, PM.

A forecast by [[Deloitte Consulting]] published in August 2008 projected that medical tourism originating in the US could jump by a factor of ten over the next decade.  An estimated 750,000 Americans went abroad for health care in 2007, and the report estimated that 1.5 million would seek health care outside the US in 2008.  The growth in medical tourism has the potential to cost US health care providers billions of dollars in lost revenue.<ref>Linda A.

In places like the US, which has high standards of quality, medical tourism is viewed as risky. In some parts of the world, wider political issues can influence where medical tourists will choose to seek out health care.\n\n[[Medical tourism provider]]s have developed as intermediaries which unite potential medical tourists with surgeons, provider hospitals and other organizations. In some cases, surgeons from the United States have  signed up with medical tourism providers to travel to Mexico  to treat American patients. The hope is that using an American surgeon may alleviate concerns about going outside the country, and persuade self-insured American employers to offer this cost-effective option to their workers as a way to save money while still provide high-quality care.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Galewitz |first1=Phil |title=To Save Money, American Patients And Surgeons Meet In Cancun |url=https://khn.org/news/to-save-money-american-patients-and-surgeons-meet-in-cancun/ |website=Kaiser Health News |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |accessdate=14 August 2019|date=2019-08-12 }}</ref> Companies that focus on medical value travel typically provide nurse case managers to assist patients with pre- and post-travel medical issues. They may also help provide resources for follow-up care upon the patient's return.\n\nCircumvention tourism is also an area of medical tourism that has grown. Circumvention tourism is travel in order to access medical services that are legal in the destination country but illegal in the home country.

Ireland and Poland, two European countries with highly restrictive abortion laws, have the highest rates of circumvention tourism. In Poland especially, it is estimated that each year nearly 7,000 women travel to the UK, where abortion services are free through the National Health Service.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Day|first1=Matthew|title=Polish women encouraged to come to UK for 'free abortions' on NHS|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/7441990/Polish-women-encouraged-to-come-to-UK-for-free-abortions-on-NHS.html|accessdate=28 April 2015|agency=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=March 15, 2010}}</ref> There are also efforts being made by independent organizations and doctors, such as with Women on Waves, to help women circumvent draconian laws in order to access medical services.

Exposure to diseases without having built up natural immunity can be a hazard for weakened individuals, specifically with respect to gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. [[hepatitis A]], [[amoebic dysentery]], [[paratyphoid]]) which could weaken progress and expose the patient to [[Mosquito-borne disease|mosquito-transmitted diseases]], [[influenza]], and [[tuberculosis]].

The motivation may be also for medical services unavailable or non-licensed in the home country: There are differences between the medical agencies (FDA, EMA etc.) world-wide, whether a drug is approved in their country or not. Even within Europe, although therapy protocols might be approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA), several countries have their own review organizations (i.e. NICE by the NHS) in order to evaluate whether the same therapy protocol would be \"cost-effective\", so that patients face differences in the therapy protocols, particularly in the access of these drugs, which might be partially explained by the financial strength of the particular Health System.\n\nMedical tourism most often is for [[surgery|surgeries]] (cosmetic or otherwise) or similar treatments, though people also travel for [[dental tourism]] or [[fertility tourism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/fertilitytourism.asp|title=fertility tourism|author=Paul McFedries|date=2006-05-17|publisher=Word Spy|accessdate=2011-10-29}}</ref> People with rare conditions may travel to countries where the treatment is better understood. However, almost all types of health care are available, including [[psychiatry]], alternative medicine, convalescent care, and even burial services.\n\nHealth tourism is a wider term for travel that focuses on medical treatments and the use of healthcare services. It covers a wide field of health-oriented, tourism ranging from preventive and health-conductive treatment to rehabilitational and curative forms of travel. [[Wellness tourism]] is a related field.\n\n==History==\nThe first recorded instance of people travelling for medical treatment dates back thousands of years to when [[Greeks|Greek]] pilgrims traveled from the eastern [[Mediterranean]] to a small area in the [[Saronic Gulf]] called [[Epidauria]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Medical Tourism|url=http://www.discovermedicaltourism.com/history/|website=Discovermedicaltourism.com|publisher=Discovermedicaltourism.com|accessdate=2015-11-03}}</ref> This territory was the sanctuary of the healing god [[Asklepios]].\n\n[[Spa town]]s and [[sanatorium|sanitaria]] were early forms of medical tourism.

A forecast by [[Deloitte Consulting]] published in August 2008 projected that medical tourism originating in the US could jump by a factor of ten over the next decade.  An estimated 750,000 Americans went abroad for health care in 2007, and the report estimated that 1.5 million would seek health care outside the US in 2008.  The growth in medical tourism has the potential to cost US health care providers billions of dollars in lost revenue.<ref>Linda A.

In places like the US, which has high standards of quality, medical tourism is viewed as risky. In some parts of the world, wider political issues can influence where medical tourists will choose to seek out health care.\n\n[[Medical tourism provider]]s have developed as intermediaries which unite potential medical tourists with surgeons, provider hospitals and other organizations. In some cases, surgeons from the United States have  signed up with medical tourism providers to travel to Mexico  to treat American patients. The hope is that using an American surgeon may alleviate concerns about going outside the country, and persuade self-insured American employers to offer this cost-effective option to their workers as a way to save money while still provide high-quality care.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Galewitz |first1=Phil |title=To Save Money, American Patients And Surgeons Meet In Cancun |url=https://khn.org/news/to-save-money-american-patients-and-surgeons-meet-in-cancun/ |website=Kaiser Health News |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |accessdate=14 August 2019|date=2019-08-12 }}</ref> Companies that focus on medical value travel typically provide nurse case managers to assist patients with pre- and post-travel medical issues. They may also help provide resources for follow-up care upon the patient's return.\n\nCircumvention tourism is also an area of medical tourism that has grown. Circumvention tourism is travel in order to access medical services that are legal in the destination country but illegal in the home country.

Ireland and Poland, two European countries with highly restrictive abortion laws, have the highest rates of circumvention tourism. In Poland especially, it is estimated that each year nearly 7,000 women travel to the UK, where abortion services are free through the National Health Service.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Day|first1=Matthew|title=Polish women encouraged to come to UK for 'free abortions' on NHS|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/7441990/Polish-women-encouraged-to-come-to-UK-for-free-abortions-on-NHS.html|accessdate=28 April 2015|agency=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=March 15, 2010}}</ref> There are also efforts being made by independent organizations and doctors, such as with Women on Waves, to help women circumvent draconian laws in order to access medical services.

Exposure to diseases without having built up natural immunity can be a hazard for weakened individuals, specifically with respect to gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. [[hepatitis A]], [[amoebic dysentery]], [[paratyphoid]]) which could weaken progress and expose the patient to [[Mosquito-borne disease|mosquito-transmitted diseases]], [[influenza]], and [[tuberculosis]]. However, because in poor tropical nations diseases run the gamut, doctors seem to be more open to the possibility of considering any infectious disease, including [[HIV]], TB, and [[typhoid]], while there are cases in the West where patients were consistently misdiagnosed for years because such diseases are perceived to be \"rare\" in the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lungil.org/il/copd/TBMisdiagnosed.asp|title=TB Often Misdiagnosed|publisher=American Lung Association of Illinois|accessdate=2007-03-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070301064539/http://www.lungil.org/il/copd/TBMisdiagnosed.asp |archivedate = March 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe quality of post-operative care can also vary dramatically, depending on the hospital and country, and may be different from US or European standards. Also, traveling long distances soon after surgery can increase the risk of complications. Long flights and decreased mobility associated with window seats can predispose one towards developing [[deep vein thrombosis]] and potentially a [[pulmonary embolism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chestnet.org/accp/article/new-dvt-guidelines-no-evidence-support-economy-class-syndrome |title=New DVT Guidelines: No Evidence to Support \"Economy Class Syndrome\"; Oral Contraceptives, Sitting in a Window Seat, Advanced Age, and Pregnancy Increase DVT Risk in Long-distance Travelers |date=7 February 2012 |publisher=American College of Chest Physicians |accessdate=10 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209195940/http://www.chestnet.org/accp/article/new-dvt-guidelines-no-evidence-support-economy-class-syndrome |archive-date=9 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other vacation activities can be problematic as well &mdash; for example, scars may become darker and more noticeable if they are sunburned while healing.<ref>[http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/prevention-wellness/staying-healthy/first-aid/caring-for-your-incision-after-surgery.html \"Caring for Your Incision After Surgery\"], FamilyDoctor.org, ''American Academy of Family Physicians'', December 2010.

Medical tourists come to Israel for a variety of surgical procedures and therapies, including bone marrow transplants, heart surgery, and catheterization, oncological and neurological treatments, orthopedic procedures, car accident rehabilitation, and [[in-vitro fertilization]]. Israel's popularity as a destination for medical tourism stems from its status as a developed country with a high-quality level of medical care, while at the same time having lower medical costs than many other developed countries. Israel is particularly popular as a destination for bone marrow transplants among Cypriots, as the procedure is not available in Cyprus, and for orthopedic procedures among Americans, as the cost of orthopedic procedures in Israel is about half that of in the United States. Israel is a particularly popular destination for people seeking IVF treatments. Medical tourists in Israel use both public and private hospitals, and all major Israeli hospitals offer medical tourism packages which typically cost far less than comparable procedures than in facilities elsewhere with a similarly high standard of care.
