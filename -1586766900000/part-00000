It was their 22nd consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football following their promotion the season 1945\u201346. They played their home games in the [[St. Jakob Stadium]]. The Chairmann of the board was Harry Thommen for the second consecutive year.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Helmut Benthaus]] was the club [[player-manager]] for third consecutive season. There were 14 teams contesting in the [[1967\u201368 Nationalliga A]]. Basel, as reigning champions, played a mediocre season. Although they were within reach of the table top all the time, they messed everything up towards the end of the season as they lost five games out of seven. Therefore they finished the season in fifth position. They were seven points behind the trio [[FC Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]], [[Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich|Grasshopper Club]] and [[FC Lugano|Lugano]] who all ended the season with 38 points. Basel won 13 of the league 26 games, drawing five, losing eight times, and they scored 49 goals conceding 33.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-fcb-bilanz\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1967/68 | title = Bilanz Saison 1967/68 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref> The trio [[Roberto Frigerio]], [[Helmut Hauser]] and [[Dieter R\u00fcefli]] were the team's top goal scorers in the domestic league, each netted nine times.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-fcb-statistic\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/statistik?saison=1967/68 | title = Statistik Nationalliga A 1967/68 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Swiss Cup]] Basel started in the round of 32 with a home match against lower classed FC Le Locle. But the game had to go into overtime. After Le Locle took the lead just after half time break, Frigerio netted the equaliser shortly before the end. In the overtime player-manager [[Helmut Benthaus]] managed the winning goal. In the next round Basel played an away game against [[FC Z\u00fcrich]] and were defeated 0\u20131 and the campaign was be-ended.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-z\u00fcrich-fcb\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=23887 | title = FC Z\u00fcrich - FC Basel 1:0 (0:0) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nAs reigning champions Basel were qualified for the [[1967\u201368 European Cup]]. In the first round they were drawn against Danish team [[Hvidovre IF|Hvidovre]]. The first leg was in the [[St. Jakob Stadium]]. Despite an early lead scored by Hauser, the Danes turned the game and won. In the return leg in stadium [[Idr\u00e6tsparken]] in [[Copenhagen]], Hauser again scored the early lead. Again the Dames turned the match and shortly after half time went into a 3\u20131 lead. This time Basel were fighting against the defeat and drew level at 3\u20133 but could not manage to score a winning goal, which would have put the through to the next round.<ref

It was their 22nd consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football following their promotion the season 1945\u201346. They played their home games in the [[St. Jakob Stadium]]. The Chairmann of the board was Harry Thommen for the second consecutive year.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Helmut Benthaus]] was the club [[player-manager]] for third consecutive season. There were 14 teams contesting in the [[1967\u201368 Nationalliga A]]. Basel, as reigning champions, played a mediocre season. Although they were within reach of the table top all the time, they messed everything up towards the end of the season as they lost five games out of seven. Therefore they finished the season in fifth position. They were seven points behind the trio [[FC Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]], [[Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich|Grasshopper Club]] and [[FC Lugano|Lugano]] who all ended the season with 38 points. Basel won 13 of the league 26 games, drawing five, losing eight times, and they scored 49 goals conceding 33.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-fcb-bilanz\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1967/68 | title = Bilanz Saison 1967/68 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref> The trio [[Roberto Frigerio]], [[Helmut Hauser]] and [[Dieter R\u00fcefli]] were the teams top goal scorers in the domestic league, each netted nine times.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-fcb-statistic\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/statistik?saison=1967/68 | title = Statistik Nationalliga A 1967/68 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Swiss Cup]] Basel started in the round of 32 with a home match against lower classed FC Le Locle. But the game had to go into overtime. After Le Locle took the lead just after half time break, Frigerio netted the equaliser shortly before the end. In the overtime player-manager [[Helmut Benthaus]] managed the winning goal. In the next round Basel played an away game against [[FC Z\u00fcrich]] and were defeated 0\u20131 and the campaign was be-ended.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-z\u00fcrich-fcb\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=23887 | title = FC Z\u00fcrich - FC Basel 1:0 (0:0) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nAs reigning champions Basel were qualified for the [[1967\u201368 European Cup]]. In the first round the were drawn against Danish team [[Hvidovre IF|Hvidovre]]. The first leg was in the [[St. Jakob Stadium]]. Despite an early lead scored by Hauser, the Danes turned the game and won. In the return leg in stadium [[Idr\u00e6tsparken]] in [[Copenhagen]], Hauser again scored the early lead. Again the Dames turned the match and shortly after half time went into a 3\u20131 lead. This time Basel were fighting against the defeat and drew level at 3\u20133 but could not manage to score a winning goal, which would have put the through to the next round.<ref

According to the Roman law ''res nullius'', or things without an owner, such as wild animals (''ferae beastiae''), lost slaves and abandoned buildings could be taken as property by anyone by seizure.\n\nA part of the debate over the history of ''terra nullius'' is when the term itself was first used. According to [[historian of ideas]] Andrew Fitzmaurice, ''territorium nullius'' and ''terra nullius'' were two different, albeit related, legal terms. He claims that ''territorium nullius'' was first used in a meeting of the [[Institut de Droit International]] in 1888 where the legal principles of the [[Berlin conference]] were discussed and that ''terra nullius'' was introduced twenty years later during legal disputes over the polar regions.<ref name=\"surplusvalue.org.au\">http://surplusvalue.org.au/Misc%20Articles%20and%20Poems/terra%20nullius%20copy.pdf</ref> Historian Michael Connor on the other hand, argues that ''territorium nullius'' and ''terra nullius'' are the same thing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunray22b.net/truth_or_not_in_academic_accusations.htm|title=Null truth to academic accusations|author=|date=|website=www.sunray22b.net|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref> Both scholars are active in the [[Australia]]n [[history wars]] debate.\n\nThere is considerable debate among historians about how and when the ''terra nullius'' concepts were used. The debate has been especially prevalent in Australia where it was ignited by the history wars caused by the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo case]] in 1992. The history wars caused Australian historians to reevaluate the country's history, the dispossession of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] and whether the land should best be characterized as having been \"settled\" or \"conquered\". A part of this debate concerned whether ''terra nullius'' as a concept was ever used by England and other European powers to justify territorial conquest.\n\nOn one side of the debate are historians such as [[Alan Frost]] and [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] who claim that in the 15th and 16th century, European writers adopted the ''res nullius'' concept for territorial conquest. Frost writes:\n\n{{quote|By the mid\u2013eighteenth century, the theoretical basis of a new convention of acquiring empire had emerged. If a European state (a Christian Prince) had already established an effective possession of a region, another might acquire title to it only by formal cession (which might or might not involve outright purchase). If the region was not already possessed by a rival, then a state might acquire it in one of three ways, viz.: \u2013 by persuading the indigenous inhabitants to submit themselves to its overlordship; \u2013 by purchasing from those inhabitants the right to settle part or parts of it; \u2013 by unilateral possession, on the basis of first discovery and effective occupation.<ref name=\"samuelgriffith.org.au\">http://samuelgriffith.org.au/docs/vol1/chap11.pdf</ref>}}\n\nHistorians debate whether \"first discovery and effective occupation\" was applied to territory inhabited by [[indigenous people]] that European empires sought to acquire or not. According to Frost:\n\n{{quote|However, if the indigenes had advanced beyond the state of nature only so far as to have developed language and the community of the family, but no further; if they had not yet mixed their labour with the earth in any permanent way; or if the region were literally uninhabited, then Europeans considered it to be terra nullius (i.e., belonging to no one), to which they might gain permanent title by first discovery and effective occupation.<ref name=\"samuelgriffith.org.au\"/>}}\n\nOn the other side of the debate are historians which claim that ''terra nullius'' is a much younger concept, which did not become formalized before the end of the 19th century. Historian Merete Borch writes:\n\n{{quote|When the wealth of material relevant to this issue is surveyed it seems much more likely that there was no legal doctrine maintaining that inhabited land could be regarded as ownerless, nor was this the basis of official policy, in the eighteenth century or before. Rather it seems to have developed as a legal theory in the nineteenth century.<ref>http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/pdfs/76.pdf</ref>}}\n\nThese historians claim instead that territorial conquest was justified from natural law &mdash; that which has no owner can be taken by the first taker. Michael Connor in his book \"The Invention of Terra Nullius\" takes an even more extreme view and argues that no one in the 19th century thought of Australia as being ''terra nullius''.  He calls the concept a [[legal fiction]], a straw man developed in the late 20th century:\n\n{{quote|By the time of Mabo in 1992, terra nullius was the only explanation for the British settlement of Australia. Historians, more interested in politics than archives, misled the legal profession into believing that a phrase no one had heard of a few years before was the very basis of our statehood, and Reynolds' version of our history, especially The Law of the Land, underpinned the Mabo judges' decision-making.<ref>Michael Connor in ''The Bulletin'' (Sydney), 20 August 2003: (see further Connor 2005.)</ref>}}\n\n==Current claims of ''terra nullius''==\nFew territories are currently considered ''terra nullius''.\n\n===Bir Tawil===\n[[File:Egypt Sudan claims.svg|thumb|upright|Simplified map showing Egypt's territory (yellow), Sudan's territory (blue), disputed territory (green) and unclaimed Bir Tawil (white)]]\n\n[[Bir Tawil]] is an example of a territory often claimed to be ''terra nullius''.<ref>There is some disagreement of whether Bir Tawil is 'terra nullius'' or not.

One border placed Bir Tawil under Sudan's control and the [[Hala'ib Triangle]] under Egypt's; the other border did the reverse.

In a minority of those claims, international and domestic courts have ruled on whether the territory is or was ''terra nullius'' or not.\n\n===Australia===\n[[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples]] inhabited Australia for over 65,000 years before [[European settlement of Australia|European settlement]], which commenced in 1788.  [[Customary law in Australia|Indigenous customs, rituals and laws]] were unwritten. It has been claimed that Australia was considered ''terra nullius'' at the time of settlement.

The concept of ''terra nullius'' was not considered in this case, however.<ref name=\"Milirrpum\">''[[Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd]]'' (1971) 17 [[Federal Law Reports|FLR]] 141 (27 April 1971) [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory|Supreme Court]] (NT).</ref> Court cases in 1977, 1979, and 1982 &ndash; brought by or on behalf of Aboriginal activists &ndash; challenged Australian sovereignty on the grounds that ''terra nullius'' had been improperly applied, therefore Aboriginal sovereignty should still be regarded as being intact. The courts rejected these cases, but the Australian High Court left the door open for a reassessment of whether the continent should be considered \"settled\" or \"conquered\".

This led to ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 1)]]''.

Expeditions from each of these polities visited Svalbard principally during the summer for [[whaling]], with the first two sending a few wintering parties in the 1620s and 1630s.<ref name=\"surplusvalue.org.au\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th century, both [[Norway]] and [[Russia]] made strong claims to the archipelago. In 1909, Italian jurist Camille Piccioni described [[Spitzbergen]], as it was then known, as ''terra nullius'':\n\n{{quote|The issue would have been simpler if Spitzbergen, until now terra nullius, could have been attributed to a single state, for reasons of neighbouring or earlier occupation.

The Philippines claims it under the principles of ''terra nullius'' and EEZ ([[Exclusive Economic Zone]]). China's claim refers to its discovery in the 13th century by Chinese fishermen. (The former [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949) | Nationalist government on the Chinese mainland]] had also claimed this territory after the founding of the [[Republic of China]] in 1911.) However, despite China's position of non-participation in an [[UNCLOS]] case, in 2016 the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration | PCA]] denied the lawfulness of China's \"[[Nine-Dash Line]]\" claim.{{cn|date=October 2019}} Despite this, China continues to build artificial islands in the South China Sea, and Scarborough Shoal is a prime location{{cn|date=October 2019}} for another one.

Since then there has been a more complicated debate and a general narrowing of the definition of \"fiduciary duty\".\n\n===Guano Islands===\nThe [[Guano Islands Act]] of 18 August 1856 enabled citizens of the U.S. to take possession of islands containing [[guano]] deposits. The islands can be located anywhere, so long as they are not occupied and not within the jurisdiction of other governments.

However, this interpretation is not accepted by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), both of whom claim sovereignty over the islands.\n\n===Burkina Faso and Niger===\nA narrow strip of land adjacent to two territorial markers along the [[Burkina Faso]]\u2013[[Niger]] border was claimed by neither country until the [[International Court of Justice]] settled a more extensive territorial dispute in 2013.

According to the Roman law ''res nullius'', or things without an owner, such as wild animals (''ferae beastiae''), lost slaves and abandoned buildings could be taken as property by anyone by seizure.\n\nA part of the debate over the history of ''terra nullius'' is when the term itself was first used. According to [[historian of ideas]] Andrew Fitzmaurice, ''territorium nullius'' and ''terra nullius'' were two different, albeit related, legal terms. He claims that ''territorium nullius'' was first used in a meeting of the [[Institut de Droit International]] in 1888 where the legal principles of the [[Berlin conference]] were discussed and that ''terra nullius'' was introduced twenty years later during legal disputes over the polar regions.<ref name=\"surplusvalue.org.au\">http://surplusvalue.org.au/Misc%20Articles%20and%20Poems/terra%20nullius%20copy.pdf</ref> Historian Michael Connor on the other hand, argues that ''territorium nullius'' and ''terra nullius'' are the same thing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunray22b.net/truth_or_not_in_academic_accusations.htm|title=Null truth to academic accusations|author=|date=|website=www.sunray22b.net|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref> Both scholars are active in the [[Australia]]n [[history wars]] debate.\n\nThere is considerable debate among historians about how and when the ''terra nullius'' concepts were used. The debate has been especially prevalent in Australia where it was ignited by the history wars caused by the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo case]] in 1992. The history wars caused Australian historians to reevaluate the country's history, the dispossession of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] and whether the land should best be characterized as having been \"settled\" or \"conquered\". A part of this debate concerned whether ''terra nullius'' as a concept was ever used by England and other European powers to justify territorial conquest.\n\nOn one side of the debate are historians such as [[Alan Frost]] and [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]] who claim that in the 15th and 16th century, European writers adopted the ''res nullius'' concept for territorial conquest. Frost writes:\n\n{{quote|By the mid\u2013eighteenth century, the theoretical basis of a new convention of acquiring empire had emerged. If a European state (a Christian Prince) had already established an effective possession of a region, another might acquire title to it only by formal cession (which might or might not involve outright purchase). If the region was not already possessed by a rival, then a state might acquire it in one of three ways, viz.: \u2013 by persuading the indigenous inhabitants to submit themselves to its overlordship; \u2013 by purchasing from those inhabitants the right to settle part or parts of it; \u2013 by unilateral possession, on the basis of first discovery and effective occupation.<ref name=\"samuelgriffith.org.au\">http://samuelgriffith.org.au/docs/vol1/chap11.pdf</ref>}}\n\nHistorians debate whether \"first discovery and effective occupation\" was applied to territory inhabited by [[indigenous people]] that European empires sought to acquire or not. According to Frost:\n\n{{quote|However, if the indigenes had advanced beyond the state of nature only so far as to have developed language and the community of the family, but no further; if they had not yet mixed their labour with the earth in any permanent way; or if the region were literally uninhabited, then Europeans considered it to be terra nullius (i.e., belonging to no one), to which they might gain permanent title by first discovery and effective occupation.<ref name=\"samuelgriffith.org.au\"/>}}\n\nOn the other side of the debate are historians which claim that ''terra nullius'' is a much younger concept, which did not become formalized before the end of the 19th century. Historian Merete Borch writes:\n\n{{quote|When the wealth of material relevant to this issue is surveyed it seems much more likely that there was no legal doctrine maintaining that inhabited land could be regarded as ownerless, nor was this the basis of official policy, in the eighteenth century or before. Rather it seems to have developed as a legal theory in the nineteenth century.<ref>http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/resources/pdfs/76.pdf</ref>}}\n\nThese historians claim instead that territorial conquest was justified from natural law &mdash; that which has no owner can be taken by the first taker. Michael Connor in his book \"The Invention of Terra Nullius\" takes an even more extreme view and argues that no one in the 19th century thought of Australia as being ''terra nullius''.  He calls the concept a [[legal fiction]], a straw man developed in the late 20th century:\n\n{{quote|By the time of Mabo in 1992, terra nullius was the only explanation for the British settlement of Australia. Historians, more interested in politics than archives, misled the legal profession into believing that a phrase no one had heard of a few years before was the very basis of our statehood, and Reynolds' version of our history, especially The Law of the Land, underpinned the Mabo judges' decision-making.<ref>Michael Connor in ''The Bulletin'' (Sydney), 20 August 2003: (see further Connor 2005.)</ref>}}\n\n==Current claims of ''terra nullius''==\nFew territories are currently considered ''terra nullius''.\n\n===Bir Tawil===\n[[File:Egypt Sudan claims.svg|thumb|upright|Simplified map showing Egypt's territory (yellow), Sudan's territory (blue), disputed territory (green) and unclaimed Bir Tawil (white)]]\n\n[[Bir Tawil]] is an example of a territory often claimed to be ''terra nullius''.<ref>There is some disagreement of whether Bir Tawil is 'terra nullius'' or not.

[[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". But Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\nA book covering the case, ''Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major'' by [[Bob Woffinden]] and James Plaskett was published in January 2015.

A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken.

[[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". But Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\nA book covering the case, ''Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major'' by [[Bob Woffinden]] and James Plaskett was published in January 2015.

The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\".

The judge told Ingram he took into account \"the punishment you have brought upon yourself and your dire financial state\", and he rejected an alternative option of a [[community service]] order after Ingram told a [[probation officer]] he feared other criminals would bully him.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Savill |first1=Richard |title=Cheating major walks free over insurance fraud |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1447382/Cheating-major-walks-free-over-insurance-fraud.html |accessdate=12 September 2018 |work=Daily Telegraph (UK) |date=22 November 2003}}</ref>\n\n==After ''Millionaire''==\nFollowing his appearance on ''Millionaire'', Ingram has appeared on other various TV shows, including ''[[The Games (UK TV series)|The Games]]'' (on which he featured with former [[Liberty X]] singer [[Kevin Simm]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/The_Games|title=The Games|publisher=UK Game Shows|accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref> ''[[The Weakest Link (UK game show)|The Weakest Link]]'' (on which he featured with his wife, Diana) and ''[[Wife Swap (UK TV series)|Wife Swap]]'', where he swapped his wife for [[Jade Goody]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn September 16th 2010, Charles was involved in a freak accident whilst mowing his lawn.

For aircraft it is generally needed for both. It was also formerly called ''alighting gear'' by some manufacturers, such as the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. For aircraft, Stinton<ref>The Design Of The Aeroplane, Darrol Stinton 1983, {{ISBN|0-632-01877-1}}, p.63</ref> makes the terminology distinction ''undercarriage (British) = landing gear (US)''.\n\nFor aircraft, the landing gear supports the craft when it is not flying, allowing it to take off, land, and taxi without damage. Wheeled landing gear is the most common with skis or floats needed to operate from snow/ice/water and skids for vertical operation on land. Faster aircraft have retractable undercarriages, which fold away during flight to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]].\n\nSome unusual landing gear have been evaluated experimentally. These include: no landing gear (to save weight), made possible by operating from a catapult cradle and flexible landing deck:<ref>Farnborough and the Fleeet Air Arm, Geoffrey Cooper 2008, {{ISBN|978 1 85780 306 8}}, pp. 197-205</ref> air cushion (to enable operation over a wide range of ground obstacles and water/snow/ice);<ref>Power The Pratt and Whitney Canada Story, Kenneth H> Sullivan and Larry Milberry 1989, {{ISBN|0-921022-01-8}}, pp. 193/194</ref> tracked (to reduce runway loading).<ref>Magnesium Overcast The Story of the Convair B-36, Dennis R. Jenkins2001-2002, {{ISBN|978-1-58007-129-1}}, p. 17</ref>\n\nFor [[launch vehicle]]s and [[Lander (spacecraft)|spacecraft landers]], the landing gear usually only supports the vehicle on landing, and is not used for takeoff or surface movement.\n\n==Aircraft==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}<!-- the spacecraft landing gear section is well sourced; the larger tracts of unsourced statements and potential [[WP:OR|original research]] are in the extensive prose on Aircraft landing gear -->\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 170\n| image1 = Oleo torque link main landing gear.JPG\n| width1 =\n| alt1 =\n| caption1 = [[Oleo strut|Oleo (pressurized gas - oil) strut]] with torque links\n| image2 = Oleo trailing link main landing gear.JPG \n| width2 =\n| alt2 =\n| caption2 = Oleo strut with trailing link\n| image3 = Rubber trailing link main landing gear.JPG\n| width3 =\n| alt3 =\n| caption3 = Rubber discs in compression with trailing link, used on [[Mooney M20]] series of aircraft\n| image4 = Spring steel main landing gear.JPG\n| width4 =\n| alt4 =\n| caption4 = Simple spring steel bar, used on many light aircraft\n| image5 = Tubular main landing gear.JPG\n| width5 =\n| alt5 =\n| caption5 = Simple steel tube\n| header = Methods of landing gear shock absorption\n| header_align = center\n| header_background =\n| footer =\n| footer_align = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| footer_background =\n| background color =\n}}\nAircraft landing gear includes wheels equipped with solid [[shock absorber]]s on light planes, and air/oil [[oleo strut]]s on larger aircraft. [[Ski]]s are used for operating from snow and [[seaplane|float]]s from water. ([[Helicopter]]s use skids, [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]]s or wheels depending on their size and role.)\n\nThe landing gear represents 2.5 to 5% of the [[MTOW]] and 1.5 to 1.75% of the aircraft cost but 20% of the [[airframe]] direct [[Aircraft maintenance|maintenance]] cost. A suitably-designed wheel can support {{cvt|30|t|lb}}, tolerate a ground speed of 300&nbsp;km/h and roll a distance of {{cvt|500000|km|mi}} ; it has a 20,000 hours [[time between overhaul]] and a 60,000 hours or 20 years life time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fzt.haw-hamburg.de/pers/Scholz/dglr/hh/text_2002_04_11_Fahrwerk.pdf |title= Aircraft Landing Gear |at= The Evolution of a System |author= Gerd Roloff |publisher= Airbus-Deutschland GmbH |date= April 2002 |access-date= 2017-05-23 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081122135510/http://www.fzt.haw-hamburg.de/pers/Scholz/dglr/hh/text_2002_04_11_Fahrwerk.pdf |archive-date= 2008-11-22 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n===Gear arrangements===\nWheeled undercarriages normally come in two types: \n* ''[[Conventional landing gear|conventional or \"taildragger\" undercarriage]]'', where there are two main wheels towards the front of the aircraft and a single, much smaller, wheel or skid at the rear. The same helicopter arrangement is called tricycle tailwheel.<ref>https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a105512.pdf, TABLE 1</ref>\n* ''[[tricycle undercarriage]]'' where there are two main wheels (or wheel assemblies) under the wings and a third smaller wheel in the nose. The same helicopter arrangement is called tricycle nosewheel.\nThe taildragger arrangement was common during the early propeller era, as it allows more room for propeller clearance. \nMost modern aircraft have tricycle undercarriages. Taildraggers are considered harder to land and take off (because the arrangement is usually ''unstable'', that is, a small deviation from straight-line travel [[Ground loop (aviation)|will tend to increase]] rather than correct itself), and usually require special pilot training. A small tail wheel or skid/bumper may be added to a tricycle undercarriage to prevent damage to the underside of the fuselage if over-rotation occurs on take-off leading to a [[tailstrike|tail strike]]. Aircraft with tail-strike protection include the [[B-29 Superfortress]], [[Boeing 727]] [[trijet]] and [[Concorde]]. Some aircraft with retractable conventional landing gear have a fixed tailwheel. Hoerner<ref>http://ftp.demec.ufpr.br/disciplinas/TM240/Marchi/Bibliografia/Hoerner.pdf p.14-3</ref> estimated the drag of the Me-109 fixed tailwheel and compared it with that of other protrusions such as the pilot's canopy.\n\nA third arrangement (known as tandem or bicycle) has the main and nose gear located fore and aft of the center of gravity under the fuselage with outriggers on the wings. This is used when there is no convenient location on either side of the fuselage to attach the main undercarriage or to store it when retracted. Examples include the [[Lockheed U-2]] spy plane and the [[Harrier Jump Jet]]. The [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] uses a similar arrangement, except that the fore and aft gears each have two twin-wheel units side by side.\n\nQuadricycle gear is similar to bicycle but with two sets of wheels displaced laterally in the fore and aft positions. Raymer<ref>https://soaneemrana.org/onewebmedia/AIRCRAFT%20DESIGN%20%3B%20A%20Conceptual%20Approach%20BY%20DANIEL%20P%20RAYMER.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704162411/https://soaneemrana.org/onewebmedia/AIRCRAFT%20DESIGN%20%3B%20A%20Conceptual%20Approach%20BY%20DANIEL%20P%20RAYMER.pdf |date=2019-07-04 }}, p.230</ref> classifies the B-52 gear as quadricycle.

If the wheels don't retract completely but protrude partially exposed to the airstream, it is called a semi-retractable gear.\n\nMost retractable gear is hydraulically operated, though some is electrically operated or even manually operated on very light aircraft. The landing gear is stowed in a compartment called a wheel well.\n\nPilots confirming that their landing gear is down and locked refer to \"three greens\" or \"three in the green.\", a reference to the electrical indicator lights (or painted panels of mechanical indicator units) from the nosewheel/tailwheel and the two main gears. Blinking green lights or red lights indicate the gear is in transit and neither up and locked or down and locked. When the gear is fully stowed up with the up-locks secure, the lights often extinguish to follow the dark cockpit philosophy; some airplanes have gear up indicator lights.<ref name=\"faaHandbook\">{{cite book |title=AMT Airframe Handbook Volume 2 (FAA-H-8083-31) |publisher=FAA |pages=13\u201324 |location=Washington DC}}</ref>\n\nRedundant systems are used to operate the landing gear and redundant main gear legs may also be provided so the aircraft can be landed in a satisfactory manner in a range of failure scenarios. The [[Boeing 747]] was given four separate and independent hydraulic systems (when previous airliners had two) and four main landing gear posts (when previous airliners had two). Safe landing would be possible if two main gear legs were torn off provided they were on opposite sides of the fuselage.<ref>747 Creating The World's First Jumbo Jet And Other Adventures From A Life In Aviation, Joe Sutter 2006, {{ISBN|0 06 088241 7}}, p. 129</ref>  In the case of power failure in a light aircraft, an emergency extension system is always available. This may be a manually operated crank or pump, or a mechanical free-fall mechanism which disengages the uplocks and allows the landing gear to fall under gravity.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Me 163 Komet (2323215901).jpg|[[Messerschmitt Me 163|Me 163B]] ''Komet'' with its two-wheel takeoff \"dolly\" in place\nFile:DHL Boeing 767 (7567986860).jpg|The landing gear of a [[Boeing 767]] retracting into the fuselage\nFile:Landing gear schematic.svg|Schematic showing hydraulically operated landing gear, with the wheel stowed in the wing root of the aircraft\nFile:737under.jpg|A [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-700]] with main undercarriage retracted in the wheel wells without landing gear doors\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-393-1409-02, Russland, Flugzeug Junkers Ju 87 D.jpg|A Ju 87D with a [[wheel spat]] on its right wheel, absent on its left\n</gallery>\n\n===Large aircraft===\nAs aircraft weights have increased more wheels have been added and runway thickness has increased to keep within the runway loading limit. This progression is shown by Torenbeek.<ref>https://www.academia.edu/14985385/Torenbeek_Synthesis_of_Subsonic_Airplane_Design, Fig. 10-5</ref> A [[Lockheed JetStar]], with 4 wheels supporting about 40,000&nbsp;lb, needed a 10in thick flexible (asphalt) pavement. The thickness rose to 25in for a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]/10 with about 400,000&nbsp;lb supported on 8 wheels. Heavier aircraft were able to operate from the same thickness pavements by using more wheels. For example, the heavier [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]/30 had 10 wheels and the first [[Boeing 747]], weighing about 700,000&nbsp;lb, had 16 wheels. The same-weight [[Lockheed C-5]], with 24 wheels, only needs an 18in pavement.\n\nThe earliest \"giant\" aircraft placed in quantity production, the [[Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI]] German [[World War I]] long-range bomber of 1916, used eighteen wheels for its undercarriage, split between two wheels on its nose gear struts, and sixteen wheels on its main gear units \u2014 split into four side-by-side quartets each, two quartets of wheels per side \u2014 under each tandem engine nacelle, to support its loaded weight of almost 12 metric tons.\nMultiple \"tandem wheels\" on an aircraft \u2014 particularly for [[cargo aircraft]], mounted to the fuselage lower sides as retractable main gear units on modern designs \u2014 were first seen during World War II, on the experimental German [[Arado Ar 232]] cargo aircraft, which used a row of eleven \"twinned\" fixed wheel sets directly under the fuselage centerline to handle heavier loads while on the ground.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sengfelder |first=G\u00fcnther |date=1993 |title=German Aircraft Landing Gear |url= |location=Atglen, PA USA |publisher=Schiffer Publishing |pages=40\u201342 |isbn=0-88740-470-7 |quote=A significant advantage of this [Ar 232] aircraft was its rough-field landing gear.

Wing-mounted floats or stubby wing-like [[sponson]]s are added for stability. Sponsons are attached to the lower sides of the fuselage.\n\nA [[floatplane]] has two or three streamlined floats. Amphibious floats have retractable wheels for land operation.\n\nAn [[amphibious aircraft]] or amphibian usually has two distinct landing gears, namely a \"boat\" hull/floats and retractable wheels, which allow it to operate from land or water.\n\nBeaching gear is detachable wheeled landing gear that allows a non-amphibious floatplane or flying boat to be maneuvered on land. It is used for aircraft maintenance and storage and is either carried in the aircraft or kept at a slipway. Beaching gear may consist of individual detachable wheels or a cradle that supports the entire aircraft. In the former case, the beaching gear is manually attached or detached with the aircraft in the water; in the latter case, the aircraft is maneuvered onto the cradle.\n\n[[Helicopter]]s able to land on water use floats or a hull and floats.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Cessna 208 Caravan 1 floatplane (G-MDJE) at Gloucestershire Airport (England) 24May2017 arp.jpg|[[Cessna 208]] floatplane with amphibious floats\nFile:De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver N72355 Kenmore 2 crop.jpg|[[de Havilland Canada DHC-2]] on non-amphibious floats\nFile:95siki-suitei_1929.jpg|[[Nakajima E8N]] floatplane with three floats\nFile:Consolidated PBY Catalina 10 (7605528392).jpg|Amphibious [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] with landing gear lowered\nFile:Short Solent with Beaching Gear.

For landing a cleaving action is required to reduce the impact with the surface of the water. \nA vee bottom parts the water and chines deflect the spray to prevent it damaging vulnerable parts of the aircraft. Additional spray control may be needed using spray strips or inverted gutters.\nA step is added to the hull, just behind the center of gravity, to stop water clinging to the afterbody so the aircraft can accelerate to flying speed. The step allows air, known as ventilation air, to break the water suction on the afterbody.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930093023.pdf</ref> Two steps were used on the [[Kawanishi H8K]].<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930083200</ref> A step increases the drag in flight. The drag contribution from the step can be reduced with a fairing. A faired step was introduced on the [[Short Sunderland]]III.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930093610.pdf, p.25</ref>\n\nOne goal of seaplane designers was the development of an open ocean seaplane capable of routine operation from very rough water. This led to changes in seaplane hull configuration. High length/beam ratio hulls and extended afterbodies improved rough water capabilities.<ref>https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/650769.pdf</ref>\nA hull much longer than its width also reduced drag in flight.<ref name=\"archive.org\">https://archive.org/details/Aviation_Week_1952-06-23/page/n17?q=m-270+martin+flying+boat</ref> An experimental development of the [[Martin Marlin]], the Martin M-270, was tested with a new hull with a greater length/beam ratio of 15 obtained by adding 6 feet to both the nose and tail.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/> Rough-sea capability can be improved with lower take-off and landing speeds because impacts with waves are reduced. The [[Shin Meiwa US-1A]] is a STOL amphibian with blown flaps and all control surfaces. The ability to land and take-off at relatively low speeds of about 45 knots and the hydrodynamic features of the hull, long length/beam ratio<ref>https://www.scribd.com/document/169396592/Is-There-a-Role-for-Modern-Day-Seaplanes-in-Open-Ocean-Search-and-Rescue-pdf, p.35</ref> and inverted spray gutter for example, allow operation in wave heights of 15 feet.<ref>https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a476447.pdf, p.13</ref> The inverted gutters channel spray to the rear of the propeller discs.<ref>https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA476447 p.13</ref>\n\nLow speed maneuvring is necessary between slipways and buoys and take-off and landing areas. Water rudders are used on seaplanes ranging in size from the [[Republic RC-3 Seabee]] to the [[Beriev A-40]]<ref>https://www.airvectors.net/avbe200.html.</ref> Hydro flaps were used on the [[Martin Marlin]]<ref>https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/14093, p.4</ref> and [[Martin SeaMaster]]. Hydroflaps, submerged at the rear of the afterbody, act as a speed brake or differentially as a rudder. A fixed fin, known as a [[skeg]], has been used for directional stability.  A skeg, was added to the second step on the [[Kawanishi H8K]] flying boat hull.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930083200.pdf, Figure 3 (d)</ref>\n\nHigh speed impacts in rough water between the hull and wave flanks may be reduced using hydro-skis which hold the hull out of the water at higher speeds. Hydro skis replace the need for a boat hull and only require a plain fuselage which planes at the rear. Alternatively skis with wheels can be used for land-based aircraft which start and end their flight from a beach or floating barge. Hydro-skis with wheels were demonstrated as an all-purpose landing gear conversion of the [[Fairchild C-123]], known as the Panto-base<ref>https://patents.google.com/patent/US2844339A/en</ref> [[Stroukoff YC-134]]. A seaplane designed from the outset with hydro-skis was the [[Convair F2Y Sea Dart]] prototype fighter. The skis incorporated small wheels, with a third wheel on the fuselage, for ground handling.\n\nIn the 1950s hydro-skis were envisaged as a ditching aid for large piston-engined aircraft.<ref>https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/38156#/summary, p.189</ref> Water-tank tests done using models of the [[Lockheed Constellation]], [[Douglas DC-4]] and [[Lockheed Neptune]] concluded that chances of survival and rescue would be greatly enhanced by preventing critical damage associated with ditching.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930086049</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Short Sunderland MR.5 ML824 NS-Z Hendon 03.77 edited-3.jpg|[[Short Sunderland]] V showing step on wing float and faired step on hull\nFile:Kawanishii H8K3.svg|[[Kawanishi H8K]] showing two steps on the hull, a skeg at the second step and spray strips under the forebody\nFile:Martin YP6M-1 Seamaster in flight.jpg|[[Martin SeaMaster]] showing outline of hydroflaps at rear\nFile:YC-123E with pantobase landing gear 1955.jpg|Stroukoff YC-123E showing hydro-skis on pantobase landing gear\nFile:Harbin SH-5.jpg|[[Harbin SH-5]] showing deep vee forebody\nFile:Us-1a 04l.jpg|[[Shin Meiwa US-1A]] showing inverted spray gutter from nose to behind propellers\nFile:ShinMaywa US-2 at Atsugi.jpg|[[Shin Meiwa US-2]] showing revised spray suppressor compared to that on US-1A\nFile:Be-42 rear view - Fairford 96.jpg|[[Beriev A-40]] showing water rudder\nFile:XF2Y-1 off San Diego 1954-55 NAN1-81.jpg|[[Convair F2Y Sea Dart]] showing twin hydro-skis\n</gallery>\n\n===Shipboard operation===\nThe landing gear on fixed-wing aircraft that land on aircraft carriers have a higher sink-rate requirement because the aircraft are flown onto the deck with no [[landing flare]].\nOther features have related to catapult take-off requirements for specific aircraft.

The main disadvantage to using the takeoff dolly/trolley and landing skid(s) system on German World War II aircraft \u2013 intended for a sizable number of late-war German jet and rocket-powered military aircraft designs \u2013 was that aircraft would likely be scattered all over a military airfield after they had landed from a mission, and would be unable to taxi on their own to an appropriately hidden \"dispersal\" location, which could easily leave them vulnerable to being shot up by attacking [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] fighters. A related contemporary example are the wingtip support wheels (\"pogos\") on the [[Lockheed U-2]] reconnaissance aircraft, which fall away after take-off and drop to earth; the aircraft then relies on titanium skids on the wingtips for landing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==== Rearwards and sideways retraction ====\n[[File:Republic P- 47D Thunderbolt ExCC.jpg|thumb|right|A Royal Air Force [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] with its raked-forward main gear, and rearward-angled main wheel position (when retracted) indicated by the just-visible open wheel door.]]\nSome main landing gear struts on World War II aircraft, in order to allow a single-leg main gear to more efficiently store the wheel within either the wing or an engine nacelle, rotated the single gear strut through a 90\u00b0 angle during the rearwards-retraction sequence to allow the main wheel to rest \"flat\" above the lower end of the main gear strut, or flush within the wing or engine nacelles, when fully retracted. Examples are the [[Curtiss P-40]], [[Vought F4U Corsair]], [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]], [[Messerschmitt Me 210]] and [[Junkers Ju 88]].

One exception to the need for this complexity in many WW II fighter aircraft was Japan's famous [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zero]] fighter, whose main gear stayed at a perpendicular angle to the centerline of the aircraft when extended, as seen from the side.\n\n==== Variable axial position of main wheels ====\nThe main wheels on the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] could move 20 inches between a forward and aft position. The forward position was used for take-off to give a longer lever-arm for pitch control and greater nose-up attitude. The aft position was used to reduce landing bounce and reduce risk of tip-back during ground handling.<ref>U.S. Naval Air Superiority Development Of Shipborne Jet Fighters 1943-1962, Tommy H.

This configuration proved so manoeuvrable that it was also selected for the [[B-47 Stratojet]].<ref>Air Force Legends Number 201 The Martin XB-51, Scott Libis, 1998, {{ISBN|0 942612 00 0}}, p. 2</ref> It was also used on the U-2, [[Myasishchev M-4]], [[Yakovlev Yak-25]], [[Yakovlev Yak-28|Yak-28]], [[Sud Aviation Vautour]]. A variation of the multi tandem layout is also used on the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] which has four main wheel bogies (two forward and two aft) underneath the fuselage and a small outrigger wheel supporting each wing-tip. The B-52's landing gear is also unique in that all four pairs of main wheels can be steered. This allows the landing gear to line up with the runway and thus makes [[crosswind landing]]s easier (using a technique called ''[[crab landing]]''). Since tandem aircraft cannot [[Rotation (aeronautics)|rotate]] for takeoff, the forward gear must be long enough to give the wings the correct [[angle of attack]] during takeoff. During landing, the forward gear must not touch the runway first, otherwise the rear gear will slam down and may cause the aircraft to bounce and become airborne again.<ref>{{cite AV media\n | people =\n | title =The B-47\n | medium =\n | publisher =[[Lookout Mountain Air Force Station]]\n | location =\n | date =1950\n | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2iU_VdHD3M&t }}</ref>\n\n==== Crosswind landing accommodation ====\n[[File:CNAM-IMG 0625.jpg|thumb|The \"castoring\" main gear arrangement on a [[Bl\u00e9riot XI]]]]\n\nOne very early undercarriage incorporating castoring for crosswind landings was pioneered on the [[Bleriot VIII]] design of 1908. It was later used in the much more famous Bl\u00e9riot XI Channel-crossing aircraft of 1909 and also copied in the earliest examples of the [[Etrich Taube]]. In this arrangement the main landing gear's shock absorption was taken up by a vertically sliding bungee cord-sprung upper member. The vertical post along which the upper member slid to take landing shocks also had its lower end as the rotation point for the forward end of the main wheel's suspension fork, allowing the main gear to pivot on moderate crosswind landings.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nManually-adjusted main-gear units on the B-52 can be set for crosswind take-offs.

Monowheel gear is also used on some powered aircraft, where drag reduction is a priority, such as the [[Europa XS]]. Much like the Me 163 rocket fighter, some gliders from prior to the [[Second World War]] used a take-off dolly that was jettisoned on take-off and then landed on a fixed skid.<ref name=\"Europa\">{{Cite web|title=Europa XS Monowheel Overview|url=http://www.europa-aircraft.co.uk/monowheel/|publisher=Europa Aircraft Ltd.|year=2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205201312/http://www.europa-aircraft.co.uk/monowheel/|archive-date=5 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> This configuration is necessarily accompanied with a taildragger.\n\n==== Helicopters ====\nLight helicopters use simple landing skids to save weight and cost. The skids may have attachment points for wheels so that they can be moved for short distances on the ground. Skids are impractical for helicopters weighing more than four tons. Some high-speed machines have retractable wheels, but most use fixed wheels for their robustness, and to avoid the need for a retraction mechanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.helis.com/howflies/skids.php|title=Skids or Wheels?|last=Cox|first=Taylor|website=helis.com|access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Tailsitter ====\n[[File:Convair XFY-1 Pogo 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|A [[Convair XFY Pogo]] showing its landing gear]]\nExperimental [[tailsitter]] aircraft use landing gear located in their tails for [[VTOL]] operation.\n\n==== Light aircraft ====\nFor light aircraft a type of landing gear which is economical to produce is a simple wooden arch laminated from ash, as used on some homebuilt aircraft. A similar arched gear is often formed from spring steel. The [[Cessna 165|Cessna Airmaster]] was among the first aircraft to use spring steel landing gear. The main advantage of such gear is that no other shock-absorbing device is needed; the deflecting leaf provides the shock absorption.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==== Folding gear ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1996-027-05A, Flugzeug Junkers Ju 288 V1.jpg|thumb|right|Ju 288 V1 first prototype, showing its complex \"folding\" main undercarriage.]] \nThe limited space available to stow landing gear has led to many complex retraction mechanisms, each unique to a particular aircraft. An early example, the German ''[[Bomber B]]'' combat aircraft design competition winner, the [[Junkers Ju 288]], had a complex \"folding\" main landing gear unlike any other aircraft designed by either [[Axis Forces|Axis]] or [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] sides in the war: its single oleo strut was only attached to the lower end of its Y-form main retraction struts, handling the twinned main gear wheels, and folding by swiveling downwards and aftwards during retraction<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www5a.biglobe.ne.jp/~t_miyama/ju288leg.html|title=Ju288\u306e\u811a|website=www5a.biglobe.ne.jp}}</ref> to \"fold\" the maingear's length to shorten it for stowage in the engine nacelle it was mounted in.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sengfelder |first=G\u00fcnther |date=1993 |title=German Aircraft Landing Gear |url= |location=Atglen, PA USA |publisher=Schiffer Publishing |pages=175\u2013177 |isbn=0-88740-470-7 |quote=The Ju 288's landing gear was most innovative in its design. A Y-shaped bearer was mounted in the engine nacelle with its upper arms hinged. At the bottom end of this bearer was the shock absorber leg, which was likewise hinged. Two double-brake wheels, with (metric) size 1015 x 380 tires, were mounted on the cross-axle. During the retraction cycle a folding strut was raised by a hydraulic jack. The bottom part of the folding strut drew the Y-bearer upwards. Functioning via a lever-and-gear arrangement, a pushrod positioned parallel to the Y-bearer acted upon another gear segment mounted to the oleo leg's hinge pin and rotated it about this as the Y-bearer was drawn upwards.}}</ref>  However, the single pivot-point design also led to [[Junkers Ju 288#Undercarriage difficulties|numerous incidents of collapsed maingear units]] for its prototype airframes.\n\n==== Tracked ====\nIncreased contact area can be obtained with very large wheels, lots of smaller wheels or track-type gear. Tracked gear made by [[Dowty Group|Dowty]] was fitted to a [[Westland Lysander]] in 1938 for taxi tests, then a [[Fairchild Cornell]] and a [[Douglas Boston]].<ref>https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1943/1943 - 2372.html</ref> Bonmartini, in Italy, fitted tracked gear to a [[Piper Cub]] in 1951.<ref>https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971 - 2630.html</ref> \nTrack-type gear was also tested using a C-47, C-82 and B-50. A much heavier aircraft, an XB-36, was made available for further tests, although there was no intention of using it on production aircraft. The stress on the runway was reduced to one third that of the B-36 four-wheel bogie.<ref>Magnesium Overcast The Story of the Convair B-36, Dennis R.

It is one of many aviation technologies being proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/environment/Documents/technology-roadmap-2013.pdf</ref> Leaving the landing gear on the ground reduces weight and drag. Leaving it behind after take-off was done for a different reason, ie with military objectives, during World War II using the \"dolly\" and \"trolley\" arrangements of the German [[Me 163]]B rocket fighter and [[Arado Ar 234]]A prototype jet recon-bomber.\n\n===Steering===\nThere are several types of steering. [[Taildragger]] aircraft may be steered by [[rudder]] alone (depending upon the [[prop wash]] produced by the aircraft to turn it) with a freely pivoting tail wheel, or by a steering linkage with the tail wheel, or by ''differential braking'' (the use of independent brakes on opposite sides of the aircraft to turn the aircraft by slowing one side more sharply than the other). Aircraft with tricycle landing gear usually have a steering linkage with the nosewheel (especially in large aircraft), but some allow the nosewheel to pivot freely and use differential braking and/or the rudder to steer the aircraft, like the [[Cirrus SR22]].\n\nSome aircraft require that the pilot steer by using rudder pedals; others allow steering with the yoke or control stick. Some allow both.  Still others have a separate control, called a ''[[tiller]]'', used for steering on the ground exclusively.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Rudder====\nWhen an aircraft is steered on the ground exclusively using the rudder, it needs a substantial airflow past the rudder, which can be generated either by the forward motion of the aircraft or by propeller slipstream. Rudder steering requires considerable practice to use effectively. Although it needs airflow past the rudder, it has the advantage of not needing any friction with the ground, which makes it useful for aircraft on water, snow or ice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Direct====\n[[File:MM00756-4.jpg|thumb|The nose gear steering-wheel ([[tiller]]) is visible as a semi-circular wheel to the left of the yoke in this photo of a Boeing 727 cockpit]]\nSome aircraft link the yoke, control stick, or rudder directly to the wheel used for steering. Manipulating these controls turns the steering wheel (the nose wheel for [[tricycle landing gear]], and the tail wheel for [[taildragger]]s). The connection may be a firm one in which any movement of the controls turns the steering wheel (and vice versa), or it may be a soft one in which a spring-like mechanism twists the steering wheel but does not force it to turn. The former provides positive steering but makes it easier to skid the steering wheel; the latter provides softer steering (making it easy to overcontrol) but reduces the probability of skidding. Aircraft with retractable gear may disable the steering mechanism wholly or partially when the gear is retracted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Differential braking====\nDifferential braking depends on asymmetric application of the brakes on the main gear wheels to turn the aircraft. For this, the aircraft must be equipped with separate controls for the right and left brakes (usually on the rudder pedals). The nose or tail wheel usually is not equipped with brakes. Differential braking requires considerable skill. In aircraft with several methods of steering that include differential braking, differential braking may be avoided because of the wear it puts on the braking mechanisms. Differential braking has the advantage of being largely independent of any movement or skidding of the nose or tailwheel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Tiller====\nA tiller in an aircraft is a small wheel or lever, sometimes accessible to one pilot and sometimes duplicated for both pilots, that controls the steering of the aircraft while it is on the ground. The tiller may be designed to work in combination with other controls such as the rudder or yoke. In large airliners, for example, the tiller is often used as the sole means of steering during taxi, and then the rudder is used to steer during takeoff and landing, so that both aerodynamic control surfaces and the landing gear can be controlled simultaneously when the aircraft is moving at aerodynamic speeds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Tires and wheels===\n[[File:Two man replace a main landing gear tire of a plane.jpg|thumb|Two mechanics replacing a main landing gear wheel on a [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-668-7162-06A, Flugzeug Heinkel He 177, Fahrgestell.jpg|thumb|right|[[Luftwaffe]] groundcrew servicing a [[Heinkel He 177|Heinkel He 177A's]] main-gear wheels and tires, February 1944]]\nThe specified selection criterion, e.g., minimum size, weight, or pressure, are used to select suitable [[Tire#Aircraft|tires]] and wheels from manufacturer's catalog and industry standards found in the Aircraft Yearbook published by the Tire and Rim Association, Inc.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19970031272.pdf, p.30</ref>\n\n====Gear loading====\nThe choice of the main wheel tires is made on the basis of the static loading case.

Braking will also become less effective due to a reduction in the frictional force between the tires and the ground. In addition, the decrease in the size of the tire, and hence the size of the wheel, could pose a problem if internal brakes are to be fitted inside the wheel rims. The arguments against higher pressure are of such a nature that commercial operators generally prefer the lower pressures in order to maximize tire life and minimize runway stress. To prevent punctures from stones Philippine Airlines had to operate their [[Hawker Siddeley 748]] aircraft with pressures as low as the tire manufacturer would permit.<ref name=blackman>\"Test Pilot\" Tony Blackman, Grub Street Publishing 2009, {{ISBN|9781906502362}}, p.177</ref> However, too low a pressure can lead to an accident as in the [[Nigeria Airways Flight 2120]].\n\nA rough general rule for required tire pressure is given by the manufacturer in their catalog.

A NASA long-term goal is to confine aircraft objectional noise to within the airport bounary. During the approach to land the landing gear is lowered several miles from touchdown and the landing gear is the dominant airframe noise source, followed by deployed highlift devices. With engines at a reduced power setting on the approach it is necessary to reduce airframe noise to make a significant reduction to total aircraft noise.<ref>http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&dvs=1575683504592~592, p.5</ref><ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040086700.pdf</ref> The addition of add-on fairings is one approach for reducing the noise from the landing gear with a longer term approach to address noise generation during initial design.<ref>http://resource.isvr.soton.ac.uk/staff/pubs/PubPDFs/Pub12391.pdf</ref>\n\n'''Semi-active gear''' Airline specifications require an airliner to reach up to 90,000 take-offs and landings and roll 500,000&nbsp;km on the ground in its lifetime. Conventional landing gear is designed to absorb the energy of a landing and doesn't perform well at reducing ground-induced vibrations in the airframe during landing ground roll, taxi and take-off. Airframe vibrations and fatigue damage can be reduced using semi-active oleos which vary damping over a wide range of ground speeds and runway quality.<ref>https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=agard+r+800, Paper 5</ref>\n\n===Accidents===\nMalfunctions or human errors (or a combination of these) related to retractable landing gear have been the cause of numerous accidents and incidents throughout aviation history.

Although rarely fatal, a gear-up landing can be very expensive if it causes extensive airframe/engine damage. For propeller-driven aircraft a [[prop strike]] may require an engine overhaul.\n\n[[File:JetBlue292Landing.jpg|thumb|[[JetBlue Airways Flight 292]], an Airbus A320, making an emergency landing on runway 25L at Los Angeles International Airport in 2005 after the front landing gear malfunctioned]]\n\nSome aircraft have a stiffened fuselage underside or added features to minimize structural damage in a wheels-up landing.

For aircraft it is generally needed for both. It was also formerly called ''alighting gear'' by some manufacturers, such as the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. For aircraft, Stinton<ref>The Design Of The Aeroplane, Darrol Stinton 1983, {{ISBN|0-632-01877-1}}, p.63</ref> makes the terminology distinction ''undercarriage (British) = landing gear (US)''.\n\nFor aircraft, the landing gear supports the craft when it is not flying, allowing it to take off, land, and taxi without damage. Wheeled landing gear is the most common with skis or floats needed to operate from snow/ice/water and skids for vertical operation on land. Faster aircraft have retractable undercarriages, which fold away during flight to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]].\n\nSome unusual landing gear have been evaluated experimentally. These include: no landing gear (to save weight), made possible by operating from a catapult cradle and flexible landing deck:<ref>Farnborough and the Fleeet Air Arm, Geoffrey Cooper 2008, {{ISBN|978 1 85780 306 8}}, pp. 197-205</ref> air cushion (to enable operation over a wide range of ground obstacles and water/snow/ice);<ref>Power The Pratt and Whitney Canada Story, Kenneth H> Sullivan and Larry Milberry 1989, {{ISBN|0-921022-01-8}}, pp. 193/194</ref> tracked (to reduce runway loading).<ref>Magnesium Overcast The Story of the Convair B-36, Dennis R.

The same helicopter arrangement is called tricycle tailwheel.<ref>https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a105512.pdf, TABLE 1</ref>\n* ''[[tricycle undercarriage]]'' where there are two main wheels (or wheel assemblies) under the wings and a third smaller wheel in the nose. The same helicopter arrangement is called tricycle nosewheel.\nThe taildragger arrangement was common during the early propeller era, as it allows more room for propeller clearance. \nMost modern aircraft have tricycle undercarriages. Taildraggers are considered harder to land and take off (because the arrangement is usually ''unstable'', that is, a small deviation from straight-line travel [[Ground loop (aviation)|will tend to increase]] rather than correct itself), and usually require special pilot training. A small tail wheel or skid/bumper may be added to a tricycle undercarriage to prevent damage to the underside of the fuselage if over-rotation occurs on take-off leading to a [[tailstrike|tail strike]]. Aircraft with tail-strike protection include the [[B-29 Superfortress]], [[Boeing 727]] [[trijet]] and [[Concorde]]. Some aircraft with retractable conventional landing gear have a fixed tailwheel. Hoerner<ref>http://ftp.demec.ufpr.br/disciplinas/TM240/Marchi/Bibliografia/Hoerner.pdf p.14-3</ref> estimated the drag of the Me-109 fixed tailwheel and compared it with that of other protrusions such as the pilot's canopy.\n\nA third arrangement (known as tandem or bicycle) has the main and nose gear located fore and aft of the center of gravity under the fuselage with outriggers on the wings. This is used when there is no convenient location on either side of the fuselage to attach the main undercarriage or to store it when retracted. Examples include the [[Lockheed U-2]] spy plane and the [[Harrier Jump Jet]]. The [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] uses a similar arrangement, except that the fore and aft gears each have two twin-wheel units side by side.\n\nQuadricycle gear is similar to bicycle but with two sets of wheels displaced laterally in the fore and aft positions. Raymer<ref>https://soaneemrana.org/onewebmedia/AIRCRAFT%20DESIGN%20%3B%20A%20Conceptual%20Approach%20BY%20DANIEL%20P%20RAYMER.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704162411/https://soaneemrana.org/onewebmedia/AIRCRAFT%20DESIGN%20%3B%20A%20Conceptual%20Approach%20BY%20DANIEL%20P%20RAYMER.pdf |date=2019-07-04 }}, p.230</ref> classifies the B-52 gear as quadricycle.

If the wheels don't retract completely but protrude partially exposed to the airstream, it is called a semi-retractable gear.\n\nMost retractable gear is hydraulically operated, though some is electrically operated or even manually operated on very light aircraft. The landing gear is stowed in a compartment called a wheel well.\n\nPilots confirming that their landing gear is down and locked refer to \"three greens\" or \"three in the green.\", a reference to the electrical indicator lights (or painted panels of mechanical indicator units) from the nosewheel/tailwheel and the two main gears. Blinking green lights or red lights indicate the gear is in transit and neither up and locked or down and locked.

The thickness rose to 25in for a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]/10 with about 400,000&nbsp;lb supported on 8 wheels. Heavier aircraft were able to operate from the same thickness pavements by using more wheels. For example, the heavier [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]]/30 had 10 wheels and the first [[Boeing 747]], weighing about 700,000&nbsp;lb, had 16 wheels. The same-weight [[Lockheed C-5]], with 24 wheels, only needs an 18in pavement.\n\nThe earliest \"giant\" aircraft placed in quantity production, the [[Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI]] German [[World War I]] long-range bomber of 1916, used eighteen wheels for its undercarriage, split between two wheels on its nose gear struts, and sixteen wheels on its main gear units \u2014 split into four side-by-side quartets each, two quartets of wheels per side \u2014 under each tandem engine nacelle, to support its loaded weight of almost 12 metric tons.\nMultiple \"tandem wheels\" on an aircraft \u2014 particularly for [[cargo aircraft]], mounted to the fuselage lower sides as retractable main gear units on modern designs \u2014 were first seen during World War II, on the experimental German [[Arado Ar 232]] cargo aircraft, which used a row of eleven \"twinned\" fixed wheel sets directly under the fuselage centerline to handle heavier loads while on the ground.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sengfelder |first=G\u00fcnther |date=1993 |title=German Aircraft Landing Gear |url= |location=Atglen, PA USA |publisher=Schiffer Publishing |pages=40\u201342 |isbn=0-88740-470-7 |quote=A significant advantage of this [Ar 232] aircraft was its rough-field landing gear.

Wing-mounted floats or stubby wing-like [[sponson]]s are added for stability. Sponsons are attached to the lower sides of the fuselage.\n\nA [[floatplane]] has two or three streamlined floats. Amphibious floats have retractable wheels for land operation.\n\nAn [[amphibious aircraft]] or amphibian usually has two distinct landing gears, namely a \"boat\" hull/floats and retractable wheels, which allow it to operate from land or water.\n\nBeaching gear is detachable wheeled landing gear that allows a non-amphibious floatplane or flying boat to be maneuvered on land. It is used for aircraft maintenance and storage and is either carried in the aircraft or kept at a slipway. Beaching gear may consist of individual detachable wheels or a cradle that supports the entire aircraft. In the former case, the beaching gear is manually attached or detached with the aircraft in the water; in the latter case, the aircraft is maneuvered onto the cradle.\n\n[[Helicopter]]s able to land on water use floats or a hull and floats.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Cessna 208 Caravan 1 floatplane (G-MDJE) at Gloucestershire Airport (England) 24May2017 arp.jpg|[[Cessna 208]] floatplane with amphibious floats\nFile:De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver N72355 Kenmore 2 crop.jpg|[[de Havilland Canada DHC-2]] on non-amphibious floats\nFile:95siki-suitei_1929.jpg|[[Nakajima E8N]] floatplane with three floats\nFile:Consolidated PBY Catalina 10 (7605528392).jpg|Amphibious [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] with landing gear lowered\nFile:Short Solent with Beaching Gear.

For landing a cleaving action is required to reduce the impact with the surface of the water. \nA vee bottom parts the water and chines deflect the spray to prevent it damaging vulnerable parts of the aircraft. Additional spray control may be needed using spray strips or inverted gutters.\nA step is added to the hull, just behind the center of gravity, to stop water clinging to the afterbody so the aircraft can accelerate to flying speed. The step allows air, known as ventilation air, to break the water suction on the afterbody.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930093023.pdf</ref> Two steps were used on the [[Kawanishi H8K]].<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930083200</ref> A step increases the drag in flight. The drag contribution from the step can be reduced with a fairing. A faired step was introduced on the [[Short Sunderland]]III.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930093610.pdf, p.25</ref>\n\nOne goal of seaplane designers was the development of an open ocean seaplane capable of routine operation from very rough water. This led to changes in seaplane hull configuration. High length/beam ratio hulls and extended afterbodies improved rough water capabilities.<ref>https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/650769.pdf</ref>\nA hull much longer than its width also reduced drag in flight.<ref name=\"archive.org\">https://archive.org/details/Aviation_Week_1952-06-23/page/n17?q=m-270+martin+flying+boat</ref> An experimental development of the [[Martin Marlin]], the Martin M-270, was tested with a new hull with a greater length/beam ratio of 15 obtained by adding 6 feet to both the nose and tail.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/> Rough-sea capability can be improved with lower take-off and landing speeds because impacts with waves are reduced. The [[Shin Meiwa US-1A]] is a STOL amphibian with blown flaps and all control surfaces. The ability to land and take-off at relatively low speeds of about 45 knots and the hydrodynamic features of the hull, long length/beam ratio<ref>https://www.scribd.com/document/169396592/Is-There-a-Role-for-Modern-Day-Seaplanes-in-Open-Ocean-Search-and-Rescue-pdf, p.35</ref> and inverted spray gutter for example, allow operation in wave heights of 15 feet.<ref>https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a476447.pdf, p.13</ref> The inverted gutters channel spray to the rear of the propeller discs.<ref>https://archive.org/details/DTIC_ADA476447 p.13</ref>\n\nLow speed maneuvring is necessary between slipways and buoys and take-off and landing areas. Water rudders are used on seaplanes ranging in size from the [[Republic RC-3 Seabee]] to the [[Beriev A-40]]<ref>https://www.airvectors.net/avbe200.html.</ref> Hydro flaps were used on the [[Martin Marlin]]<ref>https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/14093, p.4</ref> and [[Martin SeaMaster]]. Hydroflaps, submerged at the rear of the afterbody, act as a speed brake or differentially as a rudder. A fixed fin, known as a [[skeg]], has been used for directional stability.  A skeg, was added to the second step on the [[Kawanishi H8K]] flying boat hull.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930083200.pdf, Figure 3 (d)</ref>\n\nHigh speed impacts in rough water between the hull and wave flanks may be reduced using hydro-skis which hold the hull out of the water at higher speeds. Hydro skis replace the need for a boat hull and only require a plain fuselage which planes at the rear. Alternatively skis with wheels can be used for land-based aircraft which start and end their flight from a beach or floating barge. Hydro-skis with wheels were demonstrated as an all-purpose landing gear conversion of the [[Fairchild C-123]], known as the Panto-base<ref>https://patents.google.com/patent/US2844339A/en</ref> [[Stroukoff YC-134]]. A seaplane designed from the outset with hydro-skis was the [[Convair F2Y Sea Dart]] prototype fighter. The skis incorporated small wheels, with a third wheel on the fuselage, for ground handling.\n\nIn the 1950s hydro-skis were envisaged as a ditching aid for large piston-engined aircraft.<ref>https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/38156#/summary, p.189</ref> Water-tank tests done using models of the [[Lockheed Constellation]], [[Douglas DC-4]] and [[Lockheed Neptune]] concluded that chances of survival and rescue would be greatly enhanced by preventing critical damage associated with ditching.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19930086049</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Short Sunderland MR.5 ML824 NS-Z Hendon 03.77 edited-3.jpg|[[Short Sunderland]] V showing step on wing float and faired step on hull\nFile:Kawanishii H8K3.svg|[[Kawanishi H8K]] showing two steps on the hull, a skeg at the second step and spray strips under the forebody\nFile:Martin YP6M-1 Seamaster in flight.jpg|[[Martin SeaMaster]] showing outline of hydroflaps at rear\nFile:YC-123E with pantobase landing gear 1955.jpg|Stroukoff YC-123E showing hydro-skis on pantobase landing gear\nFile:Harbin SH-5.jpg|[[Harbin SH-5]] showing deep vee forebody\nFile:Us-1a 04l.jpg|[[Shin Meiwa US-1A]] showing inverted spray gutter from nose to behind propellers\nFile:ShinMaywa US-2 at Atsugi.jpg|[[Shin Meiwa US-2]] showing revised spray suppressor compared to that on US-1A\nFile:Be-42 rear view - Fairford 96.jpg|[[Beriev A-40]] showing water rudder\nFile:XF2Y-1 off San Diego 1954-55 NAN1-81.jpg|[[Convair F2Y Sea Dart]] showing twin hydro-skis\n</gallery>\n\n===Shipboard operation===\nThe landing gear on fixed-wing aircraft that land on aircraft carriers have a higher sink-rate requirement because the aircraft are flown onto the deck with no [[landing flare]].\nOther features have related to catapult take-off requirements for specific aircraft.

The main disadvantage to using the takeoff dolly/trolley and landing skid(s) system on German World War II aircraft \u2013 intended for a sizable number of late-war German jet and rocket-powered military aircraft designs \u2013 was that aircraft would likely be scattered all over a military airfield after they had landed from a mission, and would be unable to taxi on their own to an appropriately hidden \"dispersal\" location, which could easily leave them vulnerable to being shot up by attacking [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] fighters. A related contemporary example are the wingtip support wheels (\"pogos\") on the [[Lockheed U-2]] reconnaissance aircraft, which fall away after take-off and drop to earth; the aircraft then relies on titanium skids on the wingtips for landing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==== Rearwards and sideways retraction ====\n[[File:Republic P- 47D Thunderbolt ExCC.jpg|thumb|right|A Royal Air Force [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] with its raked-forward main gear, and rearward-angled main wheel position (when retracted) indicated by the just-visible open wheel door.]]\nSome main landing gear struts on World War II aircraft, in order to allow a single-leg main gear to more efficiently store the wheel within either the wing or an engine nacelle, rotated the single gear strut through a 90\u00b0 angle during the rearwards-retraction sequence to allow the main wheel to rest \"flat\" above the lower end of the main gear strut, or flush within the wing or engine nacelles, when fully retracted. Examples are the [[Curtiss P-40]], [[Vought F4U Corsair]], [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]], [[Messerschmitt Me 210]] and [[Junkers Ju 88]].

One exception to the need for this complexity in many WW II fighter aircraft was Japan's famous [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zero]] fighter, whose main gear stayed at a perpendicular angle to the centerline of the aircraft when extended, as seen from the side.\n\n==== Variable axial position of main wheels ====\nThe main wheels on the [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] could move 20 inches between a forward and aft position. The forward position was used for take-off to give a longer lever-arm for pitch control and greater nose-up attitude. The aft position was used to reduce landing bounce and reduce risk of tip-back during ground handling.<ref>U.S. Naval Air Superiority Development Of Shipborne Jet Fighters 1943-1962, Tommy H.

A variation of the multi tandem layout is also used on the [[B-52 Stratofortress]] which has four main wheel bogies (two forward and two aft) underneath the fuselage and a small outrigger wheel supporting each wing-tip. The B-52's landing gear is also unique in that all four pairs of main wheels can be steered. This allows the landing gear to line up with the runway and thus makes [[crosswind landing]]s easier (using a technique called ''[[crab landing]]''). Since tandem aircraft cannot [[Rotation (aeronautics)|rotate]] for takeoff, the forward gear must be long enough to give the wings the correct [[angle of attack]] during takeoff. During landing, the forward gear must not touch the runway first, otherwise the rear gear will slam down and may cause the aircraft to bounce and become airborne again.<ref>{{cite AV media\n | people =\n | title =The B-47\n | medium =\n | publisher =[[Lookout Mountain Air Force Station]]\n | location =\n | date =1950\n | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2iU_VdHD3M&t }}</ref>\n\n==== Crosswind landing accommodation ====\n[[File:CNAM-IMG 0625.jpg|thumb|The \"castoring\" main gear arrangement on a [[Bl\u00e9riot XI]]]]\n\nOne very early undercarriage incorporating castoring for crosswind landings was pioneered on the [[Bleriot VIII]] design of 1908. It was later used in the much more famous Bl\u00e9riot XI Channel-crossing aircraft of 1909 and also copied in the earliest examples of the [[Etrich Taube]]. In this arrangement the main landing gear's shock absorption was taken up by a vertically sliding bungee cord-sprung upper member. The vertical post along which the upper member slid to take landing shocks also had its lower end as the rotation point for the forward end of the main wheel's suspension fork, allowing the main gear to pivot on moderate crosswind landings.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nManually-adjusted main-gear units on the B-52 can be set for crosswind take-offs.

Monowheel gear is also used on some powered aircraft, where drag reduction is a priority, such as the [[Europa XS]]. Much like the Me 163 rocket fighter, some gliders from prior to the [[Second World War]] used a take-off dolly that was jettisoned on take-off and then landed on a fixed skid.<ref name=\"Europa\">{{Cite web|title=Europa XS Monowheel Overview|url=http://www.europa-aircraft.co.uk/monowheel/|publisher=Europa Aircraft Ltd.|year=2011|accessdate=13 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205201312/http://www.europa-aircraft.co.uk/monowheel/|archive-date=5 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> This configuration is necessarily accompanied with a taildragger.\n\n==== Helicopters ====\nLight helicopters use simple landing skids to save weight and cost. The skids may have attachment points for wheels so that they can be moved for short distances on the ground. Skids are impractical for helicopters weighing more than four tons. Some high-speed machines have retractable wheels, but most use fixed wheels for their robustness, and to avoid the need for a retraction mechanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.helis.com/howflies/skids.php|title=Skids or Wheels?|last=Cox|first=Taylor|website=helis.com|access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Tailsitter ====\n[[File:Convair XFY-1 Pogo 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|A [[Convair XFY Pogo]] showing its landing gear]]\nExperimental [[tailsitter]] aircraft use landing gear located in their tails for [[VTOL]] operation.\n\n==== Light aircraft ====\nFor light aircraft a type of landing gear which is economical to produce is a simple wooden arch laminated from ash, as used on some homebuilt aircraft. A similar arched gear is often formed from spring steel. The [[Cessna 165|Cessna Airmaster]] was among the first aircraft to use spring steel landing gear. The main advantage of such gear is that no other shock-absorbing device is needed; the deflecting leaf provides the shock absorption.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==== Folding gear ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1996-027-05A, Flugzeug Junkers Ju 288 V1.jpg|thumb|right|Ju 288 V1 first prototype, showing its complex \"folding\" main undercarriage.]] \nThe limited space available to stow landing gear has led to many complex retraction mechanisms, each unique to a particular aircraft. An early example, the German ''[[Bomber B]]'' combat aircraft design competition winner, the [[Junkers Ju 288]], had a complex \"folding\" main landing gear unlike any other aircraft designed by either [[Axis Forces|Axis]] or [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] sides in the war: its single oleo strut was only attached to the lower end of its Y-form main retraction struts, handling the twinned main gear wheels, and folding by swiveling downwards and aftwards during retraction<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www5a.biglobe.ne.jp/~t_miyama/ju288leg.html|title=Ju288\u306e\u811a|website=www5a.biglobe.ne.jp}}</ref> to \"fold\" the maingear's length to shorten it for stowage in the engine nacelle it was mounted in.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sengfelder |first=G\u00fcnther |date=1993 |title=German Aircraft Landing Gear |url= |location=Atglen, PA USA |publisher=Schiffer Publishing |pages=175\u2013177 |isbn=0-88740-470-7 |quote=The Ju 288's landing gear was most innovative in its design. A Y-shaped bearer was mounted in the engine nacelle with its upper arms hinged. At the bottom end of this bearer was the shock absorber leg, which was likewise hinged. Two double-brake wheels, with (metric) size 1015 x 380 tires, were mounted on the cross-axle. During the retraction cycle a folding strut was raised by a hydraulic jack. The bottom part of the folding strut drew the Y-bearer upwards. Functioning via a lever-and-gear arrangement, a pushrod positioned parallel to the Y-bearer acted upon another gear segment mounted to the oleo leg's hinge pin and rotated it about this as the Y-bearer was drawn upwards.}}</ref>  However, the single pivot-point design also led to [[Junkers Ju 288#Undercarriage difficulties|numerous incidents of collapsed maingear units]] for its prototype airframes.\n\n==== Tracked ====\nIncreased contact area can be obtained with very large wheels, lots of smaller wheels or track-type gear. Tracked gear made by [[Dowty Group|Dowty]] was fitted to a [[Westland Lysander]] in 1938 for taxi tests, then a [[Fairchild Cornell]] and a [[Douglas Boston]].<ref>https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1943/1943 - 2372.html</ref> Bonmartini, in Italy, fitted tracked gear to a [[Piper Cub]] in 1951.<ref>https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971 - 2630.html</ref> \nTrack-type gear was also tested using a C-47, C-82 and B-50. A much heavier aircraft, an XB-36, was made available for further tests, although there was no intention of using it on production aircraft. The stress on the runway was reduced to one third that of the B-36 four-wheel bogie.<ref>Magnesium Overcast The Story of the Convair B-36, Dennis R.

It is one of many aviation technologies being proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<ref>https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/environment/Documents/technology-roadmap-2013.pdf</ref> Leaving the landing gear on the ground reduces weight and drag. Leaving it behind after take-off was done for a different reason, ie with military objectives, during World War II using the \"dolly\" and \"trolley\" arrangements of the German [[Me 163]]B rocket fighter and [[Arado Ar 234]]A prototype jet recon-bomber.\n\n===Steering===\nThere are several types of steering. [[Taildragger]] aircraft may be steered by [[rudder]] alone (depending upon the [[prop wash]] produced by the aircraft to turn it) with a freely pivoting tail wheel, or by a steering linkage with the tail wheel, or by ''differential braking'' (the use of independent brakes on opposite sides of the aircraft to turn the aircraft by slowing one side more sharply than the other). Aircraft with tricycle landing gear usually have a steering linkage with the nosewheel (especially in large aircraft), but some allow the nosewheel to pivot freely and use differential braking and/or the rudder to steer the aircraft, like the [[Cirrus SR22]].\n\nSome aircraft require that the pilot steer by using rudder pedals; others allow steering with the yoke or control stick. Some allow both.  Still others have a separate control, called a ''[[tiller]]'', used for steering on the ground exclusively.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Rudder====\nWhen an aircraft is steered on the ground exclusively using the rudder, it needs a substantial airflow past the rudder, which can be generated either by the forward motion of the aircraft or by propeller slipstream. Rudder steering requires considerable practice to use effectively. Although it needs airflow past the rudder, it has the advantage of not needing any friction with the ground, which makes it useful for aircraft on water, snow or ice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Direct====\n[[File:MM00756-4.jpg|thumb|The nose gear steering-wheel ([[tiller]]) is visible as a semi-circular wheel to the left of the yoke in this photo of a Boeing 727 cockpit]]\nSome aircraft link the yoke, control stick, or rudder directly to the wheel used for steering. Manipulating these controls turns the steering wheel (the nose wheel for [[tricycle landing gear]], and the tail wheel for [[taildragger]]s). The connection may be a firm one in which any movement of the controls turns the steering wheel (and vice versa), or it may be a soft one in which a spring-like mechanism twists the steering wheel but does not force it to turn. The former provides positive steering but makes it easier to skid the steering wheel; the latter provides softer steering (making it easy to overcontrol) but reduces the probability of skidding. Aircraft with retractable gear may disable the steering mechanism wholly or partially when the gear is retracted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Differential braking====\nDifferential braking depends on asymmetric application of the brakes on the main gear wheels to turn the aircraft. For this, the aircraft must be equipped with separate controls for the right and left brakes (usually on the rudder pedals). The nose or tail wheel usually is not equipped with brakes. Differential braking requires considerable skill. In aircraft with several methods of steering that include differential braking, differential braking may be avoided because of the wear it puts on the braking mechanisms. Differential braking has the advantage of being largely independent of any movement or skidding of the nose or tailwheel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Tiller====\nA tiller in an aircraft is a small wheel or lever, sometimes accessible to one pilot and sometimes duplicated for both pilots, that controls the steering of the aircraft while it is on the ground. The tiller may be designed to work in combination with other controls such as the rudder or yoke. In large airliners, for example, the tiller is often used as the sole means of steering during taxi, and then the rudder is used to steer during takeoff and landing, so that both aerodynamic control surfaces and the landing gear can be controlled simultaneously when the aircraft is moving at aerodynamic speeds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Tires and wheels===\n[[File:Two man replace a main landing gear tire of a plane.jpg|thumb|Two mechanics replacing a main landing gear wheel on a [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-668-7162-06A, Flugzeug Heinkel He 177, Fahrgestell.jpg|thumb|right|[[Luftwaffe]] groundcrew servicing a [[Heinkel He 177|Heinkel He 177A's]] main-gear wheels and tires, February 1944]]\nThe specified selection criterion, e.g., minimum size, weight, or pressure, are used to select suitable [[Tire#Aircraft|tires]] and wheels from manufacturer's catalog and industry standards found in the Aircraft Yearbook published by the Tire and Rim Association, Inc.<ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19970031272.pdf, p.30</ref>\n\n====Gear loading====\nThe choice of the main wheel tires is made on the basis of the static loading case.

Braking will also become less effective due to a reduction in the frictional force between the tires and the ground. In addition, the decrease in the size of the tire, and hence the size of the wheel, could pose a problem if internal brakes are to be fitted inside the wheel rims. The arguments against higher pressure are of such a nature that commercial operators generally prefer the lower pressures in order to maximize tire life and minimize runway stress. To prevent punctures from stones Philippine Airlines had to operate their [[Hawker Siddeley 748]] aircraft with pressures as low as the tire manufacturer would permit.<ref name=blackman>\"Test Pilot\" Tony Blackman, Grub Street Publishing 2009, {{ISBN|9781906502362}}, p.177</ref> However, too low a pressure can lead to an accident as in the [[Nigeria Airways Flight 2120]].\n\nA rough general rule for required tire pressure is given by the manufacturer in their catalog. Goodyear for example advises the pressure to be 4% higher than required for a given weight or as fraction of the rated static load and inflation.<ref name=Goodyear>[http://www.goodyearaviation.com/resources/] Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Retrieved: 26 January 2012.</ref>\n\nTires of many commercial aircraft are required to be filled with [[nitrogen]], and not subsequently diluted with more than 5% oxygen, to prevent auto-ignition of the gas which may result from overheating brakes producing volatile vapors from the tire lining.<ref name=FAA_Ruling>[http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFinalRule.nsf/a09133bddc7f4fbb8525646000609712/e18b9cadcf1a66da86256a3100713354!OpenDocument] FAA Ruling: \"Use of Nitrogen or Other Inert Gas for Tire inflation in Lieu of Air\" Docket No. 26147 Amendment No. 25-78 RIN 2120-AD87</ref>\n\nNaval aircraft use different pressures when operating from a carrier and ashore.

A NASA long-term goal is to confine aircraft objectional noise to within the airport bounary. During the approach to land the landing gear is lowered several miles from touchdown and the landing gear is the dominant airframe noise source, followed by deployed highlift devices. With engines at a reduced power setting on the approach it is necessary to reduce airframe noise to make a significant reduction to total aircraft noise.<ref>http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&dvs=1575683504592~592, p.5</ref><ref>https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040086700.pdf</ref> The addition of add-on fairings is one approach for reducing the noise from the landing gear with a longer term approach to address noise generation during initial design.<ref>http://resource.isvr.soton.ac.uk/staff/pubs/PubPDFs/Pub12391.pdf</ref>\n\n'''Semi-active gear''' Airline specifications require an airliner to reach up to 90,000 take-offs and landings and roll 500,000&nbsp;km on the ground in its lifetime. Conventional landing gear is designed to absorb the energy of a landing and doesn't perform well at reducing ground-induced vibrations in the airframe during landing ground roll, taxi and take-off. Airframe vibrations and fatigue damage can be reduced using semi-active oleos which vary damping over a wide range of ground speeds and runway quality.<ref>https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=agard+r+800, Paper 5</ref>\n\n===Accidents===\nMalfunctions or human errors (or a combination of these) related to retractable landing gear have been the cause of numerous accidents and incidents throughout aviation history.

Although rarely fatal, a gear-up landing can be very expensive if it causes extensive airframe/engine damage. For propeller-driven aircraft a [[prop strike]] may require an engine overhaul.\n\n[[File:JetBlue292Landing.jpg|thumb|[[JetBlue Airways Flight 292]], an Airbus A320, making an emergency landing on runway 25L at Los Angeles International Airport in 2005 after the front landing gear malfunctioned]]\n\nSome aircraft have a stiffened fuselage underside or added features to minimize structural damage in a wheels-up landing.

A small area in the southern tip of the nation, surrounding [[Gaya, Niger|Gaya]] can expect to receive 700mm to 900mm or rainfall.  Northern areas which support crops, such as the southern portions of the [[A\u00efr Massif]] and the [[Kaouar oasis]] rely upon oases and a slight increase in rainfall due to mountain effects. Large portions of the northwest and far east of the nation, while within the [[Sahara desert]], see just enough seasonal rainfall to support semi-nomadic animal husbandry.  The populations of these areas, mostly [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Wodaabe]] - [[Fula people|Fula]], and [[Toubou]], practise [[Transhumance]]: traveling south to pasture and sell animals in the dry season, north into the Sahara in the brief rainy season, while maintaining settled communities along these routes.<ref name=\"Decalo1997\">{{Cite book\n|last=Decalo\n|first=Samuel\n|title=Historical Dictionary of the Niger (3rd ed.)\n|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Boston & Folkestone\n|year=1997\n|isbn=0-8108-3136-8\n}}</ref>\n[[File:Niger ag land use map USGS.png|thumb|500px|center|Cropland Use Indicator, drawn from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, for period 1986-1988. <br />Scale is: 1= 70% - 100% Crop coverage :: 2= 50% - 70% Crop coverage :: 3= 30% - 50% Crop coverage :: 4= 5% - 30% Crop coverage :: 5= 0% - 5% Crop coverage.]]\n\n==Agriculture production==\n[[Image:Niger millet Koremairwa 1214.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A farmer collecting his [[millet]] harvest near [[Koremairwa]] in the [[Dosso (department)|Dosso]] department.]]\nNiger's agricultural and livestock sectors are the mainstay of all but 18% of the population.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Fourteen percent of Niger's GDP is generated by livestock production (camels, goats, sheep and cattle), said to support 29% of the population. Thus 53% of the population is actively involved in crop production.<ref name=ussd2009 /> The 15% of Niger's land that is arable is found mainly along its southern border with Nigeria.\n\n[[Pearl millet]], sorghum, and cassava are Niger's principal rain-fed subsistence crops. Irrigated rice for internal consumption, while expensive, has, since the devaluation of the CFA franc, sold for below the price of imported rice, encouraging additional production. Cowpeas and onions are grown for commercial export, as are small quantities of garlic, peppers, potatoes, and wheat.<ref name=ussd2009 />\n\n==Drought and environmental degradation==\n[[File:Niger Farm sand tv 16aug05.jpg|thumb|right|\"Drought has turned farmland into useless soil and sand\" A farmer examines the soil in drought stricken Niger during the 2005 famine.]]\n[[File:Niger nomads flee drought 16 aug 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Nomads leaving for Nigeria with their herds, Dakoro Department, Niger, 2005.]]\nRainfall varies and when insufficient, Niger has difficulty feeding its population and must rely on grain purchases and food aid to meet food requirements.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Rains, as in much of the [[Sahel]], have been marked by annual variability. This has been especially true in the 20th century, with the [[Sahel drought|most severe drought on record]] beginning in the late 1960s and lasting, with one break, well into the 1980s. The long-term effect of this, especially to [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] populations remains in the 21st century, with those communities which rely upon cattle, sheep, and camels husbandry losing entire herds more than once during this period.  Recent rains remain variable.  For instance, the rains in 2000 were not good, those in 2001 were plentiful and well distributed.\n\nFood shortfalls have also been caused by other factors.  Market prices driven up by [[drought]] and a [[Overpopulation (animals)#Wild animal overpopulation|plague]] of [[desert locust]] in 2005&ndash;2006 caused [[2005\u201306 Niger food crisis|a major food crisis]] in parts of the nation.\n\nShortage of good farmland has led to a number of innovations to farm marginal, often [[laterite]] soils  and soil degraded by [[overfarming]], wind, [[desertification]], and drought.  Women in particular are often given poor plots of land (in inherited sections known as \"''Gamana''\") to garden, and have developed specific crops for poor soil and water conditions. These typically include ocra and malahiya. External organisations have tried introducing alternative crops, such as the fruit of the [[Ziziphus mauritania]] tree (\"''Indian Jujube''\", marketed by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) under the name of \"''Pomme du Sahel''\" or Sahel Apple) and the leaves and seeds of the [[Moringa|Moringa oleifera]].  Farmers use specialty water conservation techniques, \"water microcatchments\" or planting pits known as ''zai holes'', planting of crops among certain trees, planting in raised beds, [[drip irrigation]], and usage of water collected in the natural stone bottomed low areas common in the south east of the nation. This approach has been termed the [[Bioreclamation of Degraded Lands]].<ref>[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/PSLG-7TCJF2?OpenDocument Niger: Reclaiming \u2018useless\u2019 lands gives new lifeline to West Africa\u2019s sidelined women farmers].

[[Niger]], a landlocked [[Sub-Sahara]] African nation, and over the past two decades has consistently been ranked near or at the bottom of worldwide indexes of the [[Human development index]], [[GDP]], and per capita income.  Economic activity centres on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry, re-export trade, and export of [[uranium]]. The 50% devaluation of the West African CFA franc in January, 1994 boosted exports of [[livestock]], [[cowpea]]s, [[onion]]s, and the products of Niger's small [[cotton]] industry.  Exports of cattle to neighboring [[Nigeria]], as well as [[Macrotyloma geocarpum|Groundnuts]] and their oil remain the primary non-mineral exports.<ref name=ussd2009>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5474.htm Background Notes for Niger: January 2009] Bureau of African Affairs, United States State Department.

[[Drought]] cycles, [[desertification]], a 3.4% population growth rate and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut an already marginal economy.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Traditional subsistence farming, herding, small trading, and informal markets dominate an economy that generates few formal sector jobs.  Between 1988 and 1995 28% to 30% of the total economy of Niger was in the unregulated [[Informal sector]], including small and even large scale rural and urban production, transport and services.<ref>C.

A small area in the southern tip of the nation, surrounding [[Gaya, Niger|Gaya]] can expect to receive 700mm to 900mm or rainfall.  Northern areas which support crops, such as the southern portions of the [[A\u00efr Massif]] and the [[Kaouar oasis]] rely upon oases and a slight increase in rainfall due to mountain effects. Large portions of the northwest and far east of the nation, while within the [[Sahara desert]], see just enough seasonal rainfall to support semi-nomadic animal husbandry.  The populations of these areas, mostly [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Wodaabe]] - [[Fula people|Fula]], and [[Toubou]], practise [[Transhumance]]: traveling south to pasture and sell animals in the dry season, north into the Sahara in the brief rainy season, while maintaining settled communities along these routes.<ref name=\"Decalo1997\">{{Cite book\n|last=Decalo\n|first=Samuel\n|title=Historical Dictionary of the Niger (3rd ed.)\n|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Boston & Folkestone\n|year=1997\n|isbn=0-8108-3136-8\n}}</ref>\n[[File:Niger ag land use map USGS.png|thumb|500px|center|Cropland Use Indicator, drawn from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, for period 1986-1988. <br />Scale is: 1= 70% - 100% Crop coverage :: 2= 50% - 70% Crop coverage :: 3= 30% - 50% Crop coverage :: 4= 5% - 30% Crop coverage :: 5= 0% - 5% Crop coverage.]]\n\n==Agriculture production==\n[[Image:Niger millet Koremairwa 1214.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A farmer collecting his [[millet]] harvest near [[Koremairwa]] in the [[Dosso (department)|Dosso]] department.]]\nNiger's agricultural and livestock sectors are the mainstay of all but 18% of the population.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Fourteen percent of Niger's GDP is generated by livestock production (camels, goats, sheep and cattle), said to support 29% of the population. Thus 53% of the population is actively involved in crop production.<ref name=ussd2009 /> The 15% of Niger's land that is arable is found mainly along its southern border with Nigeria.\n\n[[Pearl millet]], sorghum, and cassava are Niger's principal rain-fed subsistence crops. Irrigated rice for internal consumption, while expensive, has, since the devaluation of the CFA franc, sold for below the price of imported rice, encouraging additional production. Cowpeas and onions are grown for commercial export, as are small quantities of garlic, peppers, potatoes, and wheat.<ref name=ussd2009 />\n\n==Drought and environmental degradation==\n[[File:Niger Farm sand tv 16aug05.jpg|thumb|right|\"Drought has turned farmland into useless soil and sand\" A farmer examines the soil in drought stricken Niger during the 2005 famine.]]\n[[File:Niger nomads flee drought 16 aug 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Nomads leaving for Nigeria with their herds, Dakoro Department, Niger, 2005.]]\nRainfall varies and when insufficient, Niger has difficulty feeding its population and must rely on grain purchases and food aid to meet food requirements.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Rains, as in much of the [[Sahel]], have been marked by annual variability. This has been especially true in the 20th century, with the [[Sahel drought|most severe drought on record]] beginning in the late 1960s and lasting, with one break, well into the 1980s. The long-term effect of this, especially to [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] populations remains in the 21st century, with those communities which rely upon cattle, sheep, and camels husbandry losing entire herds more than once during this period.  Recent rains remain variable.  For instance, the rains in 2000 were not good, those in 2001 were plentiful and well distributed.\n\nFood shortfalls have also been caused by other factors.  Market prices driven up by [[drought]] and a [[Overpopulation (animals)#Wild animal overpopulation|plague]] of [[desert locust]] in 2005&ndash;2006 caused [[2005\u201306 Niger food crisis|a major food crisis]] in parts of the nation.\n\nShortage of good farmland has led to a number of innovations to farm marginal, often [[laterite]] soils  and soil degraded by [[overfarming]], wind, [[desertification]], and drought.  Women in particular are often given poor plots of land (in inherited sections known as \"''Gamana''\") to garden, and have developed specific crops for poor soil and water conditions. These typically include ocra and malahiya. External organisations have tried introducing alternative crops, such as the fruit of the [[Ziziphus mauritania]] tree (\"''Indian Jujube''\", marketed by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) under the name of \"''Pomme du Sahel''\" or Sahel Apple) and the leaves and seeds of the [[Moringa|Moringa oleifera]].  Farmers use specialty water conservation techniques, \"water microcatchments\" or planting pits known as ''zai holes'', planting of crops among certain trees, planting in raised beds, [[drip irrigation]], and usage of water collected in the natural stone bottomed low areas common in the south east of the nation. This approach has been termed the [[Bioreclamation of Degraded Lands]].<ref>[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/PSLG-7TCJF2?OpenDocument Niger: Reclaiming \u2018useless\u2019 lands gives new lifeline to West Africa\u2019s sidelined women farmers].

Without fresh air venting to the interior via dash outlets, side windows featured vent windows and optional pop-out rear windows.\n\nLuigi Maglione, Fiat's marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock-up was missing.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com}}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The new architecture is based on the [[Fiat Mini platform]]. The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

Due to the cylinders being both located under the [[floorpan]], the boot's volume is reduced only by 25 liters - 200 L instead of the monofuel's 225. On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

Notably, in the late 1950s, the head of Renault, [[Pierre Dreyfus]], had called for the Renault R4 to have an egalitarian approach, like blue jeans, \"which people can wear in any situation if you do away with the pretentions of snobbism and social conformity.\"<ref name=\"dreyfus\">{{cite web\n |title        = Renault 4\n |publisher    = MyAutoWorld\n |author       = \n |date         = \n |url          = https://myautoworld.com/renault/cars/history/history-renault-4/history-renault-4.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring the design gestation, Giurgiaro took particular inspiration from a folding lounge chair in conceiving the seats of the Zero; simple, easy to maintain, modular, inexpensive to manufacture.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Without fresh air venting to the interior via dash outlets, side windows featured vent windows and optional pop-out rear windows.\n\nLuigi Maglione, Fiat's marketing strategist, was perplexed when first seeing the interior design, suggesting the interior mock-up was missing.

Rear suspension used a [[solid axle]] suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com}}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

The cartridge was originally designed to [[headspace (firearms)|headspace]] on the [[Rim (firearms)|semi-rim]], which worked in the [[Colt M1900]] due to the design of the [[feed ramp]]. When the .38 Auto became the .38 Super, in the 1911A1, the feed ramp could no longer be used as rim support. As a result of this, observed accuracy of the .38 Super suffered until Irv Stone of Bar-Sto barrels re-designed the chamber to allow headspacing on the case mouth. Since then, all new production .38 Super pistols headspace on the case mouth, as with other cartridges in this class. The semi-rimmed case is known to cause feeding problems in some [[magazine (firearm)|magazines]], especially double stack magazines, and led to the development of new variants with reduced rims (typically only .003\" per side).\n\nIn 1974 the industry added the +P [[headstamp]] to the .38 Super to further distinguish it from the lower-pressure .38 ACP. Most current ammunition manufacturers label ammunition for the Super as .38 Super +P.\n\nSince the .38 Super is dimensionally the same as the .38 ACP, an unsafe condition can be caused by firing .38 Super cartridges in a firearm designed for the much lower pressure .38 ACP. The weakness, in the Colt M1900, [[Colt M1902]], and others derived from that design, comes from the assembly wedge at the front of the slide. If the wedge comes out, or the slide cracks at the wedge, the slide can come off the rear of the frame when fired. The 1911 and 1911A1, having a slide that is solid on front, cannot come off the frame that way.\n\n==Cartridge dimensions==\nThe .38 Super has 17.6 [[grain (measure)|grains]] H<sub>2</sub>O (1.14 [[litre|ml]]) cartridge case capacity.\n\n[[File:38 Super Auto scale drawing.svg|300px]]\n\n'''.38 Super maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cip-bp.org/index.php?id=tdcc-telechargement |title=C.I.P. decisions, texts and tables - free current C.I.P.

These \"rimless\" cases are somewhat of a misnomer, due to the case rim not retaining the same diameter as the case wall just forward of the extractor groove. A common example is the .38 Super Comp case, which has a semi-rim extending only .003-.004\" per side, compared to standard .38 Super which has .007-.009\" per side. The main reason for the development of new cases was due to the semi-rimmed .38 Super case not always feeding reliably from the double-stack box-magazines used in several semi-automatic pistols popular with practical shooting sports, such as USPSA or IPSC. The nearly rimless cases improve feeding reliability in these pistols but are intended to be used in firearms that [[headspace (firearms)|headspace]] on the case mouth.<ref>[http://38super.net/Pages/Brass.html Rimless .38 Super Brass].</ref> Other improvements found in some of these cases are modified extractor grooves and increased thickness in key parts of the brass for high pressure loadings.\n\n==Performance==\nBecause of its larger case volume, which allows for more smokeless powder and results in higher muzzle velocities at approximately similar pressure levels,<ref name=SAAMI /> the .38 Super offers higher bullet velocity potential than the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] when handloaded and in some defense loadings.

Part of the felt recoil reduction is due to the use of lighter-weight bullets. The major cause of reduced felt recoil is a compensator, or muzzle brake. The \"comp\" works by diverting gases at the muzzle. The greater the gas volume, or the higher the pressure, the greater the effectiveness of a comp. As the Super runs at a higher pressure than, say, the .45, a comp will have more recoil-reduction effect.\n\nThe comeback began in the early 1980s, when [[Rob Leatham|Robbie Leatham]] and [[Brian Enos]] began experimenting with, and competing with, .38 Super pistols in IPSC. At the time, single-stack 1911s in .45 ACP were dominant. Their .38 Super pistols held one or two more rounds simply due to the smaller case diameter. However, the biggest advantage was the muzzle brake, allowing for faster follow-up shots, and thus faster stages and subsequent higher scores. Competitors still using .45 ACP pistols attempted to keep pace, both by adding compensators and by reducing bullet weight, quickly reaching the limit at 152-155 grains. The Super could be loaded to major with a bullet as light as 115 grains.\n\nUse of compensators in competition is limited to the Open Division in IPSC and USPSA. The other divisions there do not permit their use, and the [[International Defensive Pistol Association]] (IDPA) does not permit them at all. Lacking a comp, a .38 Super, running at major, has felt recoil much like that of a .45 ACP, and more than that of a 9&nbsp;mm.\n\nApart from its popularity in the shooting sports, the .38 Super +P is one of the most popular pistol cartridges in [[Latin America]] due to local restrictions on civilian ownership of firearms chambered for the military cartridges, such as the .45 ACP.<ref name=\"Boatman_16\" /> For this reason, American police departments in the southwestern United States often consider .38 Super shell casings found at homicide scenes as a sign that the firearm was of Latin American origin.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe .38 Super round received further publicity through the single-action \"Colt Combat Commander\" and lightweight aluminum alloy frame \"Colt Commander\".

The cartridge was originally designed to [[headspace (firearms)|headspace]] on the [[Rim (firearms)|semi-rim]], which worked in the [[Colt M1900]] due to the design of the [[feed ramp]]. When the .38 Auto became the .38 Super, in the 1911A1, the feed ramp could no longer be used as rim support. As a result of this, observed accuracy of the .38 Super suffered until Irv Stone of Bar-Sto barrels re-designed the chamber to allow headspacing on the case mouth. Since then, all new production .38 Super pistols headspace on the case mouth, as with other cartridges in this class. The semi-rimmed case is known to cause feeding problems in some [[magazine (firearm)|magazines]], especially double stack magazines, and led to the development of new variants with reduced rims (typically only .003\" per side).\n\nIn 1974 the industry added the +P [[headstamp]] to the .38 Super to further distinguish it from the lower-pressure .38 ACP. Most current ammunition manufacturers label ammunition for the Super as .38 Super +P.\n\nSince the .38 Super is dimensionally the same as the .38 ACP, an unsafe condition can be caused by firing .38 Super cartridges in a firearm designed for the much lower pressure .38 ACP. The weakness, in the Colt M1900, [[Colt M1902]], and others derived from that design, comes from the assembly wedge at the front of the slide. If the wedge comes out, or the slide cracks at the wedge, the slide can come off the rear of the frame when fired. The 1911 and 1911A1, having a slide that is solid on front, cannot come off the frame that way.\n\n==Cartridge dimensions==\nThe .38 Super has 17.6 [[grain (measure)|grains]] H<sub>2</sub>O (1.14 [[litre|ml]]) cartridge case capacity.\n\n[[File:38 Super Auto scale drawing.svg|300px]]\n\n'''.38 Super maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cip-bp.org/index.php?id=tdcc-telechargement |title=C.I.P. decisions, texts and tables - free current C.I.P.

These \"rimless\" cases are somewhat of a misnomer, due to the case rim not retaining the same diameter as the case wall just forward of the extractor groove. A common example is the .38 Super Comp case, which has a semi-rim extending only .003-.004\" per side, compared to standard .38 Super which has .007-.009\" per side. The main reason for the development of new cases was due to the semi-rimmed .38 Super case not always feeding reliably from the double-stack box-magazines used in several semi-automatic pistols popular with practical shooting sports, such as USPSA or IPSC. The nearly rimless cases improve feeding reliability in these pistols but are intended to be used in firearms that [[headspace (firearms)|headspace]] on the case mouth.<ref>[http://38super.net/Pages/Brass.html Rimless .38 Super Brass].</ref> Other improvements found in some of these cases are modified extractor grooves and increased thickness in key parts of the brass for high pressure loadings.\n\n==Performance==\nBecause of its larger case volume, which allows for more smokeless powder and results in higher muzzle velocities at approximately similar pressure levels,<ref name=SAAMI /> the .38 Super offers higher bullet velocity potential than the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] when handloaded and in some defense loadings.
