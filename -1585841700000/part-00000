He began high school as a wiry 5'11\" (1.80 m) tall [[point guard]], but he would eventually grow to 6'10\" (2.08 m) by his senior year.\n\n==College career==\nAfter graduating from high school, Calathes would go on to play [[college basketball]] for the [[Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball|Saint Joseph's Hawks]], at [[Saint Joseph's University]], in Philadelphia. At St. Joe's, he saw limited playing time as a freshman, and then played as a key substitute for the team, during his sophomore season.\n\nIt was not until his junior season, during which he averaged 13.9 points per game and 7.1 rebounds per game, that he began to fully regain the physical and athletic abilities that he possessed before his growth spurt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sjuhawks.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/calathes_pat00.html|title=Saint Joseph's Hawks Player Bio|publisher=Sjuhawks.cstv.com|accessdate=June 14, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229204117/http://sjuhawks.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/calathes_pat00.html|archivedate=December 29, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He increased his per game averages to 17.5 points and 7.5 rebounds, in his senior year, and teamed up with [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Ahmad Nivins]], to lead the Hawks to the 2008 [[Atlantic 10 Conference|Atlantic 10]] title game, and the Hawks' first [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] Tournament appearance since 2004. SJU would lose to the [[University of Oklahoma]]'s men's basketball team, the [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma Sooners]], in the opening round.\n\nAlthough he was listed as a [[small forward]] for the [[Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball|Saint Joseph's Hawks]], his versatility allowed him to play multiple positions throughout his college career.

Carroll joined during the 1955 spring sports season (1954-55 academic season). Carthage returned in the fall of 1961, and [[North Park University]] entered the following fall (1962). Lake Forest dropped out at the end of the 1962-63 season. The last member to leave the CCIW was Carroll following the 1991\u201392 season. Carroll returned to the CCIW in 2016.

of Illinois and Wisconsin''' ('''CCIW''') is a [[college athletic conference]] which competes in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division III|Division III]].\n\nCCIW schools have accounted for 46 national championships in NCAA Division III competition, including 15 in men's cross country, six in men's basketball, six in men's outdoor track and field, four in football and men's indoor track and field, three in women's soccer, two in women's outdoor track and field, women's basketball and men's soccer and one apiece in baseball and women's indoor track and field.\n\nElmhurst College won a pair of Division III women's volleyball championships (1983 and 1985), and North Central College won a women's basketball title (1983) before the conference began sponsorship of women's athletics in 1986-87.\n\nNorth Central men's cross country won its 13th national title in program history during the fall of 2009, while the North Central men's indoor track and field team captured the 2010 national championship. The Cardinals made it clean sweep by winning the men's outdoor track and field title in the spring of 2010. In addition, the Illinois Wesleyan women's outdoor track and field team, as well as the baseball team, took home national titles, giving the CCIW five national championships during the 2009\u201310 season.\n\nNorth Central defended its titles in men's indoor track and field and outdoor track and field in the spring of 2011 while the Cardinals won their second men's cross country title in three seasons in the fall of 2011 and their third-straight indoor track and field title in 2012. Illinois Wesleyan won the conference's second women's basketball national title in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cciw.org/sports/2010/6/28/Gen._0628102341.aspx?tab=cciwhistoricalinformation|title=CCIW History|accessdate=2010-06-28|publisher=www.cciw.org}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe conference was formed with nine charter members ([[Augustana College (Illinois)|Augustana College]], [[Carthage College]], [[Elmhurst College]], [[Illinois College]], [[Illinois Wesleyan University]], [[Lake Forest College]], [[Millikin University]], [[North Central College]] and [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]]) on April 26, 1946, in [[Jacksonville, Illinois|Jacksonville]], [[Illinois]], and opened competition in the 1946\u201347 academic year as the '''College Conference of Illinois'''. In 1967, the name was changed to the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin, to recognize Carthage, which moved to [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] in 1962, and [[Carroll University]], which entered the conference in 1955.\n\nThe CCIW sponsors 24 sports: baseball, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, football, men's and women's golf, men's and women's lacrosse, men's and women's soccer, softball, men's and women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's indoor track and field, men's and women's outdoor track and field, men's and women's volleyball and wrestling. The most recently added sport is men's volleyball, which starts play in the 2020 season (2019\u201320 school year).<ref name=\"2019 MVB\">{{cite press release|url=https://cciw.org/news/2018/12/12/general-cciw-announces-the-addition-of-mens-volleyball-greenville-and-loras-added-as-associate-members.aspx |title=CCIW Announces the Addition of Men's Volleyball; Greenville and Loras Added as Associate Members |publisher=College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin |date=December 12, 2018 |accessdate=December 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nCCIW membership has experienced several changes since its inception. After Carthage left in 1952, Illinois College withdrew the following year (1953). Elmhurst and Wheaton withdrew following the 1959\u201360 academic year. Wheaton re-joined for all sports but football in 1967 (and for football in 1970). Elmhurst re-joined in the fall of 1967 for all sports but football (and for football in 1968). Carroll joined during the 1955 spring sports season (1954-55 academic season). Carthage returned in the fall of 1961, and [[North Park University]] entered the following fall (1962). Lake Forest dropped out at the end of the 1962-63 season. The last member to leave the CCIW was Carroll following the 1991\u201392 season. Carroll returned to the CCIW in 2016. In 2007, [[Rose\u2013Hulman Institute of Technology]], located in [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]], [[Indiana]], joined the CCIW as an associate member for men's and women's swimming.<ref>{{cite

The dominant mechanism of production involves [[gluon]]s only present when matter has become a quark\u2013gluon plasma. When quark\u2013gluon plasma disassembles into [[hadron]]s in a breakup process, the high availability of strange [[quark|antiquarks]] helps to produce antimatter containing multiple strange quarks, which is otherwise rarely made. Similar considerations are at present made for the heavier [[charm quark|charm]] flavor, which is made at the beginning of the collision process in the first interactions and is only abundant in the high-energy environments of [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]].\n\n==Quark\u2013gluon plasma in the early universe and in the laboratory==\n[[File:strange production 3.svg|thumb|280px|Collision between two highly-energetic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] create an extremely dense environment, in which quarks and gluons may interact as free particles for brief moments.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>-22</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds. \n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581\u2013581|doi=10.1038/35001196|issn=0028-0836|via=}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3431330|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|issn=0031-9228|via=}}</ref> At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached. An even stronger signature of strangeness enhancement is the highly enhanced production of [[#Strangeness (and charm) hadronization|strange antibaryons]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|date=|year=2015|orig-year=1980|title=Extreme states of nuclear matter - 1980: From: \u201cWorkshop on Future Relativistic Heavy Ion Experiments\u201d held 7-10 October 1980 at: GSI, Darmstadt, Germany|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=115|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|issn=1434-6001|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|date=|year=2015|orig-year=1983|title=Strangeness and phase changes in hot hadronic matter - 1983: From: \u201cSixth High Energy Heavy Ion Study\u201d held 28 June - 1 July 1983 at: LBNL, Berkeley, CA, USA|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=116|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|issn=1434-6001|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Equilibrium of strangeness in quark-gluon plasma ==\n\nOne cannot assume that under all conditions the yield of strange quarks is in thermal equilibrium.

This makes it relatively easy to detect strange particles through the tracks left by their decay products. Consider as example the decay of a negatively charged [[Xi baryon]] (green in figure, dss), into a negative [[pion]] ({{Subatomic particle|Up antiquark}}d) and a neutral [[Lambda baryon]] (uds). Subsequently, the Lambda decays into a proton and another negative pion. In general this is the signature of the decay of a Xi. Although the negative [[Omega baryon]] (sss) has a similar final state decay topology, it can be clearly distinguished from the Xi because its decay products are different.\n\nMeasurement of abundant formation of Xi (uss/dss), Omega (sss) and especially their antiparticles is an important cornerstone of the claim that quark\u2013gluon plasma has been formed.<ref name=\":2\" /> This abundant formation is often presented in comparison with the scaled expectation from normal proton-proton collisions; however, such a comparison is not a necessary step in view of the large absolute yields which defy conventional model expectations.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=P.

The coincident high yield of charm and strangeness present at LHC will lead to copious production of {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.

The work in this field today focuses on the theoretical interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark\u2013gluon plasma at the time of breakup. The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing hot drop of quark\u2013gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. For this reason the presentation of the experimental results was made above without a comparison of data to model, so that the results following the pattern predicted can speak for themselves. There are as many as 10 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]]\n* [[Quark matter]]\n* [[Hadronization]]\n* [[Strangelet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{physics-footer}}\n{{Phase of matter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strangeness Production}}\n[[Category:Strangeness production| ]]\n[[Category:Strange quark|Production]]\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter]]\n[[Category:Exotic matter]]\n", "text_old": "'''Strangeness production''' is a signature and a [[diagnostic tool]] of [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]] (or QGP) formation and properties.

This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>-22</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds. \n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581\u2013581|doi=10.1038/35001196|issn=0028-0836|via=}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3431330|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|issn=0031-9228|via=}}</ref> At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached. An even stronger signature of strangeness enhancement is the highly enhanced production of [[#Strangeness (and charm) hadronization|strange antibaryons]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|date=|year=2015|orig-year=1980|title=Extreme states of nuclear matter - 1980: From: \u201cWorkshop on Future Relativistic Heavy Ion Experiments\u201d held 7-10 October 1980 at: GSI, Darmstadt, Germany|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=115|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15115-y|issn=1434-6001|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|date=|year=2015|orig-year=1983|title=Strangeness and phase changes in hot hadronic matter - 1983: From: \u201cSixth High Energy Heavy Ion Study\u201d held 28 June - 1 July 1983 at: LBNL, Berkeley, CA, USA|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|journal=The European Physical Journal A|language=en|volume=51|issue=9|pages=116|doi=10.1140/epja/i2015-15116-x|issn=1434-6001|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Equilibrium of strangeness in quark-gluon plasma ==\n\nOne cannot assume that under all conditions the yield of strange quarks is in thermal equilibrium.

Among these, heavy mesons composed of strange quarks and a heavy quark, such as [[Bottomness|bottom]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange B|link=yes}}) or [[Charm quark|charm]] ({{Subatomic particle|Strange D|link=yes}}), are of particular interest.  The coincident high yield of charm and strangeness present at LHC will lead to copious production of {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.

The work in this field today focuses on the theoretical interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark\u2013gluon plasma at the time of breakup. The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing hot drop of quark\u2013gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. For this reason the presentation of the experimental results was made above without a comparison of data to model, so that the results following the pattern predicted can speak for themselves. There are as many as 10 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]]\n* [[Quark matter]]\n* [[Hadronization]]\n* [[Strangelet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{physics-footer}}\n{{Phase of matter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strangeness Production}}\n[[Category:Strangeness production| ]]\n[[Category:Strange quark|Production]]\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter]]\n[[Category:Exotic matter]]\n", "name_user": "Bibliophilen", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added reference to major review article.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness_production"}
