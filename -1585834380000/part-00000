He was born in Manitoba, Canada, and died at the age of 82.\n\n==Early life==\nStefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at [[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Arnes, Manitoba]], Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from [[Iceland]] to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to [[North Dakota]] in 1880.\n\nHe was educated at the universities [[University of North Dakota|of North Dakota]] and [[University of Iowa|of Iowa]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied [[anthropology]] at the graduate school of [[Harvard University]], where for two years he was an instructor.\n\n==Early explorations==\nIn 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in [[Iceland]]. Recruited by [[Ejnar Mikkelsen]] and [[Ernest de Koven Leffingwell]] for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the [[Inuit]] of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] during the winter of 1906\u20131907, returning alone across country via the [[Porcupine River|Porcupine]] and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] Rivers. Under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City|New York]], he and Dr. [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R. M. Anderson]] undertook the ethnological survey of the Central Arctic coasts of the shores of [[North America]] from 1908 to 1912.\n\nIn 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired the [[Inuk]] guide [[Natkusiak]], who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic45-1-90.pdf Natkusiak (ca. 1885\u20131947)], ''Arctic'' magazine, Vol. 45, No. 1 (March 1992), pp. 90\u201392.</ref> At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt. [[George Baker Leavitt, Sr.|George B. Leavitt]], a Massachusetts [[whaler|whaling ship]] captain and friend of Stefansson's who sometimes brought the Arctic explorer replenishments of supplies from the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AE_P_XngIi0C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22george+leavitt%22+narwhal&source=bl&ots=RulYvQQUSn&sig=VkQqCn5gK9RK6Rb4yRswvfvBCqA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result ''My Life with the Eskimo''], Vilhjalmur Stefansson, Reissued by Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-2395-4}}</ref>\n\n[[Christian Klengenberg]] is first credited to have introduced the term \"[[Blond Eskimos|Blonde Eskimo]]\" to Stefansson just before Stefansson's visit to the Inuit inhabiting southwestern [[Victoria Island (Canada)|Victoria Island]], Canada, in 1910.

H.}}</ref> [[Adolphus Greely]] in 1912 first compiled the sightings recorded in earlier literature of blonde or fair haired Arctic natives and in 1912 published them in the ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' entitled \"The Origin of Stefansson's Blonde Eskimo\". Newspapers subsequently popularised the term \"Blonde Eskimo\", which caught more readers' attention despite Stefansson's preference for the term Copper Inuit. Stefansson later referenced Greely's work in his writings and the term \"Blonde Eskimo\" became applied to sightings of light haired [[Eskimo]]s from as early as the 17th century.<ref>''My Life with the Eskimo'', 1922, p. 199 (reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Loss of the ''Karluk'' and rescue of survivors==\n{{Further|Voyage of the Karluk}}\nStefansson organized and directed the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916]] to explore the regions west of [[Queen Elizabeth Islands|Parry Archipelago]] for the [[Government of Canada]]. Three ships, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', the ''Mary Sachs'', and the ''Alaska'' were employed.\n\nStefansson left the main ship, the ''Karluk'', when it became stuck in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson's explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others left on the ship suspected that he left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]] of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four men made their way to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], but died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four other men, including [[Alistair Mackay]] who had been part of the Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309|British Antarctic Expedition]], tried reaching [[Wrangel Island]] on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three died. Bartlett and his Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. Remaining survivors were picked up by the American fishing [[schooner]] [[King & Winge (fishing schooner)|''King & Winge'']] and the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] [[Revenue cutter|cutter]] {{USRC|Bear}}.<ref>Newell, Gordon R., ed., ''H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest'', at 242, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 1966.</ref>\n\nStefansson resumed his explorations by [[sledge]] over the [[Arctic Ocean]], here known as the [[Beaufort Sea]], leaving [[Collinson Point, Alaska|Collinson Point]], [[Alaska]] in April, 1914. A supporting sledge turned back {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the ''Mary Sachs'' in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.\n\n==Wrangel Island fiasco==\nIn 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise [[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Siberia]], where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the ''Karluk'' had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.\n\nStefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome from his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] but the British government rejected this claim when it was made by the young men. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged [[Russia]]n territory, caused an international incident.\n\nThe four young men, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle from the US, and Allan Crawford of Canada, were inexperienced and ill-equipped for the trip. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen [[Chukchi Sea]]. The only survivors were an Inuk woman, [[Ada Blackjack]], whom the men had hired as a seamstress in [[Nome, Alaska]], and taken with them, and the expedition's cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of [[scurvy]]. Blackjack was rescued in 1923 after two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families for having sent such ill-equipped young men to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster and that of the ''Karluk''.\n\n==Discoveries==\nStefansson's discoveries included new land (such as [[Brock Island|Brock]], [[Mackenzie King Island|Mackenzie King]], [[Borden Island|Borden]], [[Meighen Island|Meighen]], and [[Lougheed Island]]s)<ref name=Stefansson>{{cite book\n  | last = Stefansson\n  | first = Vilhjalmur\n  | title = The Friendly Arctic: The Story of Five Years in Polar Regions\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | year = 1922\n  | location = New York\n| url =https://archive.org/details/friendlyarctics01stefgoog}}</ref> and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. His journeys and successes are among the marvels of [[Arctic exploration]]. He extended the discoveries of [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the [[Drift ice|ice pack]]. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from [[Herschel Island]] on August 23, 1915.\n\nOn January 30, 1920, ''The Pioche Record'' reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the [[McClintock Arctic expedition|1853 McClintock expedition]] on [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]]. Clothing and food from the cache was in excellent condition despite the harsh arctic conditions.{{sfn|''The Pioche Record'', January 30,|1920|p=3}}\n\nIn 1921, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his explorations of the Arctic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\nStefansson remained a well-known explorer for the rest of his life. Late in life, through his affiliation with [[Dartmouth College]] (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]]. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], has been key to developing mat\u00e9riel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.\n\nStefansson joined [[the Explorers Club]] in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919\u20131922 and 1937\u20131939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson's reign when it put forth an amendment to its bylaws that read in 1938, \"A Woman's Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club's interests, primarily exploration.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\">Minutes, Explorer's Club, 4 January 1938.</ref> Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, \"This Woman's Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club's organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\" /> His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939\u20131941 mentorship of [[Gitel Steed]] as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', from which she began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at [[Romany Marie]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] [[caf\u00e9]]s.<ref name=\"Biography\">Robert Shulman.

One of the organisations prominent in this campaign was the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan]], or Ambijan, formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan's Board of Directors and Governors: \"The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,\" he wrote.\n\nAmbijan's national conference in New York, November 25\u201326, 1944, pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]], Senator [[Elbert D. Thomas]] of [[Utah]], and Soviet ambassador [[Andrei Gromyko]]. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and spouse Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nBut with the growing anti-Russian feeling in the country after [[World War II]], \"expos\u00e9s\" of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a [[Communism|Communist]] before a [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security subcommittee]] by [[Louis F. Budenz]], a Communist-turned-Catholic. Perhaps Stefansson himself had by then some second thoughts about Ambijan, for his posthumously published autobiography made no mention of his work on its behalf. Nor, for that matter, did his otherwise very complete obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of August 27, 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Srebrnik | first1 = Henry | year = 1998 | title = The Radical 'Second Life' of Vilhjalmur Stefansson | url = | journal = Arctic | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201360 | doi=10.14430/arctic1046}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy of an exclusively meat diet==\nStefansson is also a figure of considerable interest in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary circles, especially those with an interest in very [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. Stefansson documented the fact that the [[Inuit diet]] consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fish\u2014what might nowadays be perceived to be a 'zerocarb' / [[no-carbohydrate diet]]. (The diet technically contains a very low amount of carbohydates as the fresh fish that the Inuit ate would have contained a small amount of glycogen.) He found that he and his fellow explorers of European, Negro, and South Sea Islands descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. \n\nSome years after his first experience with the Inuit (known as Eskimos in Stefansson's time), Dr. Stefansson returned to the Arctic with a colleague, Dr. Karsten Anderson, to carry out research for the American Museum of Natural History. They were supplied with every necessity including a year's supply of 'civilised' food. This they declined, electing instead to live off the land. In the end, the one-year project stretched to four years, during which time the two men ate only the meat they could kill and the fish they could catch in the Canadian Arctic. Neither of the two men suffered any adverse after-effects from their four-year experiment. It was evident to Stefansson, as it had been to [[William Banting]], that the body could function perfectly well, remain healthy, vigorous and slender if it used a diet in which as much food was eaten as the body required, only carbohydrate was restricted and the total number of calories was ignored.<ref name=\"Groves\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/banting.html|title=WILLIAM BANTING: The Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet|last=Groves, PhD|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Second Opinions|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was considerable skepticism when Stefansson reported his findings about the viability of an exclusively meat diet, his claims have been borne out in later studies and analyses.<ref>Fediuk, Karen. 2000 [http://members.shaw.ca/karen.fediuk/VitaminCintheInuitdiet.pdf Vitamin C in the Inuit diet: past and present].

But unlike the pathology of diabetes, in this particular study, glucosuria was present in Anderson for 4 days and coincided only with the giving of a 100 gm of glucose for a tolerance test and with the first 3 days of his pneumonia, where he received fluids and a diet rich in carbohydrate.

Whereas Stefansson's prior experience was that lean meat would lead to illness after the second or third fatless week, Stefansson developed nausea and diarrhea on the third day at Bellevue.

He was born in Manitoba, Canada, and died at the age of 82.\n\n==Early life==\nStefansson, born William Stephenson, was born at [[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Arnes, Manitoba]], Canada, in 1879. His parents had emigrated from [[Iceland]] to Manitoba two years earlier. After losing two children during a period of devastating flooding, the family moved to [[North Dakota]] in 1880.\n\nHe was educated at the universities [[University of North Dakota|of North Dakota]] and [[University of Iowa|of Iowa]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]], 1903). During his college years, in 1899, he changed his name to Vilhjalmur Stefansson. He studied [[anthropology]] at the graduate school of [[Harvard University]], where for two years he was an instructor.\n\n==Early explorations==\nIn 1904 and 1905, Stefansson did archaeological research in [[Iceland]]. Recruited by [[Ejnar Mikkelsen]] and [[Ernest de Koven Leffingwell]] for their Anglo-American Polar Expedition, he lived with the [[Inuit]] of the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie Delta]] during the winter of 1906\u20131907, returning alone across country via the [[Porcupine River|Porcupine]] and [[Yukon River|Yukon]] Rivers. Under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City|New York]], he and Dr. [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|R. M. Anderson]] undertook the ethnological survey of the Central Arctic coasts of the shores of [[North America]] from 1908 to 1912.\n\nIn 1908, Stefansson made a decision that would affect the rest of his time in Alaska: he hired the [[Inuk]] guide [[Natkusiak]], who would remain with him as his primary guide for the rest of his Alaska expeditions.<ref>[http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic45-1-90.pdf Natkusiak (ca. 1885\u20131947)], ''Arctic'' magazine, Vol. 45, No. 1 (March 1992), pp. 90\u201392.</ref> At the time he met Natkusiak, the Inuk guide was working for Capt.

Newspapers subsequently popularised the term \"Blonde Eskimo\", which caught more readers' attention despite Stefansson's preference for the term Copper Inuit. Stefansson later referenced Greely's work in his writings and the term \"Blonde Eskimo\" became applied to sightings of light haired [[Eskimo]]s from as early as the 17th century.<ref>''My Life with the Eskimo'', 1922, p. 199 (reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, 2004).</ref>\n\n==Loss of the ''Karluk'' and rescue of survivors==\n{{Further|Voyage of the Karluk}}\nStefansson organized and directed the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913\u20131916]] to explore the regions west of [[Queen Elizabeth Islands|Parry Archipelago]] for the [[Government of Canada]]. Three ships, the ''[[HMCS Karluk|Karluk]]'', the ''Mary Sachs'', and the ''Alaska'' were employed.\n\nStefansson left the main ship, the ''Karluk'', when it became stuck in the ice in August/September 1913. Stefansson's explanation was that he and five other expedition members left to go hunting to provide fresh meat for the crew. However, William Laird McKinley and others left on the ship suspected that he left deliberately, anticipating that the ship would be carried off by moving ice, as indeed happened. The ship, with Captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]] of Newfoundland and 24 other expedition members aboard, drifted westward with the ice and was eventually crushed. It sank on January 11, 1914. Four men made their way to [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], but died there, possibly from carbon monoxide poisoning, before they could be rescued. Four other men, including [[Alistair Mackay]] who had been part of the Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1907\u201309|British Antarctic Expedition]], tried reaching [[Wrangel Island]] on their own but perished. The remaining members of the expedition, under command of Captain Bartlett, made their way to Wrangel Island where three died. Bartlett and his Inuk hunter Kataktovik made their way across sea ice to Siberia to get help. Remaining survivors were picked up by the American fishing [[schooner]] [[King & Winge (fishing schooner)|''King & Winge'']] and the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] [[Revenue cutter|cutter]] {{USRC|Bear}}.<ref>Newell, Gordon R., ed., ''H.W. McCurdy Maritime History of the Pacific Northwest'', at 242, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington, 1966.</ref>\n\nStefansson resumed his explorations by [[sledge]] over the [[Arctic Ocean]], here known as the [[Beaufort Sea]], leaving [[Collinson Point, Alaska|Collinson Point]], [[Alaska]] in April, 1914. A supporting sledge turned back {{convert|75|mi|abbr=on}} offshore, but he and two men continued onward on one sledge, living largely by his rifle on polar game for 96 days until his party reached the ''Mary Sachs'' in the autumn. Stefansson continued exploring until 1918.\n\n==Wrangel Island fiasco==\nIn 1921, he encouraged and planned an expedition for four young men to colonise [[Wrangel Island]] north of [[Siberia]], where the eleven survivors of the 22 men on the ''Karluk'' had lived from March to September 1914. Stefansson had designs for forming an exploration company that would be geared towards individuals interested in touring the Arctic island.\n\nStefansson originally wanted to claim Wrangel Island for the Canadian government. However, due to the dangerous outcome from his initial trip to the island, the government refused to assist with the expedition. He then wanted to claim the land for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] but the British government rejected this claim when it was made by the young men. The raising of the British flag on Wrangel Island, an acknowledged [[Russia]]n territory, caused an international incident.\n\nThe four young men, Frederick Maurer, E. Lorne Knight, and Milton Galle from the US, and Allan Crawford of Canada, were inexperienced and ill-equipped for the trip. All perished on the island or in an attempt to get help from Siberia across the frozen [[Chukchi Sea]]. The only survivors were an Inuk woman, [[Ada Blackjack]], whom the men had hired as a seamstress in [[Nome, Alaska]], and taken with them, and the expedition's cat, Vic. Ada Blackjack had taught herself survival skills and cared for the last man on the island, E. Lorne Knight, until he died of [[scurvy]]. Blackjack was rescued in 1923 after two years on Wrangel Island. Stefansson drew the ire of the public and the families for having sent such ill-equipped young men to Wrangel. His reputation was severely tainted by this disaster and that of the ''Karluk''.\n\n==Discoveries==\nStefansson's discoveries included new land (such as [[Brock Island|Brock]], [[Mackenzie King Island|Mackenzie King]], [[Borden Island|Borden]], [[Meighen Island|Meighen]], and [[Lougheed Island]]s)<ref name=Stefansson>{{cite book\n  | last = Stefansson\n  | first = Vilhjalmur\n  | title = The Friendly Arctic: The Story of Five Years in Polar Regions\n  | publisher = Macmillan\n  | year = 1922\n  | location = New York\n| url =https://archive.org/details/friendlyarctics01stefgoog}}</ref> and the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. His journeys and successes are among the marvels of [[Arctic exploration]]. He extended the discoveries of [[Francis Leopold McClintock]]. From April 1914 to June 1915 he lived on the [[Drift ice|ice pack]]. Stefansson continued his explorations leaving from [[Herschel Island]] on August 23, 1915.\n\nOn January 30, 1920, ''The Pioche Record'' reported that Icelandic explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson discovered a lost cache from the [[McClintock Arctic expedition|1853 McClintock expedition]] on [[Melville Island (Northwest Territories and Nunavut)|Melville Island]].

Late in life, through his affiliation with [[Dartmouth College]] (he was Director of Polar Studies), he became a major figure in the establishment of the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL) in [[Hanover, New Hampshire|Hanover]], [[New Hampshire]]. CRREL-supported research, often conducted in winter on the forbidding summit of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]], has been key to developing mat\u00e9riel and doctrine to support alpine conflict.\n\nStefansson joined [[the Explorers Club]] in 1908, four years after its founding. He later served as Club President twice: 1919\u20131922 and 1937\u20131939. In the all-male Club, the Board drew attention under Stefansson's reign when it put forth an amendment to its bylaws that read in 1938, \"A Woman's Roll of Honor shall be instituted to which the Board of Directors may name women of the United States and Canada in recognition of the noteworthy achievements and writings in the field of the Club's interests, primarily exploration.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\">Minutes, Explorer's Club, 4 January 1938.</ref> Perhaps to comfort fellow members, the article added, \"This Woman's Roll of Honor shall be quite outside the Club's organisation but shall correspond in dignity to the Honorary Class of (male) members within it.\"<ref name=\"Minutes 1938\" /> His continued support of women in anthropology is demonstrated in his 1939\u20131941 mentorship of [[Gitel Steed]] as she undertook research on diet and subsistence for his two-volume ''Lives of the Hunters'', from which she began a dissertation on hunter-gatherer.\n\nWhile living in New York City, Stefansson was one of the regulars at [[Romany Marie]]'s [[Greenwich Village]] [[caf\u00e9]]s.<ref name=\"Biography\">Robert Shulman.

One of the organisations prominent in this campaign was the [[Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia|American Committee for the Settlement of Jews in Birobidjan]], or Ambijan, formed in 1934. A tireless proponent of settlement in Birobidzhan, Stefansson appeared at countless Ambijan meetings, dinners, and rallies, and proved an invaluable resource. Ambijan produced a 50-page Year Book at the end of 1936, full of testimonials and letters of support. Among these was one from Stefansson, who was now also listed as a member of Ambijan's Board of Directors and Governors: \"The Birobidjan project seems to me to offer a most statesmanlike contribution to the problem of the rehabilitation of eastern and central European Jewry,\" he wrote.\n\nAmbijan's national conference in New York, November 25\u201326, 1944, pledged to raise $1 million to support refugees in [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] and Birobidzhan. Prominent guests and speakers included New York Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]], Senator [[Elbert D. Thomas]] of [[Utah]], and Soviet ambassador [[Andrei Gromyko]]. A public dinner, attended by the delegates and their guests, was hosted by Vilhjalmur and spouse Evelyn Stefansson. Vilhjalmur was selected as one of two vice-presidents of the organisation.\n\nBut with the growing anti-Russian feeling in the country after [[World War II]], \"expos\u00e9s\" of Stefansson began to appear in the press. In August 1951, he was denounced as a [[Communism|Communist]] before a [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Senate Internal Security subcommittee]] by [[Louis F. Budenz]], a Communist-turned-Catholic. Perhaps Stefansson himself had by then some second thoughts about Ambijan, for his posthumously published autobiography made no mention of his work on its behalf. Nor, for that matter, did his otherwise very complete obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' of August 27, 1962.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Srebrnik | first1 = Henry | year = 1998 | title = The Radical 'Second Life' of Vilhjalmur Stefansson | url = | journal = Arctic | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 58\u201360 | doi=10.14430/arctic1046}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy of an exclusively meat diet==\nStefansson is also a figure of considerable interest in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]ary circles, especially those with an interest in very [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s. Stefansson documented the fact that the [[Inuit diet]] consisted of about 90% meat and fish; Inuit would often go 6 to 9 months a year eating nothing but meat and fish\u2014what might nowadays be perceived to be a 'zerocarb' / [[no-carbohydrate diet]]. (The diet technically contains a very low amount of carbohydates as the fresh fish that the Inuit ate would have contained a small amount of glycogen.) He found that he and his fellow explorers of European, Negro, and South Sea Islands descent were also perfectly healthy on such a diet. \n\nSome years after his first experience with the Inuit (known as Eskimos in Stefansson's time), Dr. Stefansson returned to the Arctic with a colleague, Dr. Karsten Anderson, to carry out research for the American Museum of Natural History. They were supplied with every necessity including a year's supply of 'civilised' food. This they declined, electing instead to live off the land. In the end, the one-year project stretched to four years, during which time the two men ate only the meat they could kill and the fish they could catch in the Canadian Arctic. Neither of the two men suffered any adverse after-effects from their four-year experiment. It was evident to Stefansson, as it had been to [[William Banting]], that the body could function perfectly well, remain healthy, vigorous and slender if it used a diet in which as much food was eaten as the body required, only carbohydrate was restricted and the total number of calories was ignored.<ref name=\"Groves\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/banting.html|title=WILLIAM BANTING: The Father of the Low-Carbohydrate Diet|last=Groves, PhD|first=Barry|year=2002|publisher=Second Opinions|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was considerable skepticism when Stefansson reported his findings about the viability of an exclusively meat diet, his claims have been borne out in later studies and analyses.<ref>Fediuk, Karen. 2000 [http://members.shaw.ca/karen.fediuk/VitaminCintheInuitdiet.pdf Vitamin C in the Inuit diet: past and present].

For the rest of an entire year, paid observers followed them to ensure dietary compliance.  The book ''The Unseen Power: Public Relations'' states that [[Pendleton Dudley|Pendelton Dudley]], once considered the \"dean of public relations\", convinced the [[American Meat Institute]] to fund this study.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unseen Power: Public Relations|last=Cutlip|first=Scott|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0805814655|location=London|pages=101|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe results were published, and Anderson had developed [[glycosuria]] during this time, which is normally associated with untreated diabetes.  But unlike the pathology of diabetes, in this particular study, glucosuria was present in Anderson for 4 days and coincided only with the giving of a 100 gm of glucose for a tolerance test and with the first 3 days of his pneumonia, where he received fluids and a diet rich in carbohydrate.

Stefansson noted that in the North, very lean meat sometimes produced \"digestive disturbances\".  Whereas Stefansson's prior experience was that lean meat would lead to illness after the second or third fatless week, Stefansson developed nausea and diarrhea on the third day at Bellevue.  Stefansson attributes the fast onset of illness due to the usually lean meat that he was served versus the fattier caribou meat he consumed previously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblelife.org/stefansson2.htm|title=Adventures in Diet Part 2 (Harper's Monthly Magazine)|last=Stefansson|first=Vilhjalmur|date=December 1935}}</ref>  After eating fatty meat, he fully recovered in two days.

During the next 2 days he took much less protein and more fat so that he received about 20 percent of his calories from protein and 80 percent from fat.
