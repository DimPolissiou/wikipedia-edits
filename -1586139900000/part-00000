Up\u0101li was born a low-caste barber. He met the Buddha when still a child, and later, when the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes received [[pabbajja|ordination]], he did so as well. He was, in fact, ordained before the princes, putting humility before caste. Having been ordained, Up\u0101li learnt both Buddhist doctrine ({{lang-pi|Dhamma|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes}}) and ''vinaya''. His [[Upadhyay#In_Buddhism|preceptor]] was Kappitaka. Up\u0101li became known for his mastery and strictness of ''vinaya'', and was consulted often about ''vinaya'' matters. A notable case he decided about was that of the monk Ajjuka, who was accused of partisanship in a conflict about real estate. During the First Council, Up\u0101li received the important role of reciting the ''vinaya'', for which he is mostly known.\n\nScholars have analyzed Up\u0101li's role and that of other disciples in the early texts, and it has been suggested that his role in the texts was emphasized during a period of compiling that stressed monastic discipline, during which [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}) and Up\u0101li became the most important disciples. Later, Up\u0101li and his pupils became known as ''vinayadharas'' ([[P\u0101li]]; 'custodians of the vinaya'), who preserved the monastic discipline after the Buddha's ''[[parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]'' ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}; passing into final Nirvana). This lineage became an important part of the identity of [[Ceylon|Ceylonese]] and Burmese Buddhism. In China, the 7th-century Vinaya school referred to Up\u0101li as their patriarch, and it was believed that one of their founders was a reincarnation of him. The technical conversations about ''vinaya'' between the Buddha and Up\u0101li were recorded in the P\u0101li and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] traditions, and have been suggested as an important subject of study for modern-day ethics in [[American Buddhism]].\n\n== Accounts ==\nUp\u0101li the barber\u2019s personality is not depicted extensively in the texts, as the texts mostly emphasize his stereotypical qualities as an expert in monastic discipline, especially so in the [[P\u0101li]] texts.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=67, 231}}\n\n=== Early life ===\nAccording to the texts, Up\u0101li was therefore a barber, a despised profession in ancient India.{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1899 |p=102}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=357}} He was from an [[Vaishya|artisan caste]] family in service to the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes in [[Kapilavatthu]] ({{lang-sa|\u015aakya; Kapilavastu}}) and, according to the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'', to the Buddha. Up\u0101li's mother had once introduced Up\u0101li to the Buddha.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'', [[Dharmaguptaka]] and Chinese texts relate that as a child, Up\u0101li shaved the hair of the Buddha. Unlike adults, he had no fear of approaching the Buddha. Once, as he was guided by the Buddha during the shaving, he attained [[jhana|advanced states of meditation]]. Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Bareau]] argues that this story is ancient, because it precedes the tradition of art depictions of the Buddha with curly hair, and the glorification of Up\u0101li as an adult.{{sfn |Bareau |1962 |p=262}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the P\u0101li [[Cullavagga]] and the texts of discipline of the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] order, when the princes left home to become monks, Up\u0101li followed them. Since the princes handed Up\u0101li all their possessions, including jewelry, he figured that returning to Kapilavatthu with these possessions might cause him to be accused of having killed the princes for theft. Up\u0101li therefore decided to become ordained with them. They were ordained by the Buddha at the [[Malla (India)|Anupiy\u0101 grove]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. For the texts of traditions apart from P\u0101li, see {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |p=97}}.}} Several variations on the story of Up\u0101li's ordination exist, but all of them emphasize that his status in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes}}; monastic community) was independent of his caste origin. In the P\u0101li version, the princes, including [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}), voluntarily allowed Up\u0101li to ordain before them in order to give him seniority in order of ordination and abandon their own attachment to caste and social status.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}[[File:Kapilavastu.jpg|thumb|Remains at [[Tilaurakot]], one of the two sites that may have been Kapilavatthu |alt=Ruins of walled buildings]] In the Tibetan M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, co-disciple [[Sariputra|S\u0101riputta]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101riputra}}) persuaded Up\u0101li to become ordained when he hesitated because of being low caste, but in the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', it was Up\u0101li's own initiative.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'' continues that after all the monks had been ordained, the Buddha requested that the former princes bow for their former barber, which led to consternation among the witnessing king [[Bimbisara|Bimbis\u0101ra]] and advisers, who also bowed for Up\u0101li following their example.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}} It became widely known that the Sakyans had their barber ordained before them to humble their pride,{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=116}} as the Buddha related a ''[[Jataka|J\u0101taka]]'' tale that the king and advisers had bowed for Up\u0101li in a previous life, too.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=10}}\n\nIndologist [[T.W. Rhys Davids]] noted that Up\u0101li was the \"striking proof of the reality of the effect produced by Gautama's disregard of the supposed importance of caste\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1903 |p=69}} Historian {{ill|H.W. Schumann|de}} also raises Up\u0101li as an example of the general rule that \"in no case did ... humble origins prevent a monk from becoming prominent in the [[sangha|Order]]\".{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=166}} Religion scholar Jeffrey Samuels points out, though, that the majority of Buddhist monks and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]], as drawn from several analyses of Buddhist texts, were from higher castes, with a minority of six percent like Up\u0101li being exception to the rule.{{sfn |Samuels |2007 |p=123}} Historian Sangh Sen Singh argues that Up\u0101li could have been the leader of the ''sa\u1e45gha'' after the Buddha's ''[[parinibb\u0101na]]'' instead of [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa). But the fact that he was from a low caste effectively prevented this, as many of the Buddhist devotees at the time might have objected to his leadership position.{{sfn |Singh |1973 |pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n=== Monastic life ===\nUp\u0101li had a dwelling place in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101li]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015b\u0101li}}), called V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma.<!--Calikarama-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma}}{{sfn |Geiger |1912 |p=35}} He once asked the Buddha for leave to withdraw in the forest and lead a life in solitude. The Buddha refused, however, and told him that such a life was not for everyone.<!--Upali Sutta--> P\u0101li scholar [[Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|Gunapala Malalasekera]] argued that the Buddha wanted Up\u0101li to learn both meditation and Buddhist doctrine, and a life in the forest would have provided him with only the former. The texts state that the Buddha himself taught the ''[[vinaya]]'' (monastic discipline) to Up\u0101li.<!--Upali-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; Up\u0101li Sutta (3)}} Up\u0101li later attained the state of an [[arhat|enlightened disciple]].{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the [[Upadhyay#In Buddhism|preceptor]] who completed the process of Up\u0101li's [[upasampada|acceptance]] in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' was a monk called Kappitaka.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=58}}{{refn |group=note |Philosopher Michael Freedman argues that the office of preceptor may have only been developed after the Buddha's ''parinibb\u0101na'', although he admits the texts contradict each other with regard to Up\u0101li's acceptance.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=57 n.60, 97\u201398}}}} There is one story told about Up\u0101li and his preceptor. Kappitaka was in the habit of living in cemeteries. In one cemetery near Ves\u0101li he had a [[monastic cell]]. One day, a couple of nuns built a small monument there in honor of their teacher, also a nun, and made much noise in the process. Disturbed by the nuns, Kappitaka destroyed the monument, which greatly angered the nuns. Later, in an attempt to kill Kappitaka, they destroyed his cell in return. But Kappitaka was warned by Up\u0101li in advance and he had already fled elsewhere.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kappitaka Thera}} The next day, Up\u0101li was verbally abused by the nuns for having informed his teacher.{{sfn |Dhammadinna |2016 |pp=45\u201346}}\n\n=== Role in monastic discipline ===\n[[File:Upali (Ubari), from the series \u201cTwo Bodhisattva and Ten Great Disciples of Sakyamuni\u201d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Up\u0101li, woodblock print by [[Munakata Shik\u014d]], originally from 1939|left|alt=Monk in black robes looking at the sky with hands held up]]\n\nIn the literature of every Buddhist school, Up\u0101li is depicted as an expert in ''vinaya'' and the ''[[p\u0101\u1e6dimokkha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratimok\u1e63a|italic=yes}}; monastic code),{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} for which the Buddha declared him [[\u015ar\u0101vaka#Foremost disciples|foremost]] among those who remember the vinaya ({{lang-pi|Vinaya-p\u0101mokkha|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Vinayapramukkha|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=878}}{{sfn |Robinson |Johnson |1997 |p=45}} He was therefore dubbed the 'repository of the discipline' ({{lang-pi|Vinaye agganikkhitto|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} In some schools, he is also seen as an expert in the [[Bodhisattva Precepts|precepts]] of a ''[[bodhisattva|bodhisatta]]'' ({{lang-sa|bodhisattva|italic=yes}}; Buddha-to-be).{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} 5th-century ommentator [[Buddhaghosa]] stated that Up\u0101li drew up instructions and explanatory notes for monks dealing with disciplinary matters.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nUp\u0101li was also known for his strictness in practicing the discipline.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=365}} Monks considered it a privilege to study the ''vinaya'' under him.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=4}} At times, monks who felt repentance and wanted to improve themselves, sought his advice.<!--Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera--> In other cases, Up\u0101li was consulted in making decisions considering alleged offenses of monastic discipline. For example, one newly ordained nun was found pregnant, and was judged by the monk [[Devadatta]] as unfit to be a nun. However, the Buddha had Up\u0101li do a second investigation, during which Up\u0101li called upon the help of the laywoman [[Visakha|Visakh\u0101]] and several other laypeople. Eventually, Up\u0101li concluded the nun had conceived the child by her husband before her ordination as a nun, and therefore was innocent. The Buddha later praised Up\u0101li for his careful consideration of this matter.<!--Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa; Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera}}\n\nOther notable cases about which Up\u0101li decided are that of the monks Bharukaccha and Ajjuka. Bharukaccha consulted Up\u0101li whether dreaming about having sex with a woman amounted to an offense that required disrobing, and Up\u0101li judged it did not.<!--Bharukaccha--> As for the monk Ajjuka, he had decided about a dispute about real estate.<!--Ajjuka-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka; Bharukaccha}}. For the other laypeople, see {{harvtxt |Churn Law |2000 |p=464}}.}} In this  case, a rich householder was in doubt as to who he should will his inheritance to, his pious nephew or his own son. He asked Ajjuka to invite for an audience the person who had the most faith of the two{{em dash}}Ajjuka invited the nephew. Angry about the decision, the son accused Ajjuka of partisanship and went to see the monk [[\u0100nanda]]. \u0100nanda disagreed with Ajjuka's decision, judging the son the more rightful heir, and causing the son to feel justified in accusing Ajjuka of not being a \"true monk\". When Up\u0101li got involved, however, he judged in favor of Ajjuka.

The question that might have been raised is whether issuing laws would not normally be associated with kings. The ''[[Apadana|Apad\u0101na]]'' explains this by relating that Up\u0101li had been an all-powerful [[cakravartin|wheel-turning king]] for thousand previous lives, and a king of the [[deva (Buddhism)|deities]] in another thousand lives.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |1996 |p=126 note 27}} and {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}.

Buddhologist [[Jean Przyluski]] argued that Up\u0101li's prominence in the P\u0101li texts is indicative of the preference of the [[Sthavira]]v\u0101dins for ''vinaya'' above [[sutra|discourse]], whereas the prominence of \u0100nanda in the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts is indicative of their preference for discourse above ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=13, 464\u2013465}}{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |pp=22\u201323}} This preference of the compilers has also affected how \u0100nanda addresses Up\u0101li.<!--34-35--> In many of the early discourses Up\u0101li has little to no role,<!--88--> and he is not mentioned among many early lists of significant disciples.<!--89--> He is, however, frequently mentioned in lists in the ''Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka'', which only proves the point. Up\u0101li seems to obtain a much more significant role with the end of the Buddha's life.<!--110-->{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=34\u201335, 88\u201389, 110}} Przyluski's theory, which was further developed by Buddhologist Andr\u00e9 Migot, regarded [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}), Up\u0101li and [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}) as part of the second period in the compiling of the early texts (4th to early 3rd century BCE) that emphasized [[\u015b\u012bla|moral discipline]], associated with these disciples, as well as the city of [[Vesali|Ves\u0101l\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015bal\u012b}}).{{refn |group=note |Although Przyluski connected this with the city of [[Kosambi|Kosamb\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Kau\u015bamb\u012b}}) instead.{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |p=184}}}} In this period, these disciples' roles and stories were emphasized and embellished more than other disciples.{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} These differences in schools gradually developed and became stereotyped over time.{{sfn |Dutt |1925 |pp=206\u2013207}}\n\nUp\u0101li's successors formed a [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] called the ''vinayadharas'', or the 'custodians of the vinaya'.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=3}}{{sfn |Prebish |2008 |p=2}} ''Vinayadharas'' were monks who in [[early Buddhist Texts|early Buddhist texts]] were particularly known for their mastery and strictness with regard to the ''vinaya''. In 4th<!--2-->\u20135th-century<!--3--> [[Ceylon]], they then came to be associated with a lineage of such masters,<!--2--> because of the influence of Buddhaghosa, who established Up\u0101li and the other ''vinayadharas'' as an important characteristic<!--3--> of the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra]] tradition.<!--12--> This concept of a ''vinayadhara'' lineage also affected Burma, and led to a belief that only those ordained in the proper lineage could become ''vinayadharas''.<!--3--> Gradually, the ''vinayadhara'' came to be seen a sign of superior tradition, as the lineage was integrated with local history.<!--12--> Even later, the ''vinayadhara'' became a formal position<!--14--> of judge and arbitrator in problems of ''vinaya''.<!--4-->{{sfn |Frasch |1996 |pp=2\u20134, 12, 14}}\n\nUp\u0101li's lineage has gained scholarly attention because of their way of timekeeping, known by modern scholars as the \"dotted record\". Chinese sources say that Up\u0101li and his successors had a custom to insert a dot in a manuscript marking each year after the First Council. The sources claim that each of successors continued this tradition, up until 489 CE, when the [[Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] scholar [[Sa\u1e43ghabhadra]]  entered the last dot in the manuscript. This tradition has been used by some modern scholars to calculate the [[parinirvana|passing away]] of the Buddha,<!--6--> but has now been debunked as historically unlikely.<!--7--> Still, data pertaining to the ''vinayadharas'' is used to support theories regarding the dating of the Buddha's life and death,<!--6--> such as the one proposed by Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]].<!--8-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Prebish |2008 |pp=6\u20138}}. {{harvtxt |Geiger |1912 |p=xlvii}} mentions the term ''para\u1e43par\u0101''.}}\n[[File:Daoxuan (Nara National Museum).jpg|thumb|The Chinese Vinaya school founded by Tao-hs\u00fcan saw themselves as the continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage ([[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|ICP]], [[Nara National Museum]]) |upright=.7]]\nNot only in ancient India did certain lineages identify with Up\u0101li. In 7th-century China, the Vinaya or Nan-shan School was founded by the monks Ku-hsin and [[Tao-hs\u00fcan]], seen as a continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage. The school emphasized restoring and propagating the ''vinaya'' and became popular in the Pa Hwa Hills of [[Nanking]]. It developed a standard for teaching the ''vinaya''. The monks would wear black and emphasized protecting oneself against error.

Up\u0101li was born a low-caste barber. He met the Buddha when still a child, and later, when the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes received [[pabbajja|ordination]], he did so as well. He was, in fact, ordained before the princes, putting humility before caste. Having been ordained, Up\u0101li learnt both Buddhist doctrine ({{lang-pi|Dhamma|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Dharma|italic=yes}}) and ''vinaya''. His [[Upadhyay#In_Buddhism|preceptor]] was Kappitaka. Up\u0101li became known for his mastery and strictness of ''vinaya'', and was consulted often about ''vinaya'' matters. A notable case he decided about was that of the monk Ajjuka, who was accused of partisanship in a conflict about real estate. During the First Council, Up\u0101li received the important role of reciting the ''vinaya'', for which he is mostly known.\n\nScholars have analyzed Up\u0101li's role and that of other disciples in the early texts, and it has been suggested that his role in the texts was emphasized during a period of compiling that stressed monastic discipline, during which [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}) and Up\u0101li became the most important disciples. Later, Up\u0101li and his pupils became known as ''vinayadharas'' ([[P\u0101li]]; 'custodians of the vinaya'), who preserved the monastic discipline after the Buddha's ''[[parinirvana|parinibb\u0101na]]'' ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}; passing into final Nirvana). This lineage became an important part of the identity of [[Ceylon|Ceylonese]] and Burmese Buddhism. In China, the 7th-century Vinaya school referred to Up\u0101li as their patriarch, and it was believed that one of their founders was a reincarnation of him. The technical conversations about ''vinaya'' between the Buddha and Up\u0101li were recorded in the P\u0101li and [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] traditions, and have been suggested as an important subject of study for modern-day ethics in [[American Buddhism]].\n\n== Accounts ==\nUp\u0101li the barber\u2019s personality is not depicted extensively in the texts, as the texts mostly emphasize his stereotypical qualities as an expert in monastic discipline, especially so in the [[P\u0101li]] texts.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=67, 231}}\n\n=== Early life ===\nAccording to the texts, Up\u0101li was therefore a barber, a despised profession in ancient India.{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1899 |p=102}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=357}} He was from an [[Vaishya|artisan caste]] family in service to the [[Shakya|Sakya]] princes in [[Kapilavatthu]] ({{lang-sa|\u015aakya; Kapilavastu}}) and, according to the ''[[Mah\u0101vastu]]'', to the Buddha. Up\u0101li's mother had once introduced Up\u0101li to the Buddha.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'', [[Dharmaguptaka]] and Chinese texts relate that as a child, Up\u0101li shaved the hair of the Buddha. Unlike adults, he had no fear of approaching the Buddha. Once, as he was guided by the Buddha during the shaving, he attained [[jhana|advanced states of meditation]]. Buddhologist [[Andr\u00e9 Bareau]] argues that this story is ancient, because it precedes the tradition of art depictions of the Buddha with curly hair, and the glorification of Up\u0101li as an adult.{{sfn |Bareau |1962 |p=262}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the P\u0101li [[Cullavagga]] and the texts of discipline of the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] order, when the princes left home to become monks, Up\u0101li followed them. Since the princes handed Up\u0101li all their possessions, including jewelry, he figured that returning to Kapilavatthu with these possessions might cause him to be accused of having killed the princes for theft. Up\u0101li therefore decided to become ordained with them. They were ordained by the Buddha at the [[Malla (India)|Anupiy\u0101 grove]].{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. For the texts of traditions apart from P\u0101li, see {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |p=97}}.}} Several variations on the story of Up\u0101li's ordination exist, but all of them emphasize that his status in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' ({{lang-sa|sa\u1e43gha|italic=yes}}; monastic community) was independent of his caste origin. In the P\u0101li version, the princes, including [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}), voluntarily allowed Up\u0101li to ordain before them in order to give him seniority in order of ordination and abandon their own attachment to caste and social status.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}[[File:Kapilavastu.jpg|thumb|Remains at [[Tilaurakot]], one of the two sites that may have been Kapilavatthu |alt=Ruins of walled buildings]] In the Tibetan M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, co-disciple [[Sariputra|S\u0101riputta]] ({{lang-sa|\u015a\u0101riputra}}) persuaded Up\u0101li to become ordained when he hesitated because of being low caste, but in the ''Mah\u0101vastu'', it was Up\u0101li's own initiative.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=117}}{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} The ''Mah\u0101vastu'' continues that after all the monks had been ordained, the Buddha requested that the former princes bow for their former barber, which led to consternation among the witnessing king [[Bimbisara|Bimbis\u0101ra]] and advisers, who also bowed for Up\u0101li following their example.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}} It became widely known that the Sakyans had their barber ordained before them to humble their pride,{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=116}} as the Buddha related a ''[[Jataka|J\u0101taka]]'' tale that the king and advisers had bowed for Up\u0101li in a previous life, too.{{sfn |Bareau |1988 |p=76}}{{sfn |Rahula |1978 |p=10}}\n\nIndologist [[T.W. Rhys Davids]] noted that Up\u0101li was the \"striking proof of the reality of the effect produced by Gautama's disregard of the supposed importance of caste\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1903 |p=69}} Historian {{ill|H.W. Schumann|de}} also raises Up\u0101li as an example of the general rule that \"in no case did ... humble origins prevent a monk from becoming prominent in the [[sangha|Order]]\".{{sfn |Schumann |2004 |p=166}} Religion scholar Jeffrey Samuels points out, though, that the majority of Buddhist monks and [[bhikkhuni|nuns]], as drawn from several analyses of Buddhist texts, were from higher castes, with a minority of six percent like Up\u0101li being exception to the rule.{{sfn |Samuels |2007 |p=123}} Historian Sangh Sen Singh argues that Up\u0101li could have been the leader of the ''sa\u1e45gha'' after the Buddha's ''[[parinibb\u0101na]]'' instead of [[Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a|italic=yes}}, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa). But the fact that he was from a low caste effectively prevented this, as many of the Buddhist devotees at the time might have objected to his leadership position.{{sfn |Singh |1973 |pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n=== Monastic life ===\nUp\u0101li had a dwelling place in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Ves\u0101li]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015b\u0101li}}), called V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma.<!--Calikarama-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; V\u0101lik\u0101r\u0101ma}}{{sfn |Geiger |1912 |p=35}} He once asked the Buddha for leave to withdraw in the forest and lead a life in solitude. The Buddha refused, however, and told him that such a life was not for everyone.<!--Upali Sutta--> P\u0101li scholar [[Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|Gunapala Malalasekera]] argued that the Buddha wanted Up\u0101li to learn both meditation and Buddhist doctrine, and a life in the forest would have provided him with only the former. The texts state that the Buddha himself taught the ''[[vinaya]]'' (monastic discipline) to Up\u0101li.<!--Upali-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li; Up\u0101li Sutta (3)}} Up\u0101li later attained the state of an [[arhat|enlightened disciple]].{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nAccording to the Mah\u0101vastu, the [[Upadhyay#In Buddhism|preceptor]] who completed the process of Up\u0101li's [[upasampada|acceptance]] in the ''sa\u1e45gha'' was a monk called Kappitaka.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=58}}{{refn |group=note |Philosopher Michael Freedman argues that the office of preceptor may have only been developed after the Buddha's ''parinibb\u0101na'', although he admits the texts contradict each other with regard to Up\u0101li's acceptance.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=57 n.60, 97\u201398}}}} There is one story told about Up\u0101li and his preceptor. Kappitaka was in the habit of living in cemeteries. In one cemetery near Ves\u0101li he had a [[monastic cell]]. One day, a couple of nuns built a small monument there in honor of their teacher, also a nun, and made much noise in the process. Disturbed by the nuns, Kappitaka destroyed the monument, which greatly angered the nuns. Later, in an attempt to kill Kappitaka, they destroyed his cell in return. But Kappitaka was warned by Up\u0101li in advance and he had already fled elsewhere.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kappitaka Thera}} The next day, Up\u0101li was verbally abused by the nuns for having informed his teacher.{{sfn |Dhammadinna |2016 |pp=45\u201346}}\n\n=== Role in monastic discipline ===\n[[File:Upali (Ubari), from the series \u201cTwo Bodhisattva and Ten Great Disciples of Sakyamuni\u201d.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Up\u0101li, woodblock print by [[Munakata Shik\u014d]], originally from 1939|left|alt=Monk in black robes looking at the sky with hands held up]]\n\nIn the literature of every Buddhist school, Up\u0101li is depicted as an expert in ''vinaya'' and the ''[[p\u0101\u1e6dimokkha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratimok\u1e63a|italic=yes}}; monastic code),{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} for which the Buddha declared him [[\u015ar\u0101vaka#Foremost disciples|foremost]] among those who remember the vinaya ({{lang-pi|Vinaya-p\u0101mokkha|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|Vinayapramukkha|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Sarao |2004 |p=878}}{{sfn |Robinson |Johnson |1997 |p=45}} He was therefore dubbed the 'repository of the discipline' ({{lang-pi|Vinaye agganikkhitto|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} In some schools, he is also seen as an expert in the [[Bodhisattva Precepts|precepts]] of a ''[[bodhisattva|bodhisatta]]'' ({{lang-sa|bodhisattva|italic=yes}}; Buddha-to-be).{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}} 5th-century ommentator [[Buddhaghosa]] stated that Up\u0101li drew up instructions and explanatory notes for monks dealing with disciplinary matters.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}\n\nUp\u0101li was also known for his strictness in practicing the discipline.{{sfn |Baroni |2002 |p=365}} Monks considered it a privilege to study the ''vinaya'' under him.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=4}} At times, monks who felt repentance and wanted to improve themselves, sought his advice.<!--Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera--> In other cases, Up\u0101li was consulted in making decisions considering alleged offenses of monastic discipline. For example, one newly ordained nun was found pregnant, and was judged by the monk [[Devadatta]] as unfit to be a nun. However, the Buddha had Up\u0101li do a second investigation, during which Up\u0101li called upon the help of the laywoman [[Visakha|Visakh\u0101]] and several other laypeople. Eventually, Up\u0101li concluded the nun had conceived the child by her husband before her ordination as a nun, and therefore was innocent. The Buddha later praised Up\u0101li for his careful consideration of this matter.<!--Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa-->{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Kum\u0101ra-Kassapa; Raman\u012byavih\u0101r\u012b Thera}}\n\nOther notable cases about which Up\u0101li decided are that of the monks Bharukaccha and Ajjuka. Bharukaccha consulted Up\u0101li whether dreaming about having sex with a woman amounted to an offense that required disrobing, and Up\u0101li judged it did not.<!--Bharukaccha--> As for the monk Ajjuka, he had decided about a dispute about real estate.<!--Ajjuka-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka; Bharukaccha}}. For the other laypeople, see {{harvtxt |Churn Law |2000 |p=464}}.}} In this  case, a rich householder was in doubt as to who he should will his inheritance to, his pious nephew or his own son. He asked Ajjuka to invite for an audience the person who had the most faith of the two{{em dash}}Ajjuka invited the nephew. Angry about the decision, the son accused Ajjuka of partisanship and went to see the monk [[\u0100nanda]]. \u0100nanda disagreed with Ajjuka's decision, judging the son the more rightful heir, and causing the son to feel justified in accusing Ajjuka of not being a \"true monk\". When Up\u0101li got involved, however, he judged in favor of Ajjuka. He pointed out to \u0100nanda that the act of inviting a layperson did not break monastic discipline.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}. {{harvtxt |Freedman |1977 |pp=30\u201332}} mentions faith, the son seeing \u0100nanda, and the accusation of false monkhood.}} Eventually, \u0100nanda agreed with Up\u0101li, and Up\u0101li was able to settle the issue.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |p=32}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Ajjuka}} Here, too, the Buddha praised Up\u0101li for his handling of the case.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1961}} Law scholar [[Andrew Huxley (law scholar)|Andrew Huxley]] noted that Up\u0101li's judgment of this case allowed monks to engage on an ethical level with the world, whereas \u0100nanda's judgment did not.{{sfn |Huxley |2010 |p=278}}\n\n=== First Council and death ===\n[[File:Nava Jetavana Temple - Shravasti - 013 First Council at Rajagaha (9241729223).jpg|The First Council.

For the Mah\u0101sa\u1e43ghika, see {{harvtxt |Analayo |2016 |p=160}}.}}\n\nUp\u0101li had a number of pupils, who were called the ''sattarasavaggiy\u0101''.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=R\u0101jagaha}} Up\u0101li and his pupils were entrusted with the [[Bh\u0101\u1e47aka|safekeeping and reciting]] of this collection of monastic discipline.{{sfn |Norman |2005 |p=37}} Sixteen years after the Buddha's [[parinirvana|passing away]], Up\u0101li ordained a pupil called D\u0101saka, who would become his successor with regard to expertise in monastic discipline. According to the late P\u0101li ''[[Dipavamsa|D\u012bpava\u1e43sa]]'', Up\u0101li died at the age of seventy-four, if this age is interpreted as life-span, not years of ordination.{{sfn |Prebish |2008 |p=9}}\n\n=== Previous lives ===\n<!--disabled[[File:Indian relief from Amaravati, Guntur.

The question that might have been raised is whether issuing laws would not normally be associated with kings. The ''[[Apadana|Apad\u0101na]]'' explains this by relating that Up\u0101li had been an all-powerful [[cakravartin|wheel-turning king]] for thousand previous lives, and a king of the [[deva (Buddhism)|deities]] in another thousand lives.{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Huxley |1996 |p=126 note 27}} and {{harvtxt |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}. Huxley mentions the question raised.}} Before that, the texts say he was born during the age of [[Padumuttara Buddha]] and met one of that [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]]'s disciples who was foremost in monastic discipline. Up\u0101li aspired to be like him, and pursued it through doing [[merit (Buddhism)|merits]].{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}{{sfn |Cutler |1997 |p=66}}\n\nDespite Up\u0101li's previous lives as a king, he was born as a low caste barber in the time of [[Gotama Buddha]]. This is also explained in an ''Apad\u0101na'' story: in a previous life, Up\u0101li insulted a ''[[paccekabuddha]]'' ({{lang-sa|pratyekabuddha|italic=yes}}; a type of Buddha). The evil [[karma in Buddhism|karma]] brought about low birth.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}}{{sfn |Cutler |1997 |p=66}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nUp\u0101li was the focus of worship in ancient and medieval India and was regarded as the \"patron saint\" of monks who specialize in the ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Hsuan Tsang}} He is one of the [[eight enlightened disciples]], and is honored in Burmese ceremonies.{{sfn |Mrozik |2004}}{{sfn|Strong |1992 |p=240}}\n\n=== Schools and lineages ===\n[[File:Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra on 1890 map of Anuradhapura.svg|1890 map showing the historical location of the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra, drawn by a British civil servant |alt=Map of Anurudhapura, the city that included the Mahvihara |thumb]]\nSeveral scholars have contended that the prominence of certain of the Buddha's disciples in the early texts is indicative of the preference of the compilers. Buddhologist [[Jean Przyluski]] argued that Up\u0101li's prominence in the P\u0101li texts is indicative of the preference of the [[Sthavira]]v\u0101dins for ''vinaya'' above [[sutra|discourse]], whereas the prominence of \u0100nanda in the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da texts is indicative of their preference for discourse above ''vinaya''.{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=13, 464\u2013465}}{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |pp=22\u201323}} This preference of the compilers has also affected how \u0100nanda addresses Up\u0101li.<!--34-35--> In many of the early discourses Up\u0101li has little to no role,<!--88--> and he is not mentioned among many early lists of significant disciples.<!--89--> He is, however, frequently mentioned in lists in the ''Vinaya-pi\u1e6daka'', which only proves the point. Up\u0101li seems to obtain a much more significant role with the end of the Buddha's life.<!--110-->{{sfn |Freedman |1977 |pp=34\u201335, 88\u201389, 110}} Przyluski's theory, which was further developed by Buddhologist Andr\u00e9 Migot, regarded [[Mahakassapa|Mah\u0101kassapa]] ({{lang-sa|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}}), Up\u0101li and [[Anuruddha]] ({{lang-sa|Aniruddha}}) as part of the second period in the compiling of the early texts (4th to early 3rd century BCE) that emphasized [[\u015b\u012bla|moral discipline]], associated with these disciples, as well as the city of [[Vesali|Ves\u0101l\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Vai\u015bal\u012b}}).{{refn |group=note |Although Przyluski connected this with the city of [[Kosambi|Kosamb\u012b]] ({{lang-sa|Kau\u015bamb\u012b}}) instead.{{sfn |Przyluski |1923 |p=184}}}} In this period, these disciples' roles and stories were emphasized and embellished more than other disciples.{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}}These differences in schools gradually developed and became stereotyped over time.{{sfn |Dutt |1925 |pp=206\u2013207}}\n\nUp\u0101li's successors formed a [[Lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] called the ''vinayadharas'', or the 'custodians of the vinaya'.{{sfn |Sarao |2003 |p=3}}{{sfn |Prebish |2008 |p=2}} ''Vinayadharas'' were monks who in [[early Buddhist Texts|early Buddhist texts]] were particularly known for their mastery and strictness with regard to the ''vinaya''. In 4th<!--2-->\u20135th-century<!--3--> [[Ceylon]], they then came to be associated with a lineage of such masters,<!--2--> because of the influence of Buddhaghosa, who established Up\u0101li and the other ''vinayadharas'' as an important characteristic<!--3--> of the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra]] tradition.<!--12--> This concept of a ''vinayadhara'' lineage also affected Burma, and led to a belief that only those ordained in the proper lineage could become ''vinayadharas''.<!--3--> Gradually, the ''vinayadhara'' came to be seen a sign of superior tradition, as the lineage was integrated with local history.<!--12--> Even later, the ''vinayadhara'' became a formal position<!--14--> of judge and arbitrator in problems of ''vinaya''.<!--4-->{{sfn |Frasch |1996 |pp=2\u20134, 12, 14}}\n\nUp\u0101li's lineage has gained scholarly attention because of their way of timekeeping, known by modern scholars as the \"dotted record\". Chinese sources say that Up\u0101li and his successors had a custom to insert a dot in a manuscript marking each year after the First Council. The sources claim that each of successors continued this tradition, up until 489 CE, when the [[Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] scholar [[Sa\u1e43ghabhadra]]  entered the last dot in the manuscript. This tradition has been used by some modern scholars to calculate the [[parinirvana|passing away]] of the Buddha,<!--6--> but has now been debunked as historically unlikely.<!--7--> Still, data pertaining to the ''vinayadharas'' is used to support theories regarding the dating of the Buddha's life and death,<!--6--> such as the one proposed by Indologist [[Richard Gombrich]].<!--8-->{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Prebish |2008 |pp=6\u20138}}. {{harvtxt |Geiger |1912 |p=xlvii}} mentions the term ''para\u1e43par\u0101''.}}\n[[File:Daoxuan (Nara National Museum).jpg|thumb|The Chinese Vinaya school founded by Tao-hs\u00fcan saw themselves as the continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage ([[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|ICP]], [[Nara National Museum]]) |upright=.7]]\nNot only in ancient India did certain lineages identify with Up\u0101li. In 7th-century China, the Vinaya or Nan-shan School was founded by the monks Ku-hsin and [[Tao-hs\u00fcan]], seen as a continuation of Up\u0101li's lineage. The school emphasized restoring and propagating the ''vinaya'' and became popular in the Pa Hwa Hills of [[Nanking]]. It developed a standard for teaching the ''vinaya''. The monks would wear black and emphasized protecting oneself against error. It was believed at the time that Ku-hsin was a reincarnation of Up\u0101li.{{refn |For Ku-hsin, the Pa Hwa Hills, the standard and the reincarnation, see {{harvtxt |Hsiang-Kuang |1956 |p=207}}.

Much of this is found in the ''[[Pariv\u0101ra]]'', a late ''vinaya'' text.{{sfn |Malalasekera |1937 |loc=Up\u0101li}} Bareau has suggested the conversation between the Buddha and Up\u0101li about

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious around Dee and self-conscious. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago, where Mama carried her out in her arms as Dee watched the house burn, seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, and does not ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs in to the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama and they get into an argument. Dee feels that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is very physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' - Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name. \n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship to their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee(Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious around Dee and self-conscious. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago, where Mama carried her out in her arms as Dee watched the house burn, seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she has also brought with her a man whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, and does not ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs in to the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama and they get into an argument. Dee feels that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is very physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' - Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name. \n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship to their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee(Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

While the term ''Katipunan'' remained, Bonifacio's government was also known as the [[Tagalog Republic]] (Spanish: ''Rep\u00fablica Tagala''; Filipino: ''Republikang Tagalog'').

On June 23, 1898, Aguinaldo transformed his dictatorial government into a revolutionary government. On January 23, 1899, he was then elected President of the [[First Philippine Republic]], a government constituted by the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]] under the [[Malolos Constitution]]. Consequently, this government is also called the [[Malolos Republic]].\n\nThe First Philippine Republic was short-lived and never internationally recognized.

Quezon]] was elected the first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], which had been established, still under United States sovereignty, under a [[Constitution of the Philippines#Commonwealth and Third Republic (1935)|constitution]] ratified on 14 May of that year. During its first five years, the president could serve for an unrenewable six-year term. It was later amended in 1940 to limit a president to serving no more than two four-year terms. When President Quezon exiled himself to the United States after the Philippines fell to the [[Empire of Japan]] in [[World War II in the Philippines|World War II]], he appointed [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]] as Acting President and as Acting Commander-in Chief of the Armed Forces. Abad Santos was subsequently executed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] on May 2, 1942.\n\n=== The Second Republic under the Japanese ===\nOn October 14, 1943, [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] became President under [[Constitution of the Philippines#Second Republic (1943)|a constitution imposed]] by the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]]. Laurel, an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], had been instructed to remain in the City of Manila by President Quezon, who withdrew to [[Corregidor]] and then to the United States to establish a [[government in exile]] in the United States. The General Headquarters and Military Camp Base of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] was a military station are moved in the province.\n\nAfter the combined American and Filipino forces liberated the islands in 1945, Laurel officially dissolved the republic on August 17, 1945.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nThe 1935 Constitution was restored after the Japanese surrender ended World War II, with Vice President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] becoming President due to Quezon's death on August 1, 1944. It remained in effect after the United States recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines as a separate self-governing nation on July 4, 1946.\n\n=== 1973 Constitution ===\nA new [[Constitution of the Philippines#The New Society and the Fourth Republic (1973)|Constitution]] ratified on January 17, 1973 under the rule of [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] introduced a parliamentary-style government. Marcos instituted himself as [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] while serving as President in 1978. He later appointed [[Cesar Virata|C\u00e9sar Virata]] as Prime Minister in 1981.\n\nThis Constitution was in effect until the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 toppled Marcos's 21-year authoritarian regime and replaced him with [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]].\n\n===Fifth Republic===\nRuling by decree during the early part of her tenure and as a president installed by revolutionary means, President Corazon Aquino issued [[Constitution of the Philippines|Proclamation No. 3]] on March 25, 1986 which abrogated many of the provisions of the then 1973 Constitution, including the provisions associated with the Marcos regime which gave the president legislative powers, as well as the unicameral legislature called the Batasang Pambansa (literally ''National Legislature'' in Filipino). Often called the \"Freedom Constitution,\" the proclamation retained only parts of the 1973 Constitution that were essential for a return to democratic rule, such as the bill of rights. This constitution was superseded on February 2, 1987 by the present constitution.\n\n=== Other issues ===\nBoth Bonifacio and Aguinaldo might be considered to have been an inaugural president of an insurgent government. Quezon was the inaugural president of a predecessor state to the current one, while Aquino, ''m\u00e8re'', was the inaugural president of the currently-constituted government.\n\nThe government considers Aguinaldo to have been the first president of the Philippines, followed by Quezon and his successors.<ref name=tucker2009p8>{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C. |title=The encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars: a political, social, and military history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-951-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&pg=PA8 8]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200029&Itemid=26|title=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Despite the differences in [[Constitution of the Philippines|constitutions]] and government, the line of presidents is considered to be continuous. For instance, the current president, Rodrigo R. Duterte, is considered to be the 16th president.\n\nWhile the government may consider Aguinaldo as the first president, the First Republic fell under the United States' jurisdiction due to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]; the United States thus does not consider his tenure to have been legitimate.<ref name=tucker2009p8 /><ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/aguinaldo.html Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy], U.S. Library of Congress.</ref> [[Manuel L.

Laurel giving a speech.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] giving a speech after his inauguration as President of the [[Second Philippine Republic]]]]\nAs with many other [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-occupied countries in the Second World War, the Philippines had at one point two presidents heading two governments. One was Quezon and the Commonwealth [[Government in exile|government-in-exile]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the other was Manila-based Laurel heading the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic. Notably, Laurel was himself instructed to remain in Manila by President Quezon.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Laurel was not formally recognized as a president until the rule of [[Diosdado Macapagal]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=some reliable source reporting that recognition should be easy to find}} His inclusion in the official list coincided with the transfer of the official date of Independence Day from July 4 (the anniversary of the Philippines' independence from the United States) to June 12 (the anniversary of the 1898 Declaration of Independence).\n\nThe inclusion of Laurel thus causes some problems in determining the order of presidents. It is inaccurate to call Laurel the successor of Osme\u00f1a or vice versa, since Laurel's Second Republic was formally repudiated after World War II, its actions not considered legal or binding. Quezon, Osme\u00f1a, and Roxas were seen as being in a contiguous line according to the 1935 Constitution, while Laurel was the only president of the Second Republic, which had a separate charter. Thus, Laurel had neither predecessor nor successor, while Osme\u00f1a succeeded Quezon after the latter's death, and was in turn succeeded by Roxas as President of the Third Republic.\n\n==Powers and roles==\n\n===Chief Executive===\nThe president of the Philippines, being the chief executive, serves as both the head of state and head of government of the Philippines. The constitution vests the executive power with the president who consequently heads the government's executive branch, including the Cabinet and all executive departments.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 1</ref>\n\nThe president has power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures after conviction by final judgment, except in cases of impeachment. The president can grant amnesty with the concurrence of the majority of all the members of the Congress.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 19</ref> The president has authority to contract or guarantee foreign loans on behalf of the Republic but only with the prior concurrence of the Monetary Board and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 20.</ref>\n\nThe president also exercises general supervision over local government units.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 10, sec. 4.</ref>\n\n===Commander-in-Chief===\nThe president also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 18.</ref> This includes the power to suspend the [[writ of habeas corpus]] and to declare [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial law]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Power of appointment===\nWith the consent of the Commission on Appointments, the president also appoints the heads of the executive departments, board of members and its leaders from any national government-related institutions, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, high-ranking officers of the armed forces, and other officials.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 16.</ref> The members of the Supreme Court and lower courts are also appointed by the president, but only from the list of nominees prepared by the Judicial and Bar Council. Such appointments do not need the approval of the Commission on Appointments.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 8, sec. 9.</ref>\n\n===Government agencies===\n{{main|Office of the President of the Philippines}}\nSome government agencies report to no specific department but are instead under the Office of the President. These include important agencies such as the [[National Security Council (Philippines)|National Security Council]],  Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]], [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]], Climate Change Commission, Commission on Population, Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]], [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]], Authority of the [[Freeport Area of Bataan]], [[Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority]], and many more.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.pcoo.gov.ph/dir-executiveoffices.htm|title = Agencies/Offices under the Office of the President|date = |accessdate = Jan 6, 2016|website = Presidential Communications Operations Office|publisher = Government of the Philippines|last = |first = }}</ref> The [[Presidential Security Group]], which is composed mostly of members from the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine National Police]], is directly under the Office of the President.\n\n== Election process ==\n\n=== Eligibility ===\nArticle 7, Section 2 of the Constitution reads:\n\"No person may be elected President unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election.\" <ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 2</ref>\nThe Constitution also provides term limits where the president is ineligible for reelection and a person who has succeeded as President and has served as such for more than four years will be ineligible to be elected for a second term. However, with the case of [[Joseph Estrada]] who [[1998 Philippine presidential election|was elected president in 1998]], [[2001 EDSA Revolution|deposed in 2001]], and again [[2010 Philippine presidential election|ran for the presidency in 2010]], the Constitution's wording where \"[the] President shall not be eligible for any re-election\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 4</ref> remains unclear as his case was never brought to the Supreme Court. It remains unclear whether the term limit of no re-election applies only to the incumbent president or for any person who has been elected as President.\n\n=== Election ===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential election}}\n[[File:Home provinces of Philippine Presidents.PNG|thumb|Home [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] (blue and purple) of the presidents.]]\nThe president is elected by direct vote every six years, usually on the second Monday of May.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe returns of every election for President and Vice President, duly certified by the board of canvassers of each province or city, shall be transmitted to Congress, directed to the president of the Senate. Upon receipt of the certificates of canvass, the president of the Senate shall open all the certificates in the presence of a joint public session of Congress not later than 30 days after election day. Congress then canvasses the votes upon determining that the polls are authentic and were done in the manner provided by law.\n\nThe person with the highest number of votes is declared the winner, but in case two or more have the highest number of votes, the president is elected by a majority of all members of both Houses, voting separately on each.\n\n===Inauguration===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential inauguration}}\n{{Further|List of Philippine presidential inaugurations}}\n[[File:Carlos P Garcia second inauguration, 1957.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos P. Garcia]] is sworn in as the 8th president of the Philippines after winning the election of 1957]]\n[[File:Rodrigo Duterte oath taking 6.30.16.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodrigo Duterte]] during his [[Inauguration of Rodrigo Duterte|inauguration]]]]\n\nThe president of the Philippines usually takes the Oath of Office at noon of June 30 following the presidential election\n\nTraditionally, the [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]] takes the oath first, a little before noon. This is for two reasons: first, according to protocol, no one follows the president (who is last due to his supremacy), and second, to establish a constitutionally valid successor before the president-elect accedes. During the [[Manuel L. Quezon|Quezon]] inauguration, however, the vice president and the Legislature were sworn in after the president, to symbolise a new start.\n\nAs soon as the president takes the Oath of Office, a [[21-gun salute]] is fired to salute the new head of state, and the [[honors music|Presidential Anthem]] ''Mabuhay'' is played. The president delivers his inaugural address, and then proceeds to [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] to climb the Grand Staircase, a ritual which symbolises the formal possession of the Palace. The president then inducts the newly formed cabinet into office in one of the state rooms.\n\nCustom has enshrined three places as the traditional venue for the inauguration ceremony: [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos City]], [[Bulacan]]; in front of the old Legislative Building (now part of the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]]) in Manila; or at [[Quirino Grandstand]], where most have been held. In 2004, [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] delivered her pre-inaugural address at Quirino Grandstand, took the Oath of Office in [[Cebu City]] before Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr.]], and the next day held the first cabinet meeting in [[Butuan City]]. She broke with precedent, reasoning that she wanted to celebrate her inauguration in each of the three main island groups of the Philippines: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. Her first inauguration also broke precedent as she was sworn in at the [[EDSA Shrine]] on January 20, 2001, during the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001]] that removed [[Joseph Estrada]] from office.\n\nIn the past, elections were held in November and the president's inauguration was held on December 30 ([[Rizal Day]]). This ensured that when the inauguration was usually held at [[Quirino Grandstand]], the new president could see the [[Rizal Monument]] on the anniversary of his death. [[Ferdinand Marcos]] transferred the dates of both the elections and the inauguration to May and June, respectively, and it remains so to this day.\n\nThe dress code at the modern inaugural ceremony is traditional, formal Filipino clothing, which is otherwise loosely termed ''Filipiniana''. Ladies must wear [[terno]], [[baro't saya]] (the formal wear of other indigenous groups is permissible), while men don the [[Barong Tagalog]]. Non-Filipinos at the ceremony may wear their respective versions of formal dress, but foreign diplomats have often been seen donning ''Filipiniana'' as a mark of cultural respect.\n\n===Oath of Office===\nThe Constitution provides the following oath or affirmation for the president and vice president-elect which must be taken before they enter into office:<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/ Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 5]</ref>\n\n{{quotation|\"I, (name), do solemnly swear [or affirm], that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President [or Vice-President or Acting President] of the Philippines.

The [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], one of the houses of the bicameral Congress, has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment against the president, [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]], members of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], members of the Constitutional Commissions and the [[Philippine Ombudsman|ombudsman]].<ref>Constitution of the Philippines, art. 11, sec. 2</ref> When a third of its membership has endorsed the impeachment articles, it is then transmitted to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] which tries and decide, as impeachment tribunal, the impeachment case.<ref name=\"Article XI\">{{cite web|url= http://www.chanrobles.com/article11.htm|title= The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines \u2013 Article XI|accessdate= July 25, 2008|author= Chan-Robles Virtual Law Library|date= }}</ref> A main difference from US proceedings however is that only a third of House members are required to approve the motion to impeach the president (as opposed to the majority required in the United States). In the Senate, selected members of the House of Representatives act as the prosecutors and the senators act as judges with the Senate president and chief justice of the Supreme Court jointly presiding over the proceedings. Like the United States, to convict the official in question requires that a minimum of two-thirds (i.e., 16 of 24 members) of the senate vote in favour of conviction. If an impeachment attempt is unsuccessful or the official is acquitted, no new cases can be filed against that impeachable official for at least one full year.\n\n=== Impeachable offenses ===\nThe Constitution enumerates the culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, and betrayal of public trust as grounds for the impeachment of the president.<ref>Constitution of the Philippines, art. 11, sec. 2.</ref> The same also applies for the vice president, the members of the Supreme Court, the members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the ombudsman.\n\n=== Impeachment attempts and proceedings ===\n\n==== Joseph Ejercito Estrada ====\nJoseph Ejercito Estrada was the first president to undergo impeachment when the House of Representatives voted to raise the impeachment proceedings to the Senate in 2000. However, the trial ended prematurely where anti-Estrada senators walked out of the impeachment sessions when Estrada's allies in the Senate voted narrowly to block the opening of an envelope which allegedly contained critical evidence on Estrada's wealth. Estrada was later ousted from office when the [[Second EDSA Revolution|2001 EDSA Revolution]] forced him out of the presidential palace and when the Supreme Court confirmed that his leaving the palace was his ''de facto'' resignation from office.\n\n==== Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ====\nSeveral impeachment complaints were filed against Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo but none reached the required endorsement of a third of the House of Representatives.\n\n== Title ==\nThe official title of the Philippine head of state and government is \"President of the Philippines.\"<ref name=\"Const\">{{cite journal|title = 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher = Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|url = http://www.chanrobles.com/article7.htm|accessdate = January 7, 2008|ref = harv}}</ref> The title in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] is ''Pangulo'' ([[cognate]] of [[Malay language|Malay]] ''penghulu'' \"leader\", \"chieftain\").

When the Americans occupied the Philippines, they also used the Palace as an official residence. During the [[Japanese Occupation of the Philippines]], the governmental offices and the presidential residence transferred to Baguio, and the [[The Mansion, Baguio|Mansion House]] was used as the official residence.

On occasion, the wing has also been tasked to provide transportation for other members of government, visiting heads of state, and other state guests.\n\nThe fleet includes: 1 [[Fokker F28]], which is primarily used for the president's domestic trips and it is also called \"Kalayaan One\" when the president is on board, 4 [[Bell 412]] helicopters, 3 [[Sikorsky S-76]] helicopters, 1 [[Sikorsky S-70]]-5 Black Hawk, a number of [[Bell UH-1N]] Twin Hueys, as well as [[Fokker F-27]] ''Friendship''s. For trips outside of the Philippines, the Air Force employs a [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] [[Global Express]] or charters appropriate aircraft from the country's flag carrier, [[Philippine Airlines]]. In 1962, the Air Force chartered aircraft from [[Pan American World Airways]] as the international services of Philippine Airlines were suspended. Pan Am later went defunct in 1991. For short-haul flights, PAL used the [[Boeing 737]] until they were replaced by [[Airbus A320]] and [[Airbus A321]] aircraft. For medium to long-haul flights, the airline's [[Boeing 747-400]]'s were used until their retirement in September 2014. The [[Airbus A330-300]], [[Airbus A350-900]] and [[Boeing 777-300ER]] have since fulfilled these roles. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number '''PR/PAL 001''' and callsign '''PHILIPPINE 001''' is a special plane operated by [[Philippine Airlines]] to transport the president of the Philippines. The president sometimes charter private jets for domestic trips within the Philippines due to some airports in the Philippines having small runways.\n\nA Presidential Helicopter Bell 412 crashed on April 7, 2009, in the mountainous [[Ifugao Province]] north of Manila. On board were eight people, including two Cabinet undersecretaries and several servicemen. The flight was ''en route'' to Ifugao from [[Baguio City]] as an advance party of President Macapagal-Arroyo, when the control tower at the now-defunct [[Loakan Airport]] lost communication with the craft several minutes after takeoff.\n\nThe Arroyo administration planned to buy another aircraft worth of about 1.2&nbsp;billion pesos before her term ended in June 2010,<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/169716/Palace-shops-for-P12-B-jet-10-months-before-Arroyo-exit Palace shops for P1.2-B jet 10 months before Arroyo exit \u2013 Nation \u2013 GMANews.TV \u2013 Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs \u2013 Latest Philippine News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but cancelled the purchase due to other issues.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/169954/malacaang-cancels-plan-to-purchase-p12-b-jet http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/169954/news/nation/malaca-ang-cancels-plan-to-purchase-p1-2-b-jet], GMA News.</ref>\n\n=== Water transport ===\n{{Main|BRP Ang Pangulo (AT-25)}}\n'''''[[BRP Ang Pangulo (AT-25)|BRP Ang Pangulo]]''''' ('''BRP''' stands for ''Bark\u00f3 ng Rep\u00fablika ng Pilipinas'', \"Ship of the Republic of the Philippines\"; \"''Ang Pangulo''\" is Filipino for \"the president\") was commissioned by the [[Philippine Navy]] on March 7, 1959.

During his tenure, the [[Nacionalista Party]] urged him to run for president in 1953. He declined, working instead for the successful election of [[Ramon Magsaysay]], who subsequently appointed Laurel to head a diplomatic mission that was tasked with negotiating trade and other issues with United States officials, resulting in the [[Laurel-Langley Agreement]].

Quezon]] was elected the first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], which had been established, still under United States sovereignty, under a [[Constitution of the Philippines#Commonwealth and Third Republic (1935)|constitution]] ratified on 14 May of that year. During its first five years, the president could serve for an unrenewable six-year term. It was later amended in 1940 to limit a president to serving no more than two four-year terms. When President Quezon exiled himself to the United States after the Philippines fell to the [[Empire of Japan]] in [[World War II in the Philippines|World War II]], he appointed [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]] as Acting President and as Acting Commander-in Chief of the Armed Forces. Abad Santos was subsequently executed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] on May 2, 1942.\n\n=== The Second Republic under the Japanese ===\nOn October 14, 1943, [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] became President under [[Constitution of the Philippines#Second Republic (1943)|a constitution imposed]] by the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]]. Laurel, an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], had been instructed to remain in the City of Manila by President Quezon, who withdrew to [[Corregidor]] and then to the United States to establish a [[government in exile]] in the United States. The General Headquarters and Military Camp Base of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] was a military station are moved in the province.\n\nAfter the combined American and Filipino forces liberated the islands in 1945, Laurel officially dissolved the republic on August 17, 1945.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nThe 1935 Constitution was restored after the Japanese surrender ended World War II, with Vice President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] becoming President due to Quezon's death on August 1, 1944. It remained in effect after the United States recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines as a separate self-governing nation on July 4, 1946.\n\n=== 1973 Constitution ===\nA new [[Constitution of the Philippines#The New Society and the Fourth Republic (1973)|Constitution]] ratified on January 17, 1973 under the rule of [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] introduced a parliamentary-style government. Marcos instituted himself as [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] while serving as President in 1978. He later appointed [[Cesar Virata|C\u00e9sar Virata]] as Prime Minister in 1981.\n\nThis Constitution was in effect until the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 toppled Marcos's 21-year authoritarian regime and replaced him with [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]].\n\n===Fifth Republic===\nRuling by decree during the early part of her tenure and as a president installed by revolutionary means, President Corazon Aquino issued [[Constitution of the Philippines|Proclamation No. 3]] on March 25, 1986 which abrogated many of the provisions of the then 1973 Constitution, including the provisions associated with the Marcos regime which gave the president legislative powers, as well as the unicameral legislature called the Batasang Pambansa (literally ''National Legislature'' in Filipino). Often called the \"Freedom Constitution,\" the proclamation retained only parts of the 1973 Constitution that were essential for a return to democratic rule, such as the bill of rights. This constitution was superseded on February 2, 1987 by the present constitution.\n\n=== Other issues ===\nBoth Bonifacio and Aguinaldo might be considered to have been an inaugural president of an insurgent government. Quezon was the inaugural president of a predecessor state to the current one, while Aquino, ''m\u00e8re'', was the inaugural president of the currently-constituted government.\n\nThe government considers Aguinaldo to have been the first president of the Philippines, followed by Quezon and his successors.<ref name=tucker2009p8>{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C. |title=The encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars: a political, social, and military history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-951-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&pg=PA8 8]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200029&Itemid=26|title=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Despite the differences in [[Constitution of the Philippines|constitutions]] and government, the line of presidents is considered to be continuous. For instance, the current president, Rodrigo R. Duterte, is considered to be the 16th president.\n\nWhile the government may consider Aguinaldo as the first president, the First Republic fell under the United States' jurisdiction due to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]; the United States thus does not consider his tenure to have been legitimate.<ref name=tucker2009p8 /><ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/aguinaldo.html Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy], U.S. Library of Congress.</ref> [[Manuel L. Quezon]] is considered to be the first president by the United States.  He is also the first to win a popular election and a nationwide election.\n\n==== Laurel's position ====\n[[File:Jose P. Laurel giving a speech.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] giving a speech after his inauguration as President of the [[Second Philippine Republic]]]]\nAs with many other [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-occupied countries in the Second World War, the Philippines had at one point two presidents heading two governments. One was Quezon and the Commonwealth [[Government in exile|government-in-exile]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the other was Manila-based Laurel heading the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic. Notably, Laurel was himself instructed to remain in Manila by President Quezon.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Laurel was not formally recognized as a president until the rule of [[Diosdado Macapagal]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=some reliable source reporting that recognition should be easy to find}} His inclusion in the official list coincided with the transfer of the official date of Independence Day from July 4 (the anniversary of the Philippines' independence from the United States) to June 12 (the anniversary of the 1898 Declaration of Independence).\n\nThe inclusion of Laurel thus causes some problems in determining the order of presidents. It is inaccurate to call Laurel the successor of Osme\u00f1a or vice versa, since Laurel's Second Republic was formally repudiated after World War II, its actions not considered legal or binding. Quezon, Osme\u00f1a, and Roxas were seen as being in a contiguous line according to the 1935 Constitution, while Laurel was the only president of the Second Republic, which had a separate charter. Thus, Laurel had neither predecessor nor successor, while Osme\u00f1a succeeded Quezon after the latter's death, and was in turn succeeded by Roxas as President of the Third Republic.\n\n==Powers and roles==\n\n===Chief Executive===\nThe president of the Philippines, being the chief executive, serves as both the head of state and head of government of the Philippines.

However, with the case of [[Joseph Estrada]] who [[1998 Philippine presidential election|was elected president in 1998]], [[2001 EDSA Revolution|deposed in 2001]], and again [[2010 Philippine presidential election|ran for the presidency in 2010]], the Constitution's wording where \"[the] President shall not be eligible for any re-election\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 4</ref> remains unclear as his case was never brought to the Supreme Court. It remains unclear whether the term limit of no re-election applies only to the incumbent president or for any person who has been elected as President.\n\n=== Election ===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential election}}\n[[File:Home provinces of Philippine Presidents.PNG|thumb|Home [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] (blue and purple) of the presidents.]]\nThe president is elected by direct vote every six years, usually on the second Monday of May.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe returns of every election for President and Vice President, duly certified by the board of canvassers of each province or city, shall be transmitted to Congress, directed to the president of the Senate. Upon receipt of the certificates of canvass, the president of the Senate shall open all the certificates in the presence of a joint public session of Congress not later than 30 days after election day. Congress then canvasses the votes upon determining that the polls are authentic and were done in the manner provided by law.\n\nThe person with the highest number of votes is declared the winner, but in case two or more have the highest number of votes, the president is elected by a majority of all members of both Houses, voting separately on each.\n\n===Inauguration===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential inauguration}}\n{{Further|List of Philippine presidential inaugurations}}\n[[File:Carlos P Garcia second inauguration, 1957.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos P. Garcia]] is sworn in as the 8th president of the Philippines after winning the election of 1957]]\n[[File:Rodrigo Duterte oath taking 6.30.16.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodrigo Duterte]] during his [[Inauguration of Rodrigo Duterte|inauguration]]]]\n\nThe president of the Philippines usually takes the Oath of Office at noon of June 30 following the presidential election\n\nTraditionally, the [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]] takes the oath first, a little before noon. This is for two reasons: first, according to protocol, no one follows the president (who is last due to his supremacy), and second, to establish a constitutionally valid successor before the president-elect accedes. During the [[Manuel L. Quezon|Quezon]] inauguration, however, the vice president and the Legislature were sworn in after the president, to symbolise a new start.\n\nAs soon as the president takes the Oath of Office, a [[21-gun salute]] is fired to salute the new head of state, and the [[honors music|Presidential Anthem]] ''Mabuhay'' is played. The president delivers his inaugural address, and then proceeds to [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] to climb the Grand Staircase, a ritual which symbolises the formal possession of the Palace. The president then inducts the newly formed cabinet into office in one of the state rooms.\n\nCustom has enshrined three places as the traditional venue for the inauguration ceremony: [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos City]], [[Bulacan]]; in front of the old Legislative Building (now part of the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]]) in Manila; or at [[Quirino Grandstand]], where most have been held. In 2004, [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] delivered her pre-inaugural address at Quirino Grandstand, took the Oath of Office in [[Cebu City]] before Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr.]], and the next day held the first cabinet meeting in [[Butuan City]]. She broke with precedent, reasoning that she wanted to celebrate her inauguration in each of the three main island groups of the Philippines: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. Her first inauguration also broke precedent as she was sworn in at the [[EDSA Shrine]] on January 20, 2001, during the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001]] that removed [[Joseph Estrada]] from office.\n\nIn the past, elections were held in November and the president's inauguration was held on December 30 ([[Rizal Day]]). This ensured that when the inauguration was usually held at [[Quirino Grandstand]], the new president could see the [[Rizal Monument]] on the anniversary of his death. [[Ferdinand Marcos]] transferred the dates of both the elections and the inauguration to May and June, respectively, and it remains so to this day.\n\nThe dress code at the modern inaugural ceremony is traditional, formal Filipino clothing, which is otherwise loosely termed ''Filipiniana''. Ladies must wear [[terno]], [[baro't saya]] (the formal wear of other indigenous groups is permissible), while men don the [[Barong Tagalog]]. Non-Filipinos at the ceremony may wear their respective versions of formal dress, but foreign diplomats have often been seen donning ''Filipiniana'' as a mark of cultural respect.\n\n===Oath of Office===\nThe Constitution provides the following oath or affirmation for the president and vice president-elect which must be taken before they enter into office:<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/ Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 5]</ref>\n\n{{quotation|\"I, (name), do solemnly swear [or affirm], that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President [or Vice-President or Acting President] of the Philippines.

In the Senate, selected members of the House of Representatives act as the prosecutors and the senators act as judges with the Senate president and chief justice of the Supreme Court jointly presiding over the proceedings. Like the United States, to convict the official in question requires that a minimum of two-thirds (i.e., 16 of 24 members) of the senate vote in favour of conviction. If an impeachment attempt is unsuccessful or the official is acquitted, no new cases can be filed against that impeachable official for at least one full year.\n\n=== Impeachable offenses ===\nThe Constitution enumerates the culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, and betrayal of public trust as grounds for the impeachment of the president.<ref>Constitution of the Philippines, art. 11, sec. 2.</ref> The same also applies for the vice president, the members of the Supreme Court, the members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the ombudsman.\n\n=== Impeachment attempts and proceedings ===\n\n==== Joseph Ejercito Estrada ====\nJoseph Ejercito Estrada was the first president to undergo impeachment when the House of Representatives voted to raise the impeachment proceedings to the Senate in 2000. However, the trial ended prematurely where anti-Estrada senators walked out of the impeachment sessions when Estrada's allies in the Senate voted narrowly to block the opening of an envelope which allegedly contained critical evidence on Estrada's wealth. Estrada was later ousted from office when the [[Second EDSA Revolution|2001 EDSA Revolution]] forced him out of the presidential palace and when the Supreme Court confirmed that his leaving the palace was his ''de facto'' resignation from office.\n\n==== Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ====\nSeveral impeachment complaints were filed against Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo but none reached the required endorsement of a third of the House of Representatives.\n\n== Title ==\nThe official title of the Philippine head of state and government is \"President of the Philippines.\"<ref name=\"Const\">{{cite journal|title = 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher = Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|url = http://www.chanrobles.com/article7.htm|accessdate = January 7, 2008|ref = harv}}</ref> The title in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] is ''Pangulo'' ([[cognate]] of [[Malay language|Malay]] ''penghulu'' \"leader\", \"chieftain\").

However, after an earthquake in 1863, the Palacio del Gobernador was destroyed, and the residence and office of the Governor-General transferred to Malaca\u00f1ang Palace. During the [[Philippine Revolution]], President Aguinaldo resided in his own home in [[Kawit, Cavite]]. After his defeat in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], Aguinaldo transferred the [[Capital of the Philippines]] to different areas while he struggled in the pursuit of American Forces. When the Americans occupied the Philippines, they also used the Palace as an official residence. During the [[Japanese Occupation of the Philippines]], the governmental offices and the presidential residence transferred to Baguio, and the [[The Mansion, Baguio|Mansion House]] was used as the official residence. Meanwhile, President Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth resided in the [[Omni Shoreham Hotel]] in Washington D.C.

For trips outside of the Philippines, the Air Force employs a [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] [[Global Express]] or charters appropriate aircraft from the country's flag carrier, [[Philippine Airlines]]. In 1962, the Air Force chartered aircraft from [[Pan American World Airways]] as the international services of Philippine Airlines were suspended. Pan Am later went defunct in 1991. For short-haul flights, PAL used the [[Boeing 737]] until they were replaced by [[Airbus A320]] and [[Airbus A321]] aircraft. For medium to long-haul flights, the airline's [[Boeing 747-400]]'s were used until their retirement in September 2014. The [[Airbus A330-300]], [[Airbus A350-900]] and [[Boeing 777-300ER]] have since fulfilled these roles. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number '''PR/PAL 001''' and callsign '''PHILIPPINE 001''' is a special plane operated by [[Philippine Airlines]] to transport the president of the Philippines.

During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and the [[Psalms]].\n\n=== Apprenticeship to Basire ===\n[[File:William Blake - Sconfitta - Frontispiece to The Song of Los.jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work.

The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]\n\nOn 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of \u00a352.10, for a term of seven years.<ref name=bent /> At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.<ref>43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.</ref> This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.<ref>Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.</ref> It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.\n\nAfter two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that \"...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour\".<ref>44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd</ref> This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the \"living form\") left clear traces in his style.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=5|edition=3rd}}</ref> In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey.

There, he rebelled against what he regarded as the unfinished style of fashionable painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], championed by the school's first president, [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\".<ref>E691.

Blake was reportedly in the front rank of the mob during the attack. The riots, in response to a parliamentary bill revoking sanctions against Roman Catholicism, became known as the [[Gordon Riots]] and provoked a flurry of legislation from the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and the creation of the first police force.\n\n[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|left|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' (1786)]]\n\n=== Marriage and early career ===\nBlake met [[Catherine Blake|Catherine Boucher]] in 1782 when he was recovering from a relationship that had culminated in a refusal of his marriage proposal. He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, \"Do you pity me?\" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, \"Then I love you.\" Blake married Catherine \u2013 who was five years his junior \u2013 on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]]. Illiterate, Catherine signed her wedding contract with an X.

Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.\n\nBlake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.<ref>Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}</ref> After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96</ref> Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],<ref>[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.</ref> early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.\n\nBlake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}</ref> The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}</ref> There is a series of 70 mosaics commemorating Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets | quote = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake's illuminated books, ''The Songs of Innocence and Experience'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and the [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Relief etching ===\nIn 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscript]]s. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).\n\nThis is a reversal of the usual method of etching<!--same article as relief etching-->, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as \"[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]\" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.<ref>Viscomi, J.

Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as \"[[repoussage]]\", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.<ref>Sung, Mei-Ying.

That is how he rationalizes the Book's unusual ending, but notes that he is speculating.<ref>Damon, Samuel Foster (1988). A Blake Dictionary</ref>\n\n=== Felpham ===\nIn 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\", which became the words for the anthem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]\". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with \"the meer drudgery of business\" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that \"Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\".

Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.<ref>Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77</ref> It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]\n\nAlso around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot\".<ref>Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750\u20131850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper & Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].<ref>Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366\u2013367</ref> A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757\u20131827) & LINNELL, JOHN (1792\u20131882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.\n\nIn later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to [[Thomas Butts]], a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.\n\n==== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ====\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12\u201328, The Minotaur XII]]\n[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|\"Head of William Blake\" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]\nThe commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:\n\n:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.<ref>Bindman, David. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106</ref>\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'']]\nBlake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.\n\nBecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, \"Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost.\" Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).\n\nAt the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially.

Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, \"Stay Kate! Keep just as you are \u2013 I will draw your portrait \u2013 for you have ever been an angel to me.\" Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.<ref>Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389</ref> At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing \"[[free love]]\" have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.<ref>Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228</ref> A more recent study, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary [[William Godwin]] as [[Precursors to anarchism|forerunners of modern anarchism]].<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised|isbn=0-900384-77-8}}</ref> British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[E. P. Thompson]]'s last finished work, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), shows how far he was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n== Development of his views ==\n[[File:Blake God Blessing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''God blessing the seventh day'', 1805 [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]]]\nBecause Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.\n\nThe earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the \"Devil\" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.\n\nPsychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the \"Bible of Hell\" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem, ''Jerusalem'', she writes: \"The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.\"<ref>''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.</ref>\n\n[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a \"sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason\", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found \"mutual understanding\" and \"mutual forgiveness\".<ref>''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[The Ancient of Days|Ancient of Days]]'', 1794.

His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:\n* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.\n* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,\nHe'd have done anything to please us:\nGone sneaking into Synagogues\nAnd not us'd the Elders & Priests like Dogs,\nBut humble as a Lamb or Ass,\nObey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].\nGod wants not Man to Humble himself (55\u201361, E519\u201320)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nFor Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: \"All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.\" (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)\n\nBlake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including \"Urizen\", \"Enitharmon\", \"Bromion\" and \"Luvah\". His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology,<ref>\"a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology\"; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.</ref><ref>\"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own.\"; Fry, Northrop. \"Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake\". 1947, p 11.</ref> and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#eee; color:black; width:23em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Man's.\nI will not Reason & Compare; my business is to Create.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Words uttered by Los in Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.\n|}\n\nOne of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:\n\n{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings. The Treasures of Heaven are not Negations of Passion but Realities of Intellect from which All the Passions Emanate Uncurbed in their Eternal Glory.

Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that calld Body is a portion of Soul discernd by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age.\n:2.

Watercolour on wood.]]\nBlake does not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul, but sees the body as an extension of the soul, derived from the \"discernment\" of the senses. Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul. Elsewhere, he describes Satan as the \"state of error\", and as beyond salvation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Damon |first=Samuel Foster |title=A Blake Dictionary (Revised Edition) |year=1988 |publisher=Brown University Press |page=358 |isbn=0-87451-436-3 }}</ref>\n\nBlake opposed the [[Sophism|sophistry]] of [[theology|theological]] thought that excuses pain, admits evil and apologises for injustice.

Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century \"free love\" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was \"legal prostitution\" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women \u2013 H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427105337/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).\n\nBlake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E.

Dutton & Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}</ref> His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".<ref>Swinburne p. 260</ref> Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.<ref>Swinburne, p. 249.</ref> Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.<ref>Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,<ref>Berger pp. 188\u2013190</ref> the former being the true measure of purity.<ref>Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.</ref> Irene Langridge notes that \"in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.\"<ref>''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.</ref> Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.<ref>Davis, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human \"[[Fall of man|fallenness]]\". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.<ref>Berger, p. 142.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that Blake's views on \"free love\" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying \"Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?\"<ref>Quoted by Ankarsj\u00f6 on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsj\u00f6 thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,<ref>''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 129.</ref> since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.<ref>Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 64</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.<ref>David Worrall, \"Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject\", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17\u201329.</ref>\n\nBlake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of \"self-denial\", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.<ref>See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.</ref> Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,<ref>Berger, pp. 112, 284</ref> and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Creative mindset ===\n[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake \"himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments\".<ref name=\"fearfulsymmetry\">[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Blake after John Gabriel Stedman Narrative of a Five Years copy 2 object 2-detail.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's \"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows\", an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J. G. Stedman's]] ''Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam'' (1796)]]\nBlake abhorred slavery<ref>Parker, Lisa Karee, \"A World of Our Own: William Blake and Abolition.\" Thesis, Georgia State University, 2006.\n[http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/english_theses/16 online] (pdf, 11&nbsp;MB)</ref> and believed in racial and sexual equality. Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns \"to bear the beams of love\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy:\nIll shade him from the heat till he can bear,\nTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.\nAnd then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nBlake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.\n\n=== Visions ===\nFrom a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.<ref name=bent78>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36\u20137.</ref> At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\"<ref name=bent78 /> According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.<ref>A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\". Ackroyd, Peter (1995). Blake. London: Sinclair-Stevenson. p. 21-2, {{ISBN|1-85619-278-4}}.</ref> On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.<ref name=bent78 />\n\n[[File:William Blake 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Ghost of a Flea]]'', 1819\u20131820. Having informed painter-astrologer [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]] of his visions of apparitions, Blake was subsequently persuaded to paint one of them.<ref name=langr>Langridge, Irene. ''William Blake: A Study of His Life and Art Work''. 1904, pp. 48\u20139.</ref> Varley's anecdote of Blake and his vision of the flea's ghost became well-known.<ref name=langr />]]\n\nBlake claimed to experience visions throughout his life. They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by [[Archangel]]s to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In a letter of condolence to [[William Hayley]], dated 6 May 1800, four days after the death of Hayley's son,<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Haley, ESQ Vol II |last=Johnson |first=John |year=1823 |publisher=S. and R. Bentley, Dorset-Street |location=London |isbn= |page=506 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vm8ao7Qks8C&pg=PA506&lpg=PA506 }}</ref> Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|I know that our deceased friends are more really with us than when they were apparent to our mortal part. Thirteen years ago I lost a brother, and with his spirit I converse daily and hourly in the spirit, and see him in my remembrance, in the region of my imagination. I hear his advice, and even now write from his dictate.}}\n\nIn a letter to John Flaxman, dated 21 September 1800, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|[The town of] Felpham is a sweet place for Study, because it is more spiritual than London. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden Gates; her windows are not obstructed by vapours; voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly heard, & their forms more distinctly seen; & my Cottage is also a Shadow of their houses. My Wife & Sister are both well, courting Neptune for an embrace... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain are studies & Chambers filled with books & pictures of old, which I wrote & painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; & those works are the delight & Study of Archangels. (E710)}}\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, & that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams & prophecy & speak Parables unobserv'd & at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}\n\nIn ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up & then & not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation & that to me it is hindrance & not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me. What it will be Questiond When the Sun rises do you not see a round Disk of fire somewhat like a Guinea O no no I see an Innumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty I question not my Corporeal or Vegetative Eye any more than I would Question a Window concerning a Sight I look thro it & not with it. (E565-6)}}\n\nDespite seeing angels and God, Blake has also claimed to see Satan on the staircase of his South Molton Street home in London.<ref name=\"flavorwire1\" />\n\nAware of Blake's visions, [[William Wordsworth]] commented, \"There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]].\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Blake's vision on show | author=John Ezard | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1254856,00.html#article_continue |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=6 July 2004 | accessdate=24 March 2008}}</ref> In a more deferential vein, John William Cousins wrote in ''A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature'' that Blake was \"a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few\", who \"led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations\".<ref>{{cite book |title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English literature |last= Cousin |first=John William |year=1933 |publisher=Plain Label Books |isbn=978-1-60303-696-2 |page=81 |url= }}</ref> Blake's sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']], whose entry on Blake comments that \"the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence\".\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n{{Main|William Blake in popular culture}}\n[[File:William Blake3.jpg|thumb|left|William Blake's portrait in profile, by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]. This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]\nBlake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley Jr.\n\nWhile Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,<ref>Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.</ref> while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.</ref> His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work \"[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]\") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.\n\nMany such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: \"Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.\"<ref>Jung and William Blake.

Largely unrecognised during his lifetime, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in the history of the [[Romantic poetry|poetry]] and visual arts of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]]. What he called his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic works]] were said by 20th-century critic [[Northrop Frye]] to form \"what is in proportion to its merits the least read body of poetry in the English language\".<ref>Frye, Northrop and Denham, Robert D.

Within these drawings Blake found his first exposure to classical forms through the work of [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. The number of prints and bound books that James and Catherine were able to purchase for young William suggests that the Blakes enjoyed, at least for a time, a comfortable wealth.<ref name=\"The Stranger From Paradise 2001\" /> When William was ten years old, his parents knew enough of his headstrong temperament that he was not sent to school but instead enrolled in drawing classes at Pars's drawing school in [[Strand, London|the Strand]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=3|edition=3rd}}</ref> He read avidly on subjects of his own choosing. During this period, Blake made explorations into poetry; his early work displays knowledge of [[Ben Jonson]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and the [[Psalms]].\n\n=== Apprenticeship to Basire ===\n[[File:William Blake - Sconfitta - Frontispiece to The Song of Los.jpg|thumb|right|The archetype of the Creator is a familiar image in Blake's work. Here, the [[demiurge|demiurgic]] figure [[Urizen]] prays before the world he has forged. The ''[[The Song of Los|Song of Los]]'' is the third in a series of [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated books]] painted by Blake and his wife, collectively known as the ''[[Continental Prophecies]]''.]]\n\nOn 4 August 1772, Blake was apprenticed to [[engraver]] [[James Basire]] of [[Great Queen Street]], at the sum of \u00a352.10, for a term of seven years.<ref name=bent /> At the end of the term, aged 21, he became a professional engraver. No record survives of any serious disagreement or conflict between the two during the period of Blake's apprenticeship, but [[Peter Ackroyd]]'s biography notes that Blake later added Basire's name to a list of artistic adversaries \u2013 and then crossed it out.<ref>43, ''Blake'', Peter Ackroyd, [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995.</ref> This aside, Basire's style of line-engraving was of a kind held at the time to be old-fashioned compared to the flashier [[stipple]] or [[mezzotint]] styles.<ref>Blake, William. ''The Poems of William Blake''. 1893, p. xix.</ref> It has been speculated that Blake's instruction in this outmoded form may have been detrimental to his acquiring of work or recognition in later life.\n\nAfter two years, Basire sent his apprentice to copy images from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches in London (perhaps to settle a quarrel between Blake and James Parker, his fellow apprentice). His experiences in [[Westminster Abbey]] helped form his artistic style and ideas. The Abbey of his day was decorated with suits of armour, painted funeral effigies and varicoloured waxworks. Ackroyd notes that \"...the most immediate [impression] would have been of faded brightness and colour\".<ref>44, ''Blake'', Ackroyd</ref> This close study of the Gothic (which he saw as the \"living form\") left clear traces in his style.<ref name=\"The Life of William Blake\">{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Mona|title=The Life of William Blake|date=1978|publisher=Granada Publishing Limited|location=London|isbn=0-586-08297-2|page=5|edition=3rd}}</ref> In the long afternoons Blake spent sketching in the Abbey, he was occasionally interrupted by boys from [[Westminster School]], who were allowed in the Abbey. They teased him and one tormented him so much that Blake knocked the boy off a scaffold to the ground, \"upon which he fell with terrific Violence\".<ref>Blake, William and Tatham, Frederick.

Over time, Blake came to detest Reynolds' attitude towards art, especially his pursuit of \"general truth\" and \"general beauty\". Reynolds wrote in his ''Discourses'' that the \"disposition to abstractions, to generalising and classification, is the great glory of the human mind\"; Blake responded, in marginalia to his personal copy, that \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot; To Particularize is the Alone Distinction of Merit\".<ref>E691.

He recounted the story of his heartbreak for Catherine and her parents, after which he asked Catherine, \"Do you pity me?\" When she responded affirmatively, he declared, \"Then I love you.\" Blake married Catherine \u2013 who was five years his junior \u2013 on 18 August 1782 in [[St Mary's Church, Battersea]].

Throughout his life she proved an invaluable aid, helping to print his [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated works]] and maintaining his spirits throughout numerous misfortunes.\n\nBlake's first collection of poems, ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', was printed around 1783.<ref>Reproduction of 1783 edition: Tate Publishing, London, {{ISBN|978-1-85437-768-5}}</ref> After his father's death, Blake and former fellow apprentice James Parker opened a print shop in 1784, and began working with radical publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]].<ref>Ackroyd, Peter, ''Blake'', Sinclair-Stevenson, 1995, p. 96</ref> Johnson's house was a meeting-place for some leading English intellectual dissidents of the time: theologian and scientist [[Joseph Priestley]], philosopher [[Richard Price]], artist [[John Henry Fuseli]],<ref>[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Henry-Fuseli-William-Blake.html Biographies of William Blake and Henry Fuseli], retrieved on 31 May 2007.</ref> early feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] and English revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]]. Along with [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Godwin]], Blake had great hopes for the French and American revolutions and wore a [[Phrygian cap]] in solidarity with the French revolutionaries, but despaired with the rise of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] in France. In 1784 Blake composed his unfinished manuscript ''[[An Island in the Moon]]''.\n\nBlake illustrated ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (2nd edition, 1791) by Mary Wollstonecraft. They seem to have shared some views on sexual equality and the institution of marriage, but there is no evidence proving that they met. In 1793's ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'', Blake condemned the cruel absurdity of enforced chastity and marriage without love and defended the right of women to complete self-fulfilment.\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, William Blake lived in North [[Lambeth]], London, at 13 Hercules Buildings, [[Hercules Road]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakesociety.org/about-blake/blake-london/| title =Blake's Residencies | website = William Blake Society}}</ref> The property was demolished in 1918, but the site is now marked with a plaque.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://openplaques.org/plaques/8357| title =Blake Hercules Road | website = Open Plaques}}</ref> There is a series of 70 mosaics commemorating Blake in the nearby railway tunnels of [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo Station]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | title = William Blake | website = South Bank Mosaic Project | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821043757/http://www.southbankmosaics.com/projects/blakes-lambeth/ | archivedate = 21 August 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8081000/8081271.stm | title = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets | quote = Putting Blake back on Lambeth's streets |date=9 June 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> The mosaics largely reproduce illustrations from Blake's illuminated books, ''The Songs of Innocence and Experience'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', and the [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Relief etching ===\nIn 1788, aged 31, Blake experimented with [[relief etching]], a method he used to produce most of his books, paintings, pamphlets and poems. The process is also referred to as illuminated printing, and the finished products as illuminated books or prints. Illuminated printing involved writing the text of the poems on copper plates with pens and brushes, using an acid-resistant medium. Illustrations could appear alongside words in the manner of earlier [[illuminated manuscript]]s. He then etched the plates in acid to dissolve the untreated copper and leave the design standing in relief (hence the name).\n\nThis is a reversal of the usual method of etching<!--same article as relief etching-->, where the lines of the design are exposed to the acid, and the plate printed by the [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method. Relief etching (which Blake referred to as \"[[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]]\" in ''The Ghost of Abel'') was intended as a means for producing his illuminated books more quickly than via intaglio. Stereotype, a process invented in 1725, consisted of making a metal cast from a wood engraving, but Blake's innovation was, as described above, very different. The pages printed from these plates were hand-coloured in [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] and stitched together to form a volume. Blake used illuminated printing for most of his well-known works, including ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'', ''[[The Book of Thel]]'', ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion|Jerusalem]]''.<ref>Viscomi, J.

Most critical work has concentrated on Blake's relief etching as a technique because it is the most innovative aspect of his art, but a 2009 study drew attention to Blake's surviving plates, including those for the Book of Job: they demonstrate that he made frequent use of a technique known as \"[[repoussage]]\", a means of obliterating mistakes by hammering them out by hitting the back of the plate. Such techniques, typical of engraving work of the time, are very different to the much faster and fluid way of drawing on a plate that Blake employed for his relief etching, and indicates why the engravings took so long to complete.<ref>Sung, Mei-Ying.

That is how he rationalizes the Book's unusual ending, but notes that he is speculating.<ref>Damon, Samuel Foster (1988). A Blake Dictionary</ref>\n\n=== Felpham ===\nIn 1800, Blake moved to a cottage at [[Felpham]], in Sussex (now [[West Sussex]]), to take up a job illustrating the works of [[William Hayley]], a minor poet. It was in this cottage that Blake began ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books|Milton]]'' (the title page is dated 1804, but Blake continued to work on it until 1808). The preface to this work includes a poem beginning \"[[And did those feet in ancient time]]\", which became the words for the anthem \"[[And did those feet in ancient time#Use as an anthem|Jerusalem]]\". Over time, Blake began to resent his new patron, believing that Hayley was uninterested in true artistry, and preoccupied with \"the meer drudgery of business\" (E724). Blake's disenchantment with Hayley has been speculated to have influenced ''Milton: a Poem'', in which Blake wrote that \"Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\".

Having conceived the idea of portraying the characters in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', Blake approached the dealer [[Robert Cromek]], with a view to marketing an engraving. Knowing Blake was too eccentric to produce a popular work, Cromek promptly commissioned Blake's friend Thomas Stothard to execute the concept. When Blake learned he had been cheated, he broke off contact with Stothard. He set up an independent exhibition in his brother's [[haberdashery]] shop at 27 Broad Street in [[Soho]]. The exhibition was designed to market his own version of the Canterbury illustration (titled ''The Canterbury Pilgrims''), along with other works. As a result, he wrote his ''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'' (1809), which contains what [[Anthony Blunt]] called a \"brilliant analysis\" of Chaucer and is regularly anthologised as a classic of Chaucer criticism.<ref>Blunt, Anthony, ''The Art of William Blake'', p 77</ref> It also contained detailed explanations of his other paintings. The exhibition was very poorly attended, selling none of the temperas or watercolours. Its only review, in ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', was hostile.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, \"Genius spurned: Blake's doomed exhibition is back\", ''The Times Saturday Review'', 4 April 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blake 003.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with Sun'' (1805) is [[The Great Red Dragon Paintings|one of a series of illustrations]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12.]]\n\nAlso around this time (circa 1808), Blake gave vigorous expression of his views on art in an extensive series of polemical annotations to the ''Discourses'' of [[Joshua Reynolds|Sir Joshua Reynolds]], denouncing the [[Royal Academy]] as a fraud and proclaiming, \"To Generalize is to be an Idiot\".<ref>Lorenz Eitner, ed., ''Neoclassicism and Romanticism, 1750\u20131850: An Anthology of Sources and Documents'' (New York: Harper & Row/Icon Editions, 1989), p. 121.</ref>\n\nIn 1818, he was introduced by George Cumberland's son to a young artist named [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]].<ref>Bentley, G.E., ''The Stranger from Paradise'', Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 366\u2013367</ref> A [[blue plaque]] commemorates Blake and Linnell at Old Wyldes' at North End, Hampstead.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/blake-william-1757-1827|title=BLAKE, WILLIAM (1757\u20131827) & LINNELL, JOHN (1792\u20131882)|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> Through Linnell he met [[Samuel Palmer]], who belonged to a group of artists who called themselves the [[Ancients (art group)|Shoreham Ancients]]. The group shared Blake's rejection of modern trends and his belief in a spiritual and artistic New Age. Aged 65, Blake began work on [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|illustrations]] for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', later admired by [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]], who compared Blake favourably to [[Rembrandt]], and by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]], who based his ballet ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'' on a selection of the illustrations.\n\nIn later life Blake began to sell a great number of his works, particularly his Bible illustrations, to [[Thomas Butts]], a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this was typical of the opinions held of Blake throughout his life.\n\n==== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ====\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell XII.jpg|thumb|William Blake's image of the [[Minotaur]] to illustrate ''Inferno'', Canto XII,12\u201328, The Minotaur XII]]\n[[File:James S De Ville 1776-1846 Head of William Blake - Plaster cast - Sept 1823 Fitzwilliam Museum2.jpg|thumb|\"Head of William Blake\" by [[James De Ville]]. Life mask taken in plaster cast in September 1823, [[Fitzwilliam Museum]].]]\nThe commission for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' came to Blake in 1826 through Linnell, with the aim of producing a series of engravings. Blake's death in 1827 cut short the enterprise, and only a handful of watercolours were completed, with only seven of the engravings arriving at proof form. Even so, they have earned praise:\n\n:'[T]he Dante watercolours are among Blake's richest achievements, engaging fully with the problem of illustrating a poem of this complexity. The mastery of watercolour has reached an even higher level than before, and is used to extraordinary effect in differentiating the atmosphere of the three states of being in the poem'.<ref>Bindman, David. \"Blake as a Painter\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to William Blake'', Morris Eaves (ed.), Cambridge, 2003, p. 106</ref>\n[[File:Blake Dante Hell V.jpg|thumb|left|Blake's ''The Lovers' Whirlwind'' illustrates Hell in Canto V of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'']]\nBlake's illustrations of the poem are not merely accompanying works, but rather seem to critically revise, or furnish commentary on, certain spiritual or moral aspects of the text.\n\nBecause the project was never completed, Blake's intent may be obscured. Some indicators bolster the impression that Blake's illustrations in their totality would take issue with the text they accompany: In the margin of ''[[Homer]] Bearing the Sword and His Companions'', Blake notes, \"Every thing in Dantes Comedia shews That for Tyrannical Purposes he has made This World the Foundation of All & the Goddess Nature & not the Holy Ghost.\" Blake seems to dissent from Dante's admiration of the poetic works of [[ancient Greece]], and from the apparent glee with which Dante allots punishments in Hell (as evidenced by the grim humour of the [[canto]]s).\n\nAt the same time, Blake shared Dante's distrust of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished the opportunity to represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as he seemed to be near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''; he is said to have spent one of the very last [[shilling]]s he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.<ref>''Blake Records'', p. 341</ref>\n\n==== Death ====\n[[File:Finsbury bunhill blake 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Headstone in [[Bunhill Fields]], London, erected on Blake's grave in 1927 and moved to its present location in 1964\u201365]]\n[[File:Bunhill Blake 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ledger stone]] on Blake's grave, unveiled in 2018]]\n\nBlake's last years were spent at Fountain Court off the [[Strand, London|Strand]] (the property was demolished in the 1880s, when the [[Savoy Hotel]] was built).<ref name=\"death\" /> On the day of his death (12 August 1827), Blake worked relentlessly on his Dante series. Eventually, it is reported, he ceased working and turned to his wife, who was in tears by his bedside. Beholding her, Blake is said to have cried, \"Stay Kate! Keep just as you are \u2013 I will draw your portrait \u2013 for you have ever been an angel to me.\" Having completed this portrait (now lost), Blake laid down his tools and began to sing hymns and verses.<ref>Ackroyd, ''Blake'', 389</ref> At six that evening, after promising his wife that he would be with her always, Blake died.

His poetry consistently embodies an attitude of rebellion against the abuse of class power as documented in David Erdman's large study ''[[Blake: Prophet Against Empire|Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times]]''. Blake was concerned about senseless wars and the blighting effects of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Much of his poetry recounts in symbolic allegory the effects of the French and American revolutions. Erdman claims Blake was disillusioned with them, believing they had simply replaced monarchy with irresponsible mercantilism and notes Blake was deeply opposed to slavery, and believes some of his poems read primarily as championing \"[[free love]]\" have had their anti-slavery implications short-changed.<ref>Erdman ''William Blake: Prophet Against Empire'' p. 228</ref> A more recent study, ''William Blake: Visionary Anarchist'' by Peter Marshall (1988), classified Blake and his contemporary [[William Godwin]] as [[Precursors to anarchism|forerunners of modern anarchism]].<ref name=\"marshall\">{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=William Blake: Visionary Anarchist|publisher=Freedom Press|date=1 January 1994|edition=Revised|isbn=0-900384-77-8}}</ref> British [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian [[E. P. Thompson]]'s last finished work, ''[[Witness Against the Beast|Witness Against the Beast: William Blake and the Moral Law]]'' (1993), shows how far he was inspired by [[English Dissenters|dissident religious ideas]] rooted in the thinking of the most radical opponents of the monarchy during the [[English Civil War]].\n\n== Development of his views ==\n[[File:Blake God Blessing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''God blessing the seventh day'', 1805 [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]]]\nBecause Blake's later poetry contains a private mythology with complex symbolism, his late work has been less published than his earlier more accessible work. The [[Vintage Press|Vintage]] anthology of Blake edited by [[Patti Smith]] focuses heavily on the earlier work, as do many critical studies such as ''William Blake'' by D. G. Gillham.\n\nThe earlier work is primarily rebellious in character and can be seen as a protest against dogmatic religion especially notable in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', in which the figure represented by the \"Devil\" is virtually a hero rebelling against an imposter authoritarian deity. In later works, such as ''Milton'' and ''Jerusalem'', Blake carves a distinctive vision of a humanity redeemed by self-sacrifice and forgiveness, while retaining his earlier negative attitude towards what he felt was the rigid and morbid authoritarianism of traditional religion. Not all readers of Blake agree upon how much continuity exists between Blake's earlier and later works.\n\nPsychoanalyst June Singer has written that Blake's late work displayed a development of the ideas first introduced in his earlier works, namely, the humanitarian goal of achieving personal wholeness of body and spirit. The final section of the expanded edition of her Blake study ''The Unholy Bible'' suggests the later works are the \"Bible of Hell\" promised in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Regarding Blake's final poem, ''Jerusalem'', she writes: \"The promise of the divine in man, made in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'', is at last fulfilled.\"<ref>''The Unholy Bible'', June Singer, p. 229.</ref>\n\n[[John Middleton Murry]] notes discontinuity between ''Marriage'' and the late works, in that while the early Blake focused on a \"sheer negative opposition between Energy and Reason\", the later Blake emphasised the notions of self-sacrifice and forgiveness as the road to interior wholeness. This renunciation of the sharper dualism of ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' is evidenced in particular by the humanisation of the character of [[Urizen]] in the later works. Murry characterises the later Blake as having found \"mutual understanding\" and \"mutual forgiveness\".<ref>''William Blake'', Murry, p. 168.</ref>\n\n== Religious views ==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's ''[[The Ancient of Days|Ancient of Days]]'', 1794.

His view of orthodoxy is evident in ''The Marriage of Heaven and Hell''. Therein, Blake lists several ''[[Proverbs of Hell]]'', among which are the following:\n* Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.\n* As the {{Sic|catterpillar}} chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys. (8.21, 9.55, E36)\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Gospel'', Blake does not present Jesus as a philosopher or traditional messianic figure, but as a supremely creative being, above dogma, logic and even morality:\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf he had been Antichrist Creeping Jesus,\nHe'd have done anything to please us:\nGone sneaking into Synagogues\nAnd not us'd the Elders & Priests like Dogs,\nBut humble as a Lamb or Ass,\nObey'd himself to [[Caiaphas]].\nGod wants not Man to Humble himself (55\u201361, E519\u201320)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nFor Blake, Jesus symbolises the vital relationship and unity between divinity and humanity: \"All had originally one language, and one religion: this was the religion of Jesus, the everlasting Gospel. Antiquity preaches the Gospel of Jesus.\" (''[[Descriptive Catalogue (1809)|Descriptive Catalogue]]'', Plate 39, E543)\n\nBlake designed [[William Blake's mythology|his own mythology]], which appears largely in his [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic books]]. Within these he describes a number of characters, including \"Urizen\", \"Enitharmon\", \"Bromion\" and \"Luvah\". His mythology seems to have a basis in the Bible as well as Greek and Norse mythology,<ref>\"a personal mythology parallel to the Old Testament and Greek mythology\"; Bonnefoy, Yves. ''Roman and European Mythologies''. 1992, p. 265.</ref><ref>\"Then comes the question of how he read some of his other essential sources, Ovid's ''Metamorphosis'', for instance, or the Prose Edda, and how he related their symbolism to his own.\"; Fry, Northrop. \"Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake\". 1947, p 11.</ref> and it accompanies his ideas about the everlasting Gospel.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em; font-size:85%; background:#eee; color:black; width:23em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\n\"I must Create a System, or be enslav'd by another Man's.\nI will not Reason & Compare; my business is to Create.\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | Words uttered by Los in Blake's ''[[Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion]]''.\n|}\n\nOne of Blake's strongest objections to orthodox Christianity is that he felt it encouraged the suppression of natural desires and discouraged earthly joy. In ''[[A Vision of the Last Judgement]]'', Blake says that:\n\n{{quote|Men are admitted into Heaven not because they have curbed and governd their Passions or have No Passions but because they have Cultivated their Understandings. The Treasures of Heaven are not Negations of Passion but Realities of Intellect from which All the Passions Emanate Uncurbed in their Eternal Glory.

Watercolour on wood.]]\nBlake does not subscribe to the notion of a body distinct from the soul that must submit to the rule of the soul, but sees the body as an extension of the soul, derived from the \"discernment\" of the senses. Thus, the emphasis orthodoxy places upon the denial of bodily urges is a dualistic error born of misapprehension of the relationship between body and soul.

Blake scholarship was more focused on this theme in the earlier 20th century than today, although it is still mentioned notably by the Blake scholar Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 who moderately challenges this interpretation. The 19th-century \"free love\" movement was not particularly focused on the idea of multiple partners, but did agree with Wollstonecraft that state-sanctioned marriage was \"legal prostitution\" and monopolistic in character. It has somewhat more in common with early feminist movements<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|title=H-Women \u2013 H-Net|website=www2.h-net.msu.edu|accessdate=18 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427105337/http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~women/papers/freelove.html|archive-date=27 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (particularly with regard to the writings of Mary Wollstonecraft, whom Blake admired).\n\nBlake was critical of the marriage laws of his day, and generally railed against traditional Christian notions of chastity as a virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/william-blake|title=William Blake|date=17 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> At a time of tremendous strain in his marriage, in part due to Catherine's apparent inability to bear children, he directly advocated bringing a second wife into the house.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamblen |first=Emily |authorlink= |title=On the Minor Prophecies of William Blake |url= |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=10}}{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Pierre |authorlink= |title=William Blake: Poet and Mystic |url= |accessdate= |year=1915|publisher=E. P. Dutton & Company |location= |isbn= |page=45}}</ref> His poetry suggests that external demands for marital fidelity reduce love to mere duty rather than authentic affection, and decries jealousy and egotism as a motive for marriage laws. Poems such as \"Why should I be bound to thee, O my lovely Myrtle-tree?\" and \"Earth's Answer\" seem to advocate multiple sexual partners. In his poem \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\" he speaks of \"the Marriage-Hearse\" plagued by \"the youthful Harlot's curse\", the result alternately of false Prudence and/or Harlotry. ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is widely (though not universally) read as a tribute to free love since the relationship between Bromion and Oothoon is held together only by laws and not by love. For Blake, law and love are opposed, and he castigates the \"frozen marriage-bed\". In ''Visions'', Blake writes:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nTill she who burns with youth, and knows no fixed lot, is bound\nIn spells of law to one she loathes? and must she drag the chain\nOf life in weary lust? (5.21-3, E49)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn the 19th century, poet and free love advocate [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a book on Blake drawing attention to the above motifs in which Blake praises \"sacred natural love\" that is not bound by another's possessive jealousy, the latter characterised by Blake as a \"creeping skeleton\".<ref>Swinburne p. 260</ref> Swinburne notes how Blake's ''Marriage of Heaven and Hell'' condemns the hypocrisy of the \"pale religious letchery\" of advocates of traditional norms.<ref>Swinburne, p. 249.</ref> Another 19th-century free love advocate, [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844\u20131929), was influenced by Blake's mystical emphasis on energy free from external restrictions.<ref>Sheila Rowbotham's ''Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, Pierre Berger described how Blake's views echo Mary Wollstonecraft's celebration of joyful authentic love rather than love born of duty,<ref>Berger pp. 188\u2013190</ref> the former being the true measure of purity.<ref>Berger sees Blake's views as most embodied in the ''Introduction'' to the collected version of ''Songs of Innocence and Experience''.</ref> Irene Langridge notes that \"in Blake's mysterious and unorthodox creed the doctrine of free love was something Blake wanted for the edification of 'the soul'.\"<ref>''William Blake: a study of his life and art work'', by Irene Langridge, pp. 11, 131.</ref> Michael Davis's 1977 book ''William Blake a New Kind of Man'' suggests that Blake thought jealousy separates man from the divine unity, condemning him to a frozen death.<ref>Davis, p. 55.</ref>\n\nAs a theological writer, Blake has a sense of human \"[[Fall of man|fallenness]]\". S. Foster Damon noted that for Blake the major impediments to a free love society were corrupt human nature, not merely the intolerance of society and the jealousy of men, but the inauthentic hypocritical nature of human communication.<ref>S. Foster Damon ''William Blake: His Philosophy and Symbols'' (1924), p. 105.</ref> Thomas Wright's 1928 book ''Life of William Blake'' (entirely devoted to Blake's doctrine of free love) notes that Blake thinks marriage should ''in practice'' afford the joy of love, but notes that in reality it often does not,<ref>Wright, p. 57.</ref> as a couple's knowledge of being chained often diminishes their joy. Pierre Berger also analyses Blake's early mythological poems such as ''Ahania'' as declaring marriage laws to be a consequence of the fallenness of humanity, as these are born from pride and jealousy.<ref>Berger, p. 142.</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that Blake's views on \"free love\" are both qualified and may have undergone shifts and modifications in his late years. Some poems from this period warn of dangers of predatory sexuality such as ''The Sick Rose''. Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6 notes that while the hero of ''Visions of the Daughters of Albion'' is a strong advocate of free love, by the end of the poem she has become more circumspect as her awareness of the dark side of sexuality has grown, crying \"Can this be love which drinks another as a sponge drinks water?\"<ref>Quoted by Ankarsj\u00f6 on p. 68 of ''Bring Me My Arrows of Desire'' and again in his ''William Blake and Gender''</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 also notes that a major inspiration to Blake, Mary Wollstonecraft, similarly developed more circumspect views of sexual freedom late in life. In light of Blake's aforementioned sense of human 'fallenness' Ankarsj\u00f6 thinks Blake does ''not'' fully approve of sensual indulgence merely in defiance of law as exemplified by the female character of Leutha,<ref>''William Blake and gender'' (2006) by Magnus Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 129.</ref> since in the fallen world of experience all love is enchained.<ref>Ankarsj\u00f6, p. 64</ref> Ankarsj\u00f6 records Blake as having supported a commune with some sharing of partners, though David Worrall read ''The Book of Thel'' as a rejection of the proposal to take concubines espoused by some members of the Swedenborgian church.<ref>David Worrall, \"Thel in Africa: William Blake and the Post-colonial, Post-Swedenborgian Female Subject\", in ''The Reception of Blake in the Orient'', eds. Steve Clark and Masashi Suzuki. London: Continuum, 2006, pp. 17\u201329.</ref>\n\nBlake's later writings show a renewed interest in Christianity, and although he radically reinterprets Christian morality in a way that embraces sensual pleasure, there is little of the emphasis on sexual libertarianism found in several of his early poems, and there is advocacy of \"self-denial\", though such abnegation must be inspired by love rather than through authoritarian compulsion.<ref>See intro to Chapter 4 of Jerusalem.</ref> Berger (more so than Swinburne) is especially sensitive to a shift in sensibility between the early Blake and the later Blake. Berger believes the young Blake placed too much emphasis on following impulses,<ref>Berger, pp. 112, 284</ref> and that the older Blake had a better formed ideal of a true love that sacrifices self. Some celebration of mystical sensuality remains in the late poems (most notably in Blake's denial of the virginity of Jesus's mother). However, the late poems also place a greater emphasis on forgiveness, redemption, and emotional authenticity as a foundation for relationships.\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Creative mindset ===\n[[Northrop Frye]], commenting on Blake's consistency in strongly held views, notes Blake \"himself says that his notes on [Joshua] Reynolds, written at fifty, are 'exactly Similar' to those on Locke and Bacon, written when he was 'very Young'. Even phrases and lines of verse will reappear as much as forty years later. Consistency in maintaining what he believed to be true was itself one of his leading principles ... Consistency, then, foolish or otherwise, is one of Blake's chief preoccupations, just as 'self-contradiction' is always one of his most contemptuous comments\".<ref name=\"fearfulsymmetry\">[[Northrop Frye]], ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'', 1947, Princeton University Press</ref>\n\n[[File:Blake after John Gabriel Stedman Narrative of a Five Years copy 2 object 2-detail.jpg|thumb|right|Blake's \"A Negro Hung Alive by the Ribs to a Gallows\", an illustration to [[John Gabriel Stedman|J.

Several of his poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". In one poem, narrated by a black child, white and black bodies alike are described as shaded groves or clouds, which exist only until one learns \"to bear the beams of love\":\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nWhen I from black and he from white cloud free,\nAnd round the tent of God like lambs we joy:\nIll shade him from the heat till he can bear,\nTo lean in joy upon our fathers knee.\nAnd then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair,\nAnd be like him and he will then love me. (23-8, E9)\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nBlake retained an active interest in social and political events throughout his life, and social and political statements are often present in his mystical symbolism. His views on what he saw as oppression and restriction of rightful freedom extended to the Church. His spiritual beliefs are evident in ''Songs of Experience'' (1794), in which he distinguishes between the Old Testament God, whose restrictions he rejected, and the New Testament God whom he saw as a positive influence.\n\n=== Visions ===\nFrom a young age, William Blake claimed to have seen visions. The first may have occurred as early as the age of four when, according to one anecdote, the young artist \"saw God\" when God \"put his head to the window\", causing Blake to break into screaming.<ref name=bent78>Bentley, Gerald Eades and Bentley Jr., G. ''William Blake: The Critical Heritage''. 1995, pp. 36\u20137.</ref> At the age of eight or ten in [[Peckham Rye]], London, Blake claimed to have seen \"a tree filled with angels, bright angelic wings bespangling every bough like stars.\"<ref name=bent78 /> According to Blake's Victorian biographer Gilchrist, he returned home and reported the vision and only escaped being thrashed by his father for telling a lie through the intervention of his mother. Though all evidence suggests that his parents were largely supportive, his mother seems to have been especially so, and several of Blake's early drawings and poems decorated the walls of her chamber.<ref>A note of caution, however: Peter Ackroyd recounts that on one occasion \"his mother beat him for declaring that he had seen visions\", suggesting that, though \"he was beaten only once... it became a source of perpetual discontent\". Ackroyd, Peter (1995). Blake. London: Sinclair-Stevenson. p. 21-2, {{ISBN|1-85619-278-4}}.</ref> On another occasion, Blake watched haymakers at work, and thought he saw angelic figures walking among them.<ref name=bent78 />\n\n[[File:William Blake 002.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Ghost of a Flea]]'', 1819\u20131820.

They were often associated with beautiful religious themes and imagery, and may have inspired him further with spiritual works and pursuits. Certainly, religious concepts and imagery figure centrally in Blake's works. God and Christianity constituted the intellectual centre of his writings, from which he drew inspiration. Blake believed he was personally instructed and encouraged by [[Archangel]]s to create his artistic works, which he claimed were actively read and enjoyed by the same Archangels. In a letter of condolence to [[William Hayley]], dated 6 May 1800, four days after the death of Hayley's son,<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Haley, ESQ Vol II |last=Johnson |first=John |year=1823 |publisher=S. and R.

I hear his advice, and even now write from his dictate.}}\n\nIn a letter to John Flaxman, dated 21 September 1800, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|[The town of] Felpham is a sweet place for Study, because it is more spiritual than London. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden Gates; her windows are not obstructed by vapours; voices of Celestial inhabitants are more distinctly heard, & their forms more distinctly seen; & my Cottage is also a Shadow of their houses. My Wife & Sister are both well, courting Neptune for an embrace... I am more famed in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my Brain are studies & Chambers filled with books & pictures of old, which I wrote & painted in ages of Eternity before my mortal life; & those works are the delight & Study of Archangels. (E710)}}\n\nIn a letter to Thomas Butts, dated 25 April 1803, Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Now I may say to you, what perhaps I should not dare to say to anyone else: That I can alone carry on my visionary studies in London unannoy'd, & that I may converse with my friends in Eternity, See Visions, Dream Dreams & prophecy & speak Parables unobserv'd & at liberty from the Doubts of other Mortals; perhaps Doubts proceeding from Kindness, but Doubts are always pernicious, Especially when we Doubt our Friends.}}\n\nIn ''A Vision of the Last Judgement'' Blake wrote:\n\n{{quote|Error is Created Truth is Eternal Error or Creation will be Burned Up & then & not till then Truth or Eternity will appear It is Burnt up the Moment Men cease to behold it I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation & that to me it is hindrance & not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me.

(E565-6)}}\n\nDespite seeing angels and God, Blake has also claimed to see Satan on the staircase of his South Molton Street home in London.<ref name=\"flavorwire1\" />\n\nAware of Blake's visions, [[William Wordsworth]] commented, \"There was no doubt that this poor man was mad, but there is something in the madness of this man which interests me more than the sanity of [[Lord Byron]] and [[Walter Scott]].\"<ref>{{cite web | title=Blake's vision on show | author=John Ezard | url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1254856,00.html#article_continue |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=6 July 2004 | accessdate=24 March 2008}}</ref> In a more deferential vein, John William Cousins wrote in ''A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature'' that Blake was \"a truly pious and loving soul, neglected and misunderstood by the world, but appreciated by an elect few\", who \"led a cheerful and contented life of poverty illumined by visions and celestial inspirations\".<ref>{{cite book |title=A Short Biographical Dictionary of English literature |last= Cousin |first=John William |year=1933 |publisher=Plain Label Books |isbn=978-1-60303-696-2 |page=81 |url= }}</ref> Blake's sanity was called into question as recently as the publication of the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']], whose entry on Blake comments that \"the question whether Blake was or was not mad seems likely to remain in dispute, but there can be no doubt whatever that he was at different periods of his life under the influence of illusions for which there are no outward facts to account, and that much of what he wrote is so far wanting in the quality of sanity as to be without a logical coherence\".\n\n== Cultural influence ==\n{{Main|William Blake in popular culture}}\n[[File:William Blake3.jpg|thumb|left|William Blake's portrait in profile, by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]. This larger version was painted to be engraved as the frontispiece of Alexander Gilchrist's ''Life of Blake'' (1863).]]\nBlake's work was neglected for a generation after his death and almost forgotten by the time [[Alexander Gilchrist]] began work on his biography in the 1860s. The publication of the ''[[Life of William Blake]]'' rapidly transformed Blake's reputation, in particular as he was taken up by [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and associated figures, in particular [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. In the 20th century, however, Blake's work was fully appreciated and his influence increased. Important early and mid-20th-century scholars involved in enhancing Blake's standing in literary and artistic circles included [[S. Foster Damon]], [[Geoffrey Keynes]], [[Northrop Frye]], [[David V. Erdman]] and G. E. Bentley Jr.\n\nWhile Blake had a significant role to play in the art and poetry of figures such as Rossetti, it was during the Modernist period that this work began to influence a wider set of writers and artists. [[William Butler Yeats]], who edited an edition of Blake's collected works in 1893, drew on him for poetic and philosophical ideas,<ref>Hazard Adams. ''Blake and Yeats: The Contrary Vision'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1955.</ref> while British surrealist art in particular drew on Blake's conceptions of non-mimetic, visionary practice in the painting of artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].<ref>Shirley Dent and Jason Whittaker. ''Radical Blake: Influence and Afterlife from 1827''. Houndmills: Palgrave, 2002.</ref> His poetry came into use by a number of British classical composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], who set his works. Modern British composer [[John Tavener]] set several of Blake's poems, including ''The Lamb'' (as the 1982 work \"[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]\") and ''[[The Tyger]]''.\n\nMany such as [[June Singer]] have argued that Blake's thoughts on human nature greatly anticipate and parallel the thinking of the psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]]. In Jung's own words: \"Blake [is] a tantalizing study, since he compiled a lot of half or undigested knowledge in his fantasies. According to my ideas they are an artistic production rather than an authentic representation of unconscious processes.\"<ref>Jung and William Blake.

It is now preserved in the ''Mus\u00e9e d'Arch\u00e9ologie du Jura'' at ''[[Lons-le-Saunier]]''.\n\n==Reconstruction==\nThe Continental Celtic calendar as reconstructed from the calendars of Coligny and Villards d'Heria was a [[lunisolar calendar]], attempting to synchronize the solar year and the lunar month.\nThe common [[lunar year]] contained 354 or 355 days.\n\nThe calendar year began with ''Samonios'' (''samon'' is Gaulish for ''summer'', Lambert p.&nbsp;112).\nLe Contel and Verdier (1997) argue for a summer solstice start of the year. Monard (1999) argues for an autumn equinox start (by association with Irish [[Samhain]]). As Irish \"Samhain\", Olmsted (1992, 2001: 20-21, 2009) corresponds to Irish Midwinter< Olmsted argues that ''Samonios'' (\"End of Summer Half of the Year\") began at actual midwinter (December 21) when the original 30-year Celtic calendar first originated around 1000 BC, but through a calendar error by one day every 199 years, after 1300 years of operation ''Samonios'' was pushd back to November 1 in its celebration.\n\nAs with the celebrations of the first day of spring, fall, summer, and winter, not just the days corresponding to the equinoxes and solstices have been displaced earlier by 55 days in Ireland, but the rituals corresponding to those found elsewhere in European and Indo-Iranian tradition, associated with the solar events, have been displaced as well. Such a displacement can be explained by a simple one-day shift every 23.7 years in the Celtic lunar calendar cycle and its associated IVOS festivals with respect to solar time. After some 1300 years of operation, such a calendar would have displaced the lunar festivals to some 55 days earlier than the actual solar events with which they were associated. With the adoption of Christianity the displaced festivals then became fixed points within the newly acquired Julian calendar. But even in this new calendar the festivals were not fixed points in the solar year. Thus after a similar span of 1600 years from its adoption, when Pope Gregory reformed the Julian calendar, it had become 12 days out of sync with solar time.\n\nBesides the Coligny calendar plate, Classical commentary provides a few important details about early Celtic calendar cycles. Diodorus Siculus (V, 32, 6; Tierney 1960), quoting Posidonius, describes a sacrifice which took place significantly every five years among the Gauls, presumably at midsummer, since first fruits and animals were burnt in pyres (Zwicker 1934: 19). Plutarchus (Moralia, de facie in orbe Lunae: 26, 941 A) refers to a festival or expedition every 30 years undertaken in the Islands off Britain, presumably the Channel Islands, but perhaps the comment on H\uf091s\u00edodos refers to islands to the west of Britain and might relate to Ireland. Plutarchus's 30-year festive or expeditionary cycle near Britain may relate to the same 30-year cycle as that referred to among the Gauls by Plinius, writing ca. 75 A.D. but apparently quoting an earlier source (Naturalis Historia, XVI, 250).\n \n\"The sixth day of the new moon ... marks for them [the druids] the beginning of the months, the years, and the cycle at the end of thirty years, because by this time it [the moon] has considerable strength though not yet at the half way point.\" (Zwicker 1934: 55).\n\nThus classical commentary, probably most of it emanating from Posidonius at the end of the second century BC, describes both a 5-year phase, the time interval between the recurring midwinter or midsummer intercalary months, and a 30-year cycle as current among the Gauls and possibly among the British or Irish as well. One very important aspect of Plinius's statement is that both the year and the 30-year cycle begin on the same fixed day of the moon. For the 30-year cycle to begin on the same fixed day of the moon, the 30-year period must contain exactly 371 lunar months or 10956 days (actually 10955.848 days with 29.5306 days per lunar month), 1 day less than 30 solar years (10957.266 days) (see Table 4). Thus, as we shall see, Plinius can only be describing the calendar which must have been the predecessor to the 25-year Coligny calendar (Olmsted 1992: 61-64, 132-134; Olmsted 2001: 1; Duval and Pinault 1986: 415). On the Coligny calendar the term ATENOVX \"returning night\" dividing each month into two halves counting from days I to XIIII or XV as well as the N-counting scheme alongside the TII-counting scheme shows that the 25-year Coligny calendar clearly developed from an earlier fully-lunar calendar. The addition of an extra day making the month Equos have 29 rather than 28 days in year 4 of each 5 year phase causes the calendar to shift from a 30-year cycle which contains 10956 days to a 25-year cycle which contains 9130 days. \n\n \nTo total 10956 days, Plinius's 30-year calendar must contain an 1801-day phase (61 lunar months) followed by five 1831-day phases (62 lunar months) (see plate 3). In this 30-year cycle, since 5 solar years contain 1826 days, during the first 5-year phase (1801 days) the sun falls back 25 days. However, the sun gains back 5 days in each of the next five 5-year phases (which contain 1831 days, 5 days longer than the 1826 days of 5 solar years) (Olmsted 1992: 106). Thus the intercalary summer and winter solstices progress at 5-day intervals every 5 years. In contrast, the 25-year Coligny calendar contains an 1802-day phase followed by four 1832-day phases. Since a 5-year period with four 365-day years and one 366-day year contains 1826 days, the sun would initially lag behind the 25-year calendar by 24 days (1826 -1802) after the first 5-year phase. However, the sun would gain back this initial lag by 6 days for each of the four subsequent 5-year phases (1832 - 1826). This calendar realigns to within one day of solar time every 25 rather than every 30 years. Containing 9130 days, this 25-year calendar then runs almost exactly 1 day less than the 9131.06 days to be found in 25 solar years and almost exactly 5 days more than the 9124.95 days to be found in 309 lunar months, equivalent to the 5-day week, the c\u00f3icde, of the early Irish law tracts (see Olmsted 1992: 95). \n\nIndeed the Coligny calendar indicates which 5-day lunar week reigns over each subsequent 25-year cycle through a series of marks (TII, ITI, IIT), which also indicate the one-day lag of the sun with each 25 year cycle (see plate 1). TII indicates that the first lunar week begins each month during the first 25 year of operation. ITI indicates that the second lunar week begins each month during the period between year 26 and year 50. IIT indicates that the third lunar week begins each month during the period between year 51 and year 75 from the inception of the calendar. If the first winter solstice begins on day 1 of year 1, the solstice will begin on day 2 in year 26 and on day 3 in year 51. These marks in this sequence (TII, ITI, IIT), except where shifted or exchanged with other days (Olmsted 1992: tab. 6c), are found in groups of three days in a row, each group separated by the 6 days the sun, in each 5-year phase, gains back the initial fall-back of 24 days from the first 5-year phase (Olmsted 1988: tabs. 6-7; 1992: tabs. 34, 41, 43; p. 144). In this 25-year calendar the two summer and winter intercalary solstices which occur every 5 years (separated by 30 months) progress at 6-day intervals rather than the 5-day intervals they progress in the 30-year calendar. \n  \tThe pertinent observation then is that in either a 25-year or 30-year calendar, assuming four 365-day years and one 366-day year every five years, the sun falls behind the lunar festivals of the calendar (the lunar calendar festivals run ahead of the actual solar year) by 1 day every 23.70 years, a natural consequence of a 365.20-day year compared to the 365.2422 days contained in an actual solar year (see bottom of plate 3). The actual IVOS festivals will then fall 1 day earlier with respect to sun every 23.70 years, progressively getting further and further out of whack with solar time. The  25-year cycle is more accurate to solar time than is the 30-year cycle in that the assumption of a one-day shift every 25 years  is much closer to the actual one-day shift every 23.70 years than is the assumption of a one-day shift every 30 years. Both calendars keep track of the assumed solar fallback by 1 day in each 25-year or 30-year cycle.\n \nAfter 1300 years the actual lunar festivals associated with the solstices and equinoxes will take place on average 54 days ahead of the sun (Olmsted 1992: 130-134; tab. 57). If the Julian calendar was adopted with Christianity around 450 AD, this would give a date of around 850 BC for the beginning of a 30-year pagan Irish calendar, if such existed. But there is nothing exact in this date because of the natural oscillation of the lunar and solar dates caused by the intercalary months and the 11-day difference between the lunar and solar year. This oscillation gives a wide margin of error of + 300 years. Thus from the evidence of the 55-day displacement of the Irish festivals, we might assume that somewhere in the period 550 BC to 1150 BC the original 30-year Celtic calendar cycle was adopted. However, there is another source for dating the origin of the 30-year calendar. The agreement of these two sources then puts our dating on a more solid footing.\n\n\nThe entry {{lang|xtg|TRINOX[tion] SAMO[nii] SINDIV}} \"three-nights of Samonios today\") on the 17th of Samonios suggests that, like the Irish festival of Samhain, it lasted for three nights. The phrase *''trinoxtion Samonii'' is comparable to a Gaulish festival mentioned in a 1st-century AD Latin inscription from Limoges, France, which mentions a \"10 night festival (*''decamnoctiacon'') of (Apollo) [[Grannus]]\" ( {{lang|la|POSTVMVS DV[M]NORIGIS F(ILIVS) VERG(OBRETVS) AQVAM MARTIAM DECAMNOCTIACIS GRANNI D[E] S[VA] P[ECVNIA] D[EDIT]}})<ref>Lejeune, Michel, \"Notes d'etymologie gauloise\" (\"XI. Les 'Dix Nuits' de Grannos\"), \u00c9tudes Celtiques, XXXI, 1995, 91-97.</ref>. Olmsted (2001: 26, 40) indicates that TRINOUX SAMO is actually an abbreviation for TRI(TIO)NOUX \"the Third Night of Samonios\", just as (PETIUX RIVROS is an abbreviation for\nPET(UOR)I(NO)UX RIVROS \"the fourth night of ''Rivros''.  Both of these days are displaced by the transference of lucky MAT days into unlucky ANMAT months. Their original positions are indicated by the ordinal numerals \"TRI(TI)- and PET(UOR)I-.\n\nThe solar year was approximated by the insertion of a 13th [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] month every two and a half years. The additional months were intercalated before ''Samonios'' in the first year, and between ''Cutios'' and ''Giamonios'' in the third year. The name of the first intercalary month is not known with certainty, the text being fragmentary.\nIn a suggestion first made by Schmidt (1979:198),the name of the first intercalary month is probably ''Quimonios'', found in the final verse of the gnomic line at the end of the month, {{lang|xtg|OX[.]ANTIA POC DEDOR TON IN QVIMON}}, emended to {{lang|xtg|[TRICANTON] OX[OC]ANTIA PO(N)C(E) DEDOR TON IN(ON) QVIMON(IV)}} \"Three hundred eighty and five are given this year through Quimonios\" (''Quimon-'' abbreviating the io-stem dative ''Quimoniu'').<ref>Olmsted, Garrett, \"The Use of Ordinal Numerals on the Gaulish Coligny Calendar\", ''[[The Journal of Indo-European Studies]]'' 16 (1988), p. 296.</ref>\nThe name of the second intercalary month is reconstructed as ''Rantaranos'' or ''Bantaranos'', based on the reading of the fifth line in the corresponding fragment.\nA gnomic verse pertaining to intercalation was taking up the first two lines, read as {{lang|xtg|CIALLOS B(IS) SONNO CINGOS}}.<ref>Dottin (1920:[https://archive.org/stream/lalanguegauloise00dottuoft#page/191/mode/2up 192]); Lambert p.&nbsp;116.</ref> The term ''{{lang|xtg|sonno cingos}}'' is interpreted as \"sun's march\" = \"a year\" by Delamarre (2003).\n\nThe months were divided into two halves, the beginning of the second half marked with the term ''atenoux'' or \"renewal\"<ref>The interpretation of ''atenoux'' as \"returning night\" is improbable (Delamarre p.58) and \"renewing\" would seem more probable; thus the month would start at new moon and ''atenoux'' would indicate the renewal, ie the full moon.</ref> (cf. Old Irish ''athnugud'' \"renewal\"). The basic unit of the Celtic calendar was thus the fortnight or half-month, as is also suggested in traces in Celtic folklore.

It is now preserved in the ''Mus\u00e9e d'Arch\u00e9ologie du Jura'' at ''[[Lons-le-Saunier]]''.\n\n==Reconstruction==\nThe Continental Celtic calendar as reconstructed from the calendars of Coligny and Villards d'Heria was a [[lunisolar calendar]], attempting to synchronize the solar year and the lunar month.\nThe common [[lunar year]] contained 354 or 355 days.\n\nThe calendar year began with ''Samonios'' (''samon'' is Gaulish for ''summer'', Lambert p.&nbsp;112).\nLe Contel and Verdier (1997) argue for a summer solstice start of the year. Monard (1999) argues for an autumn equinox start (by association with Irish [[Samhain]]). As Irish \"Samhain\", Olmsted (1992, 2001: 20-21, 2009) corresponds to Irish Midwinter< Olmsted argues that ''Samonios'' (\"End of Summer Half of the Year\") began at actual midwinter (December 21) when the original 30-year Celtic calendar first originated around 1000 BC, but through a calendar error by one day every 199 years, after 1300 years of operation ''Samonios'' was pushd back to November 1 in its celebration.\n\nAs with the celebrations of the first day of spring, fall, summer, and winter, not just the days corresponding to the equinoxes and solstices have been displaced earlier by 55 days in Ireland, but the rituals corresponding to those found elsewhere in European and Indo-Iranian tradition, associated with the solar events, have been displaced as well. Such a displacement can be explained by a simple one-day shift every 23.7 years in the Celtic lunar calendar cycle and its associated IVOS festivals with respect to solar time. After some 1300 years of operation, such a calendar would have displaced the lunar festivals to some 55 days earlier than the actual solar events with which they were associated. With the adoption of Christianity the displaced festivals then became fixed points within the newly acquired Julian calendar. But even in this new calendar the festivals were not fixed points in the solar year. Thus after a similar span of 1600 years from its adoption, when Pope Gregory reformed the Julian calendar, it had become 12 days out of sync with solar time.\n\nBesides the Coligny calendar plate, Classical commentary provides a few important details about early Celtic calendar cycles. Diodorus Siculus (V, 32, 6; Tierney 1960), quoting Posidonius, describes a sacrifice which took place significantly every five years among the Gauls, presumably at midsummer, since first fruits and animals were burnt in pyres (Zwicker 1934: 19). Plutarchus (Moralia, de facie in orbe Lunae: 26, 941 A) refers to a festival or expedition every 30 years undertaken in the Islands off Britain, presumably the Channel Islands, but perhaps the comment on H\uf091s\u00edodos refers to islands to the west of Britain and might relate to Ireland. Plutarchus's 30-year festive or expeditionary cycle near Britain may relate to the same 30-year cycle as that referred to among the Gauls by Plinius, writing ca. 75 A.D. but apparently quoting an earlier source (Naturalis Historia, XVI, 250).\n \n\"The sixth day of the new moon ... marks for them [the druids] the beginning of the months, the years, and the cycle at the end of thirty years, because by this time it [the moon] has considerable strength though not yet at the half way point.\" (Zwicker 1934: 55).\n\nThus classical commentary, probably most of it emanating from Posidonius at the end of the second century BC, describes both a 5-year phase, the time interval between the recurring midwinter or midsummer intercalary months, and a 30-year cycle as current among the Gauls and possibly among the British or Irish as well. One very important aspect of Plinius's statement is that both the year and the 30-year cycle begin on the same fixed day of the moon. For the 30-year cycle to begin on the same fixed day of the moon, the 30-year period must contain exactly 371 lunar months or 10956 days (actually 10955.848 days with 29.5306 days per lunar month), 1 day less than 30 solar years (10957.266 days) (see Table 4). Thus, as we shall see, Plinius can only be describing the calendar which must have been the predecessor to the 25-year Coligny calendar (Olmsted 1992: 61-64, 132-134; Olmsted 2001: 1; Duval and Pinault 1986: 415). On the Coligny calendar the term ATENOVX \"returning night\" dividing each month into two halves counting from days I to XIIII or XV as well as the N-counting scheme alongside the TII-counting scheme shows that the 25-year Coligny calendar clearly developed from an earlier fully-lunar calendar. The addition of an extra day making the month Equos have 29 rather than 28 days in year 4 of each 5 year phase causes the calendar to shift from a 30-year cycle which contains 10956 days to a 25-year cycle which contains 9130 days. \n\n \nTo total 10956 days, Plinius's 30-year calendar must contain an 1801-day phase (61 lunar months) followed by five 1831-day phases (62 lunar months) (see plate 3). In this 30-year cycle, since 5 solar years contain 1826 days, during the first 5-year phase (1801 days) the sun falls back 25 days. However, the sun gains back 5 days in each of the next five 5-year phases (which contain 1831 days, 5 days longer than the 1826 days of 5 solar years) (Olmsted 1992: 106). Thus the intercalary summer and winter solstices progress at 5-day intervals every 5 years. In contrast, the 25-year Coligny calendar contains an 1802-day phase followed by four 1832-day phases. Since a 5-year period with four 365-day years and one 366-day year contains 1826 days, the sun would initially lag behind the 25-year calendar by 24 days (1826 -1802) after the first 5-year phase. However, the sun would gain back this initial lag by 6 days for each of the four subsequent 5-year phases (1832 - 1826). This calendar realigns to within one day of solar time every 25 rather than every 30 years. Containing 9130 days, this 25-year calendar then runs almost exactly 1 day less than the 9131.06 days to be found in 25 solar years and almost exactly 5 days more than the 9124.95 days to be found in 309 lunar months, equivalent to the 5-day week, the c\u00f3icde, of the early Irish law tracts (see Olmsted 1992: 95). \n\nIndeed the Coligny calendar indicates which 5-day lunar week reigns over each subsequent 25-year cycle through a series of marks (TII, ITI, IIT), which also indicate the one-day lag of the sun with each 25 year cycle (see plate 1). TII indicates that the first lunar week begins each month during the first 25 year of operation. ITI indicates that the second lunar week begins each month during the period between year 26 and year 50. IIT indicates that the third lunar week begins each month during the period between year 51 and year 75 from the inception of the calendar. If the first winter solstice begins on day 1 of year 1, the solstice will begin on day 2 in year 26 and on day 3 in year 51. These marks in this sequence (TII, ITI, IIT), except where shifted or exchanged with other days (Olmsted 1992: tab. 6c), are found in groups of three days in a row, each group separated by the 6 days the sun, in each 5-year phase, gains back the initial fall-back of 24 days from the first 5-year phase (Olmsted 1988: tabs. 6-7; 1992: tabs. 34, 41, 43; p. 144). In this 25-year calendar the two summer and winter intercalary solstices which occur every 5 years (separated by 30 months) progress at 6-day intervals rather than the 5-day intervals they progress in the 30-year calendar. \n  \tThe pertinent observation then is that in either a 25-year or 30-year calendar, assuming four 365-day years and one 366-day year every five years, the sun falls behind the lunar festivals of the calendar (the lunar calendar festivals run ahead of the actual solar year) by 1 day every 23.70 years, a natural consequence of a 365.20-day year compared to the 365.2422 days contained in an actual solar year (see bottom of plate 3). The actual IVOS festivals will then fall 1 day earlier with respect to sun every 23.70 years, progressively getting further and further out of whack with solar time. The  25-year cycle is more accurate to solar time than is the 30-year cycle in that the assumption of a one-day shift every 25 years  is much closer to the actual one-day shift every 23.70 years than is the assumption of a one-day shift every 30 years. Both calendars keep track of the assumed solar fallback by 1 day in each 25-year or 30-year cycle.\n \nAfter 1300 years the actual lunar festivals associated with the solstices and equinoxes will take place on average 54 days ahead of the sun (Olmsted 1992: 130-134; tab. 57). If the Julian calendar was adopted with Christianity around 450 AD, this would give a date of around 850 BC for the beginning of a 30-year pagan Irish calendar, if such existed. But there is nothing exact in this date because of the natural oscillation of the lunar and solar dates caused by the intercalary months and the 11-day difference between the lunar and solar year. This oscillation gives a wide margin of error of + 300 years. Thus from the evidence of the 55-day displacement of the Irish festivals, we might assume that somewhere in the period 550 BC to 1150 BC the original 30-year Celtic calendar cycle was adopted. However, there is another source for dating the origin of the 30-year calendar. The agreement of these two sources then puts our dating on a more solid footing.\n\n\nThe entry {{lang|xtg|TRINOX[tion] SAMO[nii] SINDIV}} \"three-nights of Samonios today\") on the 17th of Samonios suggests that, like the Irish festival of Samhain, it lasted for three nights. The phrase *''trinoxtion Samonii'' is comparable to a Gaulish festival mentioned in a 1st-century AD Latin inscription from Limoges, France, which mentions a \"10 night festival (*''decamnoctiacon'') of (Apollo) [[Grannus]]\" ( {{lang|la|POSTVMVS DV[M]NORIGIS F(ILIVS) VERG(OBRETVS) AQVAM MARTIAM DECAMNOCTIACIS GRANNI D[E] S[VA] P[ECVNIA] D[EDIT]}})<ref>Lejeune, Michel, \"Notes d'etymologie gauloise\" (\"XI. Les 'Dix Nuits' de Grannos\"), \u00c9tudes Celtiques, XXXI, 1995, 91-97.</ref>. Olmsted (2001: 26, 40) indicates that TRINOUX SAMO is actually an abbreviation for TRI(TIO)NOUX \"the Third Night of Samonios\", just as (PETIUX RIVROS is an abbreviation for\nPET(UOR)I(NO)UX RIVROS \"the fourth night of ''Rivros''.  Both of these days are displaced by the transference of lucky MAT days into unlucky ANMAT months. Their original positions are indicated by the ordinal numerals \"TRI(TI)- and PET(UOR)I-.\n\nThe solar year was approximated by the insertion of a 13th [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] month every two and a half years. The additional months were intercalated before ''Samonios'' in the first year, and between ''Cutios'' and ''Giamonios'' in the third year. The name of the first intercalary month is not known with certainty, the text being fragmentary.\nIn a suggestion first made by Schmidt (1979:198),the name of the first intercalary month is probably ''Quimonios'', found in the final verse of the gnomic line at the end of the month, {{lang|xtg|OX[.]ANTIA POC DEDOR TON IN QVIMON}}, emended to {{lang|xtg|[TRICANTON] OX[OC]ANTIA PO(N)C(E) DEDOR TON IN(ON) QVIMON(IV)}} \"Three hundred eighty and five are given this year through Quimonios\" (''Quimon-'' abbreviating the io-stem dative ''Quimoniu'').<ref>Olmsted, Garrett, \"The Use of Ordinal Numerals on the Gaulish Coligny Calendar\", ''[[The Journal of Indo-European Studies]]'' 16 (1988), p. 296.</ref>\nThe name of the second intercalary month is reconstructed as ''Rantaranos'' or ''Bantaranos'', based on the reading of the fifth line in the corresponding fragment.\nA gnomic verse pertaining to intercalation was taking up the first two lines, read as {{lang|xtg|CIALLOS B(IS) SONNO CINGOS}}.<ref>Dottin (1920:[https://archive.org/stream/lalanguegauloise00dottuoft#page/191/mode/2up 192]); Lambert p.&nbsp;116.</ref> The term ''{{lang|xtg|sonno cingos}}'' is interpreted as \"sun's march\" = \"a year\" by Delamarre (2003).\n\nThe months were divided into two halves, the beginning of the second half marked with the term ''atenoux'' or \"renewal\"<ref>The interpretation of ''atenoux'' as \"returning night\" is improbable (Delamarre p.58) and \"renewing\" would seem more probable; thus the month would start at new moon and ''atenoux'' would indicate the renewal, ie the full moon.</ref> (cf. Old Irish ''athnugud'' \"renewal\"). The basic unit of the Celtic calendar was thus the fortnight or half-month, as is also suggested in traces in Celtic folklore. The first half was always 15 days, the second half either 14 or 15 days on alternate months (similar to [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nMonths of 30 days were marked ''MAT'', months of 29 days were marked ''ANM(AT)''.\nThis has been read as \"lucky\" and \"unlucky\", respectively, based on comparison with Middle Welsh ''mad'' and ''anfad'', but the meaning could here also be merely descriptive, \"complete\" and \"incomplete\".<ref name=\"BM1\">Bernhard Maier: ''Lexikon der keltischen Religion und Kultur''.

This is done more particularly  on the sixth day of the moon, the day which is the beginning of their months and years, as also of their ages, which, with them, are but thirty years. This day they select because the moon, though not yet in the middle of her course, has already considerable power and influence; and they call her by a name which signifies, in their language, the all-healing.\"\n[[John Bostock (physician)|Bostock, John]], [[Henry Thomas Riley]] (eds) (1855).

From their beginnings as prominent figures in the early-1960s U.S. folk revival, the group has recorded over 20 albums and had several hits, including \"Green, Green\", \"Saturday Night\", \"Today\", \"Denver\", and \"[[This Land Is Your Land]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=The New Christy Minstrels |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-new-christy-minstrels-mn0000328352/songs |title=The New Christy Minstrels - Songs |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-10-08}}</ref> Their 1962 debut album, ''[[Presenting The New Christy Minstrels]]'', won a [[5th Grammy Awards#Pop|Grammy Award]] and was on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] for two years.<ref name=Amg-NCM/>\n\nThe group has sold millions of records and were in demand at concerts and on television shows.<ref name=WhyFame/> They also helped to launch the musical careers of several musicians, including [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Gene Clark]], [[Kim Carnes]], and [[Barry McGuire]].<ref name=WhyFame/>\n\n==History==\nThe New Christy Minstrels were formed by singer/guitarist [[Randy Sparks]] in 1961. Sparks had been a solo performer in the late 1950s, mixing folk music with pop standards and playing successful club dates on the West Coast and in Manhattan. Twice winner of the All-Navy Talent competition, he landed a number of high-profile television appearances and a recording contract with [[Verve Records]]. At the suggestion of Verve founder [[Norman Granz]] in 1960, he formed \"the Randy Sparks 3\" with his wife, Jackie Miller, and singer/arranger Nick Woods. After a year touring with his trio, he realized he wanted a still larger group. At the time, folk music was very popular and choral groups like the [[Norman Luboff]] Choir had begun incorporating folk classics in their repertoires, but\u2014in Sparks' opinion\u2014they sang too perfectly, lacking the rustic, earthy character of folk performance. Throughout the latter months of 1961 and into early 1962, Sparks created a 14-voice ensemble - The New Christy Minstrels\u2014by combining his trio with a quartet he met in the Pacific Northwest called the Fairmount Singers (Dave Ellingson, Terry Tillman, Hal Ayotte and Robbie Mills), another trio called The Inn Group (John Forsha, Karol Dugan and [[Jerry Yester]]), banjo player Billy Cudmore, folk-blues singer Terry Wadsworth, folk singer [[Dolan Ellis]] and singer/guitarist Art Podell.<ref name=Amg-NCM/><ref name=Amg-Presenting/> Large commercial folk groups did not exist in those days, and The New Christy Minstrels delivered a robust new sound. An avid historian of [[Americana]], Sparks named his group after [[Christy's Minstrels]], a [[blackface]] group formed by Philadelphia-born showman [[Edwin Pearce Christy]] in 1842 and known primarily for introducing many of Stephen Foster's compositions. In a similar way, Sparks envisioned his group\u2014with its innovative sound\u2014as a means to attract attention to his own writing, which consisted of original songs and fresh adaptations of folk classics.\n\nAt the outset, the original plan was that the group would be a recording act only, and several charter members joined with the assumption that their commitment would be for only occasional studio work to supplement their individual careers. In April 1962 the group, reduced to 10 members after the early departure of the Fairmount Singers, recorded their debut album, ''[[Presenting The New Christy Minstrels]]'', for [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=Amg-Presenting/> Eventually, the album won a [[Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Chorus]]<ref name=Amg-NCM/> and sat on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts for two years, peaking at number 19.<ref name=Amg-NCM/> The album included [[Woody Guthrie]]'s \"[[This Land Is Your Land]]\", which entered the pop singles charts in December 1962.<ref name=Amg-NCM-singles/>\n\nHowever, prior to the album's release, [[Irving Townsend]], head of Columbia Records West Coast A&R, demanded of Sparks that he turn the group into a legitimate performing ensemble that could make live appearances to promote their releases; otherwise, he would not release the album. Sparks promptly agreed and, at Townsend's request, hired business managers George Greif and Sid Garris (Greif-Garris Management) to help his dauntingly large, unproven group get bookings to generate the revenue stream needed to cover the hefty payroll and business costs.  Unfortunately, some of the charter recruits had no interest in committing full-time to what they saw as a high risk project; others had contract obligations of their own and were simply not available.  The Inn Group (Jerry Yester, Karol Dugan, John Forsha), Terry Wadsworth and Billy Cudmore all quit the group a few weeks after the recording sessions. Sparks ended up losing half of his charter roster at almost the exact moment that his new business managers landed a major booking for the group to become regulars on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', a weekly variety show set to debut in the fall of 1962. Sparks, Greif-Garris and some of the remaining members immediately started looking for replacements. Among the new hires were the folk duo Barry & Barry (folksingers [[Barry McGuire]] and Barry Kane), vocalist [[Peggy Connelly]], singer/banjoist [[Larry Ramos]], and tenor Clarence Treat (upright bass and mandolin). The new lineup broke in their act at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in Los Angeles in July\u2013August 1962, which included a mix of folk Americana performed by the ensemble (usually Sparks' reworkings of folk melodies), a smattering of vaudevillian humor and step out solos, duos and trios by the members. They were a smash success and garnered rave reviews from both ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']].\n\nPrior to the debut of the Williams television show, the group appeared with Andy at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] in September. When the Williams Show debuted in October, the New Christy Minstrels quickly became one of the most popular features of the program. Several weeks into the Williams season, Connelly was replaced by vocalist Gayle Caldwell. This became the group roster that the public would come to know throughout the 1962-63 television season and the line-up most closely associated with the group's subsequent hit recordings:  To review, that roster is: Randy Sparks, Jackie Miller, Nick Woods, Dolan Ellis, Art Podell, Barry McGuire, Barry Kane, Larry Ramos, Clarence Treat and Gayle Caldwell. The new group was starting out at a stunning pace. In early December, they appeared at the Coconut Grove with comedian George Gobel, and over the holidays they appeared at Carnegie Hall with singer/comedian Allan Sherman\u2014a stunning accomplishment for such a new ensemble.\n\nThe group's second album, ''The New Christy Minstrels in Person'', was released in February 1963 (recorded in September 1962 while Connelly was still in the line-up). In January 1963, the group recorded ''The New Christy Minstrels Tell Tall Tales! (Legends and Nonsense)'', which was released in May shortly after the ''Andy Williams Show'' had wrapped for the season. By now the group's fame had grown considerably, and they received \"a raft of enthusiastic reviews\".<ref name=WhyFame/> In April 1963, following a successful appearance at the Latin Quarter in New York, the group recorded another studio album, ''Ramblin''', which included \"Green, Green\", a McGuire/Sparks composition that became the group's first hit single, peaking at number three on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary Charts]].<ref name=Amg-NCM-singles/> \"Green, Green\" sold over one million copies in 1963, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/>\n\nIn May 1963, Sparks stopped touring with the group to focus on developing material for the group and opening a night club in Los Angeles called Ledbetter's which he intended to use as a magnet for fresh talent and a training ground for future minstrels in the event he needed replacements.  By the end of the year he had formed [[The Back Porch Majority]],<ref name=MrPopHistory/> which was positioned initially as the farm team for the New Christy Minstrels. It proved to be a wise move. He passed the role of frontman for the group on the concert trail to McGuire, who had an engaging warmth and charisma that had charmed audiences in concerts and on the Williams appearances. Soon after McGuire's promotion, Ellis left and was replaced by [[Gene Clark]].  Clark was hired before the Back Porch Majority had taken shape, so he went straight into the Minstrels\u2014an exciting, but terrifying challenge for a shy country boy. (He had been discovered at a local club in Kansas City while the group was on tour.) Although a talented singer, Clark was inhibited by the cocky confidence of his new bandmates and was hesitant in lobbying for a turn at the mike, so on stage he tended to withdraw to the side and had a low key presence. Sparks was not satisfied with his lack of spirit on stage and, by the end of the year, had concluded he needed to find a replacement.  In part because he saw the writing on the wall, but also because he was losing interest in folk music (amidst the British Invasion triggered by The Beatles), Clark quit the group early in 1964 of his own volition.   Within a few weeks, he joined [[Roger McGuinn|Jim McGuinn]] and [[David Crosby]] in the Jet Set, and later [[The Byrds]].  Clark was replaced by Paul Potash, a former singer partner of Art Podell (in Art and Paul, a successful folk duo back in 1960-1961). At the about the same time, the group's two female singers, Jackie Miller and Gayle Caldwell, also left, tired of the group's grueling concert schedule.  They were replaced by alto Karen Gunderson, formerly a featured vocalist in a folk trio called The Sherwood Singers, and soprano Ann White.<ref name=WhyFame/> All three replacements were \"graduates\" of The Back Porch Majority farm team program, promoted to the Minstrels in late February 1964. (Miller and Caldwell launched a successful career as a pop/folk duo called Jackie and Gayle, quickly landing a recording contract with Capitol Records and a spot as semi-regulars on ABC's Shindig in the fall of 1964. In fact, Jackie and Gayle were the first artists to take the stage on the premiere episode of that influential show.)\n\nLate in 1963, Sparks had been contracted to create a [[film score]] for ''[[Advance to the Rear]]'', featuring [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Stella Stevens]]. The corresponding soundtrack performed by The New Christy Minstrels was released in May 1964 as ''Today and Other songs from 'Advance to the Rear'''.<ref name=Amg-NCM-Today-song>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2518726|pure_url=yes}} |title=Today |work=[[AllMusic]] |first=William |last=Ruhlmann |accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref> It was the first complete soundtrack ever made in the folk music style.

Each episode had an outdoor setting, with two filmed at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] and three at popular venues in the Los Angeles area\u2014Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and Pacific Ocean Park.  A guest comedian appeared with the group in each episode. ''Ford Presents the New Christy Minstrels'' ran for five weeks, from August 6 to September 10, 1964, airing on NBC from 9:30&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. ET on Thursday throughout its run.<ref name=\"mcneil\">McNeil, Alex, ''Total Television: The Comprehensive Guide to Programming from 1948 to the Present'', New York: Penguin Books, 1996, p. 595.</ref><ref name=\"Brooks and Marsh\">Brooks, Tim, and Earle Marsh, ''The Complete Directory to Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present, Sixth Edition'', New York: Ballantine Books, 1995, {{ISBN|0-345-39736-3}}, p. 736.</ref>\n\nIn late summer of 1964, Randy Sparks decided to sell his interests in the group to his business partners, Greif-Garris Management (George Greif and Sid Garris.)  He shifted his focus to Ledbetters, reviving his solo career, and launching the careers of other groups.  By this time, the name \"Randy Sparks\" had become a magnet for aspiring talent, so Randy's club soon became a showcase for performers who later went on to major fame.  Among these were John Denver, the Carpenters, the Hagers, Gary Muledeer, comedian Steve Martin and many others.  His farm team for the Christies\u2014the Back Porch Majority\u2014were soon launched on a successful career of their own.\n\nIn January 1965, the New Christy Minstrels, now under the leadership of Greif-Garris, embarked on their first European tour, appearing in London, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Amsterdam and, finally, at the prestigious San Remo Festival in Italy where they performed the two winning songs.  One of these songs, \"Le Colline Sono in Fiore,\" which featured a romantic duet by Nick Woods and Karen Gunderson, became a No. 1 hit single in Italy early in the spring.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=h0UEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&dq \"New Christy Minstrels to Start First European Trek in January\"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', August 8, 1964</ref>   Upon the group's return to the States, McGuire left to embark on a solo career.  Because he had been the group's front man for 18 months by then\u2014and the familiar voice on \"Green, Green,\" their biggest hit\u2014his departure spelled the end of the original New Christy Minstrels in the minds of the fans. Greif-Garris had roots in the big band era and never had any interest in folk music (which was fading fast anyway,) so they started to move the group towards more of a variety act, doing \"novelty and pop tunes\" and a little comedy.  Reflecting this shift, they had a ''Billboard'' Top 100 hit in the spring of 1965 with a cover of \"[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]\" from the Disney film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.<ref name=\"Amg-NCM-singles\" />  They also performed the song \"live\" on the Academy Award telecast the night it won \"Best Song.\"\n\nTurnover in the group's roster started to accelerate through 1965, and at an even faster rate in the years that followed.   Paul Potash had left the same time as McGuire in early February.  They were replaced by pop/folk singers Bob Buchanan and Michael Whalen, respectively, both performers on the LA club circuit.  In April 1965, Barry Kane quit and was replaced by Will Teague; in late July, Clarence Treat was replaced by Bill Skiles and Pete Henderson, aka [[Skiles and Henderson]], a comedy duo that broadened The New Christy Minstrels's stage act. In September, Nick Woods was replaced by [[Rusty Evans]], and, in January 1966 Larry Ramos left, eventually joining [[The Association]], and was replaced by noted folksinger/songwriter [[Mike Settle]].  In late February, Art Podell, Karen Gunderson and Michael Whalen left.  Among their replacements were singer/songwriter Michael McGinnis and  pop/folk singer Ede Mae Kellogg (sister of Lynn Kellogg, of the Broadway cast of Hair).  In July 1966, Ann White left\u2014the last player to leave who had worked in the group during the Sparks era.  She was replaced by Kim Carnes (later of \"Bette Davis Eyes\" fame).  Ann White's departure was part of a major personnel shake up.  She, Skiles and Henderson, Will Teague and Bob Buchanan all left at about the same time.  Among their replacements (in addition to Kim Carnes) were folksinger Mark Holly, former Fairmount Singer Dave Ellingson, tenor Terry Williams and a pop singer from Texas by the name of Kenny Rogers.  In 1967, Williams and Mike Settle made plans to leave the Minstrels and form a folk/rock group back in Los Angeles.  They recruited Kenny Rogers into the project late in the spring along with another minstrel, Thelma Camacho, a soprano who had been classically trained, but had a bluesy edge to her sound.  Together as a quartet, joined by drummer Mickey Jones, they debuted as The First Edition in August 1967 on the Ledbetter's stage.   In the years that followed, Rogers broke out and became a huge success in country music.  In the spring of 1980, he reunited with old band-mate Kim Carnes for a duet, \"Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer,\"  which became a No. 4 hit on the Hot 100.\n\nThe rapid turnover took a toll on the group's sound as an ensemble. While the group almost always featured top talent throughout the Sixties and into the early Seventies, the constant churn made it effectively impossible to hone a group blend.  During the days on The Andy Williams Show, the group roster was more stable and the group had the key advantage of working with the show's musical/choral director, George Wyle.  Week after week, they would work with him on new choral arrangements to back Williams and his guest stars, in addition to performing their own spotlight material.  As a result, they honed a beautiful sound as a chorus in their own right\u2014which was on full display on their \"Ramblin'\" album in particular, which was recorded in Columbia's 30th studio, once an old church and known for its superb acoustics.  None of the line-ups in later years had such an advantage.  The concerts were entertaining, but\u2014with a couple of fleeting exceptions (spring 1965 and late 1972)\u2014the group sound never matched the quality they had achieved with George Wyle at the outset.\n\nFrom the late Sixties, through the Seventies and into the mid-Eighties, the New Christy Minstrels continued to perform across the country\u2014all under the management of Greif-Garris. Within this timeframe they released a few more albums, including \"On Tour Through Motortown\" in 1968, which in the years since has become a kitsch classic as an album of Motown songs, performed with pop arrangements by a fading folk group, desperately seeking renewed relevance.  In 1970, they performed during [[Super Bowl IV]] at [[Tulane Stadium]] in New Orleans. They were introduced as \"young Americans who demonstrate \u2013 with guitars.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Steve|title=Sponsors at the Super Bowl eclipse big game with glitz|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-01-29/features/1995029174_1_doritos-super-bowl-bowl-iv|accessdate=9 May 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 29, 1995}}</ref>  Note: Some sources erroneously report that the group disbanded in the early 1970s and reformed late in the decade.  This is not true.  Towards the end of 1972, Sid Garris was faced with a revolt among the members who had clicked as an ensemble, earning enthusiastic responses from their audiences.  The members confronted Greif-Garris to gain more creative control and more equitable treatment.  Rather than acquiesce, Greif-Garris fired the group en masse and started rebuilding from scratch.  No doubt, this is the source of the rumor that the group was disbanded in the early 1970s.\n\nIn the late 1980s and into the early 1990s, the group's concert activity declined steadily until it stopped completely.  Early in the new millennium, Randy Sparks was able to register a trademark on the (dormant) New Christy Minstrels name and once again became the leader of the group he had started almost 50 years before.  He launched a revamped, reinvigorated group on a new series of concerts, playing to sold-out crowds and standing ovations\u2014a satisfying renaissance for the man who started it all.\n\n==Today==\nIn 2009, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to Randy Sparks and The New Christy Minstrels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf|title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated|website=Palmspringswalkofstars.com|accessdate=27 October 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=}}</ref> In May 2010, the group embarked on a highly successful tour, performing 33 concerts over 54 days in October and November of that year.\n\n==Foundation==\nThe New Christy Minstrels are currently run and owned by the New Christy Minstrels Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to preserving the group's music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newchristyminstrelsfoundation.org |title=foundation_home |publisher=Newchristyminstrelsfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-08}}</ref>\n\n==Current group members==\nFounder Randy Sparks has spent the most time in The New Christy Minstrels; second place in that category is Becky Jo Benson, who has been an active member non-stop since 1997.

Minstrels''' are an American large-ensemble [[folk music]] group founded by [[Randy Sparks]] in 1961. From their beginnings as prominent figures in the early-1960s U.S. folk revival, the group has recorded over 20 albums and had several hits, including \"Green, Green\", \"Saturday Night\", \"Today\", \"Denver\", and \"[[This Land Is Your Land]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=The New Christy Minstrels |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-new-christy-minstrels-mn0000328352/songs |title=The New Christy Minstrels - Songs |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-10-08}}</ref> Their 1962 debut album, ''[[Presenting The New Christy Minstrels]]'', won a [[5th Grammy Awards#Pop|Grammy Award]] and was on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] for two years.<ref name=Amg-NCM/>\n\nThe group has sold millions of records and were in demand at concerts and on television shows.<ref name=WhyFame/> They also helped to launch the musical careers of several musicians, including [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Gene Clark]], [[Kim Carnes]], and [[Barry McGuire]].<ref name=WhyFame/>\n\n==History==\nThe New Christy Minstrels were formed by singer/guitarist [[Randy Sparks]] in 1961. Sparks had been a solo performer in the late 1950s, mixing folk music with pop standards and playing successful club dates on the West Coast and in Manhattan. Twice winner of the All-Navy Talent competition, he landed a number of high-profile television appearances and a recording contract with [[Verve Records]]. At the suggestion of Verve founder [[Norman Granz]] in 1960, he formed \"the Randy Sparks 3\" with his wife, Jackie Miller, and singer/arranger Nick Woods. After a year touring with his trio, he realized he wanted a still larger group. At the time, folk music was very popular and choral groups like the [[Norman Luboff]] Choir had begun incorporating folk classics in their repertoires, but\u2014in Sparks' opinion\u2014they sang too perfectly, lacking the rustic, earthy character of folk performance. Throughout the latter months of 1961 and into early 1962, Sparks created a 14-voice ensemble - The New Christy Minstrels\u2014by combining his trio with a quartet he met in the Pacific Northwest called the Fairmount Singers (Dave Ellingson, Terry Tillman, Hal Ayotte and Robbie Mills), another trio called The Inn Group (John Forsha, Karol Dugan and [[Jerry Yester]]), banjo player Billy Cudmore, folk-blues singer Terry Wadsworth, folk singer [[Dolan Ellis]] and singer/guitarist Art Podell.<ref name=Amg-NCM/><ref name=Amg-Presenting/> Large commercial folk groups did not exist in those days, and The New Christy Minstrels delivered a robust new sound. An avid historian of [[Americana]], Sparks named his group after [[Christy's Minstrels]], a [[blackface]] group formed by Philadelphia-born showman [[Edwin Pearce Christy]] in 1842 and known primarily for introducing many of Stephen Foster's compositions. In a similar way, Sparks envisioned his group\u2014with its innovative sound\u2014as a means to attract attention to his own writing, which consisted of original songs and fresh adaptations of folk classics.\n\nAt the outset, the original plan was that the group would be a recording act only, and several charter members joined with the assumption that their commitment would be for only occasional studio work to supplement their individual careers. In April 1962 the group, reduced to 10 members after the early departure of the Fairmount Singers, recorded their debut album, ''[[Presenting The New Christy Minstrels]]'', for [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=Amg-Presenting/> Eventually, the album won a [[Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Chorus]]<ref name=Amg-NCM/> and sat on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] charts for two years, peaking at number 19.<ref name=Amg-NCM/> The album included [[Woody Guthrie]]'s \"[[This Land Is Your Land]]\", which entered the pop singles charts in December 1962.<ref name=Amg-NCM-singles/>\n\nHowever, prior to the album's release, [[Irving Townsend]], head of Columbia Records West Coast A&R, demanded of Sparks that he turn the group into a legitimate performing ensemble that could make live appearances to promote their releases; otherwise, he would not release the album. Sparks promptly agreed and, at Townsend's request, hired business managers George Greif and Sid Garris (Greif-Garris Management) to help his dauntingly large, unproven group get bookings to generate the revenue stream needed to cover the hefty payroll and business costs.  Unfortunately, some of the charter recruits had no interest in committing full-time to what they saw as a high risk project; others had contract obligations of their own and were simply not available.  The Inn Group (Jerry Yester, Karol Dugan, John Forsha), Terry Wadsworth and Billy Cudmore all quit the group a few weeks after the recording sessions. Sparks ended up losing half of his charter roster at almost the exact moment that his new business managers landed a major booking for the group to become regulars on ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', a weekly variety show set to debut in the fall of 1962. Sparks, Greif-Garris and some of the remaining members immediately started looking for replacements. Among the new hires were the folk duo Barry & Barry (folksingers [[Barry McGuire]] and Barry Kane), vocalist [[Peggy Connelly]], singer/banjoist [[Larry Ramos]], and tenor Clarence Treat (upright bass and mandolin). The new lineup broke in their act at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in Los Angeles in July\u2013August 1962, which included a mix of folk Americana performed by the ensemble (usually Sparks' reworkings of folk melodies), a smattering of vaudevillian humor and step out solos, duos and trios by the members. They were a smash success and garnered rave reviews from both ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']].\n\nPrior to the debut of the Williams television show, the group appeared with Andy at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] in September. When the Williams Show debuted in October, the New Christy Minstrels quickly became one of the most popular features of the program. Several weeks into the Williams season, Connelly was replaced by vocalist Gayle Caldwell. This became the group roster that the public would come to know throughout the 1962-63 television season and the line-up most closely associated with the group's subsequent hit recordings:  To review, that roster is: Randy Sparks, Jackie Miller, Nick Woods, Dolan Ellis, Art Podell, Barry McGuire, Barry Kane, Larry Ramos, Clarence Treat and Gayle Caldwell. The new group was starting out at a stunning pace. In early December, they appeared at the Coconut Grove with comedian George Gobel, and over the holidays they appeared at Carnegie Hall with singer/comedian Allan Sherman\u2014a stunning accomplishment for such a new ensemble.\n\nThe group's second album, ''The New Christy Minstrels in Person'', was released in February 1963 (recorded in September 1962 while Connelly was still in the line-up). In January 1963, the group recorded ''The New Christy Minstrels Tell Tall Tales! (Legends and Nonsense)'', which was released in May shortly after the ''Andy Williams Show'' had wrapped for the season. By now the group's fame had grown considerably, and they received \"a raft of enthusiastic reviews\".<ref name=WhyFame/> In April 1963, following a successful appearance at the Latin Quarter in New York, the group recorded another studio album, ''Ramblin''', which included \"Green, Green\", a McGuire/Sparks composition that became the group's first hit single, peaking at number three on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary Charts]].<ref name=Amg-NCM-singles/> \"Green, Green\" sold over one million copies in 1963, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/>\n\nIn May 1963, Sparks stopped touring with the group to focus on developing material for the group and opening a night club in Los Angeles called Ledbetter's which he intended to use as a magnet for fresh talent and a training ground for future minstrels in the event he needed replacements.  By the end of the year he had formed [[The Back Porch Majority]],<ref name=MrPopHistory/> which was positioned initially as the farm team for the New Christy Minstrels. It proved to be a wise move. He passed the role of frontman for the group on the concert trail to McGuire, who had an engaging warmth and charisma that had charmed audiences in concerts and on the Williams appearances. Soon after McGuire's promotion, Ellis left and was replaced by [[Gene Clark]].  Clark was hired before the Back Porch Majority had taken shape, so he went straight into the Minstrels\u2014an exciting, but terrifying challenge for a shy country boy. (He had been discovered at a local club in Kansas City while the group was on tour.) Although a talented singer, Clark was inhibited by the cocky confidence of his new bandmates and was hesitant in lobbying for a turn at the mike, so on stage he tended to withdraw to the side and had a low key presence. Sparks was not satisfied with his lack of spirit on stage and, by the end of the year, had concluded he needed to find a replacement.  In part because he saw the writing on the wall, but also because he was losing interest in folk music (amidst the British Invasion triggered by The Beatles), Clark quit the group early in 1964 of his own volition.   Within a few weeks, he joined [[Roger McGuinn|Jim McGuinn]] and [[David Crosby]] in the Jet Set, and later [[The Byrds]].  Clark was replaced by Paul Potash, a former singer partner of Art Podell (in Art and Paul, a successful folk duo back in 1960-1961). At the about the same time, the group's two female singers, Jackie Miller and Gayle Caldwell, also left, tired of the group's grueling concert schedule.  They were replaced by alto Karen Gunderson, formerly a featured vocalist in a folk trio called The Sherwood Singers, and soprano Ann White.<ref name=WhyFame/> All three replacements were \"graduates\" of The Back Porch Majority farm team program, promoted to the Minstrels in late February 1964. (Miller and Caldwell launched a successful career as a pop/folk duo called Jackie and Gayle, quickly landing a recording contract with Capitol Records and a spot as semi-regulars on ABC's Shindig in the fall of 1964. In fact, Jackie and Gayle were the first artists to take the stage on the premiere episode of that influential show.)\n\nLate in 1963, Sparks had been contracted to create a [[film score]] for ''[[Advance to the Rear]]'', featuring [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Stella Stevens]]. The corresponding soundtrack performed by The New Christy Minstrels was released in May 1964 as ''Today and Other songs from 'Advance to the Rear'''.<ref name=Amg-NCM-Today-song>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2518726|pure_url=yes}} |title=Today |work=[[AllMusic]] |first=William |last=Ruhlmann |accessdate=2010-07-20}}</ref> It was the first complete soundtrack ever made in the folk music style.

Each episode had an outdoor setting, with two filmed at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] and three at popular venues in the Los Angeles area\u2014Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and Pacific Ocean Park.  A guest comedian appeared with the group in each episode. ''Ford Presents the New Christy Minstrels'' ran for five weeks, from August 6 to September 10, 1964, airing on NBC from 9:30&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. ET on Thursday throughout its run.<ref name=\"mcneil\">McNeil, Alex, ''Total Television: The Comprehensive Guide to Programming from 1948 to the Present'', New York: Penguin Books, 1996, p. 595.</ref><ref name=\"Brooks and Marsh\">Brooks, Tim, and Earle Marsh, ''The Complete Directory to Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present, Sixth Edition'', New York: Ballantine Books, 1995, {{ISBN|0-345-39736-3}}, p. 736.</ref>\n\nIn late summer of 1964, Randy Sparks decided to sell his interests in the group to his business partners, Greif-Garris Management (George Greif and Sid Garris.)  He shifted his focus to Ledbetters, reviving his solo career, and launching the careers of other groups.  By this time, the name \"Randy Sparks\" had become a magnet for aspiring talent, so Randy's club soon became a showcase for performers who later went on to major fame.  Among these were John Denver, the Carpenters, the Hagers, Gary Muledeer, comedian Steve Martin and many others.  His farm team for the Christies\u2014the Back Porch Majority\u2014were soon launched on a successful career of their own.\n\nIn January 1965, the New Christy Minstrels, now under the leadership of Greif-Garris, embarked on their first European tour, appearing in London, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Amsterdam and, finally, at the prestigious San Remo Festival in Italy where they performed the two winning songs.  One of these songs, \"Le Colline Sono in Fiore,\" which featured a romantic duet by Nick Woods and Karen Gunderson, became a #1 hit single in Italy early in the spring.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=h0UEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA6&dq \"New Christy Minstrels to Start First European Trek in January\"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', August 8, 1964</ref>   Upon the group's return to the States, McGuire left to embark on a solo career.  Because he had been the group's front man for 18 months by then\u2014and the familiar voice on \"Green, Green,\" their biggest hit\u2014his departure spelled the end of the original New Christy Minstrels in the minds of the fans. Greif-Garris had roots in the big band era and never had any interest in folk music (which was fading fast anyway,) so they started to move the group towards more of a variety act, doing \"novelty and pop tunes\" and a little comedy.  Reflecting this shift, they had a ''Billboard'' Top 100 hit in the spring of 1965 with a cover of \"[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]\" from the Disney film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.<ref name=\"Amg-NCM-singles\" />  They also performed the song \"live\" on the Academy Award telecast the night it won \"Best Song.\"\n\nTurnover in the group's roster started to accelerate through 1965, and at an even faster rate in the years that followed.   Paul Potash had left the same time as McGuire in early February.  They were replaced by pop/folk singers Bob Buchanan and Michael Whalen, respectively, both performers on the LA club circuit.  In April 1965, Barry Kane quit and was replaced by Will Teague; in late July, Clarence Treat was replaced by Bill Skiles and Pete Henderson, aka [[Skiles and Henderson]], a comedy duo that broadened The New Christy Minstrels's stage act. In September, Nick Woods was replaced by [[Rusty Evans]], and, in January 1966 Larry Ramos left, eventually joining [[The Association]], and was replaced by noted folksinger/songwriter [[Mike Settle]].  In late February, Art Podell, Karen Gunderson and Michael Whalen left.  Among their replacements were singer/songwriter Michael McGinnis and  pop/folk singer Ede Mae Kellogg (sister of Lynn Kellogg, of the Broadway cast of Hair).  In July 1966, Ann White left\u2014the last player to leave who had worked in the group during the Sparks era.  She was replaced by Kim Carnes (later of \"Bette Davis Eyes\" fame).  Ann White's departure was part of a major personnel shake up.  She, Skiles and Henderson, Will Teague and Bob Buchanan all left at about the same time.  Among their replacements (in addition to Kim Carnes) were folksinger Mark Holly, former Fairmount Singer Dave Ellingson, tenor Terry Williams and a pop singer from Texas by the name of Kenny Rogers.  In 1967, Williams and Mike Settle made plans to leave the Minstrels and form a folk/rock group back in Los Angeles.  They recruited Kenny Rogers into the project late in the spring along with another minstrel, Thelma Camacho, a soprano who had been classically trained, but had a bluesy edge to her sound.  Together as a quartet, joined by drummer Mickey Jones, they debuted as The First Edition in August 1967 on the Ledbetter's stage.   In the years that followed, Rogers broke out and became a huge success in country music.  In the spring of 1980, he reunited with old band-mate Kim Carnes for a duet, \"Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer,\"  which became a No. 4 hit on the Hot 100.\n\nThe rapid turnover took a toll on the group's sound as an ensemble. While the group almost always featured top talent throughout the Sixties and into the early Seventies, the constant churn made it effectively impossible to hone a group blend.  During the days on The Andy Williams Show, the group roster was more stable and the group had the key advantage of working with the show's musical/choral director, George Wyle.  Week after week, they would work with him on new choral arrangements to back Williams and his guest stars, in addition to performing their own spotlight material.  As a result, they honed a beautiful sound as a chorus in their own right\u2014which was on full display on their \"Ramblin'\" album in particular, which was recorded in Columbia's 30th studio, once an old church and known for its superb acoustics.  None of the line-ups in later years had such an advantage.  The concerts were entertaining, but\u2014with a couple of fleeting exceptions (spring 1965 and late 1972)\u2014the group sound never matched the quality they had achieved with George Wyle at the outset.\n\nFrom the late Sixties, through the Seventies and into the mid-Eighties, the New Christy Minstrels continued to perform across the country\u2014all under the management of Greif-Garris. Within this timeframe they released a few more albums, including \"On Tour Through Motortown\" in 1968, which in the years since has become a kitsch classic as an album of Motown songs, performed with pop arrangements by a fading folk group, desperately seeking renewed relevance.  In 1970, they performed during [[Super Bowl IV]] at [[Tulane Stadium]] in New Orleans. They were introduced as \"young Americans who demonstrate \u2013 with guitars.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Steve|title=Sponsors at the Super Bowl eclipse big game with glitz|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-01-29/features/1995029174_1_doritos-super-bowl-bowl-iv|accessdate=9 May 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 29, 1995}}</ref>  Note: Some sources erroneously report that the group disbanded in the early 1970s and reformed late in the decade.  This is not true.  Towards the end of 1972, Sid Garris was faced with a revolt among the members who had clicked as an ensemble, earning enthusiastic responses from their audiences.  The members confronted Greif-Garris to gain more creative control and more equitable treatment.  Rather than acquiesce, Greif-Garris fired the group en masse and started rebuilding from scratch.  No doubt, this is the source of the rumor that the group was disbanded in the early 1970s.\n\nIn the late 1980s and into the early 1990s, the group's concert activity declined steadily until it stopped completely.  Early in the new millennium, Randy Sparks was able to register a trademark on the (dormant) New Christy Minstrels name and once again became the leader of the group he had started almost 50 years before.  He launched a revamped, reinvigorated group on a new series of concerts, playing to sold-out crowds and standing ovations\u2014a satisfying renaissance for the man who started it all.\n\n==Today==\nIn 2009, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to Randy Sparks and The New Christy Minstrels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf|title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated|website=Palmspringswalkofstars.com|accessdate=27 October 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf|archivedate=13 October 2012|df=}}</ref> In May 2010, the group embarked on a highly successful tour, performing 33 concerts over 54 days in October and November of that year.\n\n==Foundation==\nThe New Christy Minstrels are currently run and owned by the New Christy Minstrels Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to preserving the group's music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newchristyminstrelsfoundation.org |title=foundation_home |publisher=Newchristyminstrelsfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-08}}</ref>\n\n==Current group members==\nFounder Randy Sparks has spent the most time in The New Christy Minstrels; second place in that category is Becky Jo Benson, who has been an active member non-stop since 1997.
