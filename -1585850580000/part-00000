The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even logically contradictory ideas such as creating square circles. A no-limits understanding of omnipotence such as this has been rejected by theologians from  [[Thomas Aquinas]] to contemporary philosophers of religion, such as [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|Alvin Plantinga]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=God, Freedom, and Evil|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1977|isbn=0-8028-1731-9|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=[https://archive.org/details/godfreedomevil00plan/page/ Chapter 4]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/godfreedomevil00plan/page/}}</ref> Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for atheism{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}, though Christian theologians and philosophers, such as [[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]], contend that a no-limits understanding of omnipotence is not relevant to orthodox Christian theology. Other possible resolutions to the paradox hinge on the definition of omnipotence applied and the nature of God regarding this application and whether omnipotence is directed toward God himself or outward toward his external surroundings.\n\nThe omnipotence paradox has medieval origins, dating at least to the 12th century. It was addressed by [[Averro\u00ebs]]<ref name=\"TT\">[[Averro\u00ebs]], ''Tahafut al-Tahafut (The Incoherence of the Incoherence)'' trans. Simon Van Den Bergh, Luzac & Company 1969, sections 529\u2013536</ref> and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref name=TA/> [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to \"deny himself\".\n\nThe most well-known version of the omnipotence paradox is the so-called ''paradox of the stone'': \"Could God create a stone so heavy that even He could not lift it?\"<ref name=\"Savage, C. Wade 1967 pp. 74\">Savage, C. Wade. \"The Paradox of the Stone\" ''Philosophical Review'', Vol. 76, No. 1 (Jan., 1967), pp. 74\u201379 {{doi|10.2307/2182966}}</ref> This phrasing of the omnipotence paradox is vulnerable to objections based on the physical nature of [[gravity]], such as how the [[weight]] of an object depends on what the local gravitational field is. Alternative statements of the paradox that do not involve such difficulties include \"If given the axioms of Euclidean geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to 180 degrees?\" and \"Can God create a prison so secure that he cannot escape from it?\". (OK, LK Hart added) If God is great,can he destroy the universe without destroying himself?\n\n==Overview==\nA common modern version of the omnipotence paradox is expressed in the question: \"Can [an omnipotent being] create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?\" This question generates a dilemma. The being can either create a stone it cannot lift, or it cannot create a stone it cannot lift. If the being {{em|can}} create a stone that it cannot lift, then it is not omnipotent because there is a weight threshold beyond its own power to lift. If the being {{em|cannot}} create a stone it cannot lift, then there is something it cannot create, and is therefore not omnipotent. In either case, God is not omnipotent.<ref name=\"Savage, C. Wade 1967 pp. 74\"/>\n\nA related issue is whether the concept of \"logically possible\" is different for a world in which omnipotence exists than a world in which omnipotence does not exist.\n\nThe dilemma of omnipotence is similar to another classic paradox\u2014the [[irresistible force paradox]]: \"What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an immovable object?\" One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Some claim{{who|date=May 2015}} that the only way out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. But this is not a way out, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/the-omnipotence-paradox-has-puzzled-people-for-centuries-curiosity/|title=The Omnipotence Paradox Has Puzzled People For Centuries|website=curiosity.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> <!--If they are GUARANTEED not to meet then I don't see what the problem is.-->\n\n==Types of omnipotence==\n{{Main|Omnipotence}}\n[[Peter Geach]] describes and rejects four levels of omnipotence. He also defines and defends a lesser notion of the \"almightiness\" of God.\n\n#\"Y is '''absolutely omnipotent'''\" means that \"Y\" can do anything that can be expressed in a string of words even if it is self-[[contradiction|contradictory]]: \"Y\" is not bound by the laws of logic.\"<ref name=\"Geach\">Geach, P. T. \"Omnipotence\" 1973 in Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 63\u201375</ref>   \n#\"Y is '''omnipotent'''\" means \"Y can do X\" is true [[if and only if]] X is a logically consistent description of a state of affairs. This position was once advocated by [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref name=TA>[[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas, Thomas]] [[Summa Theologica]] Book 1 Question 25 article 3</ref> This definition of omnipotence solves some of the paradoxes associated with omnipotence, but some modern formulations of the paradox still work against this definition. Let X = \"to make something that its maker cannot lift.\" As [[George I. Mavrodes|Mavrodes]] points out, there is nothing logically contradictory about this. A man could, for example, make a boat that he could not lift.<ref name=\"Mavrodes\">Mavrodes, George. \"[http://spot.colorado.edu/~kaufmad/courses/Mavrodes.pdf Some Puzzles Concerning Omnipotence]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\" first published 1963 now in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 131\u201334</ref>   \n#\"Y is '''omnipotent'''\" means \"Y can do X\" is true if and only if \"Y does X\" is logically consistent. Here the idea is to exclude actions that are inconsistent for Y to do but might be consistent for others. Again sometimes it looks as if Aquinas takes this position.<ref>[[Aquinas]] [[Summa Theologica]] Book 1 Question 25 article 4 response #3</ref> Here Mavrodes' worry about X= \"to make something its maker cannot lift\" is no longer a problem, because \"God does X\" is not logically consistent. However, this account may still have problems with moral issues like X = \"tells a lie\" or temporal issues like X = \"brings it about that Rome was never founded.\"<ref name = \"Geach\" />\n#\"Y is '''omnipotent'''\" means whenever \"Y will bring about X\" is logically possible, then \"Y can bring about X\" is true. This sense, also does not allow the paradox of omnipotence to arise, and unlike definition #3 avoids any temporal worries about whether an omnipotent being could change the past. However, Geach criticizes even this sense of omnipotence as misunderstanding the nature of God's promises.<ref name = \"Geach\" />\n#\"Y is '''almighty'''\" means that Y is not just more powerful than any creature; no creature can compete with Y in power, even unsuccessfully.<ref name=\"Geach\" /> In this account nothing like the omnipotence paradox arises, but perhaps that is because God is not taken to be in any sense omnipotent. On the other hand, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] seems to think that almightiness is one of the things that make God count as omnipotent.<ref name = \"amselm\">[[Anselm of Canterbury]] Proslogion Chap VII in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] in his [[City of God (book)|City of God]] writes \"[[God]] is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills\" and thus proposes the definition that \"Y is '''omnipotent'''\" means \"If Y wishes to do X then Y can and does do X\". \n \nThe notion of omnipotence can also be applied to an entity in different ways. An '''essentially omnipotent''' being is an entity that is necessarily omnipotent. In contrast, an '''accidentally omnipotent''' being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.<ref name=\"Hoffman\">Hoffman, Joshua, Rosenkrantz, Gary.

Harper and Brothers, 1900.</ref> Some modern approaches to the problem have involved [[semantics|semantic]] debates over whether language\u2014and therefore philosophy\u2014can meaningfully address the concept of omnipotence itself.<ref>[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein, Ludwig.]] [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] (6.41 and following)</ref>\n\n==Proposed answers==\n\n===Omnipotence doesn't mean breaking the laws of logic===\n\nA common response from Christian philosophers, such as [[Norman Geisler]] or [[William Lane Craig]], is that the paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, does not mean that God can do anything ''at all'' but, rather, that he can do ''anything that's possible according to his nature.'' The distinction is important. God cannot perform logical absurdities; he cannot, for instance, make 1+1=3. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature. The Bible supports this, they assert, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, which says it is \"impossible for God to lie.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.equip.org/article/any-absolutes-absolutely/ |title = Any Absolutes? Absolutely!}}</ref><ref>https://www.alwaysbeready.com/images/stories/alwaysbeready/geisler%20norman%20-%20how%20to%20approach%20bible%20difficulties%20a.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAnother common response to the omnipotence paradox is to try to define omnipotence to mean something weaker than absolute omnipotence, such as definition 3 or 4 above. The paradox can be resolved by simply stipulating that omnipotence does not require that the being have abilities that are logically impossible, but only be able to do anything that conforms to the laws of logic. A good example of a modern defender of this line of reasoning is George Mavrodes.<ref name = \"Mavrodes\" /> Essentially, Mavrodes argues that it is no limitation on a being's omnipotence to say that it cannot make a round square. Such a \"task\" is termed by him a \"pseudo-task\" as it is self-contradictory and inherently nonsense. [[Harry Frankfurt]]\u2014following from Descartes\u2014has responded to this solution with a proposal of his own: that God can create a stone impossible to lift and also lift said stone<blockquote>For why should God not be able to perform the task in question? To be sure, it is a task\u2014the task of lifting a stone which He cannot lift\u2014whose description is self-contradictory. But if God is supposed capable of performing one task whose description is self-contradictory\u2014that of creating the problematic stone in the first place\u2014why should He not be supposed capable of performing another\u2014that of lifting the stone? After all, is there any greater trick in performing two logically impossible tasks than there is in performing one?<ref name=\"frankfurt\">Frankfurt, Harry. \"The Logic of Omnipotence\" first published in 1964 in ''[[Philosophical Review]]'' and now in ''Necessity, Volition, and Love''. [[Cambridge University Press]] November 28, 1998 pp.1\u20132</ref></blockquote>\n\nIf a being is ''accidentally omnipotent'', it can resolve the paradox by creating a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, it is possible for an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, of whether the being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power.<ref name=\"Hoffman\" /> On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of as central to the notion of the Christian Incarnation.<ref name=\"gore\">Gore, Charles, \"A Kenotic Theory of Incarnation\" first published 1891, in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 165\u201368</ref>\n\nIf a being is ''essentially omnipotent'', then it can also resolve the paradox (as long as we take omnipotence not to require absolute omnipotence). The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent, and therefore it is impossible for it to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible\u2014just like the accidentally omnipotent\u2014and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.\n\nThe omnipotent being cannot create such a stone because its power is equal to itself\u2014thus, removing the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2\u2014as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, it is possible for non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position [[Augustine of Hippo]] took in his ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'':<blockquote>For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.V.10.html|title=NPNF1-02. St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThus Augustine argued that God could not do anything or create any situation that would, in effect, make God not God.\n\nIn a 1955 article in the philosophy journal ''Mind'', [[J. L. Mackie]] tried to resolve the paradox by distinguishing between first-order omnipotence (unlimited power to act) and second-order omnipotence (unlimited power to determine what powers to act things shall have).<ref>[[J. L. Mackie|Mackie, J. L.]], \"Evil and Omnipotence.\" ''Mind'' LXIV, No, 254 (April 1955).</ref> An omnipotent being with both first and second-order omnipotence at a particular time might restrict its own power to act and, henceforth, cease to be omnipotent in either sense. There has been considerable philosophical dispute since Mackie, as to the best way to formulate the paradox of omnipotence in formal logic.<ref name = \"TPoG\">The Power of God: Readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978. Keene and Mayo disagree p. 145, Savage provides 3 formalizations p. 138\u201341, Cowan has a different strategy p. 147, and Walton uses a whole separate strategy p. 153\u201363</ref>\n\n;God and logic\n\n: <p>Although the most common translation of the noun \"Logos\" is \"Word\" other translations have been used. Gordon Clark (1902\u20131985), a Calvinist theologian and expert on pre-Socratic philosophy, famously translated Logos as \"Logic\": \"In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God.\" He meant to imply by this translation that the laws of logic were derived from God and formed part of Creation, and were therefore not a secular principle imposed on the Christian world view.</p><!--\n\n--><p>God obeys the laws of logic because God is eternally logical in the same way that God does not perform evil actions because God is eternally good. So, God, by nature logical and unable to violate the laws of logic, cannot make a boulder so heavy he cannot lift it because that would violate the [[law of non contradiction]] by creating an immovable object and an unstoppable force.</p><!--\n\n--><p>This raises the question, similar to the [[Euthyphro Dilemma]], of where this law of logic, which God is bound to obey, comes from. According to these theologians ([[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]]), this law is not a law above God that he assents to but, rather, logic is an eternal part of God's nature, like his [[omniscience]] or [[omnibenevolence]].</p>\n\n===Paradox is meaningless: the question is sophistry===\n\nAnother common response is that since God is supposedly omnipotent, the phrase \"could not lift\" does not make sense and the paradox is meaningless.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Problem of Pain, Clive Staples Lewis, 1944 MacMillan</ref><ref>Loving Wisdom: Christian Philosophy of Religion by Paul Copan, Chalice Press, 2007 page 46</ref> This may mean that the complexity involved in rightly understanding omnipotence\u2014contra all the logical details involved in misunderstanding it\u2014is a function of the fact that omnipotence, like infinity, is perceived at all by contrasting reference to those complex and variable things, ''which it is not''. An alternative meaning, however, is that a non-corporeal God cannot lift anything, but can raise it (a linguistic pedantry)\u2014or to use the beliefs of Hindus (that there is one God, who can be manifest as several different beings) that whilst it is possible for God to do all things, it is not possible for all his incarnations to do them. As such, God could create a stone so heavy that, in one incarnation, he couldn't lift it, yet could do something that an incarnation that ''could'' lift the stone could not.\n\nThe lifting a rock paradox (''Can God lift a stone larger than he can carry?'') uses human characteristics to cover up the main skeletal structure of the question. With these assumptions made, two arguments can stem from it:\n\n#'''Lifting''' covers up the definition of '''translation''', which means moving something from one point in space to another. With this in mind, the real question would be, \"''Can God move a rock from one location in space to another that is larger than possible?''\" For the rock to be unable to move from one space to another, it would have to be larger than space itself. However, it is impossible for a rock to be larger than space, as space always adjusts itself to cover the space of the rock. If the supposed rock was out of space-time dimension, then the question would not make sense\u2014because it would be impossible to move an object from one location in space to another if there is no space to begin with, meaning the faulting is with the logic of the question and not God's capabilities.\n#The words, \"Lift a Stone\" are used instead to substitute capability. With this in mind, essentially the question is asking if God is incapable, so the real question would be, \"''Is God capable of being incapable?''\" If God is capable of being incapable, it means that He is incapable, because He has the potential to not be able to do something. Conversely, if God is incapable of being incapable, then the two inabilities cancel each other out, making God have the capability to do something.\n\nThe act of killing oneself is not applicable to an omnipotent being, since, despite that such an act does involve some power, it also involves a ''lack'' of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely ''synthetic'': constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent [[omnipresence]].\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] asserts that the paradox arises from a misunderstanding of omnipotence. He maintains that inherent contradictions and logical impossibilities do not fall under the omnipotence of God.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1 |title=Summa Theologica |publisher=Ccel.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314053544/http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1 |archive-date=2007-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  J. L Cowan sees this paradox as a reason to reject the concept of 'absolute' omnipotence,<ref>Cowan, J. L. \"The Paradox of Omnipotence\" first published 1962, in ''The Power of God: Readings on Omnipotence and Evil''. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 144\u201352</ref> while others, such as [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], argue that God is absolutely omnipotent, despite the problem.<ref name=\"Descartes, Rene 1641\"/>\n\n[[C. S. Lewis]] argues that when talking about omnipotence, referencing \"a rock so heavy that God cannot lift it\" is nonsense just as much as referencing \"a square circle\"; that it is not logically coherent in terms of power to think that omnipotence includes the power to do the logically impossible. So asking \"Can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?\" is just as much nonsense as asking \"Can God draw a square circle?\" The logical contradiction here being God's simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement \"God can lift this rock\" must have a truth value of either true or false, it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone that is too heavy for it to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this does not quite make complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that the only difference is that this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of 'things' included in that end.\n\nIn other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' do is not a ''limit'' on its actual agency, but an ''epistemological boundary'' without which omnipotence could not be ''identified'' (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic [[Liar Paradox]]: If I say, \"I am a liar\", then how can it be true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an ''epistemological'' paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless. Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, \"God can\" before it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Lewis additionally said that, \"Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved.\" This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, ''as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.''\n\n==Language and omnipotence==\nThe philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is frequently interpreted as arguing that language is not up to the task of describing the kind of power an omnipotent being would have. In his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', he stays generally within the realm of [[logical positivism]] until claim 6.4\u2014but at 6.41 and following, he argues that [[ethics]] and several other issues are \"transcendental\" subjects that we cannot examine with language. Wittgenstein also mentions the will, life after death, and God\u2014arguing that, \"When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question be put into words.\"<ref>Wittgenstein, Ludwig. proposition 6.5</ref>\n\nWittgenstein's work expresses the omnipotence paradox as a problem in [[semantics]]\u2014the study of how we give symbols meaning. (The retort \"That's only semantics,\" is a way of saying that a statement only concerns the definitions of words, instead of anything important in the physical world.) According to the ''Tractatus,'' then, even attempting to formulate the omnipotence paradox is futile, since language cannot refer to the entities the paradox considers. The final proposition of the ''Tractatus'' gives Wittgenstein's dictum for these circumstances: \"What we cannot speak of, we must pass over in silence\".<ref>Wittgenstein, Ludwig. proposition 7</ref>\n\nWittgenstein's approach to these problems is influential among other 20th century religious thinkers such as [[D. Z. Phillips]].<ref name=\"phillips\">[[D. Z. Phillips]] \"Philosophy, Theology and the Reality of God\" in Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings. William Rowe and William Wainwright eds. 3rd ed. 1998 Oxford University Press</ref> In his later years, however, Wittgenstein wrote works often interpreted as conflicting with his positions in the ''Tractatus'',<ref name=\"hacker\">Hacker, P.M.S. Wittgenstein's Place in Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy. 1996 Blackwell</ref> and indeed the later Wittgenstein is mainly seen as the leading critic of the early Wittgenstein.\n\n==Other versions of the paradox==\nIn the 6th century, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] claims that a version of the omnipotence paradox constituted the dispute between Paul the Apostle and Elymas the Magician mentioned in [[Acts 13]]:8, but it is phrased in terms of a debate as to whether God can \"deny himself\" ala 2 Tim 2:13.<ref name = \"psd\">[[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], \"Divine Names\" 893B in Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works. trans Colm Luibheid Paulist Press. 1987. {{ISBN|0-8091-2838-1}}</ref> In the 11th century, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] argues that there are many things that God cannot do, but that nonetheless he counts as omnipotent.<ref name=\"anselm\">Anselm of Canterbury Proslogion Chap. VII, in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] advanced a version of the omnipotence paradox by asking whether God could create a triangle with internal angles that did not add up to 180 degrees. As Aquinas put it in ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'':\n\n{{quotation|Since the principles of certain sciences, such as logic, geometry and arithmetic are taken only from the formal principles of things, on which the essence of the thing depends, it follows that God could not make things contrary to these principles. For example, that a genus was not predicable of the species, or that lines drawn from the centre to the circumference were not equal, or that a triangle did not have three angles equal to two right angles.<ref>\"Cum principia quarundam scientiarum, ut logicae, geometriae et arithmeticae, sumantur ex solis principiis formalibus rerum, ex quibus essentia rei dependet, sequitur quod contraria horum principiorum Deus facere non possit: sicut quod genus non sit praedicabile de specie; vel quod lineae ductae a centro ad circumferentiam non sint aequales; aut quod triangulus rectilineus non habeat tres angulos aequales duobus rectis\". Aquinas, T. ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', Book 2, Section 25. trans. Edward Buckner</ref>}}\n\nThis can be done on a sphere, and not on a flat surface. The later invention of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] does not resolve this question; for one might as well ask, \"If given the axioms of [[elliptic geometry|Riemannian geometry]], can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles ''do not'' add up to ''more'' than 180 degrees?\" In either case, the real question is whether an omnipotent being would have the ability to evade consequences that follow logically from a system of axioms that the being created.\n\nA version of the paradox can also be seen in non-theological contexts. A similar problem occurs when accessing legislative or [[parliamentary sovereignty]], which holds a specific legal institution to be omnipotent in legal power, and in particular such an institution's ability to regulate itself.<ref>Suber, P. (1990) [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psa/sec01.htm#C ''The Paradox of Self-Amendment: A Study of Law, Logic, Omnipotence, and Change''].

After all, if we consider the stone's position relative to the sun the planet orbits around, one could hold that the stone is ''constantly'' lifted\u2014strained though that interpretation would be in the present context. Modern physics indicates that the choice of phrasing about lifting stones should relate to acceleration; however, this does not in itself of course invalidate the fundamental concept of the generalized omnipotence paradox. However, one could easily modify the classic statement as follows: \"An omnipotent being creates a [[universe]] that follows the laws of Aristotelian physics.

The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even logically contradictory ideas such as creating square circles. A no-limits understanding of omnipotence such as this has been rejected by theologians from  [[Thomas Aquinas]] to contemporary philosophers of religion, such as [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|Alvin Plantinga]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=God, Freedom, and Evil|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1977|isbn=0-8028-1731-9|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=[https://archive.org/details/godfreedomevil00plan/page/ Chapter 4]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/godfreedomevil00plan/page/}}</ref> Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for atheism{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}, though Christian theologians and philosophers, such as [[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]], contend that a no-limits understanding of omnipotence is not relevant to orthodox Christian theology. Other possible resolutions to the paradox hinge on the definition of omnipotence applied and the nature of God regarding this application and whether omnipotence is directed toward God himself or outward toward his external surroundings.\n\nThe omnipotence paradox has medieval origins, dating at least to the 12th century. It was addressed by [[Averro\u00ebs]]<ref name=\"TT\">[[Averro\u00ebs]], ''Tahafut al-Tahafut (The Incoherence of the Incoherence)'' trans. Simon Van Den Bergh, Luzac & Company 1969, sections 529\u2013536</ref> and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref name=TA/> [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to \"deny himself\".\n\nThe most well-known version of the omnipotence paradox is the so-called ''paradox of the stone'': \"Could God create a stone so heavy that even He could not lift it?\"<ref name=\"Savage, C. Wade 1967 pp. 74\">Savage, C. Wade. \"The Paradox of the Stone\" ''Philosophical Review'', Vol. 76, No. 1 (Jan., 1967), pp. 74\u201379 {{doi|10.2307/2182966}}</ref> This phrasing of the omnipotence paradox is vulnerable to objections based on the physical nature of [[gravity]], such as how the [[weight]] of an object depends on what the local gravitational field is. Alternative statements of the paradox that do not involve such difficulties include \"If given the axioms of Euclidean geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to 180 degrees?\" and \"Can God create a prison so secure that he cannot escape from it?\".\n\n==Overview==\nA common modern version of the omnipotence paradox is expressed in the question: \"Can [an omnipotent being] create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?\" This question generates a dilemma. The being can either create a stone it cannot lift, or it cannot create a stone it cannot lift. If the being {{em|can}} create a stone that it cannot lift, then it is not omnipotent because there is a weight threshold beyond its own power to lift. If the being {{em|cannot}} create a stone it cannot lift, then there is something it cannot create, and is therefore not omnipotent. In either case, God is not omnipotent.<ref name=\"Savage, C. Wade 1967 pp. 74\"/>\n\nA related issue is whether the concept of \"logically possible\" is different for a world in which omnipotence exists than a world in which omnipotence does not exist.\n\nThe dilemma of omnipotence is similar to another classic paradox\u2014the [[irresistible force paradox]]: \"What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an immovable object?\" One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Some claim{{who|date=May 2015}} that the only way out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. But this is not a way out, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/the-omnipotence-paradox-has-puzzled-people-for-centuries-curiosity/|title=The Omnipotence Paradox Has Puzzled People For Centuries|website=curiosity.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> <!--If they are GUARANTEED not to meet then I don't see what the problem is.-->\n\n==Types of omnipotence==\n{{Main|Omnipotence}}\n[[Peter Geach]] describes and rejects four levels of omnipotence. He also defines and defends a lesser notion of the \"almightiness\" of God.\n\n#\"Y is '''absolutely omnipotent'''\" means that \"Y\" can do anything that can be expressed in a string of words even if it is self-[[contradiction|contradictory]]: \"Y\" is not bound by the laws of logic.\"<ref name=\"Geach\">Geach, P. T. \"Omnipotence\" 1973 in Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 63\u201375</ref>   \n#\"Y is '''omnipotent'''\" means \"Y can do X\" is true [[if and only if]] X is a logically consistent description of a state of affairs. This position was once advocated by [[Thomas Aquinas]].<ref name=TA>[[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas, Thomas]] [[Summa Theologica]] Book 1 Question 25 article 3</ref> This definition of omnipotence solves some of the paradoxes associated with omnipotence, but some modern formulations of the paradox still work against this definition. Let X = \"to make something that its maker cannot lift.\" As [[George I. Mavrodes|Mavrodes]] points out, there is nothing logically contradictory about this. A man could, for example, make a boat that he could not lift.<ref name=\"Mavrodes\">Mavrodes, George. \"[http://spot.colorado.edu/~kaufmad/courses/Mavrodes.pdf Some Puzzles Concerning Omnipotence]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\" first published 1963 now in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 131\u201334</ref>   \n#\"Y is '''omnipotent'''\" means \"Y can do X\" is true if and only if \"Y does X\" is logically consistent. Here the idea is to exclude actions that are inconsistent for Y to do but might be consistent for others. Again sometimes it looks as if Aquinas takes this position.<ref>[[Aquinas]] [[Summa Theologica]] Book 1 Question 25 article 4 response #3</ref> Here Mavrodes' worry about X= \"to make something its maker cannot lift\" is no longer a problem, because \"God does X\" is not logically consistent. However, this account may still have problems with moral issues like X = \"tells a lie\" or temporal issues like X = \"brings it about that Rome was never founded.\"<ref name = \"Geach\" />\n#\"Y is '''omnipotent'''\" means whenever \"Y will bring about X\" is logically possible, then \"Y can bring about X\" is true. This sense, also does not allow the paradox of omnipotence to arise, and unlike definition #3 avoids any temporal worries about whether an omnipotent being could change the past. However, Geach criticizes even this sense of omnipotence as misunderstanding the nature of God's promises.<ref name = \"Geach\" />\n#\"Y is '''almighty'''\" means that Y is not just more powerful than any creature; no creature can compete with Y in power, even unsuccessfully.<ref name=\"Geach\" /> In this account nothing like the omnipotence paradox arises, but perhaps that is because God is not taken to be in any sense omnipotent. On the other hand, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] seems to think that almightiness is one of the things that make God count as omnipotent.<ref name = \"amselm\">[[Anselm of Canterbury]] Proslogion Chap VII in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] in his [[City of God (book)|City of God]] writes \"[[God]] is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills\" and thus proposes the definition that \"Y is '''omnipotent'''\" means \"If Y wishes to do X then Y can and does do X\". \n \nThe notion of omnipotence can also be applied to an entity in different ways. An '''essentially omnipotent''' being is an entity that is necessarily omnipotent. In contrast, an '''accidentally omnipotent''' being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.<ref name=\"Hoffman\">Hoffman, Joshua, Rosenkrantz, Gary.

Harper and Brothers, 1900.</ref> Some modern approaches to the problem have involved [[semantics|semantic]] debates over whether language\u2014and therefore philosophy\u2014can meaningfully address the concept of omnipotence itself.<ref>[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein, Ludwig.]] [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] (6.41 and following)</ref>\n\n==Proposed answers==\n\n===Omnipotence doesn't mean breaking the laws of logic===\n\nA common response from Christian philosophers, such as [[Norman Geisler]] or [[William Lane Craig]], is that the paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, does not mean that God can do anything ''at all'' but, rather, that he can do ''anything that's possible according to his nature.'' The distinction is important. God cannot perform logical absurdities; he cannot, for instance, make 1+1=3. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature. The Bible supports this, they assert, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, which says it is \"impossible for God to lie.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.equip.org/article/any-absolutes-absolutely/ |title = Any Absolutes? Absolutely!}}</ref><ref>https://www.alwaysbeready.com/images/stories/alwaysbeready/geisler%20norman%20-%20how%20to%20approach%20bible%20difficulties%20a.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAnother common response to the omnipotence paradox is to try to define omnipotence to mean something weaker than absolute omnipotence, such as definition 3 or 4 above. The paradox can be resolved by simply stipulating that omnipotence does not require that the being have abilities that are logically impossible, but only be able to do anything that conforms to the laws of logic. A good example of a modern defender of this line of reasoning is George Mavrodes.<ref name = \"Mavrodes\" /> Essentially, Mavrodes argues that it is no limitation on a being's omnipotence to say that it cannot make a round square. Such a \"task\" is termed by him a \"pseudo-task\" as it is self-contradictory and inherently nonsense. [[Harry Frankfurt]]\u2014following from Descartes\u2014has responded to this solution with a proposal of his own: that God can create a stone impossible to lift and also lift said stone<blockquote>For why should God not be able to perform the task in question? To be sure, it is a task\u2014the task of lifting a stone which He cannot lift\u2014whose description is self-contradictory. But if God is supposed capable of performing one task whose description is self-contradictory\u2014that of creating the problematic stone in the first place\u2014why should He not be supposed capable of performing another\u2014that of lifting the stone? After all, is there any greater trick in performing two logically impossible tasks than there is in performing one?<ref name=\"frankfurt\">Frankfurt, Harry. \"The Logic of Omnipotence\" first published in 1964 in ''[[Philosophical Review]]'' and now in ''Necessity, Volition, and Love''. [[Cambridge University Press]] November 28, 1998 pp.1\u20132</ref></blockquote>\n\nIf a being is ''accidentally omnipotent'', it can resolve the paradox by creating a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, it is possible for an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, of whether the being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power.<ref name=\"Hoffman\" /> On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of as central to the notion of the Christian Incarnation.<ref name=\"gore\">Gore, Charles, \"A Kenotic Theory of Incarnation\" first published 1891, in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 165\u201368</ref>\n\nIf a being is ''essentially omnipotent'', then it can also resolve the paradox (as long as we take omnipotence not to require absolute omnipotence). The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent, and therefore it is impossible for it to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible\u2014just like the accidentally omnipotent\u2014and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.\n\nThe omnipotent being cannot create such a stone because its power is equal to itself\u2014thus, removing the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2\u2014as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, it is possible for non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position [[Augustine of Hippo]] took in his ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'':<blockquote>For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.V.10.html|title=NPNF1-02. St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThus Augustine argued that God could not do anything or create any situation that would, in effect, make God not God.\n\nIn a 1955 article in the philosophy journal ''Mind'', [[J. L. Mackie]] tried to resolve the paradox by distinguishing between first-order omnipotence (unlimited power to act) and second-order omnipotence (unlimited power to determine what powers to act things shall have).<ref>[[J. L. Mackie|Mackie, J. L.]], \"Evil and Omnipotence.\" ''Mind'' LXIV, No, 254 (April 1955).</ref> An omnipotent being with both first and second-order omnipotence at a particular time might restrict its own power to act and, henceforth, cease to be omnipotent in either sense. There has been considerable philosophical dispute since Mackie, as to the best way to formulate the paradox of omnipotence in formal logic.<ref name = \"TPoG\">The Power of God: Readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978. Keene and Mayo disagree p. 145, Savage provides 3 formalizations p. 138\u201341, Cowan has a different strategy p. 147, and Walton uses a whole separate strategy p. 153\u201363</ref>\n\n;God and logic\n\n: <p>Although the most common translation of the noun \"Logos\" is \"Word\" other translations have been used. Gordon Clark (1902\u20131985), a Calvinist theologian and expert on pre-Socratic philosophy, famously translated Logos as \"Logic\": \"In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God.\" He meant to imply by this translation that the laws of logic were derived from God and formed part of Creation, and were therefore not a secular principle imposed on the Christian world view.</p><!--\n\n--><p>God obeys the laws of logic because God is eternally logical in the same way that God does not perform evil actions because God is eternally good. So, God, by nature logical and unable to violate the laws of logic, cannot make a boulder so heavy he cannot lift it because that would violate the [[law of non contradiction]] by creating an immovable object and an unstoppable force.</p><!--\n\n--><p>This raises the question, similar to the [[Euthyphro Dilemma]], of where this law of logic, which God is bound to obey, comes from. According to these theologians ([[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]]), this law is not a law above God that he assents to but, rather, logic is an eternal part of God's nature, like his [[omniscience]] or [[omnibenevolence]].</p>\n\n===Paradox is meaningless: the question is sophistry===\n\nAnother common response is that since God is supposedly omnipotent, the phrase \"could not lift\" does not make sense and the paradox is meaningless.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Problem of Pain, Clive Staples Lewis, 1944 MacMillan</ref><ref>Loving Wisdom: Christian Philosophy of Religion by Paul Copan, Chalice Press, 2007 page 46</ref> This may mean that the complexity involved in rightly understanding omnipotence\u2014contra all the logical details involved in misunderstanding it\u2014is a function of the fact that omnipotence, like infinity, is perceived at all by contrasting reference to those complex and variable things, ''which it is not''. An alternative meaning, however, is that a non-corporeal God cannot lift anything, but can raise it (a linguistic pedantry)\u2014or to use the beliefs of Hindus (that there is one God, who can be manifest as several different beings) that whilst it is possible for God to do all things, it is not possible for all his incarnations to do them. As such, God could create a stone so heavy that, in one incarnation, he couldn't lift it, yet could do something that an incarnation that ''could'' lift the stone could not.\n\nThe lifting a rock paradox (''Can God lift a stone larger than he can carry?'') uses human characteristics to cover up the main skeletal structure of the question. With these assumptions made, two arguments can stem from it:\n\n#'''Lifting''' covers up the definition of '''translation''', which means moving something from one point in space to another. With this in mind, the real question would be, \"''Can God move a rock from one location in space to another that is larger than possible?''\" For the rock to be unable to move from one space to another, it would have to be larger than space itself. However, it is impossible for a rock to be larger than space, as space always adjusts itself to cover the space of the rock. If the supposed rock was out of space-time dimension, then the question would not make sense\u2014because it would be impossible to move an object from one location in space to another if there is no space to begin with, meaning the faulting is with the logic of the question and not God's capabilities.\n#The words, \"Lift a Stone\" are used instead to substitute capability. With this in mind, essentially the question is asking if God is incapable, so the real question would be, \"''Is God capable of being incapable?''\" If God is capable of being incapable, it means that He is incapable, because He has the potential to not be able to do something. Conversely, if God is incapable of being incapable, then the two inabilities cancel each other out, making God have the capability to do something.\n\nThe act of killing oneself is not applicable to an omnipotent being, since, despite that such an act does involve some power, it also involves a ''lack'' of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely ''synthetic'': constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent [[omnipresence]].\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] asserts that the paradox arises from a misunderstanding of omnipotence. He maintains that inherent contradictions and logical impossibilities do not fall under the omnipotence of God.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1 |title=Summa Theologica |publisher=Ccel.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314053544/http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1 |archive-date=2007-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  J. L Cowan sees this paradox as a reason to reject the concept of 'absolute' omnipotence,<ref>Cowan, J. L. \"The Paradox of Omnipotence\" first published 1962, in ''The Power of God: Readings on Omnipotence and Evil''. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 144\u201352</ref> while others, such as [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], argue that God is absolutely omnipotent, despite the problem.<ref name=\"Descartes, Rene 1641\"/>\n\n[[C. S. Lewis]] argues that when talking about omnipotence, referencing \"a rock so heavy that God cannot lift it\" is nonsense just as much as referencing \"a square circle\"; that it is not logically coherent in terms of power to think that omnipotence includes the power to do the logically impossible. So asking \"Can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?\" is just as much nonsense as asking \"Can God draw a square circle?\" The logical contradiction here being God's simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement \"God can lift this rock\" must have a truth value of either true or false, it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone that is too heavy for it to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this does not quite make complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that the only difference is that this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of 'things' included in that end.\n\nIn other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' do is not a ''limit'' on its actual agency, but an ''epistemological boundary'' without which omnipotence could not be ''identified'' (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic [[Liar Paradox]]: If I say, \"I am a liar\", then how can it be true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an ''epistemological'' paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless. Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, \"God can\" before it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Lewis additionally said that, \"Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved.\" This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, ''as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.''\n\n==Language and omnipotence==\nThe philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is frequently interpreted as arguing that language is not up to the task of describing the kind of power an omnipotent being would have. In his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', he stays generally within the realm of [[logical positivism]] until claim 6.4\u2014but at 6.41 and following, he argues that [[ethics]] and several other issues are \"transcendental\" subjects that we cannot examine with language. Wittgenstein also mentions the will, life after death, and God\u2014arguing that, \"When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question be put into words.\"<ref>Wittgenstein, Ludwig. proposition 6.5</ref>\n\nWittgenstein's work expresses the omnipotence paradox as a problem in [[semantics]]\u2014the study of how we give symbols meaning. (The retort \"That's only semantics,\" is a way of saying that a statement only concerns the definitions of words, instead of anything important in the physical world.) According to the ''Tractatus,'' then, even attempting to formulate the omnipotence paradox is futile, since language cannot refer to the entities the paradox considers. The final proposition of the ''Tractatus'' gives Wittgenstein's dictum for these circumstances: \"What we cannot speak of, we must pass over in silence\".<ref>Wittgenstein, Ludwig. proposition 7</ref>\n\nWittgenstein's approach to these problems is influential among other 20th century religious thinkers such as [[D. Z. Phillips]].<ref name=\"phillips\">[[D. Z. Phillips]] \"Philosophy, Theology and the Reality of God\" in Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings. William Rowe and William Wainwright eds. 3rd ed. 1998 Oxford University Press</ref> In his later years, however, Wittgenstein wrote works often interpreted as conflicting with his positions in the ''Tractatus'',<ref name=\"hacker\">Hacker, P.M.S. Wittgenstein's Place in Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy. 1996 Blackwell</ref> and indeed the later Wittgenstein is mainly seen as the leading critic of the early Wittgenstein.\n\n==Other versions of the paradox==\nIn the 6th century, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] claims that a version of the omnipotence paradox constituted the dispute between Paul the Apostle and Elymas the Magician mentioned in [[Acts 13]]:8, but it is phrased in terms of a debate as to whether God can \"deny himself\" ala 2 Tim 2:13.<ref name = \"psd\">[[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], \"Divine Names\" 893B in Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works. trans Colm Luibheid Paulist Press. 1987. {{ISBN|0-8091-2838-1}}</ref> In the 11th century, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] argues that there are many things that God cannot do, but that nonetheless he counts as omnipotent.<ref name=\"anselm\">Anselm of Canterbury Proslogion Chap. VII, in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 35\u201336</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] advanced a version of the omnipotence paradox by asking whether God could create a triangle with internal angles that did not add up to 180 degrees. As Aquinas put it in ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'':\n\n{{quotation|Since the principles of certain sciences, such as logic, geometry and arithmetic are taken only from the formal principles of things, on which the essence of the thing depends, it follows that God could not make things contrary to these principles. For example, that a genus was not predicable of the species, or that lines drawn from the centre to the circumference were not equal, or that a triangle did not have three angles equal to two right angles.<ref>\"Cum principia quarundam scientiarum, ut logicae, geometriae et arithmeticae, sumantur ex solis principiis formalibus rerum, ex quibus essentia rei dependet, sequitur quod contraria horum principiorum Deus facere non possit: sicut quod genus non sit praedicabile de specie; vel quod lineae ductae a centro ad circumferentiam non sint aequales; aut quod triangulus rectilineus non habeat tres angulos aequales duobus rectis\". Aquinas, T. ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', Book 2, Section 25. trans. Edward Buckner</ref>}}\n\nThis can be done on a sphere, and not on a flat surface. The later invention of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] does not resolve this question; for one might as well ask, \"If given the axioms of [[elliptic geometry|Riemannian geometry]], can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles ''do not'' add up to ''more'' than 180 degrees?\" In either case, the real question is whether an omnipotent being would have the ability to evade consequences that follow logically from a system of axioms that the being created.\n\nA version of the paradox can also be seen in non-theological contexts. A similar problem occurs when accessing legislative or [[parliamentary sovereignty]], which holds a specific legal institution to be omnipotent in legal power, and in particular such an institution's ability to regulate itself.<ref>Suber, P. (1990) [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psa/sec01.htm#C ''The Paradox of Self-Amendment: A Study of Law, Logic, Omnipotence, and Change'']. Peter Lang Publishing</ref>\n\nIn a sense, the classic statement of the omnipotence paradox \u2014 a rock so heavy that its omnipotent creator cannot lift it \u2014 is grounded in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] science. After all, if we consider the stone's position relative to the sun the planet orbits around, one could hold that the stone is ''constantly'' lifted\u2014strained though that interpretation would be in the present context. Modern physics indicates that the choice of phrasing about lifting stones should relate to acceleration; however, this does not in itself of course invalidate the fundamental concept of the generalized omnipotence paradox. However, one could easily modify the classic statement as follows: \"An omnipotent being creates a [[universe]] that follows the laws of Aristotelian physics. Within this universe, can the omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that the being cannot lift it?\"\n\n[[Ethan Allen]]'s ''Reason'' addresses the topics of [[original sin]], [[theodicy]] and several others in classic [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] fashion.<ref name = \"allen\">[[Ethan Allen|Allen, Ethan]].

He argues, \"the one cannot be without the other, any more than there could be a compact number of mountains without valleys, or that I could exist and not exist at the same time, or that God should effect any other contradiction in nature.\" Labeled by his friends a [[Deism|Deist]], Allen accepted the notion of a divine being, though throughout ''Reason'' he argues that even a divine being must be circumscribed by logic.\n\nIn ''[[Principles of Philosophy]],'' [[Descartes]] tried refuting the existence of atoms with a variation of this argument, claiming God could not create things so indivisible that he could not divide them.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Religion}}\n*[[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]]\n*[[Problem of evil]]\n*[[List of paradoxes]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Omnipotence_paradox.ogg|2007-09-04}}\n*[[Ethan Allen|Allen, Ethan]].

F\u00e9lix Gallardo was serving his 37-year sentence at the [[Altiplano prison|Altiplano]] maximum-security prison but was transferred to a medium-security facility in 2014 due to his declining health.\n\n==Early life==\n\nBorn on a ranch in Bellavista, on the outskirts of [[Culiac\u00e1n]], [[Sinaloa]], F\u00e9lix Gallardo graduated from high school and studied business in college.

As a result, the Colombian cartels began to utilize Mexico as their primary transhipment point.\n\n[[Juan Matta-Ballesteros]] was F\u00e9lix Gallardo's primary connection to the Colombian cartels. Matta-Ballesteros had originally introduced F\u00e9lix Gallardo's predecessor, Alberto Sicilia-Falcon, to Santiago Ocampo of the [[Cali Cartel]], the head of one of the largest U.S. cocaine smuggling rings. Rather than taking cash payments for their services, the smugglers in the Guadalajara cartel took a 50% cut of the cocaine they transported from Colombia.

Reportedly, Qureshi walked up to a booth with the sign \"Got Questions? We've got answers,\" picked up a brochure on Islam and asked a question, as the booth's sign invited anyone to do. As Qureshi was engaged in conversation, a Muslim man walked by, snatched the brochure out of Qureshi's hand, and approached security personnel with it. Security personnel used this to create a confrontation with Qureshi and his colleagues, telling them to leave without telling them why, and ultimately assaulting them.<ref>{{Citation|last=Acts17Apologetics|title=Arab Fest 2009: The Unedited Footage|date=2009-06-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLDck9RzLpo|accessdate=2017-10-04}}</ref> Returning in 2010, Qureshi and his colleagues resolved not to engage anyone in conversation unless it was initiated by someone else.

Qureshi attended medical school at the Eastern Virginia Medical School after graduating from Old Dominion University. After completing his medical degree, Qureshi decided to spend his life studying and preaching the Christian Gospel and became a speaker for the [[Ravi Zacharias]] International Ministries. He subsequently completed three more master's degrees in theology and religious studies and was pursuing doctoral studies at the University of Oxford at the time of his death.\n\nQureshi lectured to students at more than 100 universities, including Oxford, Columbia, Dartmouth, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Hong Kong. He has participated in 18 moderated, public debates around North America, Europe, and Asia. In 2015, Qureshi debated at Wayne State University with Muslim scholar [[Shabir Ally]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Ravi Zacharias International Ministries|title=What is God Really Like: Tawhid or Trinity?

In 2009, Qureshi, and other members of Acts 17 Apologetics were kicked out of the fair on the pretense that they were passing out Christian literature. Reportedly, Qureshi walked up to a booth with the sign \"Got Questions? We've got answers,\" picked up a brochure on Islam and asked a question, as the booth's sign invited anyone to do. As Qureshi was engaged in conversation, a Muslim man walked by, snatched the brochure out of Qureshi's hand, and approached security personnel with it. Security personnel used this to create a confrontation with Qureshi and his colleagues, telling them to leave without telling them why, and ultimately assaulting them.<ref>{{Citation|last=Acts17Apologetics|title=Arab Fest 2009: The Unedited Footage|date=2009-06-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLDck9RzLpo|accessdate=2017-10-04}}</ref> Returning in 2010, Qureshi and his colleagues resolved not to engage anyone in conversation unless it was initiated by someone else. Furthermore, the members of Acts 17 Apologetics filmed the entirety of their interactions, as they had done the previous year. During the 2010 Festival, Qureshi was shown being asked questions by a small crowd of Muslim teenagers.

Robinson]] served as CEO of Scientific Atlanta for 20 years, and chairman of the board for an additional eight years, until he retired from the company in 1979. Scientific Atlanta grew dramatically; it earned $3.1 million in revenue in 1962 and approximately $200 million when Robinson left. [[Sidney Topol]] served as its president from 1971\u201383, CEO from 1975\u201387, and chairman of the board from 1978-90. During his tenure, the company grew in sales to more than $600 million. During the 1970s the company developed the concept of cable/satellite connection, which, in working with [[HBO]] and transportable earth stations developed by [[TelePrompTer Corporation]] and manufactured by Scientific Atlanta, established satellite-delivered television for the cable industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable Hall of Fame 1998 - 2010 Honorees Sid Topol {{!}}|url=http://www.cablecenter.org/content.cfm?id=1055 | publisher =The Cable Center | accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s Scientific-Atlanta earned a place in the space and defense industries as a manufacturer of electronic testing equipment for antennae. By the end of that decade the company had added instruments for testing telephones and acoustic devices with defense applications. As a military contractor, the company distinguished itself by manufacturing unique electronic instruments for the federal government. According to ''Business Week'', Scientific-Atlanta was a company \"fascinated with communications esoterica.\"\n\nScientific-Atlanta applied its energy to opportunities in new fields with large growth potential and few barriers to entry. The company sought out products that were either low-cost and high volume or had a very high price tag. \"You've either got to make 10,000 of something worth $100 to $200, or several of something worth $500,000 or $10 million,\" Topol told the ''New York Times''. The company planned to make the low-cost, high volume end of this equation profitable through aggressive research and development and a strong marketing effort. In its annual report, as reprinted in David C. Rickert's Harvard Business School case study of Scientific-Atlanta, the company stated: \"Scientific-Atlanta operates under a disciplined business plan that concentrates on design, manufacture, and sale of standard technical products for the communications and instrumentation markets.\" More specifically, Topol recounted in Dun's Review, as restated by Rickert, \"I asked what products we needed for growing markets, not what markets we should go after because we had a product.\"\n\nThe answer to that question was telecommunications products, primarily the satellite earth station, a large mobile dish used to receive signals transmitted from communications satellites orbiting the earth. In 1973 the company displayed a portable satellite earth station at a communications trade show in California. It planned to sell the portable stations to companies in the relatively new and rapidly growing cable television field so they could transmit their programming to a large number of stations in different areas. The stations, in turn, would send the programming to consumers' homes over their cable networks. At the time, however, observers told Scientific-Atlanta executives that satellite transmission of cable television programming would take place only in the distant future.\n\nThese predictions proved incorrect and as the cable television industry boomed in the mid- to late 1970s, Scientific-Atlanta grew with it. The company's profits ballooned by 40 percent a year from 1972 on as Scientific-Atlanta came to dominate the market it had largely pioneered. In 1976, as sales rose to more than $45 million, the company greatly expanded its manufacturing, laboratory, and office space at its headquarters. It sold two-thirds of the 3,000 satellite earth stations purchased by cable companies during the 1970s, enabling its clients\u2014broadcasters such as Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime/The Movie Channel\u2014to become pillars of the cable broadcasting industry. Scientific-Atlanta's strength in satellite earth stations helped to enhance its overall sales of cable television equipment, and the company also began to market other components necessary to operate a cable television system.\n\nIn addition to its satellite products for the cable industry, Scientific-Atlanta manufactured testing and measuring devices for telecommunications, industrial, and laboratory use. The company added to its instrumentation operations when it acquired the San Diego-based Spectral Dynamics Corporation, a manufacturer of scientific devices, in 1978 for $17.4 million. Spectral Dynamics brought with it European sales subsidiaries in Germany, France, England, and the Netherlands. With these additions, Scientific-Atlanta had sales network that covered 40 countries and was supported by a worldwide service network that adjusted and repaired its instruments. Both Scientific-Atlanta and Spectral Dynamics relied on continual research and development to bring new products to market, thereby enhancing market share and fostering company growth.\n\nBy the start of 1979 Scientific-Atlanta employed 2,700 people. That year the company also introduced Homesat, a subsidiary formed to market satellite equipment to homeowners who lived in areas too remote to receive adequate television reception.\n\nIn addition to its two main areas of operation\u2014communications and instrumentation\u2014Scientific-Atlanta entered the field of home security and energy management during the 1970s. The company marketed wireless home alarm systems and provided equipment to utilities that enabled them to monitor home energy use.\n\nBy the dawn of the 1980s, Scientific Atlanta had become the world's largest supplier of satellite earth stations.\n\nIn August 2002, the company laid off  6 percent of the company's total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=3610|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020908080838/http://hive4media.com:80/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=3610|title=Scientific-Atlanta Cuts 400 Jobs|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archivedate=September 8, 2002|date=August 16, 2002|accessdate=September 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2003, Scientific-Atlanta introduced their first Explorer HD set-top box, which is capable of displaying [[HDTV]] programming, at [[Best Buy]] stores in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. It was later rolled out nationwide. In March 2004, Scientific-Atlanta launched the Explorer 8000HD, their first set-top box with both DVR and HD.\n\nIn the set-top arena, Scientific-Atlanta once enjoyed 100% market share with [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cablevision]] and [[AT&T U-verse]]; all three companies have since started to transition to other boxes, Cablevision using [[Samsung]], while TWC and U-verse are split between SA/Cisco and competitor [[Arris International|Arris]] (formerly [[Motorola]]). [[Comcast]] also has a split account with the two companies. Other companies that have split accounts with SA and Arris are [[Suddenlink Communications]], [[Charter Communications]] and [[Cox Communications|Cox]]; the two vendors also had split accounts for [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]] before that company went under in 2006. [[Pace plc]], who mainly competes in foreign markets, serves as a domestic rival, but on a limited scale.\n\nOn November 18, 2005, Scientific Atlanta announced that it would be purchased by [[Cisco Systems]] in a US$6.9 billion cash deal. On February 25, 2006, Cisco Systems announced that it had completed acquisition of Scientific Atlanta in a cash deal that paid $43 per share. The total cash value of the deal was roughly US$7 billion, or US$5.1 billion net of Scientific Atlanta's cash balance, and also about US$5.1 billion over their 2005 [[shareholders' equity]]. In its fiscal year 2005, Scientific Atlanta earned $1.36 per common share (diluted).\n\nOn November 21, 2015, Cisco completed sale of its Connected Devices Business Unit (CDBU) to [[Technicolor SA]]. <ref>http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac0/ac1/ac259/technicolor.html#~overview</ref> This business was comprised primarily by customer premises equipment (CPE) related hardware and software that had originated at Scientific Atlanta, including set top boxes, cable gateways / modems, CableCard devices, digital transport adapters, wireless video access points, network extenders, accessories and eleven software products related to these offerings.<ref>http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac0/ac1/ac259/docs/connected-devices.pdf</ref>\n\nThe company was honored at the 2008 [[Technology & Engineering Emmy Award]]s for development of interactive video on demand infrastructure and signaling, leading to large scale [[Video on demand|VOD]] implementations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.scientificatlanta.com/ Scientific Atlanta official site]\n\n{{Atlanta companies}}\n\n[[Category:Scientific Atlanta| ]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Gwinnett County, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Computer companies established in 1951]]\n[[Category:Cisco Systems acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Computer companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:1951 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1951]]\n[[Category:2006 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications equipment vendors]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name             = Scientific Atlanta, Inc.\n| logo             = Scientific Atlanta logo.svg\n| logo_caption     = The Scientific Atlanta logo after Cisco's acquisition\n| type             = [[Subsidiary]]\n| genre            = \n| fate             = \n| predecessor      = \n| successor        = \n| foundation       = {{Start date and age|1951}}\n| founders         = [[James E.

Robinson]] served as CEO of Scientific Atlanta for 20 years, and chairman of the board for an additional eight years, until he retired from the company in 1979. Scientific Atlanta grew dramatically; it earned $3.1 million in revenue in 1962 and approximately $200 million when Robinson left. [[Sidney Topol]] served as its president from 1971\u201383, CEO from 1975\u201387, and chairman of the board from 1978-90. During his tenure, the company grew in sales to more than $600 million. During the 1970s the company developed the concept of cable/satellite connection, which, in working with [[HBO]] and transportable earth stations developed by [[TelePrompTer Corporation]] and manufactured by Scientific Atlanta, established satellite-delivered television for the cable industry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cable Hall of Fame 1998 - 2010 Honorees Sid Topol {{!}}|url=http://www.cablecenter.org/content.cfm?id=1055 | publisher =The Cable Center | accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s Scientific-Atlanta earned a place in the space and defense industries as a manufacturer of electronic testing equipment for antennae. By the end of that decade the company had added instruments for testing telephones and acoustic devices with defense applications. As a military contractor, the company distinguished itself by manufacturing unique electronic instruments for the federal government. According to ''Business Week'', Scientific-Atlanta was a company \"fascinated with communications esoterica.\"\n\nScientific-Atlanta applied its energy to opportunities in new fields with large growth potential and few barriers to entry. The company sought out products that were either low-cost and high volume or had a very high price tag. \"You've either got to make 10,000 of something worth $100 to $200, or several of something worth $500,000 or $10 million,\" Topol told the ''New York Times''. The company planned to make the low-cost, high volume end of this equation profitable through aggressive research and development and a strong marketing effort. In its annual report, as reprinted in David C. Rickert's Harvard Business School case study of Scientific-Atlanta, the company stated: \"Scientific-Atlanta operates under a disciplined business plan that concentrates on design, manufacture, and sale of standard technical products for the communications and instrumentation markets.\" More specifically, Topol recounted in Dun's Review, as restated by Rickert, \"I asked what products we needed for growing markets, not what markets we should go after because we had a product.\"\n\nThe answer to that question was telecommunications products, primarily the satellite earth station, a large mobile dish used to receive signals transmitted from communications satellites orbiting the earth. In 1973 the company displayed a portable satellite earth station at a communications trade show in California. It planned to sell the portable stations to companies in the relatively new and rapidly growing cable television field so they could transmit their programming to a large number of stations in different areas. The stations, in turn, would send the programming to consumers' homes over their cable networks. At the time, however, observers told Scientific-Atlanta executives that satellite transmission of cable television programming would take place only in the distant future.\n\nThese predictions proved incorrect and as the cable television industry boomed in the mid- to late 1970s, Scientific-Atlanta grew with it. The company's profits ballooned by 40 percent a year from 1972 on as Scientific-Atlanta came to dominate the market it had largely pioneered. In 1976, as sales rose to more than $45 million, the company greatly expanded its manufacturing, laboratory, and office space at its headquarters. It sold two-thirds of the 3,000 satellite earth stations purchased by cable companies during the 1970s, enabling its clients\u2014broadcasters such as Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime/The Movie Channel\u2014to become pillars of the cable broadcasting industry. Scientific-Atlanta's strength in satellite earth stations helped to enhance its overall sales of cable television equipment, and the company also began to market other components necessary to operate a cable television system.\n\nIn addition to its satellite products for the cable industry, Scientific-Atlanta manufactured testing and measuring devices for telecommunications, industrial, and laboratory use. The company added to its instrumentation operations when it acquired the San Diego-based Spectral Dynamics Corporation, a manufacturer of scientific devices, in 1978 for $17.4 million. Spectral Dynamics brought with it European sales subsidiaries in Germany, France, England, and the Netherlands. With these additions, Scientific-Atlanta had sales network that covered 40 countries and was supported by a worldwide service network that adjusted and repaired its instruments. Both Scientific-Atlanta and Spectral Dynamics relied on continual research and development to bring new products to market, thereby enhancing market share and fostering company growth.\n\nBy the start of 1979 Scientific-Atlanta employed 2,700 people. That year the company also introduced Homesat, a subsidiary formed to market satellite equipment to homeowners who lived in areas too remote to receive adequate television reception.\n\nIn addition to its two main areas of operation\u2014communications and instrumentation\u2014Scientific-Atlanta entered the field of home security and energy management during the 1970s. The company marketed wireless home alarm systems and provided equipment to utilities that enabled them to monitor home energy use.\n\nBy the dawn of the 1980s, Scientific Atlanta had become the world's largest supplier of satellite earth stations.\n\nIn August 2002, the company laid off  6 percent of the company's total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hive4media.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=3610|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020908080838/http://hive4media.com:80/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=3610|title=Scientific-Atlanta Cuts 400 Jobs|website=[[hive4media.com]]|archivedate=September 8, 2002|date=August 16, 2002|accessdate=September 22, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2003, Scientific-Atlanta introduced their first Explorer HD set-top box, which is capable of displaying [[HDTV]] programming, at [[Best Buy]] stores in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]].

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the fourteenth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Scott Derrickson]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Jon Spaihts]] and [[C. Robert Cargill]], and stars<!-- Order based on billing block --> [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as surgeon Stephen Strange along with [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Rachel McAdams]], [[Benedict Wong]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Scott Adkins]], [[Mads Mikkelsen]], and [[Tilda Swinton]]. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.\n\nVarious incarnations of a Doctor Strange film adaptation had been in development since the mid-1980s, until [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired the film rights in April 2005 on behalf of Marvel Studios. [[Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer]] were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson was hired to direct, with Spaihts re-writing the script. Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his other commitments. This gave Derrickson time to work on the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help. [[Principal photography]] on the film began in November 2015 in Nepal, before moving to England and Hong Kong, and wrapping up in New York City in April 2016.\n\n''Doctor Strange'' had its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 4, in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]]. The film grossed over $677 million worldwide, was met with praise for its visuals and cast, and received awards attention, including an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A sequel, ''[[#Sequel|Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'', is scheduled for release on May 7, 2021.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn [[Kathmandu]], the sorcerer [[Kaecilius]] and his zealots enter the secret compound [[Kamar-Taj]] and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the [[Ancient One]], a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.\n\nIn [[New York City]], [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant [[neurosurgeon]], severely injures his hands in a car crash, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]] tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]], a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the [[astral plane]] and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius.\n\nStrange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called [[Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctums]], in New York City, [[London]], and [[Hong Kong]], which are all directly accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical [[Eye of Agamotto]]. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.\n\nKaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact [[Dormammu]] of the [[Dark Dimension (comics)|Dark Dimension]], where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off with the help of the [[Cloak of Levitation]], only to be critically injured during a skirmish. He teleports himself back to the hospital where Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the Sanctum, Strange reveals to Mordo that the Ancient One has been drawing power from the Dark Dimension to sustain her long life, and Mordo becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York, Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then enters the Dark Dimension and creates a [[time loop]] around himself and Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he permanently leave Earth alone and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the loop.\n\nDisillusioned by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo renounces his sorcerer career and departs. Strange returns the Eye to Kamar-Taj and takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Strange decides to help [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], who has brought his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] to Earth to search for their father, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]].{{refn|name=Ragnarok|group=N|As depicted in the 2017 film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses to walk, telling him that Earth has \"too many sorcerers\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Doctor Strange cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Left to right: Cumberbatch, Derrickson, Swinton, McAdams, Ejiofor, Mikkelsen, and Wong at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n<!--Do NOT add cast members unless they are confirmed by a reliable source.

Strange is also aided by a [[Cloak of Levitation]] for flight, and the [[Eye of Agamotto]], a relic containing an [[Infinity Stone]] that can [[List of time travel works of fiction#Time travel in films|manipulate time]].<ref name=\"FeigePowersObjects\" /><ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> Cumberbatch took great care in defining the physical movements and gestures for the spells, knowing that they would be noted and studied by fans.<ref name=\"CumberbatchGestures\" /> He described these gestures as \"balletic\" and \"very dynamic\",<ref name=\"CumberbatchGestures2\" /> and received help with [[finger-tutting]] movements from dancer JayFunk.<ref name=\"FingerTutting\" />\n* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as [[Baron Mordo|Karl Mordo]]: <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts, close to the [[Ancient One]] and a mentor to Strange. This version of Mordo is a combination of different characters from the Doctor Strange mythos, and unlike in the comics is not introduced as villainous.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /><ref name=\"EjioforConfirm\" /> Ejiofor noted this, calling Mordo \"a very complex character that, really, I don't think can be nailed down either way\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> Director [[Scott Derrickson]] added that the change in character stemmed from casting Ejiofor and conversations the director had with him.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Ejiofor described Mordo's relationship with the Ancient One as \"long and intense\",<ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> while noting a \"growing respect\" between the character and Strange, until \"things get complicated\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Derrickson felt Mordo was a [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], saying \"When someone gives themselves over to an extraordinarily strict moral code, the process of breaking out of that is a violent one. He becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One's [moral contradictions]. The difference is Strange can accept that contradiction. Mordo cannot cope with it,\"<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> which leads to the \"antagonism between Mordo and Strange\" to explore in future films.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Discussing the diversity of the film's cast when addressing the controversial casting of the characters the Ancient One and [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]], Derrickson was confident that the decision to cast Ejiofor as Mordo, and thus changing the character \"from white to black\", was the right one to make.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]]: <br />An emergency surgeon<ref name=\"McAdams2\" /><ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> initially written as a love interest for Strange, but shortly before filming, Derrickson suggested that this trope be subverted by making the two characters lovers as part of their backstory and coming \"out the other side of it as friends\". McAdams described this dynamic by saying, \"The love is between them no matter what stage they're at in the actual relationship.\"<ref name=\"NoLoveInterest\" /> With this change in characterization, producer [[Kevin Feige]] described Palmer as a \"lynchpin to [Strange's] old life, once he steps into the role of a sorcerer. She is someone he connects with at the beginning, and reconnects with, and helps anchor his humanity.\"<ref name=\"McAdams3\" /> He explained that having this character be a \"connection to Strange's life in New York City, in the normal world\" after his journey was important to the studio, which is why Palmer was chosen for the character over the more prominent, but more fantastical character [[Clea]].<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg3\" /> Palmer is also known as the hero [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]] in the comics, a storyline that does not play into the film, but that Feige hinted could be explored in future films. [[Rosario Dawson]] portrays another Night Nurse character, [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]], in Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Netflix television series]].<ref name=\"NightNurse\" />\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]:<ref name=\"Wong\" /> <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of [[Kamar-Taj]]'s most valuable relics and books.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> The character is depicted in the comics as Strange's Asian, \"tea-making manservant\", a [[ethnic stereotype|racial stereotype]] that Derrickson did not want in the film,<ref name=\"WongCut\" /><ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> and so the character was not included in the film's script. After the non-Asian actress [[Tilda Swinton]] was cast as the other significant Asian character from the ''Doctor Strange'' comics, the Ancient One\u2014which was also done to avoid the comics' racial stereotypes\u2014Derrickson felt obligated to find a way to include Wong in the film. The character as he ultimately appears is \"completely subverted as a character and reworked into something that didn't fall into any of the stereotypes of the comics\",<ref name=\"WongCut\" /> which Derrickson was pleased gave an Asian character \"a strong presence in the movie\".<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Actor Wong was also pleased with the changes made to the character, and described him as \"a drill sergeant to Kamar-Taj\" rather than a manservant. He does not practice martial arts in the film, avoiding another racial stereotype.<ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> Derrickson added that Wong will have \"a strong presence in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" moving forward.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Nicodemus West]]: A rival surgeon to Strange.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"Stuhlbarg\" />\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Jonathan Pangborn: A [[paraplegic]] who learned from the Ancient One how to heal himself through the mystic arts.<ref name=\"Bratt\" /><ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /><ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Lucian: One of Kaecilius' followers.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Lucian\"/>\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as [[Kaecilius]]: <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts who broke away from the Ancient One.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> A combination of several antagonists from the comics, Kaecilius was used in the film to drive the introduction and development of bigger villains for the future, including \"certain individuals who live in other dimensions\". Derrickson compared this dynamic to that of [[Saruman]] and [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', giving the film a \"huge and fantastical\" villain like Sauron, but also having \"human relateability\" with Kaecilius, like Saruman, for Strange to face throughout the film.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> Derrickson admitted that Marvel's villains are often criticized, and noted that MCU films dedicate little time to developing antagonists. For ''Doctor Strange'', he just hoped to show \"Kaecilius's point of view and what makes him tick\" in the time that he could,<ref name=\"DerricksonVillainOct2016\" /> feeling that the character is a \"man of ideas\" with \"watertight logic\" like John Doe from ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and [[The Joker (The Dark Knight)|the Joker]] from ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> On these motivations, Feige explained that Kaecilius believes the Ancient One is a hypocrite, protecting her own power base, and that the world may be better off \"if we were to allow some of these other things through.\"<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> Mikkelsen's makeup took between 2\u20133 hours to apply.<ref name=\"MikkelsenMakeup\" />\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as the [[Ancient One]]: <br />A [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] mystic<ref name=\"MarvelAncientOneResponse\" /> who becomes Strange's mentor.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /> The character in the comics is a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] man, a situation which co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]] compared to the [[Kobayashi Maru]], an unwinnable training exercise in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. He explained that adapting the character as the comics portrayed him would be realizing the major Asian [[Fu Manchu]] stereotype, and would involve the film with the [[Tibetan sovereignty debate]], but not giving one of few significant Asian roles to an Asian actor would also understandably be received negatively.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /><ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Derrickson wanted to change the character to be an Asian woman, but felt that an older Asian woman would invoke the [[Dragon Lady]] stereotype, while a younger Asian woman would be perceived as exploiting [[Asian fetish]] and \"a fanboy's dream girl\". To avoid the character filling any of those three stereotypes, or enabling the stereotype of a \"Western character coming to Asia to learn about being Asian\",<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Derrickson decided to cast a non-Asian actor in the role, but to still take the opportunity to cast \"an amazing actress in a male role\".<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Feeling that Swinton was the obvious choice to play \"domineering, secretive, ethereal, enigmatic, [and] mystical\", Derrickson wrote the Ancient One in the film specifically for the actress, before she was offered the role.<ref name=\"WorldPremiere\" /> Additionally, though the film uses the terms \"her\" and \"she\", Swinton chose to portray the character as [[Androgyny|androgynous]], while Feige explained that the Ancient One and Sorcerer Supreme are mantles in the film held by multiple characters through time, so a more comic-accurate Ancient One could exist within the MCU.<ref name=\"SwintonDec2015\" /><ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> Still, Swinton's casting was widely criticized as [[Whitewashing in film|whitewashing]].<ref name=\"SwintonResponse\" /> In response to this, Derrickson said that though he was pleased with the diversity of the film's cast, in terms of both gender and ethnicity, \"Asians have been whitewashed and stereotyped in American cinema for over a century and people should be mad or nothing will change. What I did was the lesser of two evils, but it is still an evil.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n\nCumberbatch also portrays, uncredited, the villainous entity [[Dormammu]]. The actor suggested he take on the role to Derrickson, feeling that having the character be a \"horrific\" reflection of Strange would work better than just \"being a big ghoulish monster\". The director agreed, elaborating that the casting implies that Dormammu does not have a normal physical form in his own dimension, and so is simply imitating Strange for their confrontation. To create the character, Cumberbatch provided motion-capture reference for the visual effects team, and his voice was blended with that of another uncredited British actor, whom Derrickson described as having \"a very deep voice\".<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /><ref name=\"DormammuVoice\" /> The producers also had [[Tony Todd]] record voice over for Dormammu as an alternative to Cumberbatch, but ultimately decided on using Cumberbatch for the voice.<ref name=\"ToddDormammu\" />\n\n[[Chris Hemsworth]] reprises his role of [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] from previous MCU films in the film's mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> Additionally, [[Linda Louise Duan]] appears, unnamed, as [[Tina Minoru]],<ref name=\"Duan\" /><ref name=\"MinoruUnnamed\" /> Mark Anthony Brighton portrays [[Daniel Drumm]],<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> and Topo Wresniwiro portrays Hamir,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> all Masters of the Mystic Arts under the Ancient One. The latter is based on [[Hamir the Hermit]], Wong's father in the comics, who was the Ancient One's personal manservant. The character is neither a manservant nor Wong's father in the film.<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> Zara Phythian, Alaa Safi, and Katrina Durden portray zealots under Kaecilius,<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"Phythian\" /> and [[Pat Kiernan]] appears as himself.<ref name=\"KiernanCameo\" /> Doctor Strange co-creator [[Stan Lee]] makes a [[cameo appearance]] as a bus rider reading [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]''.<ref name=\"StanLee\" /><ref name=\"IMAXScreening\" /> [[Amy Landecker]] was cast as anesthesiologist Bruner, but the majority of her role was cut from the finished film.<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nA film based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Doctor Strange]] was initially listed as being in development at [[New World Pictures]],<ref name=\"NewWorld\" /> with a script dated January 21, 1986 by [[Bob Gale]].<ref name=\"IGNGale\" /> For unknown reasons, Gale's film never went further into production.<ref name=\"IGNGale\" /> By 1989, [[Alex Cox]] had co-written a script with Doctor Strange co-creator [[Stan Lee]]. The script had the character traveling to the Fourth Dimension before facing the villain [[Dormammu]] on [[Easter Island]], [[Chile]]. A film using this script was almost made by [[Regency Enterprises|Regency]], but the company's films were [[Film distributor|distributed]] by [[Warner Bros.]] at the time, which was in a dispute with Marvel over merchandising.<ref name=\"AlexCox\" /> By December 1992, [[Wes Craven]] had signed to write and direct ''Doctor Strange'' for release in either 1994 or 1995, with [[Savoy Pictures]] distributing.<ref name=\"Variety\" /><ref name=\"Variety2\" /> In 1995, [[David S. Goyer]] had completed a script for the film.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> By April 1997, [[Columbia Pictures]] had purchased the film rights and Jeff Welch was working on a new screenplay, with [[Bernie Brillstein]] and [[Brad Grey]] producing.<ref name=\"Variety3\" />\n\nBy April 2000, Columbia dropped ''Doctor Strange'', which then had [[Michael France]] attached to write a script and interest from [[Chuck Russell]] and [[Stephen Norrington]] to direct.<ref name=\"ColumbiaDrop\" /> By June 2001, [[Dimension Films]] acquired the film rights, with Goyer back on board as writer and director. Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of ''[[Murder Mysteries]]'',<ref name=\"Goyer\" /> and promised not to be highly dependent on [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"IGN\" /> However, by August 2001, [[Miramax]] acquired the film rights from Dimension,<ref name=\"Miramax\" /> and by March 2002, Goyer had dropped out of the project.<ref name=\"GoyerDrop\" /> A 2005 release date was announced the next March,<ref name=\"2005release\" /> while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. [[Marvel Studios]] CEO [[Avi Arad]] stated, \"We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but we are working on it. We are trying to find the real [[Jerry Garcia]] of the writing community.\"<ref name=\"AradWriter\" /> In April 2005, [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired ''Doctor Strange'' from Miramax, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Paramount\" /> In 2007, [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Neil Gaiman]] pitched a version of the film to Marvel, with Gaiman writing and del Toro directing. Gaiman was especially interested in including the character [[Clea]], but the studio was not interested.<ref name=\"IndieWiredelToro\" />\n\nIn March 2009, Marvel hired writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, including Doctor Strange.<ref name=\"Writers2009\" /> In June 2010, Marvel Studios hired [[Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer]] to write ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name=\"MarvelStudios\" /> While promoting ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' in April 2011, actor [[Patrick Dempsey]] indicated he was lobbying to play the title character.<ref name=\"Dempsey\" /> In January 2013, Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] confirmed that Doctor Strange would appear in some capacity as part of \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Three|Phase Three]]\" of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"PhaseThree\" /> Feige then reiterated that a Doctor Strange feature film was in development at Marvel Studios that May,<ref name=\"FeigeMay2013\" /><ref name=\"HollywoodReporterMay2013\" /> and again in November.<ref name=\"FeigeNov2013\" /> In February 2014, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that Marvel was considering [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]], [[Jonathan Levine]], [[Nikolaj Arcel]] and [[Dean Israelite]] to direct the film, and was considering [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger]] to rewrite the film's script.<ref name=\"THRFeb2014\" /> Feige denied this report, but confirmed that Marvel was considering prospective candidates.<ref name=\"IGNFeb2014\" /> By March, Marvel was considering Andrews, Levine, and [[Scott Derrickson]] to direct the film.<ref name=\"IGNMarch2014\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=I think when you consider the work that I've done it makes sense that he'd be my favorite comic book character, at least in the Marvel universe.

The entire history of the comics is extraordinary.|source=\u2014Scott Derrickson, director of ''Doctor Strange''<ref name=\"DerricksonQuote\" />}}\nIn June 2014, Derrickson was chosen to direct the film.<ref name=\"Derrickson\" /> He had written a 12-page scene for the film featuring Strange and an assailant fighting in the [[astral plane]] while a doctor attempts to save Strange's physical body in a hospital, based on a sequence from the comic ''[[Doctor Strange: The Oath]]''. Derrickson illustrated the sequence with his own concept art, alongside storyboards from professional artists and an [[Storyboards#Animatics|animatic]], which he presented in a 90-minute pitch to the studio. This cost Derrickson an \"obnoxious amount\" of his own money, but he felt it necessary to prove \"that I wanted [the job] more than anyone\", especially after Marvel told him that more people had lobbied to direct ''Doctor Strange'' than any of their other films.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> Derrickson ultimately had eight meetings with Marvel for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> After he was hired, Marvel bought the 12-page scene from Derrickson, and it became one of the film's main set pieces.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> On transitioning from horror films to a superhero film, Derrickson said, \"It was nice to work on something more positive. And not have my headspace in something so dark for so long. But it was also weirdly similar because of the fantastical nature of the movie\". In his horror films, Derrickson tried to use \"real characters and real character drama played by good actors ... [to] encounter the fantastical\", and so he wanted actors of the same high caliber for ''Doctor Strange'' through which he could introduce the more fantastical elements to the MCU.<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" />\n\nDerrickson and Marvel had originally discussed him writing the film alongside his ''[[Sinister (film)|Sinister]]'' co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]], with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel felt that they would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer,<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> with [[Jon Spaihts]] hired to rewrite the script instead.<ref name=\"CumberbatchOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Spaihts\" /> Spaihts, a big fan of ''Doctor Strange'' as a child, had started \"pestering\" Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked \"all afternoon, and the fit was right\",<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not \"take that answer. Call them back, tell them there's a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room\", and after talking with Marvel for \"another three or four hours\" he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a \"fully-formed\" sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that \"the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it.\" Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as \"little things\" from Spaihts, \"like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple.\"<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> Derrickson wanted [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of \"nightmares themselves as being a dimension\",<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /><ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> but Feige felt \"getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension\" would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, \"the most present villain in the comics\", became the film's main villain.<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" />\n\nDuring the early development process, Marvel, Derrickson, and Spaihts all envisioned [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] playing the title role.<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> By the end of June, Marvel had reportedly been looking at [[Tom Hardy]] and [[Jared Leto]] for the film's lead as well,<ref name=\"Spaihts\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineJun2014\" /> while [[\u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez]], who worked with Derrickson on 2014's ''[[Deliver Us from Evil (2014 film)|Deliver Us from Evil]]'', had discussed a possible role with the director.<ref name=\"Ramirez\" /> In July, after fans and the media had also championed Cumberbatch for the role of Doctor Strange, the actor explained at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] that he would be unable to accept the role due to commitments to other projects.<ref name=\"CumberbatchConflicts\" /> Feige stated that a lead actor would be announced \"relatively quickly\",<ref name=\"JulyCasting\" /> and by the end of that month [[Joaquin Phoenix]] entered talks to play the character.<ref name=\"Phoenix\" /><ref name=\"Phoenix2\" /> By September 2014, Marvel Studios was in negotiations to shoot ''Doctor Strange'' at [[The Pinewood Studios Group|Pinewood-Shepperton]] in England, with crews being assembled for a move into [[Shepperton Studios]] in late 2014/early 2015, for filming in May 2015.<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /> Negotiations with Phoenix ended in October 2014,<ref name=\"Phoenix3\" /> as the actor felt that blockbuster films would never be \"fulfilling\", with \"too many requirements that went against [his] instincts for character.\"<ref name=\"PhoenixReason\" /> Marvel then placed Leto, [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Oscar Isaac]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[Keanu Reeves]] on their shortlist for the character.<ref name=\"OctCasting\" /><ref name=\"OctCasting2\" /> [[Ryan Gosling]] also had discussions to play the character,<ref name=\"Gosling\" /> while Reeves was not approached about the role,<ref name=\"Reeves\" /> and Cumberbatch was still considered to be in contention.<ref name=\"OctCasting\" /><ref name=\"OctCasting2\" /> In October, Cumberbatch entered negotiations to play the character,<ref name=\"Cumberbatch\" /> and was officially cast in December.<ref name=\"CumberbatchOfficial\" /> Feige explained that Marvel had kept returning to him for the role while considering other actors,<ref name=\"FeigeProductionShift\" /> with Derrickson noting that even during discussions with Phoenix, he and Marvel still wanted to cast Cumberbatch in the role.<ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> The company eventually decided to change the film's production schedule to fit around Cumberbatch's commitments, allowing him to join the project.<ref name=\"FeigeProductionShift\" />\n\n[[File:Scott Derrickson by Gage Skidmore (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Derrickson promoting ''Doctor Strange'' at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con]]\nWith the film's new production schedule, its intended release date was pushed back to November 2016,<ref name=\"Oct2014Event\" /> and Derrickson was able to do some work on the script himself. He brought Cargill in to work with him on this as was originally planned. Describing the film, Cargill called it both a superhero film and a fantasy film, saying \"it's a very magical fantasy universe, but at the same time it plays by some of the superhero tropes that people enjoy.\"<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Spaihts returned later in the process to \"do some more writing and help bring the movie home\", and said he was \"delighted\" by the work that Derrickson and Cargill had done in the interim.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> Feige and Derrickson have noted that, in addition to ''The Oath'' and Steve Ditko's original work on Doctor Strange, an influence on all the film's writers was the Doctor Strange comic book ''Into Shamballa''.<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSRNov2016\" />\n\nIn January 2015, [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] entered preliminary talks with Marvel for a role in the film,<ref name=\"Ejiofor\" /> later revealed to be [[Baron Mordo]].<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /> Ejiofor's role was confirmed during the 2015 [[Disney D23|D23 Expo]].<ref name=\"EjioforConfirm\" /> In April, Derrickson and members of the production team visited [[New York City]] to scout potential filming locations, while Feige revealed that filming would begin that November.<ref name=\"NYCScoutingNovFilming\" /> A month later, [[Tilda Swinton]] was in talks to play the [[Ancient One]].<ref name=\"Swinton\" /> In June 2015, Derrickson announced that he was going to London to begin work on the film,<ref name=\"DerricksonLondon\" /> and Feige confirmed that Strange's [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] would appear, located on [[Bleecker Street]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], as in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> Swinton confirmed her role in the film in July,<ref name=\"SwintonConfirmed\" /> when [[Rachel McAdams]] was being considered for the female lead. McAdams cautioned that \"it's still super-early, and I don't know where that's gonna go, if it's gonna go anywhere at all\",<ref name=\"McAdams\" /> but she ultimately confirmed her role during the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"McAdams2\" /> [[Mads Mikkelsen]] entered into early negotiations to play a villain in August,<ref name=\"VarietyMikkelsen\" /> \"one of a number of actors being considered for the unspecified villainous role.\"<ref name=\"DeadlineMikkelsen\" />\n\nIn September 2015, ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' director [[James Gunn]] stated that many of the crew that worked on that film were unable to return for [[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2|its sequel]], because they had committed to ''Doctor Strange''.<ref name=\"Crew\" /> Derrickson also revealed that Gunn had provided notes on the script, beyond the general conversing the MCU directors have between themselves for their films.<ref name=\"GunnNotes\" /> At the end of the month, Feige stated that additional casting announcements would be made \"before the end of the year\",<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\" /> and by early November, [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] entered negotiations to appear in the film as Nicodemus West, a rival of Strange.<ref name=\"Stuhlbarg\" /> Derrickson had offered the role to Stuhlbarg because he was interested in working with the actor, and he agreed to join the cast after reading some Doctor Strange comics and being drawn to the character's \"guilt-ridden arc\" where West \"blames himself for ruining the surgery on Strange's hands and robbing him of his ability to operate\".<ref name=\"StuhlbargReasons\" />\n\nFeige felt that the visuals of the film needed \"to be a [[Steve Ditko|Ditko]]/[[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick]]/[[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]]/''[[The Matrix]]'' mind-trip\",<ref name=\"FeigeMar2014\" /> and said that \"You don't get into it in ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'', but if a scientist went to [[Hogwarts]] he'd find out how some of that stuff is happening! We're not going to spend a lot of time on that, but there will be some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds.\"<ref name=\"FeigeMar2014\" /> In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and ''Harry Potter'', wanting \"to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal. And to root it in gestures as opposed to spoken incantations and things like that.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" /> Feige called ''Doctor Strange'' the \"doorway\" into the supernatural side of the MCU,<ref name=\"FeigeAprilSupernatural\" /> a role that Derrickson noted was also served by the character in the early comics, when the ''Doctor Strange'' comics \"broke open the Marvel comic book universe into the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel multiverse]]\".<ref name=\"MCUMultiverse\" /> Discussing the portrayal of other dimensions in the film, Feige stated that it would not explore parallel realities like the comics' \"[[Earth-616]] and Earth 617\", but would instead feature \"dimensions that are so mind-bending that you can barely perceive them\",<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg2\" /> like the Astral plane, Dark Dimension, and Mirror Dimension.<ref name=\"DarkDimension\" /><ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /><ref name=\"IGNIMAXReaction\" />\n\n[[Astrophysicist]] [[Adam Frank]] served as a scientific consultant on the film, having already known Derrickson and been a Marvel fan since childhood.<ref name=\"FrankConsultant2\" /> Frank advised on \"the human experience of space and time\", helping Marvel conceive ideas for their cinematic multiverse, and suggesting dialogue for characters based on their beliefs, whether they were materialist, rationalist, reductionist, or \"had this enlarged perspective.\"<ref name=\"FrankConsultant\" /> He noted that modern movie goers may not necessarily understand these complex scientific ideas, but do appear to appreciate that \"amazing things happen from science. So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities\u2014people are used to that in their lives. So I think it makes sense to them, and it's exciting to them\". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a \"great thing ... speaking as a scientist\", saying that \"they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them.\"<ref name=\"FrankConsultant2\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in [[Nepal]] on November 4, 2015, under the [[working title]] ''Checkmate''.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /><ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]], serving as cinematographer for the film after doing the same on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', described ''Doctor Strange'' as Marvel's ''Fantasia'', and noted that a lot of [[previsualization]] was required to figure out how to shoot the \"[[Psychedelia|psychedelic]]\", [[M. C. Escher]]-inspired imagery.<ref name=\"DP\" /> Davis used the [[Arri Alexa#Alexa 65|Arri Alexa 65]] camera for the film,<ref name=\"DavisArriAlexa\" /> along with the [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT Plus]]. [[Vision Research Phantom]] Flex 4Ks, which shoot up to 1000 [[Frame rate|fps]], were used for high speed sequences like Strange's car crash.<ref name=\"FXguide\" />\n\n[[File:Benedict Cumberbatch on the set of Doctor Strange.jpg|thumb|Cumberbatch filming ''Doctor Strange'' in [[Kathmandu]], November 2015]]\nDerrickson chose Nepal as a location to feature an \"Eastern city\" that would not be familiar to most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]]. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event \"was all the more reason to shoot there\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was \"absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it's so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It's important to a film like this\u2014which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension\u2014that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The eventual filming locations around the [[Kathmandu Valley]] included the [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]] and [[Swayambhunath]] Temples;<ref name=\"NepalShooting\" /> [[Thamel]] and [[New Road of Kathmandu|New Road]] in [[Kathmandu]];<ref name=\"NepalShooting4\" /> and the [[Patan Durbar Square]] in [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]].<ref name=\"NepalShooting3\" /><ref name=\"NepalShooting5\" />\n\nProduction moved to [[Longcross Studios]] in [[Surrey]], England on November 11,<ref name=\"Longcross\" /> and was scheduled to stay there until March 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingScheduledEnd\" /> The real Kathmandu street that led into the fictional Kamar-Taj courtyard was replicated at Longcross, which production designer Charles Wood described as \"very hard because Kathmandu is a most beautiful city and it's steeped in history. To transition from that level of detail and history, with the shape of the streets, the warping of the buildings, these ancient bricks and these ancient tiles, was a real challenge.\" For authenticity, the set was dressed with real food, and populated with dogs, pigeons, and Nepalese extras, many of whom were relatives of people who live on the real Kathmandu street.<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The inside of [[Kamar-Taj]] was also constructed at Longcross, with \"sculptors creating beautiful columns and wall decorations and craftsmen building screens and doors to evoke the exotic feel of the ancient sanctuary.\" Wood's goal was to make the set feel like the Ancient One and her disciples actually lived there, and give it a \"truly spiritual, truly magical\" feel, while integrating it into a real building that the production filmed in Kathmandu. This and the Kathmandu street were two of twenty-one sets that the crew built at Longcross. Others included Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, and a Hong Kong street \"complete with over 80 neon signs and a giant roof to keep the rain out.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> [[Citypoint]] on Ropemaker Street, London, doubled as the New York City building where the Ancient One falls to her death.<ref name=\"Citypoint\" />\n\nFilming also took place in Hong Kong,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> and in New York City's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /> Additional New York City-set scenes were shot at Shepperton Studios,<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /><ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> and later in London.<ref name=\"LondonFilming\" /> By the end of November, the casting of Mikkelsen and Stuhlbarg was confirmed,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> alongside [[Amy Landecker]] and [[Scott Adkins]] in unspecified roles.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Landecker\" /> Additionally, [[Benedict Wong]] heard about the film from his friend Ejiofor, and sought a role in it himself.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> He was cast as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in January,<ref name=\"Wong\" /> and immediately joined the production for filming.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> [[Lamborghini]] provided six [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n#Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4 Spyder (2016\u2013)|Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4s]] for use in the film, one of which the production wrecked during filming.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> Lamborghini said that they felt \"there are a lot of characteristics of Doctor Strange that are connected with the Lamborghini philosophy.\"<ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> The Lamborghini crash scene was filmed at [[Northfleet]], Kent by the [[River Thames]].<ref name=\"KentFilming\" /> Also in January 2016, filming took place at [[Exeter College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> The next month, Feige revealed that the film originally had a prologue that took place in [[CERN]], due to the real world research being done at the facility on alternate dimensions and parallel universes.<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> Production moved to New York City's [[Flatiron District]] in April,<ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> where set photos revealed that Zara Phythian had joined the cast.<ref name=\"Phythian\" /> Principal photography [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in New York City on April 3, 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn June 2016, a [[Diamond Select Toys]] press release for ''Doctor Strange'' toys, in their Marvel [[Minimates]] line, named Mikkelsen's character [[Kaecilius]] and McAdams' character [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]].<ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> Mikkelsen's role was confirmed in an official tie-in comic for the film,<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> while McAdams' was confirmed at San Diego Comic Con 2016.<ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> Additionally, [[Benjamin Bratt]] was revealed to have been cast<ref name=\"Bratt\" /> as Jonathan Pangborn;<ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /> Adkins' role was revealed to be Lucian, a follower of Kaecilius;<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> and Landecker's role was later revealed to be anesthesiologist Dr. Bruner.<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> The latter was mostly cut from the film,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> with Landecker explaining that she had been cast in the small role, for two scenes at the beginning of the film, because Derrickson was a fan of her performance in ''[[A Serious Man]]'', which also starred Stuhlbarg. After filming her first scene, in which she assists Strange with a surgery, Landecker asked not to be involved in the other scene because she had no lines for it and was only seen from behind, and instead wished to attend a special premiere at the [[White House]] for her series ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]''. The actress believed she was later cut from the first scene, but she is still credited for a brief appearance.<ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> Also, Derrickson revealed that [[Lulu Wilson]] had been cast as Strange's sister, for a scene depicting her drowning at a young age. The scene had been shot, and Derrickson thought it was \"great [as a] self-contained scene\", but it \"didn't work\" with the rest of the film, and was cut.<ref name=\"LuluSister\" />\n\nAlso at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson noted that there were still \"a couple pickup shoots\" to do for the film to \"clarify the logic\".<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> Further content for the film's training sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences \"loved [the training portion of the film] and wanted more\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August.<ref name=\"WongReshootWrap\" /> [[Dan Harmon]] wrote material for these additional scenes,<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> which Derrickson described as \"script analysis and dialogue work\", not enough to receive credit in the film.<ref name=\"Harmon2\" /> Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to \"give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts.\"<ref name=\"Harmon3\" /> Before the film's sets were demolished, ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' director [[Taika Waititi]] took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting [[Chris Hemsworth]]'s [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. The scene was for ''Ragnarok'' and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was \"kind of perfect\" to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to ''Doctor Strange'' as a mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" /> A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential ''Doctor Strange'' sequel.<ref name=\"PostCreditScene\" /> Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective ''Doctor Strange'' scene, and \"kept throwing lines at\" Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film.<ref name=\"GunnCameos\" /> Additional options Gunn filmed included Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word [[wikt:excelsior|excelsior]] meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being \"totally crazy\"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a ''[[Garfield]]'' book, noting how the character \"HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!\". Gunn felt the ''Garfield'' option was originally meant to appear in the final version of the film, but ended up being too long for the scene.<ref name=\"GunnLeeOptions\" /> By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.<ref name=\"IMAXScreening\" />\n\nFeige described the film's use of 3D as serving the storytelling, saying, \"hopefully it helps bend people's minds even more than with just the flat screen.\"<ref name=\"Feige3DUse\" /> He said that \"there are sequences of the film that 3D is actually necessary to tell the dimensional story that is happening through visuals\". However, he noted that during visual effects reviews for the film it became apparent that these sequences were adversely affecting the story when viewed in 2D, which necessitated adjustments so the sequences would work in all formats.<ref name=\"Feige3DCollider\" /> Over one hour of footage in the film was \"specially formatted\" for IMAX.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\nVisual effects for ''Doctor Strange'' were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Method Studios]], [[Framestore]], Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV,<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" /> contributing to 1450 effects shots. [[Previsualization]] was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals).<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> Visual effects supervisor [[Stephane Ceretti]], who also worked on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', explained the similarities and differences between the two films, saying, \"there's some resemblance in some of the things that we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In [''Guardians''], it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. ''Guardians'' was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" />\n\nFurther discussing the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as \"the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [which] were all about these weird visuals\",<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> as well as \"a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher\".<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from \"a bunch of experimental, [[fractal]] videos from [[YouTube]]\" that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game ''[[Monument Valley (video game)|Monument Valley]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesVisuals\" /> Derrickson's \"ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects to do things that are fresh and new\u2014to not just blow things up.\"<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them \"to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning...\" Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action \"in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we've seen in any other movies.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg2\" /> On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on ''The Oath'' comic, while adding that the end fight was \"an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork\" from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take ''[[Inception]]'' \"to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" /> Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of \"a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it\", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing \"which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder\".<ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" />\n\n[[File:Doctor Strange mirror dimension.jpg|thumb|left|The Manhattan mirror sequence was mostly filmed on green screen (top), with visual effects added by [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]] (bottom).<ref name=\"FXguide\" />]]\nILM worked on the folding Manhattan mirror sequence (chosen because of their work creating a digital New York in ''The Avengers'') and the time fight sequence in Hong Kong, which consisted of 200 and 150 shots, respectively. They began work on the film 10 months before filming began to plan out the Manhattan sequence; it was mainly CGI, though some New York location shots were used. The sequence was mainly handled by ILM's San Francisco and Vancouver offices. The Hong Kong time sequence was done mainly by ILM's London office. ILM also created digital doubles for many of the actors, which were shared with the other vendors. Method Studios, who worked on the [[Microverse|Quantum Realm]] in ''Ant-Man'', worked on the \"magical mystery tour\" sequence, with Strange hurtling through various dimensions. The sequence was handled by Method's Los Angeles studio, with their Vancouver studio contributing the opening shot of the sequence. The only shot Method did not work on in the sequence was the one that linked to Dormammu, as Luma Pictures assisted in his creation (they handled his other appearances in the film). Method created 7 dimensions for the sequence: the initial wormhole to the \"Speaker Cone\"; the Bioluminesce world; the fractals of \"soft solid\" world; a version of the Quantum Realm; Strange falling through his own eye and Cosmic Scream; the Dark Dimension; and the Shape Shifting realm. The Shape Shifting realm originally had Strange morphing and changing shape, but that was ultimately removed as Derrickson felt the audience needed to see Cumberbatch. Method's Vancouver studio created Strange's car crash, the rooftop training, and the sequence in which Strange experiments with time on an apple in the Kamar-Taj library. The car crash blended the high speed photography and some green screen sequences, with digital assets for both Cumberbatch and the car. In total, Method worked on 270 effects shots.<ref name=\"FXguide\" />\n\nFramestore was chosen to work on the Cloak of Levitation, due to their work creating [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]] in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Ceretti called Cloak's actions \"kind of scripted but not as deeply\" as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process \"we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" /> Framestore also worked on environment shots, the [[Mandelbrot set]] sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form \"one of the hardest effects we've had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful.\" Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a [[geode]]. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence at the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as \"it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [When he is talking to Strange] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff\u2026 these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [a] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [look] of the entire space.\" On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, \"We tried to make it alive all the time\u2014the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment,\" with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit \"with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [with] colors, crazy blacklight colors.\" He continued, \"It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [that] we really tried to be faithful to.\"<ref name=\"IGNVFX2\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Doctor Strange (soundtrack)}}\nIn May 2016, [[Michael Giacchino]] revealed that he would score the film.<ref name=\"Giacchino\" /> Derrickson called the score \"magic in the literal sense of the word,\" adding Giacchino \"is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with [[Temp track|temp music]].\"<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=\"AbbeyRoad\" /> During a recording session, [[Paul McCartney]] heard one of Giacchino's cues being recorded and likened it to [[The Beatles]] song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\".<ref name=\"Walrus\" /> Derrickson, a [[Bob Dylan]] fan, looked for a place in the film to include one of his songs, but could not find one. However, he was able to include the song \"[[Interstellar Overdrive]]\" by [[Pink Floyd]].<ref name=\"BobDylanPinkFloyd\" /><ref name=\"PinkFloyd\" /> Derrickson had hoped to use either \"Interstellar Overdrive\" or [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s \"[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]\" for the film's credits, but the [[Royalty payment#Music royalties|royalties]] to use either in the credits were too expensive, resulting in Giacchino creating the track \"The Master of the Mystic End Credits\".<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> A soundtrack album from [[Hollywood Records]] was released digitally on October 21, 2016, with a physical release on November 18, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn August 2015, a concept art trailer narrated by Derrickson was shown at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]]. The images showed artwork of Cumberbatch in a traditional Doctor Strange outfit from the comics, as well as a rough sequence of the plot, highlighting points such as Strange's car crash, his journey for healing, and fighting Ejiofor as Mordo (before the character was moved away from a villainous role in the film per discussions between Derrickson and the actor).<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"D232015\" /> The trailer was met with \"a very big reaction from the gathered crowd.\"<ref name=\"D232015\" />\n\nOn April 12, 2016, the first teaser trailer for the film debuted on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.<ref name=\"KimmelTrailer\" /><ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> Clark Collis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared the \"series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes\" featured in the trailer to the film ''Inception'',<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> as did Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]''. Forbes added that the structure of the trailer resembled early marketing for the film ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Graeme McMillian criticised these similarities, as well as similarities to ''The Matrix'' and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of [[Hugh Laurie]]'s [[Gregory House]] from ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', calling them not \"necessarily a real problem, of course ... [but] there's nothing there outside the derivative aspects: due to the nature of the trailer, there's no story beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe the performances will elevate the material.\" McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of \"Tilda Swinton literally knock[ing] Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body,\" but concluded, \"as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, this feels far less bold and assured\" than the first trailer for ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.<ref name=\"THRTrailer\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Marvel Comics]] released a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|prelude tie-in comic]] written by Will Corona Pilgrim, with art by Jorge Forn\u00e9s.<ref name=\"PreludeComic\" /> The issue sees four Masters of the Mystic Arts\u2013Kaecilius, Wong, Tina Minoru and Daniel Drumm\u2013pursue a woman who has stolen a mystical relic.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> A second issue, centered on the [[Ancient One]] training apprentices in the magical arts at [[Kamar-Taj]], was released a month later.<ref name=\"PreludeComic2\" /> Derrickson, Cumberbatch, Swinton, Ejiofor, McAdams, Mikkelsen, and Wong attended San Diego Comic-Con 2016, where they debuted an exclusive clip and the second trailer for the film.<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> The next month, the same Comic-Con clip was screened at the [[Asia Pop Comic Convention Manila]].<ref name=\"AsiaPopClip\" /> In September 2016, an additional prelude comic was released, centered on Kaecilius,<ref name=\"InfinitePrelude\" /> while behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' Blu-ray.<ref name=\"CapCWHomeMedia\" /> Also in September, Marvel, in partnership with [[Dolby Laboratories]], [[Broadcom]], [[Synchrony Financial|Synchrony Bank]], and [[Society for Science & the Public]], announced \"The Magic of STEM Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in [[STEM fields|STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields]]. The challenge was for contestants to submit videos of them finding mentors to explore ideas once thought to only be possible with magic. Five winners would attend the world premiere of the film, and receive a tour of [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]], as well as a $1,000 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving a mentorship with Walt Disney Studio's Digital Team.<ref name=\"ScienceContest\" />\n\nOn October 10, 2016, approximately 15 minutes of footage was screened at 115 IMAX 3D locations in North America, and select 3D and IMAX 3D locations worldwide. Fans attending the event received an exclusive IMAX poster for the film.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" /> Umberto Gonzales of [[TheWrap]] called the footage \"stunning to behold\". He added that a sequence shown in which the Ancient One sends Strange \"on his first trippy tour through the multiverse\" was \"where the IMAX 3D really shines. The audience is given an incredible visual tour of the multiverse which features other dimensions and other realities. It really is something to behold in IMAX 3D,\" concluding that \"after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage, IMAX 3D is the definitive format to see the film.\"<ref name=\"TheWrapIMAXReaction\" /> Britt Hayes for Screen Crush felt the footage was \"dizzying\" and \"far weirder and wilder than [the] trailers are letting on,\" though felt it was a bit difficult \"to judge some of what was shown out of context (especially earlier scenes)\". Regarding the same sequence where the Ancient One sends Strange through the multiverse, Hayes said, \"[[Seth Rogen]]'s comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on the psychedelic visuals employed here. It's astounding, elaborate stuff, and easily provides the most entertaining moments in the footage.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushIMAXReaction\" /> [[IGN]]'s Terri Schwartz said the sequences shown were where \"Derrickson's horror aesthetics shine through\".<ref name=\"IGNIMAXReaction\" />\n\nMarvel provided [[Twitter]] stickers, [[Giphy]] content, [[Facebook]] Live, [[Snapchat]] lenses and filter, [[Tumblr]] stunts, and [[Instagram]] special content related to the film. Additionally, [[Microsoft Surface]] had a promotional sponsorship of the film, due to the use of the device in the filmmaking process.

Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" /> Mara Reinstein of ''[[US Weekly]]'' called the film \"joyless\" and wrote, \"Despite [Benedict Cumberbatch's] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here \u2013 save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations.\"<ref name=\"USWeeklyReview\" /> [[Rex Reed]] of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' called ''Doctor Strange'' \"an awkwardly clich\u00e9-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality\" and said, \"None of it makes any sense...

There's so much progress that can be made.\" He would like to follow the example of ''The Dark Knight'' and \"bring in a villain where you really got to go deep [and have] a more visceral experience\". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more ''Doctor Strange'' solo film.<ref name=\"DenofGeekOct2016\" /> Derrickson hoped to feature<!--NIGHTMARE IS ALREADY WIKILINKED TO THE COMIC CHARACTER ABOVE--> Nightmare in a potential sequel,<ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is being \"kept in the loop\" about how the ''Avengers'' films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]].<ref name=\"DerricksonSRNov2016\" /> Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing [[Clea]] appear in a potential sequel.<ref name=\"CleaSequelPotential\" /> By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, ''[[Locke & Key (TV series)|Locke & Key]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelReturn\" /> Despite no official announcements, Wong said in October 2018 that he expected filming on a sequel to begin by the end of that year.<ref name=\"WongSequelFilming\" /> By December 2018, Derrickson had \"quietly\" finalized a deal to return to direct the sequel, and Cumberbatch and Wong were confirmed to reprise their roles from the first film, with McAdams stated as likely to return.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed2\" />\n\nIn July 2019, the sequel was announced as ''Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'', with a release date of May 7, 2021. Feige and Derrickson revealed that the sequel would have more of a horror tone than the first film, that [[Elizabeth Olsen]] would reprise her MCU role of [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch]], and that her [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' would tie into the events of the film.<ref name=\"SequelHorror\" /><ref name=\"SequelReleaseDate\" /> The film would also tie into the Disney+ series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''.<ref name=\"LokiSequel\" /> In October 2019, ''Collider'' reported that Jade Bartlett would be the film's screenwriter.<ref name=\"SequelBartlett\" /> In January 2020, Marvel and Derrickson announced that he would no longer direct the film due to creative differences, but would remain an executive producer on the film. No delays were expected for the start of filming that May.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelExit\" /> By February, it was reported that [[Sam Raimi]] was in negotiations to take over as director, Ejiofor

was shooting some stunt work with Zoe Saldana \u2013 I run between sets on one soundstage. Stan laughing at The Doors of Perception was what ended up in the film, but we shot other options, such as \u2013 Stan reading a book and leaning into the guy next to him, saying, 'Do you know what excelsior means?' \u2013 Stan throwing his head back and laughing as hard as he can, yelling, 'I'm laughing for no reason! I'm totally crazy!' \u2013 And, my favorite, Stan laughing hysterically at a Garfield book, hooting, 'He HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!' Supposedly that one was in the film for a while, but it ended up being too long for the scene.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the fourteenth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Scott Derrickson]] from a screenplay he wrote with [[Jon Spaihts]] and [[C. Robert Cargill]], and stars<!-- Order based on billing block --> [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as surgeon Stephen Strange along with [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Rachel McAdams]], [[Benedict Wong]], [[Michael Stuhlbarg]], [[Benjamin Bratt]], [[Scott Adkins]], [[Mads Mikkelsen]], and [[Tilda Swinton]]. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.\n\nVarious incarnations of a Doctor Strange film adaptation had been in development since the mid-1980s, until [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired the film rights in April 2005 on behalf of Marvel Studios. [[Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer]] were brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson was hired to direct, with Spaihts re-writing the script. Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating a schedule change to work around his other commitments. This gave Derrickson time to work on the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help. [[Principal photography]] on the film began in November 2015 in Nepal, before moving to England and Hong Kong, and wrapping up in New York City in April 2016.\n\n''Doctor Strange'' had its world premiere in Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, and was released in the United States on November 4, in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]]. The film grossed over $677 million worldwide, was met with praise for its visuals and cast, and received awards attention, including an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. A sequel, ''[[#Sequel|Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness]]'', is scheduled for release on May 7, 2021.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn [[Kathmandu]], the sorcerer [[Kaecilius]] and his zealots enter the secret compound [[Kamar-Taj]] and behead its librarian. They steal a few pages from an ancient, mystical text belonging to the [[Ancient One]], a long-lived sorcerer who has taught every student at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, but Kaecilius and his followers escape.\n\nIn [[New York City]], [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]], a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant [[neurosurgeon]], severely injures his hands in a car crash, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]] tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by [[Baron Mordo|Mordo]], a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the [[astral plane]] and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She reluctantly agrees to train Strange, whose arrogance and ambition remind her of Kaecilius.\n\nStrange studies under the Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient books in the library that is now guarded by Master [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]. Strange learns that Earth is protected from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called [[Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctums]], in New York City, [[London]], and [[Hong Kong]], which are all directly accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again. Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical [[Eye of Agamotto]]. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.\n\nKaecilius uses the stolen pages to contact [[Dormammu]] of the [[Dark Dimension (comics)|Dark Dimension]], where time is non-existent. Kaecilius destroys the London Sanctum to weaken Earth's protection. The zealots then attack the New York Sanctum, killing its guardian, but Strange holds them off with the help of the [[Cloak of Levitation]], only to be critically injured during a skirmish. He teleports himself back to the hospital where Palmer saves him. Upon returning to the Sanctum, Strange reveals to Mordo that the Ancient One has been drawing power from the Dark Dimension to sustain her long life, and Mordo becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One. After a fight in the Mirror Dimension of New York, Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One and escapes to Hong Kong. Before dying, she tells Strange that he too will have to bend the rules to complement Mordo's steadfast nature in order to defeat Kaecilius. Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead, the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to reverse time and save Wong, then enters the Dark Dimension and creates a [[time loop]] around himself and Dormammu. After repeatedly killing Strange to no avail, Dormammu finally gives in to Strange's demand that he permanently leave Earth alone and take Kaecilius and his zealots with him in return for Strange breaking the loop.\n\nDisillusioned by Strange and the Ancient One defying nature's laws, Mordo renounces his sorcerer career and departs. Strange returns the Eye to Kamar-Taj and takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies with Wong. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Strange decides to help [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], who has brought his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] to Earth to search for their father, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]].{{refn|name=Ragnarok|group=N|As depicted in the 2017 film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses to walk, telling him that Earth has \"too many sorcerers\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Doctor Strange cast by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Left to right: Cumberbatch, Derrickson, Swinton, McAdams, Ejiofor, Mikkelsen, and Wong at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\n<!--Do NOT add cast members unless they are confirmed by a reliable source.

This version of Mordo is a combination of different characters from the Doctor Strange mythos, and unlike in the comics is not introduced as villainous.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /><ref name=\"EjioforConfirm\" /> Ejiofor noted this, calling Mordo \"a very complex character that, really, I don't think can be nailed down either way\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> Director [[Scott Derrickson]] added that the change in character stemmed from casting Ejiofor and conversations the director had with him.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Ejiofor described Mordo's relationship with the Ancient One as \"long and intense\",<ref name=\"Ejiofor3\" /> while noting a \"growing respect\" between the character and Strange, until \"things get complicated\".<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Derrickson felt Mordo was a [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], saying \"When someone gives themselves over to an extraordinarily strict moral code, the process of breaking out of that is a violent one. He becomes disillusioned with the Ancient One's [moral contradictions]. The difference is Strange can accept that contradiction. Mordo cannot cope with it,\"<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> which leads to the \"antagonism between Mordo and Strange\" to explore in future films.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /> Discussing the diversity of the film's cast when addressing the controversial casting of the characters the Ancient One and [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]], Derrickson was confident that the decision to cast Ejiofor as Mordo, and thus changing the character \"from white to black\", was the right one to make.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]]: <br />An emergency surgeon<ref name=\"McAdams2\" /><ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> initially written as a love interest for Strange, but shortly before filming, Derrickson suggested that this trope be subverted by making the two characters lovers as part of their backstory and coming \"out the other side of it as friends\". McAdams described this dynamic by saying, \"The love is between them no matter what stage they're at in the actual relationship.\"<ref name=\"NoLoveInterest\" /> With this change in characterization, producer [[Kevin Feige]] described Palmer as a \"lynchpin to [Strange's] old life, once he steps into the role of a sorcerer. She is someone he connects with at the beginning, and reconnects with, and helps anchor his humanity.\"<ref name=\"McAdams3\" /> He explained that having this character be a \"connection to Strange's life in New York City, in the normal world\" after his journey was important to the studio, which is why Palmer was chosen for the character over the more prominent, but more fantastical character [[Clea]].<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg3\" /> Palmer is also known as the hero [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]] in the comics, a storyline that does not play into the film, but that Feige hinted could be explored in future films. [[Rosario Dawson]] portrays another Night Nurse character, [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]], in Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Netflix television series]].<ref name=\"NightNurse\" />\n* [[Benedict Wong]] as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]]:<ref name=\"Wong\" /> <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of [[Kamar-Taj]]'s most valuable relics and books.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> The character is depicted in the comics as Strange's Asian, \"tea-making manservant\", a [[ethnic stereotype|racial stereotype]] that Derrickson did not want in the film,<ref name=\"WongCut\" /><ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> and so the character was not included in the film's script. After the non-Asian actress [[Tilda Swinton]] was cast as the other significant Asian character from the ''Doctor Strange'' comics, the Ancient One\u2014which was also done to avoid the comics' racial stereotypes\u2014Derrickson felt obligated to find a way to include Wong in the film. The character as he ultimately appears is \"completely subverted as a character and reworked into something that didn't fall into any of the stereotypes of the comics\",<ref name=\"WongCut\" /> which Derrickson was pleased gave an Asian character \"a strong presence in the movie\".<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Actor Wong was also pleased with the changes made to the character, and described him as \"a drill sergeant to Kamar-Taj\" rather than a manservant. He does not practice martial arts in the film, avoiding another racial stereotype.<ref name=\"WongJun2016\" /> Derrickson added that Wong will have \"a strong presence in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" moving forward.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Nicodemus West]]: A rival surgeon to Strange.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"Stuhlbarg\" />\n* [[Benjamin Bratt]] as Jonathan Pangborn: A [[paraplegic]] who learned from the Ancient One how to heal himself through the mystic arts.<ref name=\"Bratt\" /><ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /><ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Lucian: One of Kaecilius' followers.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Lucian\"/>\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as [[Kaecilius]]: <br />A Master of the Mystic Arts who broke away from the Ancient One.<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /><ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> A combination of several antagonists from the comics, Kaecilius was used in the film to drive the introduction and development of bigger villains for the future, including \"certain individuals who live in other dimensions\". Derrickson compared this dynamic to that of [[Saruman]] and [[Sauron]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', giving the film a \"huge and fantastical\" villain like Sauron, but also having \"human relateability\" with Kaecilius, like Saruman, for Strange to face throughout the film.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> Derrickson admitted that Marvel's villains are often criticized, and noted that MCU films dedicate little time to developing antagonists. For ''Doctor Strange'', he just hoped to show \"Kaecilius's point of view and what makes him tick\" in the time that he could,<ref name=\"DerricksonVillainOct2016\" /> feeling that the character is a \"man of ideas\" with \"watertight logic\" like John Doe from ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and [[The Joker (The Dark Knight)|the Joker]] from ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSept2016\" /> On these motivations, Feige explained that Kaecilius believes the Ancient One is a hypocrite, protecting her own power base, and that the world may be better off \"if we were to allow some of these other things through.\"<ref name=\"Mikkelsen\" /> Mikkelsen's makeup took between 2\u20133 hours to apply.<ref name=\"MikkelsenMakeup\" />\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as the [[Ancient One]]: <br />A [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] mystic<ref name=\"MarvelAncientOneResponse\" /> who becomes Strange's mentor.<ref name=\"Ejiofor2\" /> The character in the comics is a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] man, a situation which co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]] compared to the [[Kobayashi Maru]], an unwinnable training exercise in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe. He explained that adapting the character as the comics portrayed him would be realizing the major Asian [[Fu Manchu]] stereotype, and would involve the film with the [[Tibetan sovereignty debate]], but not giving one of few significant Asian roles to an Asian actor would also understandably be received negatively.<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /><ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Derrickson wanted to change the character to be an Asian woman, but felt that an older Asian woman would invoke the [[Dragon Lady]] stereotype, while a younger Asian woman would be perceived as exploiting [[Asian fetish]] and \"a fanboy's dream girl\". To avoid the character filling any of those three stereotypes, or enabling the stereotype of a \"Western character coming to Asia to learn about being Asian\",<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" /> Derrickson decided to cast a non-Asian actor in the role, but to still take the opportunity to cast \"an amazing actress in a male role\".<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> Feeling that Swinton was the obvious choice to play \"domineering, secretive, ethereal, enigmatic, [and] mystical\", Derrickson wrote the Ancient One in the film specifically for the actress, before she was offered the role.<ref name=\"WorldPremiere\" /> Additionally, though the film uses the terms \"her\" and \"she\", Swinton chose to portray the character as [[Androgyny|androgynous]], while Feige explained that the Ancient One and Sorcerer Supreme are mantles in the film held by multiple characters through time, so a more comic-accurate Ancient One could exist within the MCU.<ref name=\"SwintonDec2015\" /><ref name=\"FeigeJune2015\" /> Still, Swinton's casting was widely criticized as [[Whitewashing in film|whitewashing]].<ref name=\"SwintonResponse\" /> In response to this, Derrickson said that though he was pleased with the diversity of the film's cast, in terms of both gender and ethnicity, \"Asians have been whitewashed and stereotyped in American cinema for over a century and people should be mad or nothing will change. What I did was the lesser of two evils, but it is still an evil.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWhitewashing\" />\n\nCumberbatch also portrays, uncredited, the villainous entity [[Dormammu]]. The actor suggested he take on the role to Derrickson, feeling that having the character be a \"horrific\" reflection of Strange would work better than just \"being a big ghoulish monster\". The director agreed, elaborating that the casting implies that Dormammu does not have a normal physical form in his own dimension, and so is simply imitating Strange for their confrontation. To create the character, Cumberbatch provided motion-capture reference for the visual effects team, and his voice was blended with that of another uncredited British actor, whom Derrickson described as having \"a very deep voice\".<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /><ref name=\"DormammuVoice\" /> The producers also had [[Tony Todd]] record voice over for Dormammu as an alternative to Cumberbatch, but ultimately decided on using Cumberbatch for the voice.<ref name=\"ToddDormammu\" />\n\n[[Chris Hemsworth]] reprises his role of [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] from previous MCU films in the film's mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> Additionally, [[Linda Louise Duan]] appears, unnamed, as [[Tina Minoru]],<ref name=\"Duan\" /><ref name=\"MinoruUnnamed\" /> Mark Anthony Brighton portrays [[Daniel Drumm]],<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /> and Topo Wresniwiro portrays Hamir,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> all Masters of the Mystic Arts under the Ancient One.

Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of ''[[Murder Mysteries]]'',<ref name=\"Goyer\" /> and promised not to be highly dependent on [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"IGN\" /> However, by August 2001, [[Miramax]] acquired the film rights from Dimension,<ref name=\"Miramax\" /> and by March 2002, Goyer had dropped out of the project.<ref name=\"GoyerDrop\" /> A 2005 release date was announced the next March,<ref name=\"2005release\" /> while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. [[Marvel Studios]] CEO [[Avi Arad]] stated, \"We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but we are working on it. We are trying to find the real [[Jerry Garcia]] of the writing community.\"<ref name=\"AradWriter\" /> In April 2005, [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired ''Doctor Strange'' from Miramax, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Paramount\" /> In 2007, [[Guillermo del Toro]] and [[Neil Gaiman]] pitched a version of the film to Marvel, with Gaiman writing and del Toro directing.

The entire history of the comics is extraordinary.|source=\u2014Scott Derrickson, director of ''Doctor Strange''<ref name=\"DerricksonQuote\" />}}\nIn June 2014, Derrickson was chosen to direct the film.<ref name=\"Derrickson\" /> He had written a 12-page scene for the film featuring Strange and an assailant fighting in the [[astral plane]] while a doctor attempts to save Strange's physical body in a hospital, based on a sequence from the comic ''[[Doctor Strange: The Oath]]''. Derrickson illustrated the sequence with his own concept art, alongside storyboards from professional artists and an [[Storyboards#Animatics|animatic]], which he presented in a 90-minute pitch to the studio. This cost Derrickson an \"obnoxious amount\" of his own money, but he felt it necessary to prove \"that I wanted [the job] more than anyone\", especially after Marvel told him that more people had lobbied to direct ''Doctor Strange'' than any of their other films.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> Derrickson ultimately had eight meetings with Marvel for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> After he was hired, Marvel bought the 12-page scene from Derrickson, and it became one of the film's main set pieces.<ref name=\"DerricksonHiring\" /><ref name=\"LuluSister\" /> On transitioning from horror films to a superhero film, Derrickson said, \"It was nice to work on something more positive. And not have my headspace in something so dark for so long. But it was also weirdly similar because of the fantastical nature of the movie\". In his horror films, Derrickson tried to use \"real characters and real character drama played by good actors ... [to] encounter the fantastical\", and so he wanted actors of the same high caliber for ''Doctor Strange'' through which he could introduce the more fantastical elements to the MCU.<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" />\n\nDerrickson and Marvel had originally discussed him writing the film alongside his ''[[Sinister (film)|Sinister]]'' co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]], with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel felt that they would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer,<ref name=\"CargillPodcast\" /> with [[Jon Spaihts]] hired to rewrite the script instead.<ref name=\"CumberbatchOfficial\" /><ref name=\"Spaihts\" /> Spaihts, a big fan of ''Doctor Strange'' as a child, had started \"pestering\" Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked \"all afternoon, and the fit was right\",<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not \"take that answer. Call them back, tell them there's a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room\", and after talking with Marvel for \"another three or four hours\" he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film.<ref name=\"Spaihts/FilmNov2016\" /> Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a \"fully-formed\" sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that \"the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and tell our best version of it.\" Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as \"little things\" from Spaihts, \"like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple.\"<ref name=\"SpaihtsColliderNov2016\" /> Derrickson wanted [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of \"nightmares themselves as being a dimension\",<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /><ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> but Feige felt \"getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension\" would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces.

We're not going to spend a lot of time on that, but there will be some of that. And particularly for a character like Strange, who goes from a man of science to a man of faith and who traverses both worlds.\"<ref name=\"FeigeMar2014\" /> In developing the film's magic, Derrickson felt a responsibility to not repeat the representation of magic from previous films, like ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' and ''Harry Potter'', wanting \"to find a new way to make it feel more tactical and real and surreal.

So by grounding your stories enough in science to not so much make them plausible, but to allow that science to open up new possibilities\u2014people are used to that in their lives. So I think it makes sense to them, and it's exciting to them\". This was an aspect of previous MCU films that Frank called a \"great thing ... speaking as a scientist\", saying that \"they build a coherent and consistent universe that respects the scientific process and that uses enough of real science to make things plausible or build off them.\"<ref name=\"FrankConsultant2\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began in [[Nepal]] on November 4, 2015, under the [[working title]] ''Checkmate''.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /><ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]], serving as cinematographer for the film after doing the same on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', described ''Doctor Strange'' as Marvel's ''Fantasia'', and noted that a lot of [[previsualization]] was required to figure out how to shoot the \"[[Psychedelia|psychedelic]]\", [[M.

After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]]. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event \"was all the more reason to shoot there\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was \"absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it's so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It's important to a film like this\u2014which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension\u2014that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The eventual filming locations around the [[Kathmandu Valley]] included the [[Pashupatinath Temple|Pashupatinath]] and [[Swayambhunath]] Temples;<ref name=\"NepalShooting\" /> [[Thamel]] and [[New Road of Kathmandu|New Road]] in [[Kathmandu]];<ref name=\"NepalShooting4\" /> and the [[Patan Durbar Square]] in [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]].<ref name=\"NepalShooting3\" /><ref name=\"NepalShooting5\" />\n\nProduction moved to [[Longcross Studios]] in [[Surrey]], England on November 11,<ref name=\"Longcross\" /> and was scheduled to stay there until March 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingScheduledEnd\" /> The real Kathmandu street that led into the fictional Kamar-Taj courtyard was replicated at Longcross, which production designer Charles Wood described as \"very hard because Kathmandu is a most beautiful city and it's steeped in history. To transition from that level of detail and history, with the shape of the streets, the warping of the buildings, these ancient bricks and these ancient tiles, was a real challenge.\" For authenticity, the set was dressed with real food, and populated with dogs, pigeons, and Nepalese extras, many of whom were relatives of people who live on the real Kathmandu street.<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> The inside of [[Kamar-Taj]] was also constructed at Longcross, with \"sculptors creating beautiful columns and wall decorations and craftsmen building screens and doors to evoke the exotic feel of the ancient sanctuary.\" Wood's goal was to make the set feel like the Ancient One and her disciples actually lived there, and give it a \"truly spiritual, truly magical\" feel, while integrating it into a real building that the production filmed in Kathmandu. This and the Kathmandu street were two of twenty-one sets that the crew built at Longcross. Others included Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum, and a Hong Kong street \"complete with over 80 neon signs and a giant roof to keep the rain out.\"<ref name=\"RTFilming\" /> [[Citypoint]] in Ropemaker Street, London, doubled as the New York City building where the Ancient One falls to her death.<ref name=\"Citypoint\" />\n\nFilming also took place in Hong Kong,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> and in New York City's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingNov2015\" /> Additional New York City-set scenes were shot at Shepperton Studios,<ref name=\"Pinewood\" /><ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> and later in London.<ref name=\"LondonFilming\" /> By the end of November, the casting of Mikkelsen and Stuhlbarg was confirmed,<ref name=\"MarvelProductionBegins\" /> alongside [[Amy Landecker]] and [[Scott Adkins]] in unspecified roles.<ref name=\"Adkins\"/><ref name=\"Landecker\" /> Additionally, [[Benedict Wong]] heard about the film from his friend Ejiofor, and sought a role in it himself.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> He was cast as [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in January,<ref name=\"Wong\" /> and immediately joined the production for filming.<ref name=\"WongVulture\" /> [[Lamborghini]] provided six [[Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n#Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4 Spyder (2016\u2013)|Hurac\u00e1n LP 610-4s]] for use in the film, one of which the production wrecked during filming.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> Lamborghini said that they felt \"there are a lot of characteristics of Doctor Strange that are connected with the Lamborghini philosophy.\"<ref name=\"Lamborghini\" /> The Lamborghini crash scene was filmed at [[Northfleet]], Kent by the [[River Thames]].<ref name=\"KentFilming\" /> Also in January 2016, filming took place at [[Exeter College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"ExeterCollege\" /><ref name=\"DSFunFactsPDF\" /> The next month, Feige revealed that the film originally had a prologue that took place in [[CERN]], due to the real world research being done at the facility on alternate dimensions and parallel universes.<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016\" /> Production moved to New York City's [[Flatiron District]] in April,<ref name=\"NYCFilming\" /> where set photos revealed that Zara Phythian had joined the cast.<ref name=\"Phythian\" /> Principal photography [[wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] in New York City on April 3, 2016.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn June 2016, a [[Diamond Select Toys]] press release for ''Doctor Strange'' toys, in their Marvel [[Minimates]] line, named Mikkelsen's character [[Kaecilius]] and McAdams' character [[Night Nurse (comics)#Christine Palmer|Christine Palmer]].<ref name=\"Kaecilius\" /> Mikkelsen's role was confirmed in an official tie-in comic for the film,<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> while McAdams' was confirmed at San Diego Comic Con 2016.<ref name=\"McAdamsRole\" /> Additionally, [[Benjamin Bratt]] was revealed to have been cast<ref name=\"Bratt\" /> as Jonathan Pangborn;<ref name=\"DSCastPDF\" /> Adkins' role was revealed to be Lucian, a follower of Kaecilius;<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> and Landecker's role was later revealed to be anesthesiologist Dr. Bruner.<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /> The latter was mostly cut from the film,<ref name=\"OfficialCredits\" /><ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> with Landecker explaining that she had been cast in the small role, for two scenes at the beginning of the film, because Derrickson was a fan of her performance in ''[[A Serious Man]]'', which also starred Stuhlbarg. After filming her first scene, in which she assists Strange with a surgery, Landecker asked not to be involved in the other scene because she had no lines for it and was only seen from behind, and instead wished to attend a special premiere at the [[White House]] for her series ''[[Transparent (TV series)|Transparent]]''. The actress believed she was later cut from the first scene, but she is still credited for a brief appearance.<ref name=\"LandeckerExplanation\" /> Also, Derrickson revealed that [[Lulu Wilson]] had been cast as Strange's sister, for a scene depicting her drowning at a young age. The scene had been shot, and Derrickson thought it was \"great [as a] self-contained scene\", but it \"didn't work\" with the rest of the film, and was cut.<ref name=\"LuluSister\" />\n\nAlso at San Diego Comic Con, Derrickson noted that there were still \"a couple pickup shoots\" to do for the film to \"clarify the logic\".<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> Further content for the film's training sequence was also shot during these reshoots, as early test audiences \"loved [the training portion of the film] and wanted more\".<ref name=\"DerricksonCommentary\" /> Wong indicated that the reshoots had been completed in August.<ref name=\"WongReshootWrap\" /> [[Dan Harmon]] wrote material for these additional scenes,<ref name=\"Harmon\" /> which Derrickson described as \"script analysis and dialogue work\", not enough to receive credit in the film.<ref name=\"Harmon2\" /> Feige said that in addition to any humor that Harmon could add to the film, he was brought on to \"give us his opinions on the sci-fi concepts.\"<ref name=\"Harmon3\" /> Before the film's sets were demolished, ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' director [[Taika Waititi]] took advantage by writing and filming a scene featuring Strange meeting [[Chris Hemsworth]]'s [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]. The scene was for ''Ragnarok'' and shot before that film began production. Derrickson and Marvel felt the scene was \"kind of perfect\" to show Strange joining the wider MCU after his stand alone introduction, and so added it to ''Doctor Strange'' as a mid-credits scene.<ref name=\"Hemsworth\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" /> A post-credits scene, directed by Derrickson, teases Mordo's role as an antagonist to Strange in a potential ''Doctor Strange'' sequel.<ref name=\"PostCreditScene\" /> Stan Lee's cameo in the film was directed by Gunn on the set of ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''. This was alongside several other Lee cameos, to limit the amount of travel he had to do for the next four MCU films. Gunn contacted Derrickson during the shoot to ensure that the shot matched up with the respective ''Doctor Strange'' scene, and \"kept throwing lines at\" Lee on the day to give Derrickson and Marvel plenty of options to choose from for the film.<ref name=\"GunnCameos\" /> Additional options Gunn filmed included Lee reading a book and asking a gentleman next to him if he knew what the word [[wikt:excelsior|excelsior]] meant; Lee laughing really hard and stating he was laughing for no reason, being \"totally crazy\"; and Lee laughing hysterically at a ''[[Garfield]]'' book, noting how the character \"HATES Mondays but he LOVES lasagna!\". Gunn felt the ''Garfield'' option was originally meant to appear in the final version of the film, but ended up being too long for the scene.<ref name=\"GunnLeeOptions\" /> By October 10, 2016, Derrickson had completed the film.<ref name=\"IMAXScreening\" />\n\nFeige described the film's use of 3D as serving the storytelling, saying, \"hopefully it helps bend people's minds even more than with just the flat screen.\"<ref name=\"Feige3DUse\" /> He said that \"there are sequences of the film that 3D is actually necessary to tell the dimensional story that is happening through visuals\". However, he noted that during visual effects reviews for the film it became apparent that these sequences were adversely affecting the story when viewed in 2D, which necessitated adjustments so the sequences would work in all formats.<ref name=\"Feige3DCollider\" /> Over one hour of footage in the film was \"specially formatted\" for IMAX.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\nVisual effects for ''Doctor Strange'' were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), [[Method Studios]], [[Framestore]], Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV,<ref name=\"FXguide\" /><ref name=\"ArtofVFX\" /> contributing to 1450 effects shots. [[Previsualization]] was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, whips, stalks and aerial 'lily pads', and portals).<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> Visual effects supervisor [[Stephane Ceretti]], who also worked on ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', explained the similarities and differences between the two films, saying, \"there's some resemblance in some of the things that we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In [''Guardians''], it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. ''Guardians'' was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" />\n\nFurther discussing the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as \"the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [which] were all about these weird visuals\",<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> as well as \"a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher\".<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from \"a bunch of experimental, [[fractal]] videos from [[YouTube]]\" that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game ''[[Monument Valley (video game)|Monument Valley]]''.<ref name=\"LATimesVisuals\" /> Derrickson's \"ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects to do things that are fresh and new\u2014to not just blow things up.\"<ref name=\"CBRAug2016\" /> Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them \"to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning...\" Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action \"in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we've seen in any other movies.\"<ref name=\"FeigeSept2016Pg2\" /> On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on ''The Oath'' comic, while adding that the end fight was \"an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork\" from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take ''[[Inception]]'' \"to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie.\"<ref name=\"DerricksonWrapNov2016\" /> Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of \"a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up and they have to close it\", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing \"which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder\".<ref name=\"DerricksonEnding\" />\n\n[[File:Doctor Strange mirror dimension.jpg|thumb|left|The Manhattan mirror sequence was mostly filmed on green screen (top), with visual effects added by [[Industrial Light & Magic|ILM]] (bottom).<ref name=\"FXguide\" />]]\nILM worked on the folding Manhattan mirror sequence (chosen because of their work creating a digital New York in ''The Avengers'') and the time fight sequence in Hong Kong, which consisted of 200 and 150 shots, respectively. They began work on the film 10 months before filming began to plan out the Manhattan sequence; it was mainly CGI, though some New York location shots were used. The sequence was mainly handled by ILM's San Francisco and Vancouver offices. The Hong Kong time sequence was done mainly by ILM's London office. ILM also created digital doubles for many of the actors, which were shared with the other vendors. Method Studios, who worked on the [[Microverse|Quantum Realm]] in ''Ant-Man'', worked on the \"magical mystery tour\" sequence, with Strange hurtling through various dimensions. The sequence was handled by Method's Los Angeles studio, with their Vancouver studio contributing the opening shot of the sequence. The only shot Method did not work on in the sequence was the one that linked to Dormammu, as Luma Pictures assisted in his creation (they handled his other appearances in the film). Method created 7 dimensions for the sequence: the initial wormhole to the \"Speaker Cone\"; the Bioluminesce world; the fractals of \"soft solid\" world; a version of the Quantum Realm; Strange falling through his own eye and Cosmic Scream; the Dark Dimension; and the Shape Shifting realm. The Shape Shifting realm originally had Strange morphing and changing shape, but that was ultimately removed as Derrickson felt the audience needed to see Cumberbatch. Method's Vancouver studio created Strange's car crash, the rooftop training, and the sequence in which Strange experiments with time on an apple in the Kamar-Taj library. The car crash blended the high speed photography and some green screen sequences, with digital assets for both Cumberbatch and the car. In total, Method worked on 270 effects shots.<ref name=\"FXguide\" />\n\nFramestore was chosen to work on the Cloak of Levitation, due to their work creating [[Rocket (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Rocket]] in ''Guardians of the Galaxy''. Ceretti called Cloak's actions \"kind of scripted but not as deeply\" as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process \"we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film\".<ref name=\"IGNVFX\" /> Framestore also worked on environment shots, the [[Mandelbrot set]] sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form \"one of the hardest effects we've had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful.\" Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a [[geode]]. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence at the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"FXguide\" /> In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as \"it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [When he is talking to Strange] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff\u2026 these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [a] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [look] of the entire space.\" On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, \"We tried to make it alive all the time\u2014the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment,\" with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit \"with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [with] colors, crazy blacklight colors.\" He continued, \"It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [that] we really tried to be faithful to.\"<ref name=\"IGNVFX2\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Doctor Strange (soundtrack)}}\nIn May 2016, [[Michael Giacchino]] revealed that he would score the film.<ref name=\"Giacchino\" /> Derrickson called the score \"magic in the literal sense of the word,\" adding Giacchino \"is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with [[Temp track|temp music]].\"<ref name=\"DerricksonColliderSDCC\" /> The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=\"AbbeyRoad\" /> During a recording session, [[Paul McCartney]] heard one of Giacchino's cues being recorded and likened it to [[The Beatles]] song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\".<ref name=\"Walrus\" /> Derrickson, a [[Bob Dylan]] fan, looked for a place in the film to include one of his songs, but could not find one. However, he was able to include the song \"[[Interstellar Overdrive]]\" by [[Pink Floyd]].<ref name=\"BobDylanPinkFloyd\" /><ref name=\"PinkFloyd\" /> Derrickson had hoped to use either \"Interstellar Overdrive\" or [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s \"[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]\" for the film's credits, but the [[Royalty payment#Music royalties|royalties]] to use either in the credits were too expensive, resulting in Giacchino creating the track \"The Master of the Mystic End Credits\".<ref name=\"Empire12Things\" /> A soundtrack album from [[Hollywood Records]] was released digitally on October 21, 2016, with a physical release on November 18, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" /><ref name=\"Soundtrack2\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn August 2015, a concept art trailer narrated by Derrickson was shown at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]]. The images showed artwork of Cumberbatch in a traditional Doctor Strange outfit from the comics, as well as a rough sequence of the plot, highlighting points such as Strange's car crash, his journey for healing, and fighting Ejiofor as Mordo (before the character was moved away from a villainous role in the film per discussions between Derrickson and the actor).<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" /><ref name=\"D232015\" /> The trailer was met with \"a very big reaction from the gathered crowd.\"<ref name=\"D232015\" />\n\nOn April 12, 2016, the first teaser trailer for the film debuted on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''.<ref name=\"KimmelTrailer\" /><ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> Clark Collis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared the \"series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes\" featured in the trailer to the film ''Inception'',<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" /> as did Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]''. Forbes added that the structure of the trailer resembled early marketing for the film ''[[Batman Begins]]''.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Graeme McMillian criticised these similarities, as well as similarities to ''The Matrix'' and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of [[Hugh Laurie]]'s [[Gregory House]] from ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', calling them not \"necessarily a real problem, of course ... [but] there's nothing there outside the derivative aspects: due to the nature of the trailer, there's no story beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide that maybe the performances will elevate the material.\" McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of \"Tilda Swinton literally knock[ing] Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body,\" but concluded, \"as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, this feels far less bold and assured\" than the first trailer for ''Guardians of the Galaxy''.<ref name=\"THRTrailer\" />\n\nIn July 2016, [[Marvel Comics]] released a [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|prelude tie-in comic]] written by Will Corona Pilgrim, with art by Jorge Forn\u00e9s.<ref name=\"PreludeComic\" /> The issue sees four Masters of the Mystic Arts\u2013Kaecilius, Wong, Tina Minoru and Daniel Drumm\u2013pursue a woman who has stolen a mystical relic.<ref name=\"PreludeSynopsis\" /> A second issue, centered on the [[Ancient One]] training apprentices in the magical arts at [[Kamar-Taj]], was released a month later.<ref name=\"PreludeComic2\" /> Derrickson, Cumberbatch, Swinton, Ejiofor, McAdams, Mikkelsen, and Wong attended San Diego Comic-Con 2016, where they debuted an exclusive clip and the second trailer for the film.<ref name=\"SDCC2016\" /> The next month, the same Comic-Con clip was screened at the [[Asia Pop Comic Convention Manila]].<ref name=\"AsiaPopClip\" /> In September 2016, an additional prelude comic was released, centered on Kaecilius,<ref name=\"InfinitePrelude\" /> while behind the scenes footage was released as a special feature on the ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' Blu-ray.<ref name=\"CapCWHomeMedia\" /> Also in September, Marvel, in partnership with [[Dolby Laboratories]], [[Broadcom]], [[Synchrony Financial|Synchrony Bank]], and [[Society for Science & the Public]], announced \"The Magic of STEM Challenge\", aimed at females aged 15 through 18 in [[STEM fields|STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) fields]]. The challenge was for contestants to submit videos of them finding mentors to explore ideas once thought to only be possible with magic. Five winners would attend the world premiere of the film, and receive a tour of [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]], as well as a $1,000 saving account from Synchrony Bank, with one grand prize winner receiving a mentorship with Walt Disney Studio's Digital Team.<ref name=\"ScienceContest\" />\n\nOn October 10, 2016, approximately 15 minutes of footage was screened at 115 IMAX 3D locations in North America, and select 3D and IMAX 3D locations worldwide. Fans attending the event received an exclusive IMAX poster for the film.<ref name=\"IMAXFootage\" /> Umberto Gonzales of [[TheWrap]] called the footage \"stunning to behold\". He added that a sequence shown in which the Ancient One sends Strange \"on his first trippy tour through the multiverse\" was \"where the IMAX 3D really shines. The audience is given an incredible visual tour of the multiverse which features other dimensions and other realities. It really is something to behold in IMAX 3D,\" concluding that \"after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage, IMAX 3D is the definitive format to see the film.\"<ref name=\"TheWrapIMAXReaction\" /> Britt Hayes for Screen Crush felt the footage was \"dizzying\" and \"far weirder and wilder than [the] trailers are letting on,\" though felt it was a bit difficult \"to judge some of what was shown out of context (especially earlier scenes)\". Regarding the same sequence where the Ancient One sends Strange through the multiverse, Hayes said, \"[[Seth Rogen]]'s comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on the psychedelic visuals employed here. It's astounding, elaborate stuff, and easily provides the most entertaining moments in the footage.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushIMAXReaction\" /> [[IGN]]'s Terri Schwartz said the sequences shown were where \"Derrickson's horror aesthetics shine through\".<ref name=\"IGNIMAXReaction\" />\n\nMarvel provided [[Twitter]] stickers, [[Giphy]] content, [[Facebook]] Live, [[Snapchat]] lenses and filter, [[Tumblr]] stunts, and [[Instagram]] special content related to the film. Additionally, [[Microsoft Surface]] had a promotional sponsorship of the film, due to the use of the device in the filmmaking process.

Underneath all of its improvements, the core narrative is something we've seen countless times.\"<ref name=\"EbertReview\" /> Mara Reinstein of ''[[US Weekly]]'' called the film \"joyless\" and wrote, \"Despite [Benedict Cumberbatch's] alluring powers, he can't save an overly convoluted film that relies on a galaxy of derivative 3-D special-effect tricks... Nobody is having much fun here \u2013 save for the doctor's Cloak of Levitation that has its own devilish personality and can whisk him out of scary situations.\"<ref name=\"USWeeklyReview\" /> [[Rex Reed]] of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' called ''Doctor Strange'' \"an awkwardly clich\u00e9-riddled mix of hamstrung imagination and bizarro reality\" and said, \"None of it makes any sense...

There's so much progress that can be made.\" He would like to follow the example of ''The Dark Knight'' and \"bring in a villain where you really got to go deep [and have] a more visceral experience\". Cumberbatch added that he had signed on for at least one more ''Doctor Strange'' solo film.<ref name=\"DenofGeekOct2016\" /> Derrickson hoped to feature<!--NIGHTMARE IS ALREADY WIKILINKED TO THE COMIC CHARACTER ABOVE--> Nightmare in a potential sequel,<ref name=\"IGNOct2016\" /> and expressed interest in further exploring the characters Jonathan Pangborn and Hamir in a sequel, after their smaller roles in the first film. He also explained that he is being \"kept in the loop\" about how the ''Avengers'' films will use Strange, because of his close relationships with Feige and co-director [[Russo brothers|Joe Russo]].<ref name=\"DerricksonSRNov2016\" /> Spaihts has also expressed interest in seeing [[Clea]] appear in a potential sequel.<ref name=\"CleaSequelPotential\" /> By April 2017, it was reported that Derrickson would return for a potential sequel, beginning work on it after fulfilling his commitments to the television series, ''[[Locke & Key (TV series)|Locke & Key]]''.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelReturn\" /> Despite no official announcements, Wong said in October 2018 that he expected filming on a sequel to begin by the end of that year.<ref name=\"WongSequelFilming\" /> By December 2018, Derrickson had \"quietly\" finalized a deal to return to direct the sequel, and Cumberbatch and Wong were confirmed to reprise their roles from the first film, with McAdams stated as likely to return.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"DerricksonSequelConfirmed2\" />\n\nIn July 2019, the sequel was announced as ''Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'', with a release date of May 7, 2021. Feige and Derrickson revealed that the sequel would have more of a horror tone than the first film, that [[Elizabeth Olsen]] would reprise her MCU role of [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch]], and that her [[Disney+]] series ''[[WandaVision]]'' would tie into the events of the film.<ref name=\"SequelHorror\" /><ref name=\"SequelReleaseDate\" /> The film would also tie into the Disney+ series ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]''.<ref name=\"LokiSequel\" /> In October 2019, ''Collider'' reported that Jade Bartlett would be the film's screenwriter.<ref name=\"SequelBartlett\" /> In January 2020, Marvel and Derrickson announced that he would no longer direct the film due to creative differences, but would remain an executive producer on the film. No delays were expected for the start of filming that May.<ref name=\"DerricksonSequelExit\" /> By February, it was reported that [[Sam Raimi]] was in negotiations to take over as director, Ejiofor

The new designs would be a direct successor to the ''[[Schnellbomber]]'' philosophy of the [[Dornier Do 17]] and [[Junkers Ju 88]], relying on high speed as its primary defence. Bomber B would also be a much larger and more capable aircraft, with range and payload far greater than the ''Schnellbombers'', besting even the largest conventional designs then under consideration. The winning design was intended to form the backbone of the ''Luftwaffe'' bomber force, replacing the wide collection of semi-specialized designs then in service. The [[Reich Air Ministry]] was so optimistic that more modest projects were generally cancelled; when the project failed the ''Luftwaffe'' was left with hopelessly outdated aircraft.\n\n==Background==\nBy the late 1930s, [[airframe]] construction methods had progressed to the point where airframes could be built to any required size, founded on the all-metal airframe design technologies pioneered by [[Hugo Junkers]] [[Junkers J 1|in 1915]] and constantly improved upon for over two decades to follow \u2013 especially in Germany with aircraft like the [[Dornier Do X]] flying boat and the [[Junkers G 38]] airliner, and the Soviet Union with the enormous [[Tupolev ANT-20|''Maksim Gorki'']], the largest aircraft built anywhere in the 1930s.\n\nEngines for such designs was a great problem; mid-30s aero engines were limited to about 600&nbsp;hp and the first 1000&nbsp;hp engines were just entering the prototype stage \u2013 notably the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] and [[Daimler-Benz DB 601]]. Even the latest engines were limited in the sort of designs they could power; a twin-engine aircraft would have about 1,500&nbsp;kW (2,000&nbsp;hp), the same power as a mid-war single engined [[fighter aircraft]] like the [[Hawker Typhoon]] or [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]. Although using a larger number of engines was possible, and achieved in some airframe examples for both the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Third Reich]], the production capacity of both nations was considered too small to equip a fleet with such designs. The United States, confident in its ability to produce aviation engines in any needed quantity, opted for four-engine designs with massed defensive firepower, as seen in the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]].\n\nIn Germany, most bomber designs were adapted from pre-war designs, many of them passenger aircraft or dual-use designs. The first specialist bomber aircraft was the [[Junkers Ju 88]], which had limited range and payload, forcing the Luftwaffe to maintain the [[Heinkel He 111]] for other missions. A shortage of both types forced the early-war Luftwaffe to improvise with a collection of aircraft, a problem no one in the Luftwaffe was at all happy with.

When the Manchester flew with all of the problems with the Vulture remaining, it too received a four-engine revision by its designer, [[Roy Chadwick]]. The [[Avro Lancaster]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]] designs formed the backbone of [[RAF Bomber Command]] for the rest of the war.\n\nIn Germany, the Bomber A program in mid-1936 had led to the [[Heinkel He 177]] A, powered by two [[Daimler-Benz DB 606]] \"power system\" engines. The 606 was a late-1930s attempt to use two [[Daimler-Benz DB 601]] powerplants mated to a common gear reduction case to arrive at a 24-cylinder powerplant like the Vulture but using twin crankcases for the demanding German [[Heinkel He 119]] high-speed reconnaissance design and the [[Messerschmitt Me 261]] long range aircraft. The pair of DB 601 component engines of the DB 606 were arranged in an inverted [[W engine|W-block]] layout, keeping each component engine as a discrete, \"all up\" engine as much as possible (except for the \"final drive\" to the propeller shaft) instead of the X-crankcase/cylinder layout. Daimler-Benz was also working on a single-crankcase 24-cylinder design in parallel with the DB 606, creating the [[Daimler-Benz DB 604]] as an X-engine design of their own, from 1939 through September 1942.

The 222 was a remarkably compact and efficient engine design, being almost identical in cylinder number, displacement and weight to the British [[Napier Sabre]] [[H engine|H-type]] four-bank [[sleeve valve]]d inline engine, and the best attempt at creating a German aviation engine that could routinely exceed 1,500&nbsp;kW output at altitude, but as with the BMW designs and even the later [[Heinkel HeS 011]] advanced turbojet engine, never came close to being a production-ready aircraft powerplant, with just under 300 examples of the Jumo 222 produced in total between several different versions.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II |url= |accessdate= |year=1989 |publisher=Studio Editions Ltd. |location= |isbn= |page=296 |pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hugojunkers.pytalhost.com/ju_jumo222_a1.htm |title=The Hugo Junkers Homepage - Engines: Jumo 222 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=October 29, 2012 |publisher=The Hugo Junkers Homepage |accessdate=4 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228035000/http://hugojunkers.pytalhost.com/ju_jumo222_a1.htm |archive-date=28 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Designs==\n[[File:Fw 191A on Ground hr ExCC.jpg|thumb|left|Focke-Wulf Fw 191A]]\n[[Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado]], [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]], [[Focke-Wulf]] and [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] all responded with designs and [[Henschel]] later added the [[Henschel Hs 130|Hs 130]]. It was clear even at this point that the call for designs was to some extent a formality, as the Junkers design had already been selected for production. The [[Arado Ar 340|Ar 340]] was dropped in the design stage and [[Dornier Do 317|Do 317]] was relegated to low-priority development, while prototype orders were placed for the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 191|Fw 191]] and the [[Junkers Ju 288|Ju 288]]. With the Focke-Wulf and Dornier projects as first and second backups, the ''Technisches-Amt'' technical development office of the [[Reich Air Ministry|RLM]] started using these other designs as experimental testbeds. The Fw 191 was based around an all-electric platform to power nearly all its flight accessories, in place of hydraulics. The Fw 191 thus earned the nickname of ''Das Fliegende Kraftwerk'' (the flying power station). This dramatically increased the complexity of wiring the planes and the chance that one of the many motors would fail was considerable but that was not considered terribly important\u2014it was felt that the Junkers design would work anyway.\n\n==The end of the project==\n\n[[File:Jumo 222E 2.jpg|thumb|right|The Jumo 222 engine, on which so much depended concerning the Bomber B project]]\nPrototype airframes of the Ju 288 and Fw 191 designs were ready mid-1940 but neither the Jumo 222 nor the DB 604 were ready. Both teams decided to power their prototypes with the [[BMW 801]] [[radial engine]], although with 900&nbsp;hp less per engine and with the BMW 801 radials themselves barely out of initial development, the planes were seriously underpowered. For comparative purposes, the nearly-equal displacement [[Wright Twin Cyclone]] radial engine was powering the American [[B-25 Mitchell]] twin-engined medium bomber with some 1,270 kW (1,700 hp) apiece of output, even with the B-25 having only a top airspeed of some 440 km/h (273 mph) at a take off weight of 15.9 tonnes (35,000 lb).\n\nThe first Jumo 222A/B development engines did not arrive until October 1941 and some eleven months later the DB 604 project was cancelled. By May 1942, in desperation, it was suggested that the [[Daimler-Benz DB 606]] be used instead, even though it was considerably larger and heavier (1.5 tonnes) and was well known to have serious problems. Prototypes of both designs with these engines were ordered, although the Fw 191 was just getting into the air with the BMW 801 radials at this point and the Ju 288 was showing a continual tendency to break its main landing gear on touchdown, partly due to its [[Junkers Ju 288#Undercarriage difficulties|undercarriage problems]] caused by its complex method of stowing the oleo struts during retraction.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sengfelder |first=G\u00fcnther |year=1993 |title=German Aircraft Landing Gear |location=Atglen, PA USA |publisher=Schiffer |pages=175\u2013177 |isbn=0-88740-470-7 |quote=The Ju 288's landing gear was most innovative in its design. A Y-shaped bearer was mounted in the engine nacelle with its upper arms hinged. At the bottom end of this bearer was the shock absorber leg, which was likewise hinged. Two double-brake wheels, with (metric) size 1015 \u00d7 380 tires, were mounted on the cross-axle. During the retraction cycle a folding strut was raised by a hydraulic jack. The bottom part of the folding strut drew the Y-bearer upwards. Functioning via a lever-and-gear arrangement, a pushrod positioned parallel to the Y-bearer acted upon another gear segment mounted to the oleo leg's hinge pin and rotated it about this as the Y-bearer was drawn upwards.}}</ref>\n\nThe RLM had no designs to fill the gap left if Bomber B did not work, even though some minor designs like the [[Henschel Hs 130]], usually powered with two DB 603 or 605 engines and the [[Dornier Do 317]], being tried with the same, trouble-prone DB 606 or 610 [[Heinkel He 177#Engine difficulties|\"welded-together engines\"]] on some of its prototype airframes were also being considered. A slightly improved Ju 88, based on the prototype Ju 88B design, was ordered as the [[Junkers Ju 188|Ju 188]] and several prototypes of stretched versions of existing bomber designs with four engines were also ordered, as with Junkers' [[Junkers Ju 488|Ju 488]] in 1943\u201344.\n\nIn June 1943, the T-Amt finally gave up; by this point, even if the Jumo 222 started working reliably, as it had begun to do in the summer of 1943, a shortage of the metals needed for the high-temperature alloys it used meant it would not be able to enter production anyway, with just under 300 development powerplants built. The three-year development period during the war in Europe, with no combat-ready designs to show for the effort, meant that the Bomber B project was a time-consuming venture that delivered nothing, while also serving to ensure that no other designs were available in late 1943, when their existing twin-engined medium bombers, most developed in the mid\u2013late 30s, started to become hopelessly outdated.\n\nWith the failure of Bomber B, four engine versions of the He 177, which had first been officially considered as early as October 1941 with the \"He 177H\" paper-only derivative, the ancestor of the [[Heinkel He 274]] high-altitude design project, were considered as replacements for the mainline variants of the He 177A through most of 1943.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griehl |first1=Manfred |last2=Dressel |first2=Joachim |title=Heinkel He 177 - 277 - 274 |year=1998 |publisher=Airlife |location=Shrewsbury, UK |isbn=1-85310-364-0 |page=177}}</ref> The trio of completed [[Daimler-Benz DB 603|DB 603]]-powered [[Heinkel He 177#Further development-the Heinkel He 177B|He 177B]] prototypes would start their flight tests by the end of 1943.

The new designs would be a direct successor to the ''[[Schnellbomber]]'' philosophy of the [[Dornier Do 17]] and [[Junkers Ju 88]], relying on high speed as its primary defence. Bomber B would also be a much larger and more capable aircraft, with range and payload far greater than the ''Schnellbombers'', besting even the largest conventional designs then under consideration. The winning design was intended to form the backbone of the ''Luftwaffe'' bomber force, replacing the wide collection of semi-specialized designs then in service. The [[Reich Air Ministry]] was so optimistic that more modest projects were generally cancelled; when the project failed the ''Luftwaffe'' was left with hopelessly outdated aircraft.\n\n==Background==\nBy the late 1930s, [[airframe]] construction methods had progressed to the point where airframes could be built to any required size, founded on the all-metal airframe design technologies pioneered by [[Hugo Junkers]] [[Junkers J 1|in 1915]] and constantly improved upon for over two decades to follow \u2013 especially in Germany with aircraft like the [[Dornier Do X]] flying boat and the [[Junkers G 38]] airliner, and the Soviet Union with the enormous [[Tupolev ANT-20|''Maksim Gorki'']], the largest aircraft built anywhere in the 1930s.\n\nEngines for such designs was a great problem; mid-30s aero engines were limited to about 600&nbsp;hp and the first 1000&nbsp;hp engines were just entering the prototype stage \u2013 notably the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] and [[Daimler-Benz DB 601]]. Even the latest engines were limited in the sort of designs they could power; a twin-engine aircraft would have about 1,500&nbsp;kW (2,000&nbsp;hp), the same power as a mid-war single engined [[fighter aircraft]] like the [[Hawker Typhoon]] or [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]. Although using a larger number of engines was possible, and achieved in some airframe examples for both the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Third Reich]], the production capacity of both nations was considered too small to equip a fleet with such designs. The United States, confident in its ability to produce aviation engines in any needed quantity, opted for four-engine designs with massed defensive firepower, as seen in the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]].\n\nIn Germany, most bomber designs were adapted from pre-war designs, many of them passenger aircraft or dual-use designs. The first specialist bomber aircraft was the [[Junkers Ju 88]], which had limited range and payload, forcing the Luftwaffe to maintain the [[Heinkel He 111]] for other missions. A shortage of both types forced the early-war Luftwaffe to improvise with a collection of aircraft, a problem no one in the Luftwaffe was at all happy with. The earlier [[Ural bomber]] program that had been championed by Luftwaffe General [[Walther Wever (general)|Walther Wever]] but which had failed to produce any practical Allied-style \"heavy bombers\". Wever's death on June 3, 1936 prompted the issuance of the RLM's \"Bomber A\" heavy bomber design specification on the day he died, to inspire development of a new heavy bomber with much better range and payload than the Ural Bomber prototypes, the [[Dornier Do 19]] and the [[Junkers Ju 89]] would ever be able to provide. The winning design, given its [[List of RLM aircraft designations|RLM airframe number]] on November 5, 1937 was the [[Heinkel He 177]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griehl |first1=Manfred |last2=Dressel |first2=Joachim |title=Heinkel He 177 \u2013 277 \u2013 274 |year=1998 |publisher=Airlife |location=Shrewsbury, UK |isbn=1-85310-364-0 |page=8}}</ref>\n\nThis program was just in the process of selecting the winning design when the first German large capacity engines began testing. Compared to the [[Junkers Jumo 211|Jumo 211s]] in the Ju 88, a pair of such engines in a bomber's airframe would more than double the power when compared to a pair of the earlier powerplants, upwards to 5,000&nbsp;hp (3680&nbsp;kW). With this sort of power, a significantly more capable design could be built, one with considerably larger internal space for a much larger bomb load, more fuel for longer range and even better speed.

This led to the 53.7-litre displacement [[BMW 802]] in 1943, an eighteen-cylinder air-cooled radial, and the even larger, 83.5 litre displacement [[BMW 803]] 28-cylinder liquid-cooled radial. As both the 802 and 803 proved to be dismal failures in testing,<ref>{{cite book |last=Gunston |first=Bill |title=World Encyclopaedia of Aero Engines |url= |accessdate= |year=1989 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0-517-67964-7 |page=27 |pages=}}</ref> their development only went so far as to prioritize the 802 for \"completion and prototype construction as a secondary issue\", while the 803 only received attention to \"its design and development\". This state of affairs at BMW led to the company's engineering staff being redirected to place all efforts on improving the 801 to develop it to its full potential.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Fedden |first=Sir Roy |date=December 6, 1945 |title=German Piston-Engine Progress |page=603 |magazine=Flight Magazine |location=London, UK |publisher=Flightglobal }}</ref> Only the BMW 801F radial development, through its use of features coming from the 801E subtype, was able to substantially exceed the over-1,500 kW output level \u2014 the F-version was tested at a top output level of some 1,765 kW (2,400 PS) of take-off power.  \n\nThe Junkers company's own 24-cylinder [[Junkers Jumo 222]], liquid cooled six-bank inline engine, with four cylinders in each bank, came the closest to being the only production, single-crankcase design high-output powerplant candidate during the war years, intended to power not only the Junkers Ju 288, but also many other German multi-engined advanced combat aircraft projects. The 222 was a remarkably compact and efficient engine design, being almost identical in cylinder number, displacement and weight to the British [[Napier Sabre]] [[H engine|H-type]] four-bank [[sleeve valve]]d inline engine, and the best attempt at creating a German aviation engine that could routinely exceed 1,500&nbsp;kW output at altitude, but as with the BMW designs and even the later [[Heinkel HeS 011]] advanced turbojet engine, never came close to being a production-ready aircraft powerplant, with just under 300 examples of the Jumo 222 produced in total between several different versions.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II |url= |accessdate= |year=1989 |publisher=Studio Editions Ltd. |location= |isbn= |page=296 |pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hugojunkers.pytalhost.com/ju_jumo222_a1.htm |title=The Hugo Junkers Homepage - Engines: Jumo 222 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=October 29, 2012 |publisher=The Hugo Junkers Homepage |accessdate=4 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228035000/http://hugojunkers.pytalhost.com/ju_jumo222_a1.htm |archive-date=28 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Designs==\n[[File:Fw 191A on Ground hr ExCC.jpg|thumb|left|Focke-Wulf Fw 191A]]\n[[Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado]], [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]], [[Focke-Wulf]] and [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] all responded with designs and [[Henschel]] later added the [[Henschel Hs 130|Hs 130]]. It was clear even at this point that the call for designs was to some extent a formality, as the Junkers design had already been selected for production. The [[Arado Ar 340|Ar 340]] was dropped in the design stage and [[Dornier Do 317|Do 317]] was relegated to low-priority development, while prototype orders were placed for the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 191|Fw 191]] and the [[Junkers Ju 288|Ju 288]]. With the Focke-Wulf and Dornier projects as first and second backups, the ''Technisches-Amt'' technical development office of the [[Reich Air Ministry|RLM]] started using these other designs as experimental testbeds. The Fw 191 was based around an all-electric platform to power nearly all its flight accessories, in place of hydraulics. The Fw 191 thus earned the nickname of ''Das Fliegende Kraftwerk'' (the flying power station). This dramatically increased the complexity of wiring the planes and the chance that one of the many motors would fail was considerable but that was not considered terribly important\u2014it was felt that the Junkers design would work anyway.\n\n==The end of the project==\n\n[[File:Jumo 222E 2.jpg|thumb|right|The Jumo 222 engine, on which so much depended concerning the Bomber B project]]\nPrototype airframes of the Ju 288 and Fw 191 designs were ready mid-1940 but neither the Jumo 222 nor the DB 604 were ready. Both teams decided to power their prototypes with the [[BMW 801]] [[radial engine]], although with 900&nbsp;hp less per engine and with the BMW 801 radials themselves barely out of initial development, the planes were seriously underpowered. For comparative purposes, the nearly-equal displacement [[Wright Twin Cyclone]] radial engine was powering the American [[B-25 Mitchell]] twin-engined medium bomber with some 1,270 kW (1,700 hp) apiece of output, even with the B-25 having only a top airspeed of some 440 km/h (273 mph) at a take off weight of 15.9 tonnes (35,000 lb).\n\nThe first Jumo 222A/B development engines did not arrive until October 1941 and some eleven months later the DB 604 project was cancelled. By May 1942, in desperation, it was suggested that the [[Daimler-Benz DB 606]] be used instead, even though it was considerably larger and heavier (1.5 tonnes) and was well known to have serious problems. Prototypes of both designs with these engines were ordered, although the Fw 191 was just getting into the air with the BMW 801 radials at this point and the Ju 288 was showing a continual tendency to break its main landing gear on touchdown, partly due to its [[Junkers Ju 288#Undercarriage difficulties|undercarriage problems]] caused by its complex method of stowing the oleo struts during retraction.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sengfelder |first=G\u00fcnther |year=1993 |title=German Aircraft Landing Gear |location=Atglen, PA USA |publisher=Schiffer |pages=175\u2013177 |isbn=0-88740-470-7 |quote=The Ju 288's landing gear was most innovative in its design. A Y-shaped bearer was mounted in the engine nacelle with its upper arms hinged. At the bottom end of this bearer was the shock absorber leg, which was likewise hinged. Two double-brake wheels, with (metric) size 1015 \u00d7 380 tires, were mounted on the cross-axle. During the retraction cycle a folding strut was raised by a hydraulic jack. The bottom part of the folding strut drew the Y-bearer upwards. Functioning via a lever-and-gear arrangement, a pushrod positioned parallel to the Y-bearer acted upon another gear segment mounted to the oleo leg's hinge pin and rotated it about this as the Y-bearer was drawn upwards.}}</ref>\n\nThe RLM had no designs to fill the gap left if Bomber B did not work, even though some minor designs like the [[Henschel Hs 130]], usually powered with two DB 603 or 605 engines and the [[Dornier Do 317]], being tried with the same, trouble-prone DB 606 or 610 [[Heinkel He 177#Engine difficulties|\"welded-together engines\"]] on some of its prototype airframes were also being considered. A slightly improved Ju 88, based on the prototype Ju 88B design, was ordered as the [[Junkers Ju 188|Ju 188]] and several prototypes of stretched versions of existing bomber designs with four engines were also ordered, as with Junkers' [[Junkers Ju 488|Ju 488]] in 1943\u201344.\n\nIn June 1943, the T-Amt finally gave up; by this point, even if the Jumo 222 started working reliably, as it had begun to do in the summer of 1943, a shortage of the metals needed for the high-temperature alloys it used meant it would not be able to enter production anyway, with just under 300 development powerplants built. The three-year development period during the war in Europe, with no combat-ready designs to show for the effort, meant that the Bomber B project was a time-consuming venture that delivered nothing, while also serving to ensure that no other designs were available in late 1943, when their existing twin-engined medium bombers, most developed in the mid\u2013late 30s, started to become hopelessly outdated.\n\nWith the failure of Bomber B, four engine versions of the He 177, which had first been officially considered as early as October 1941 with the \"He 177H\" paper-only derivative, the ancestor of the [[Heinkel He 274]] high-altitude design project, were considered as replacements for the mainline variants of the He 177A through most of 1943.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griehl |first1=Manfred |last2=Dressel |first2=Joachim |title=Heinkel He 177 - 277 - 274 |year=1998 |publisher=Airlife |location=Shrewsbury, UK |isbn=1-85310-364-0 |page=177}}</ref> The trio of completed [[Daimler-Benz DB 603|DB 603]]-powered [[Heinkel He 177#Further development-the Heinkel He 177B|He 177B]] prototypes would start their flight tests by the end of 1943. Production of the B-series He 177s by [[Arado Flugzeugwerke]], the prime subcontractor for Heinkel's heavy bombers, was never undertaken as the Arado firm had priority for its jet-powered [[Arado Ar 234]] bomber and by early July 1944, four months before Arado would be able to commence license-built construction of the He 177B-5, the ''Luftwaffe'' began the [[Emergency Fighter Program]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Griehl |first1=Manfred |last2=Dressel |first2=Joachim |title=Heinkel He 177 \u2013 277 \u2013 274 |year=1998 |publisher=Airlife |location=Shrewsbury, UK |isbn=1-85310-364-0 |page=165}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:World War II medium bombers of Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Maury Markowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBackground", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber_B"}
