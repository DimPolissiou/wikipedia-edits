He was born in St. Albans, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. Grimaldi was educated at [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)#20th century|St. Albans Boys School]], where he developed his talent for electric jazz, songwriting and art. His career focused on the Jazz genre, although he played other genres as well. Grimaldi formed a number of bands and wrote and performed until his death from multiple sclerosis in 1983.\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===[http://www.soundcloud.com/woodygsd/sets/motiffe Motiffe]===\nGrimaldi became interested in music after he joined his school's orchestra in his early teenage years. While in the school orchestra, he discovered his talent with stringed instruments and his ability to write music. John and Mark Pasterfield set up a school band called [http://www.soundcloud.com/woodygsd/sets/motiffe/ Motiffe] in 1970. As Pasterfield had a drum kit, he became the drummer; Dave Shackley played bass; Ian Wilson, Quentin Bryar, and Steve Bellingham played keyboards. Bellingham left in 1971 and Mick Avery then joined on keyboard. In early 1972 they reached their live peak with a support slot to Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's ELO, shortly after they were recorded live in St Albans School by Deroy; 100 copies of the album were produced, some of which were still around in 2013.\n\n===[http://www.soundcloud.com/woodygsd/sets/flux Flux]===\n'''(1972\u20131974)''' <br />\nSoon afterward in 1972, there was conflict within Motiffe regarding what and how much the band should play. To resolve to conflict, John Grimaldi and Dave Shackley started a new band named Flux, aiming to become professional.\nNeil Chapman (drums) and Phil Hawkins (keyboard) joined to make up the band. Flux recorded, though nothing was released. Flux also performed live, and started to attract some attention. The St. Albans band Babe Ruth and their management took Flux under their wing. In late 1972 Flux were gaining in popularity, and receiving interest from the music industry. Chapman left to be replaced by Charlie Chandler from Hemel Hempstead on drums; Dave Punshon (keyboard) left Babe Ruth to join Flux, however he agreed to continue to do live performances with Babe Ruth until a replacement was found. Richard Blanchard, a flute, sax & vocalist from Pinner joined. The band, with this line-up, played regularly & widely including 100 club & Marquee.\n\nFlux recorded a demo for EMI harvest at Manchester Square and was nearly signed, but it did not happen. However, there was interest from other companies. About this time Punshon left to live with the Divine Light Movement, and was replaced by pro circuit musician Zo\u00eb Kronberger (keyboard). Chandler left to rebuild antique furniture, and was replaced by pro circuit musician Nick Monas (drums). Blanchard, who was also a professional photographer, left to focus on increasing demands of his photography work and to pursue other music opportunities. He was replaced by circuit pro Jon Gifford (flute/sax).\n\nKronberger and Monas eventually left in mid-1974. Soon afterward, John did the Argent audition and went to them, resulting in Flux folding in late 1974.\n\n===[https://soundcloud.com/woodygsd/sets/the-argent-years Argent]===\n'''(1974 \u2013 1975/76)'''<br />\n\nIn 1974, Russ Ballard left Argent; [http://www.soundcloud.com/woodygsd/sets/the-argent-years Grimaldi] and [[John Verity]] joined the band to replace him. Their entry into the band was partly due to their being from the same town and school as [[Rod Argent]], the band's founder.

Contemporary operating rooms are devoid of a theatre setting, making the term \"operating theater\" a misnomer. There are only two old-style operating theaters left, both of which are preserved as part of museums.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Operating rooms==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}\nOperating rooms are spacious, easy to clean in a [[cleanroom]], and well-lit, typically with overhead [[Surgical lighting|surgical lights]], and may have viewing screens and [[Medical monitor|monitors]]. Operating rooms are generally windowless and feature controlled temperature and humidity. Special air handlers filter the air and maintain a slightly elevated pressure. Electricity support has backup systems in case of a black-out. Rooms are supplied with wall suction, oxygen, and possibly other anesthetic gases. Key equipment consists of the [[operating table]] and the [[anesthesia cart]]. In addition, there are tables to set up instruments. There is storage space for common surgical supplies. There are containers for disposables. Outside the operating room is a dedicated scrubbing area that is used by [[surgeon]]s, [[anesthetist]]s, ODPs (operating department practitioners), and nurses prior to surgery. An operating room will have a map to enable the terminal cleaner to realign the operating table and equipment to the desired layout during cleaning.\n\nSeveral operating rooms are part of the operating suite that forms a distinct section within a health-care facility. Besides the operating rooms and their wash rooms, it contains rooms for personnel to change, wash, and rest, preparation and [[recovery room]]s(s), storage and cleaning facilities, offices, dedicated corridors, and possibly other supportive units. In larger facilities, the operating suite is climate- and air-controlled, and separated from other departments so that only authorized personnel have access.\n\n'''Temperature and surgical site infections (SSI).'''

This machine has tubes that connect to the patient to assist them in breathing during surgery, and built-in monitors that help control the mixture of gases in the breathing circuit.\n*The anesthesia cart is next to the anesthesia machine. It contains the medications, equipment, and other supplies that the anesthesiologist may need.\n*Sterile instruments to be used during surgery are arranged on a stainless steel table.\n*An electronic monitor (which records the heart rate and respiratory rate by adhesive patches that are placed on the patient's chest).\n*The pulse oximeter machine attaches to the patient's finger with an elastic band aid. It measures the amount of oxygen contained in the blood.\n[[File:Hybrid operating theatre gemelli rome.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Hybrid operating room]] for cardiovascular surgery at [[Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic|Gemelli Hospital]] in [[Rome]]]]\n*Automated blood pressure measuring machine that automatically inflates the blood pressure cuff on patient's arm.\n*An electrocautery machine uses high frequency electrical signals to cauterize or seal off blood vessels and may also be used to cut through tissue with a minimal amount of bleeding.\n*If surgery requires, a [[heart-lung machine]] or other specialized equipment may be brought into the room.\n*Advances in technology now support hybrid operating rooms, which integrate diagnostic imaging systems such as [[MRI]] and [[cardiac catheterization]] into the operating room to assist surgeons in specialized neurological and cardiac procedures.\n\n==Surgeon and assistants' equipment==\nPeople in the operating room wear PPE (personal protective equipment) to help prevent bacteria from infecting the surgical incision. This PPE includes the following:\n\n*Similar to normal [[cleanroom]]s, germless.\n*A protective cap covering their hair\n*Masks over their lower face, covering their mouths and noses with minimal gaps to prevent inhalation of plume or airborne microbes\n*Shades or glasses over their eyes, including specialized colored glasses for use with different lasers. a fiber-optic headlight may be attached for greater visibility\n*Sterile gloves; usually latex-free due to latex sensitivity which affects some health care workers and patients\n*Long gowns, with the bottom of the gown no closer than six inches to the ground.\n*Protective covers on their shoes\n*If x-rays are expected to be used, lead aprons/neck covers are used to prevent overexposure to radiation\n\nThe surgeon may also wear special glasses that help him/her to see more clearly. The circulating nurse and anesthesiologist will not wear a gown in the OR because they are not a part of the sterile team.

Contemporary operating rooms are devoid of a theatre setting, making the term \"operating theater\" a misnomer. There are only two old-style operating theaters left, both of which are preserved as part of museums.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Operating rooms==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2009}}\nOperating rooms are spacious, easy to clean in a [[cleanroom]], and well-lit, typically with overhead [[Surgical lighting|surgical lights]], and may have viewing screens and [[Medical monitor|monitors]]. Operating rooms are generally windowless and feature controlled temperature and humidity. Special air handlers filter the air and maintain a slightly elevated pressure. Electricity support has backup systems in case of a black-out. Rooms are supplied with wall suction, oxygen, and possibly other anesthetic gases. Key equipment consists of the [[operating table]] and the [[anesthesia cart]]. In addition, there are tables to set up instruments. There is storage space for common surgical supplies. There are containers for disposables. Outside the operating room is a dedicated scrubbing area that is used by [[surgeon]]s, [[anesthetist]]s, ODPs (operating department practitioners), and nurses prior to surgery. An operating room will have a map to enable the terminal cleaner to realign the operating table and equipment to the desired layout during cleaning.\n\nSeveral operating rooms are part of the operating suite that forms a distinct section within a health-care facility. Besides the operating rooms and their wash rooms, it contains rooms for personnel to change, wash, and rest, preparation and [[recovery room]]s(s), storage and cleaning facilities, offices, dedicated corridors, and possibly other supportive units. In larger facilities, the operating suite is climate- and air-controlled, and separated from other departments so that only authorized personnel have access.\n\n'''Temperature and surgical site infections (SSI).'''

This PPE includes the following:\n\n*Similar to normal [[cleanroom]]s, germless.\n*A protective cap covering their hair\n*Masks over their lower face, covering their mouths and noses with minimal gaps to prevent inhalation of plume or airborne microbes\n*Shades or glasses over their eyes, including specialized colored glasses for use with different lasers. a fiber-optic headlight may be attached for greater visibility\n*Sterile gloves; usually latex-free due to latex sensitivity which affects some health care workers and patients\n*Long gowns, with the bottom of the gown no closer than six inches to the ground.\n*Protective covers on their shoes\n*If x-rays are expected to be used, lead aprons/neck covers are used to prevent overexposure to radiation\n\nThe surgeon may also wear special glasses that help him/her to see more clearly. The circulating nurse and anesthesiologist will not wear a gown in the OR because they are not a part of the sterile team.

Born in [[Seoul]], Cho spent his adolescence in [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]] with initial aspirations of a professional career in [[association football]], playing as a striker in the youth academy of [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A]] club [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]]. He returned to South Korea to pursue music in his late teens, initially signing with [[YG Entertainment]] as a trainee before being transferred to [[Yuehua Entertainment]].

Cho subsequently changed his stage name to WOODZ in 2018, reflecting changes in musical direction.

Born in [[Seoul]], Cho spent his adolescence in [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]] with initial aspirations of a professional career in [[association football]], playing as a striker in the youth academy of [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A]] club [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]]. He returned to South Korea to pursue music in his late teens, initially signing with [[YG Entertainment]] as a trainee before being transferred to [[Yuehua Entertainment]]. He first rose to fame as the main rapper and sub-vocalist of South Korean-Chinese [[boy band]] [[Uniq (band)|UNIQ]], formed by Yuehua in 2014. In 2015 and 2016, he co-founded the [[musical collective|musical collectives]] M.O.L.A and Drinkcolor.\n\nFollowing an appearance on the [[Show Me the Money 5|fifth season]] of the South Korean rap competition show ''[[Show Me the Money (South Korean TV series)|Show Me the Money]]'', Cho first debuted as a solo artist under the stage name Luizy in July 2016, with the release of the collaborative [[Korean hip hop|hip-hop]] single \"Recipe\". Cho subsequently changed his stage name to WOODZ in 2018, reflecting changes in musical direction. His releases as WOODZ, including the singles \"POOL\", \"DIFFERENT\", and \"meaningless\", delved into [[alternative R&B]], and featured Cho transitioning from rap to vocals. In addition to his solo work, he has written and produced songs for artists in both his native Korea and China, as well as for the shows ''[[The Unit: Idol Rebooting Project]]'' and ''[[Idol Producer]]''.\n\nIn 2019, Cho participated in the South Korean survival show ''[[Produce X 101]]''. He finished in fifth place, making him a member of the show's derivative boy band, [[X1 (band)|X1]]. He debuted with X1 under [[Swing Entertainment]] in August 2019. X1 debuted with 10 other members on August 28th, 2019, with the song Flash. \n\n==Early life and education==\nCho Seung-youn was born on August 5, 1996 in [[Seoul]], South Korea.<ref>{{cite web
