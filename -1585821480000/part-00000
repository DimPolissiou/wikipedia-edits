Lacey. Bailey suggested the formation of an 'Imperial Cricket Board'. In the letter, he suggested that the board would be responsible for formulation of rules and regulations which will govern the international matches between the three members: Australia, England and South Africa. Bailey, wanted to host a Triangular Test series between the participant countries in South Africa. Australia rejected the offer. However, Bailey did not lose hope. He saw an opportunity of getting the three members together during the Australia's tour of England in 1909.

The emergence of new technology saw the introduction of a [[third umpire]] who was equipped with video playback facilities.\n\nBy 1995, TV replays were made available for run outs and stumpings in Test matches with the third umpire required to signal out or not out with red and green lights respectively. The following year, the cameras were used to determine if the ball had crossed the boundary, and in 1997 decisions on the cleanness of catches could be referred to the third umpire.

The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had [[Double taxation|double-tax agreements]] with the United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pvt. Ltd \u2013 known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.\n\nFor the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001\u20132008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their commercial income from tax.\n\nThe option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through [[Sport England]], to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London \u2013 but be given special exemption from paying UK [[corporation tax]] on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. ICC is registered in [[British Virgin Islands]]. In August 2005, the ICC moved its offices to [[Dubai]], and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11\u20131 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4326601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cricket chiefs move base to Dubai | date=7 March 2005}}</ref>\n\nWhile the principal driver of the ICC's move to [[Dubai]] was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GD23Df05.html|title= Cricket's home moves closer to the money|work=[[Asia Times Online]]| date=23 April 2005|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Income generation==\n[[File:ICC logo 2010.jpg|thumb|Variant ICC Logo with old motto]]\nThe ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the [[Cricket World Cup]], and it distributes the majority of that income to its members.

There was also investment income of $6.695 million in the period.{{Update inline|reason=There have been 3 World Cups since this date|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches ([[Test cricket|Test matches]], [[One Day International]] and [[Twenty20|Twenty20 Internationals]]), that account for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they are owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and the [[ICC Super Series]] played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions Trophy to be scrapped in 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/biggest-player-in-the-game-flexes-muscle/2006/01/06/1136387626870.html | location=Melbourne | work=[[The Age]] | title=Biggest player in the game flexes muscle | date=7 January 2006}}</ref> The [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy 2004]] event was referred to in ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden 2005]]'' by the editor as a \"turkey of a tournament\" and a \"fiasco\"; although the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|2006 edition]] was seen as a greater success due to a new format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=ICC President thanks India for \"outstanding\" ICC Champions Trophy | author=Murgatroyd, Brian / ICC|publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 6 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=When the cricket did all the talking |publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 7 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ICC World Twenty20]], first played [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|in 2007]], was a success.

This cycle will begin [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|in 2010]], one year after the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20|2009 edition]].\n\n== Rules and regulation ==\nThe International Cricket Council oversees playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. The ICC does not have copyright to the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'': only the MCC may change the Laws, though this is usually done in consultation with the game's global governing body. The ICC maintains a set of playing conditions for international cricket which make slight amendments to the Laws. They also have a \"[[ICC Code of Conduct|Code of Conduct]]\" to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008, the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players.\n\n==Umpires and referees==\nThe ICC appoints international [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] and [[Match referee]]s who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|Elite Panel]], the [[International Panel of Umpires and Referees|International Panel]], and the [[ICC Associates and Affiliates umpire panel|Associates and Affiliates Panel]].\n\nAs of April 2012, the Elite Panel includes twelve umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire [[first-class cricket]] in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 8\u201310 Test matches and 10\u201315 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days plus travel and preparation time per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Match officials|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003001326/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC [[U/19 Cricket World Cup|Under 19 Cricket World Cup]] to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a \"third umpire\" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044124/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was formed in June 2006.\nIt superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for umpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of the five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels.\nMembers of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are eligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments. High-performing umpires may also be considered for other ICC events, including the ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup, and could also be invited to be involved in the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602070629/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|archivedate=2 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere is also an [[Elite Panel of ICC Referees]] who act as the independent representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket.

The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had [[Double taxation|double-tax agreements]] with the United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pvt. Ltd \u2013 known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.\n\nFor the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001\u20132008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their commercial income from tax.\n\nThe option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through [[Sport England]], to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London \u2013 but be given special exemption from paying UK [[corporation tax]] on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. ICC is registered in [[British Virgin Islands]]. In August 2005, the ICC moved its offices to [[Dubai]], and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11\u20131 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4326601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cricket chiefs move base to Dubai | date=7 March 2005}}</ref>\n\nWhile the principal driver of the ICC's move to [[Dubai]] was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GD23Df05.html|title= Cricket's home moves closer to the money|work=[[Asia Times Online]]| date=23 April 2005|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Income generation==\n[[File:ICC logo 2010.jpg|thumb|Variant ICC Logo with old motto]]\nThe ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the [[Cricket World Cup]], and it distributes the majority of that income to its members. Sponsorship and television rights of the World Cup brought in over US$1.6 billion between 2007 and 2015, by far the ICC's main source of income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/271994.html |title=ICC rights go to ESPN-Star|publisher=[[ESPN]] | work=[[Cricinfo]]|date= 9 December 2006|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/276853.html |title=ICC set to cash in on sponsorship rights |publisher=[[ESPN]] | work=[[Cricinfo]] |date= 18 January 2007|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref> In the nine-month accounting period to 31 December 2007 the ICC had operating income of $12.66 million, mainly from member subscriptions and sponsorship. In contrast, event income was [[US$]]285.87 million, including $239 million from the 2007 World Cup. There was also investment income of $6.695 million in the period.{{Update inline|reason=There have been 3 World Cups since this date|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches ([[Test cricket|Test matches]], [[One Day International]] and [[Twenty20|Twenty20 Internationals]]), that account for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they are owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and the [[ICC Super Series]] played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions Trophy to be scrapped in 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/biggest-player-in-the-game-flexes-muscle/2006/01/06/1136387626870.html | location=Melbourne | work=[[The Age]] | title=Biggest player in the game flexes muscle | date=7 January 2006}}</ref> The [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy 2004]] event was referred to in ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden 2005]]'' by the editor as a \"turkey of a tournament\" and a \"fiasco\"; although the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|2006 edition]] was seen as a greater success due to a new format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=ICC President thanks India for \"outstanding\" ICC Champions Trophy | author=Murgatroyd, Brian / ICC|publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 6 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=When the cricket did all the talking |publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 7 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ICC World Twenty20]], first played [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|in 2007]], was a success. The ICC's current plan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World Cup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year before the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year of the cycle. This cycle will begin [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|in 2010]], one year after the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20|2009 edition]].\n\n== Rules and regulation ==\nThe International Cricket Council oversees playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. The ICC does not have copyright to the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'': only the MCC may change the Laws, though this is usually done in consultation with the game's global governing body. The ICC maintains a set of playing conditions for international cricket which make slight amendments to the Laws. They also have a \"[[ICC Code of Conduct|Code of Conduct]]\" to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008, the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players.\n\n==Umpires and referees==\nThe ICC appoints international [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] and [[Match referee]]s who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|Elite Panel]], the [[International Panel of Umpires and Referees|International Panel]], and the [[ICC Associates and Affiliates umpire panel|Associates and Affiliates Panel]].\n\nAs of April 2012, the Elite Panel includes twelve umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire [[first-class cricket]] in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 8\u201310 Test matches and 10\u201315 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days plus travel and preparation time per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Match officials|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003001326/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC [[U/19 Cricket World Cup|Under 19 Cricket World Cup]] to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a \"third umpire\" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044124/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was formed in June 2006.\nIt superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for umpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of the five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels.\nMembers of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are eligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments. High-performing umpires may also be considered for other ICC events, including the ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup, and could also be invited to be involved in the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602070629/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|archivedate=2 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere is also an [[Elite Panel of ICC Referees]] who act as the independent representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be appealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases.\n\nThe Council failed to achieve consensus among the cricket playing nations \u2013 as of June 2012 \u2013 on the universal application of Umpire's Decision Review System, due to opposition by BCCI. It will continue to be applied subject to mutual agreement of the playing countries.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-27/top-stories/32440276_1_drs-ball-tracking-icc-executive-board| title= No decision yet on universal application of DRS\n|work=Times of India |date=27 June 2012}}</ref> In July 2012, ICC decided to send a delegation to show the ball tracking research done by Dr Ed Rosten, an expert on computer vision and technology, to BCCI to remove the scepticism about the use of DRS technology.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-10/top-stories/32617106_1_expert-in-computer-vision-icc-management-decision-review-system| title= Research on DRS to be shown to BCCI\n| date= 10 July 2012 |work=Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ireland and Afghanistan ICC newest full members amid wide-ranging governance reform|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/422449|website=icc-cricket.com|publisher=ICC|accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Regional bodies==\nThese regional bodies aim to organise, promote and develop the game of cricket:\n* [[African Cricket Association]]\n* [[Asian Cricket Council]]\n* [[ICC Americas]]\n* [[ICC East Asia-Pacific]]\n* [[European Cricket Council]]\n\nTwo further regional bodies were disestablished following the creation of the African Cricket Association:\n* [[East and Central Africa Cricket Council]]\n* [[West Africa Cricket Council]]\n\n==Competitions and awards==\n{{Main|International cricket}}\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\n* [[ICC Test Championship]] (Notional league for Test rankings)\n* [[ICC ODI Championship]] (Notional league for ODI rankings)\n* [[ICC T20I Championship]] (Notional league for T20I rankings)\n\n=== Tournaments ===\nThe ICC organises various international '''''test''''', '''''one-day''''' and '''''Twenty20''''' cricket competitions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Format\n! colspan=\"2\" |Men\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Women\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Youth\n|-\n!Full Members\n!Associates Members\n|-\n|[[Test cricket|Test]]\n|[[ICC World Test Championship]]\n|[[ICC Intercontinental Cup]] (defunct)\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[One-day cricket|One-day]]\n|[[Cricket World Cup|ICC Cricket World Cup]]\n|[[ICC World Cricket League]] (defunct)\n|[[ICC Women's Cricket World Cup]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Under-19 Cricket World Cup|ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]]\n|-\n|[[ICC Champions Trophy]] (defunct)\n|[[ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier]]\n|[[ICC Women's Championship]]\n|-\n|[[2020\u201322_ICC_Cricket_World_Cup_Super_League|ICC Cricket World Cup Super League]]\n|[[ICC Cricket World Cup League 2]]<br />[[ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Twenty20]]\n|[[ICC Men's T20 World Cup]]\n|[[ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier]]\n|[[ICC Women's T20 World Cup]]\n|\n|}\nThe ICC has instituted the '''[[ICC Awards]]''' to recognise and honour the best international cricket players of the previous 12 months.

Following the corruption scandals by cricketers connected with the legal and illegal [[bookmaking]] markets, the ICC set up an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) in 2000 under the retired [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner]] of the [[London Metropolitan Police]], [[Paul Condon, Baron Condon|Lord Condon]]. Among the corruption on which they have reported was that of former [[South African national cricket captains|South African captain]] [[Hansie Cronje]] who had accepted substantial sums of money from an Indian bookmaker for under-performing or ensuring that certain matches had a pre-determined result. Similarly, the former [[Indian national cricket captains|Indian captain]] [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] and [[Ajay Jadeja]] were investigated, found guilty of match-fixing, and banned from playing cricket (for life and for five years, respectively).  The ACSU continues to monitor and investigate any reports of corruption in cricket and protocols have been introduced, which for example prohibit the use of [[mobile telephone]]s in [[Changeroom|dressing room]]s.\n\nPrior to the 2007 [[Cricket World Cup]] ICC chief executive [[Malcolm Speed]] warned against any corruption and said that the ICC would be vigilant and intolerant against it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070213/sports/sports3.html |work=The Jamaica Star |title=Speed warns against corruption during World Cup |date=13 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201121545/http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070213/sports/sports3.html |archivedate=1 February 2009  }}</ref>\n\nFollowing a [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal|scandal that occurred]] during the 2010 Pakistan tour of England, 3 Pakistani players, [[Mohammad Amir]], [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]] and [[Salman Butt]] were found to be guilty of spot-fixing, and were banned for 5 years, 7 years and 10 years respectively.

The first economy to follow this path in the modern world was the [[United Kingdom]]. The speed at which other economies have made the transition to service-based (or \"[[Post-industrial economy|post-industrial]]\") economies has increased over time.\n\nHistorically, manufacturing tended to be more open to [[international trade]] and competition than services. However, with dramatic cost reduction and speed and reliability improvements in the transportation of people and the communication of information, the service sector now includes some of the most intensive international competition, despite residual [[protectionism]].\n\n== Issues for service providers ==\n[[File:FirstIncision.JPG|thumb|Surgery team at work]]\n[[File:Risci\u00f2-in-avorio.jpg|thumb|Transport service]]\n[[File:Automatic Telephone Exchange- Communications in Wartime, London, England, UK, 1945 D23700.jpg|thumb|right|Testing telephone lines in [[London]] in 1945.]]\nService providers face obstacles selling services that goods-sellers rarely face.  Services are intangible, making it difficult for potential customers to understand what they will receive and what value it will hold for them. Indeed, some, such as [[consultants]] and providers of [[investment]] services, offer no guarantees of the value for price paid.\n\nSince the quality of most services depends largely on the quality of the individuals providing the services, \"people costs\" are usually a high fraction of service costs.  Whereas a manufacturer may use technology, simplification, and other techniques to lower the cost of goods sold, the service provider often faces an unrelenting pattern of increasing costs.\n\n[[Product differentiation]] is often difficult. For example, how does one choose one [[investment adviser]] over another, since they are often seen to provide identical services? Charging a premium for services is usually an option only for the most established firms, who charge extra based upon [[brand recognition]].<ref>{{cite book|last=De Soto|first=Glenn|title=Fragmented: the Demise of Unionized Construction|year=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781847285775|page=64}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n== Examples of tertiary sector industries ==\n\nExamples of tertiary industries may include:\n\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Hospitality industry]]/[[tourism]] \n* [[Mass media]]\n* [[Healthcare]]/[[hospitals]]\n* [[Public health]]\n* [[Pharmacy]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Waste disposal]]\n* [[Consulting]]\n* [[Gambling]]\n* [[Retail]] sales\n** [[Fast-moving consumer goods]] (FMCG)\n* [[Franchising]]\n* [[Real estate]]\n* [[Education]]\n* [[Financial services]]\n** [[Banking]]\n** [[Insurance]]\n** [[Investment management]]\n* [[Professional services]]\n** [[Accounting]]\n** [[Legal services]]\n** [[Management consulting]]\n* [[Transportation]]\n\n==List of countries by tertiary output==\n{{Main|List of countries by GDP sector composition}}\n\n[[File:2005gdpServices.png|right|upright=1.35|thumbnail|Service output as a percentage of the top producer (USA) as of 2005]]\n\nBelow is a list of countries by service output at market exchange rates in 2016:\n\n{{Bar chart\n| float       = center\n| title       = Largest countries by tertiary output in [[Gross domestic product#Nominal GDP and adjustments to GDP|Nominal GDP]], according to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]], 2016\n| table_width = 70\n| bar_width   = 50 <!-- must be an unformatted number -->\n| data_max    = 14,100<!-- Upper bound on the values in the data fields -->\n| label_type  = Economy\n| data_type   = {{center|Countries by tertiary output in 2016 (billions in [[United States dollar|USD]])}}\n| label1      = (01) '''{{USA}}''' | data1 = 14,762\n| label3      = (02) '''{{CHN}}''' | data3 = 5,688\n| label4      = (03) '''{{JPN}}''' | data4 = 3,511\n| label5      = (04) '''{{GER}}''' | data5 = 2,395\n| label6      = {{nowrap|(05) '''{{GBR}}'''}} | data6 = 2,109\n| label7      = (06) '''{{FRA}}''' | data7 = 1,941\n| label8      = (07) '''{{ITA}}''' | data8 = 1,366\n| label9      = (08) '''{{BRA}}''' | data9 = 1,295\n| label10     = (09) '''{{CAN}}''' | data10 = 1,081\n| label11     = (10) '''{{IND}}''' | data11 = 1,024\n| label12     = (11) '''{{ESP}}''' | data12 = 926\n| label13     = (12) '''{{AUS}}''' | data13 = 859\n| label14     = (13) '''{{KOR}}''' | data14 = 850\n| label15     = (14) '''{{RUS}}''' | data15 = 797\n| label16     = (15) '''{{MEX}}''' | data16 = 661\n| label17     = (16) '''{{TUR}}''' | data17 = 551\n| label18     = (17) '''{{NED}}''' | data18 = 543\n| label19     = (18) '''{{CHE}}''' | data19 = 484\n| label20     = (19) '''{{IDN}}''' | data20 = 429\n| label21     = (20) '''{{BEL}}''' | data21 = 362\n| caption     = {{resize|88%|The twenty largest countries by tertiary output in 2016, according to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]].}}\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Economic sector]]\n* [[Indigo Era]]\n* [[Quaternary sector of the economy]]\n* [[Voluntary sector]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Economics}}\n*{{Commonscatinline|Service industries}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Industries}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tertiary Sector Of The Economy}}\n[[Category:Industry|Sector, 3]]\n[[Category:Economic sectors|+3]]\n[[Category:Service industries| ]]\n\n[[de:Wirtschaftssektor#Terti.C3.A4rsektor_.28Dienstleistungssektor.29]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Service sector}}\n{{Redirect|Service industry|the Austin, Texas-based band|The Service Industry}}\n{{For|the part of the economy sometimes referred to as the \"third sector\"|Voluntary sector}}\n{{Economic sectors}}[[File:Product\u2019s lifecycle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Product's lifecycle]]\nThe '''service sector''' is the third of the three [[economic sector]]s of the [[three-sector theory]].

However, with dramatic cost reduction and speed and reliability improvements in the transportation of people and the communication of information, the service sector now includes some of the most intensive international competition, despite residual [[protectionism]].\n\n== Issues for service providers ==\n[[File:FirstIncision.JPG|thumb|Surgery team at work]]\n[[File:Risci\u00f2-in-avorio.jpg|thumb|Transport service]]\n[[File:Automatic Telephone Exchange- Communications in Wartime, London, England, UK, 1945 D23700.jpg|thumb|right|Testing telephone lines in [[London]] in 1945.]]\nService providers face obstacles selling services that goods-sellers rarely face.  Services are intangible, making it difficult for potential customers to understand what they will receive and what value it will hold for them. Indeed, some, such as [[consultants]] and providers of [[investment]] services, offer no guarantees of the value for price paid.\n\nSince the quality of most services depends largely on the quality of the individuals providing the services, \"people costs\" are usually a high fraction of service costs.  Whereas a manufacturer may use technology, simplification, and other techniques to lower the cost of goods sold, the service provider often faces an unrelenting pattern of increasing costs.\n\n[[Product differentiation]] is often difficult. For example, how does one choose one [[investment adviser]] over another, since they are often seen to provide identical services? Charging a premium for services is usually an option only for the most established firms, who charge extra based upon [[brand recognition]].<ref>{{cite book|last=De Soto|first=Glenn|title=Fragmented: the Demise of Unionized Construction|year=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781847285775|page=64}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n== Examples of tertiary sector industries ==\n\nExamples of tertiary industries may include:\n\n* [[Telecommunication]]\n* [[Hospitality industry]]/[[tourism]] \n* [[Mass media]]\n* [[Healthcare]]/[[hospitals]]\n* [[Public health]]\n* [[Pharmacy]]\n* [[Information technology]]\n* [[Waste disposal]]\n* [[Consulting]]\n* [[Gambling]]\n* [[Retail]] sales\n** [[Fast-moving consumer goods]] (FMCG)\n* [[Franchising]]\n* [[Real estate]]\n* [[Education]]\n* [[Financial services]]\n** [[Banking]]\n** [[Insurance]]\n** [[Investment management]]\n* [[Professional services]]\n** [[Accounting]]\n** [[Legal services]]\n** [[Management consulting]]\n* [[Transportation]]\n\n==List of countries by tertiary output==\n{{Main|List of countries by GDP sector composition}}\n\n[[File:2005gdpServices.png|right|upright=1.35|thumbnail|Service output as a percentage of the top producer (USA) as of 2005]]\n\nBelow is a list of countries by service output at market exchange rates in 2016:\n\n{{Bar chart\n| float       = center\n| title       = Largest countries by tertiary output in [[Gross domestic product#Nominal GDP and adjustments to GDP|Nominal GDP]], according to [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]], 2016\n| table_width = 70\n| bar_width   = 50 <!-- must be an unformatted number -->\n| data_max    = 14,100<!-- Upper bound on the values in the data fields -->\n| label_type  = Economy\n| data_type   = {{center|Countries by tertiary output in 2016 (billions in [[United States dollar|USD]])}}\n| label1      = (01) '''{{USA}}''' | data1 = 14,762\n| label3      = (02) '''{{CHN}}''' | data3 = 5,688\n| label4      = (03) '''{{JPN}}''' | data4 = 3,511\n| label5      = (04) '''{{GER}}''' | data5 = 2,395\n| label6      = {{nowrap|(05) '''{{GBR}}'''}} | data6 = 2,109\n| label7      = (06) '''{{FRA}}''' | data7 = 1,941\n| label8      = (07) '''{{ITA}}''' | data8 = 1,366\n| label9      = (08) '''{{BRA}}''' | data9 = 1,295\n| label10     = (09) '''{{CAN}}''' | data10 = 1,081\n| label11     = (10) '''{{IND}}''' | data11 = 1,024\n| label12     = (11) '''{{ESP}}''' | data12 = 926\n| label13     = (12) '''{{AUS}}''' | data13 = 859\n| label14     = (13) '''{{KOR}}''' | data14 = 850\n| label15     = (14) '''{{RUS}}''' | data15 = 797\n| label16     = (15) '''{{MEX}}''' | data16 = 661\n| label17     = (16) '''{{TUR}}''' | data17 = 551\n| label18     = (17) '''{{NED}}''' | data18 = 543\n| label19     = (18) '''{{CHE}}''' | data19 = 484\n| label20     = (19) '''{{IDN}}''' | data20 = 429\n| label21     = (20) '''{{BEL}}''' | data21 = 362\n| caption     = {{resize|88%|The twenty largest countries by tertiary output in 2016, according to the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]].}}\n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Economic sector]]\n* [[Indigo Era]]\n* [[Quaternary sector of the economy]]\n* [[Voluntary sector]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Economics}}\n*{{Commonscatinline|Service industries}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Industries}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tertiary Sector Of The Economy}}\n[[Category:Industry|Sector, 3]]\n[[Category:Economic sectors|+3]]\n[[Category:Service industries| ]]\n\n[[de:Wirtschaftssektor#Terti.C3.A4rsektor_.28Dienstleistungssektor.29]]\n", "name_user": "Xindeho", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy"}

The change from {{lang|wlm|-dyf}} to {{lang|cy|-dydd}} shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} and ''dd'' {{IPA-cy|\u00f0|}}, and was perhaps also driven by [[folk etymology]] ({{lang|cy|dydd}} is Welsh for 'day' whereas *{{lang|cy|dyf}} has no obvious meaning). This [[sound change]] had probably first occurred in the [[Middle Ages]]; both forms were current in the [[Tudor period]]. {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}} has its origins in [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning \"the fort of the [[River Taff|Taff]]\". The [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] probably refers to that established by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. {{lang|cy|Caer}} is Welsh for ''fort'' and {{lang|cy|-dyf}} is in effect a form of {{lang|cy|Taf}} (Taff), the river which flows by Cardiff Castle, with the {{angle bracket|t}} showing [[consonant mutation]] to {{angle bracket|d}} and the vowel showing [[affection (linguistics)|affection]] as a result of a (lost) [[genitive case]] ending.<ref name=hwo>Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan, ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''.

Cardiff is also famous for Cardiff Castle, [[St David's Hall]], [[Llandaff Cathedral]] and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]].\n\n[[Cardiff Castle]] is a major tourist attraction in the city and is situated in the heart of the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]]. The [[St Fagans National History Museum|National History Museum at St Fagans]] in Cardiff is a large open-air museum housing dozens of buildings from throughout Welsh history that have been moved to the site in Cardiff. The Civic Centre in [[Cathays Park]] comprises a collection of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings such as the [[City Hall, Cardiff|City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and buildings forming part of Cardiff University, together with more modern civic buildings. These buildings are laid out around the Queen Alexandra Gardens, a formal park which contains the [[Welsh National War Memorial]] and a number of other, smaller, memorials.\n\nIn addition to Cardiff Castle, [[Castell Coch]] (''Red Castle'') is located in [[Tongwynlais]], in the north of the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian [[folly]] designed by [[William Burges]] for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by [[Ifor Bach]], a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.\n\nCardiff claims to have the largest concentration of [[castles]] of any city in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html |title=2007 Rugby World Cup City Guides \u2013 Cardiff |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=19 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405094448/http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0%2C21043%2C13092_2689478%2C00.html |archivedate=5 April 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, there are the remains of two Motte and Bailey castles in Radyr and Rhiwbina (both known as the \"Twmpath\", a Welsh word for a small mound),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |title=Twmpath Castle |year=2002 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307035335/http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> which along with a castle at Whitchurch (known as Treoda and destroyed by housing in the 1960s) formed an arc of fortifications which divided the Norman lordship from the Welsh lordship of Senghenydd.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |title=The Gatehouse: Treoda, Whitchurch |date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=28 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815082212/http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |archive-date=15 August 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further up the Cefn Cibwr ridge on the boundary with Caerphilly there is also another ruined castle, known as Castell Morgraig. Archaeological evidence suggests this castle was never finished, and it is debated whether the fortification was of Norman or Welsh origin. The concentration of these castles is indicative of the moveable nature of the border between the Norman lordship of Glamorgan, centred at Cardiff, and its Welsh neighbours to the north.\n\nWhile not strictly castles in the historic sense, there is also the ruined [[Bishop's Palace, Llandaff|Llandaff Bishop's Palace]], a fortified residence belonging to the Bishops of Llandaff and [[St Fagans National History Museum|Saint Fagans Castle]], a preserved seventeenth century manor house, once the seat of the Earls of Plymouth.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n|<gallery caption=\"Cardiff's castles\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Cardiff Castle - panoramio (1).jpg|Cardiff Castle\nFile:Castell Coch - exterior.JPG|Castell Coch \nFile:St Fagans castle - Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 1458954.jpg|St Fagans Castle\nFile:Bishop's Palace, Llandaff 2011 5.jpg|Bishop's Palace, Llandaff\n</gallery>\n|}\nOther major tourist attractions are the [[Cardiff Bay]] regeneration sites which include the recently opened Wales Millennium Centre and the Senedd, and many other cultural and sites of interest including the [[Cardiff Bay Barrage]] and the famous [[Coal Exchange]].

The change from {{lang|wlm|-dyf}} to {{lang|cy|-dydd}} shows the colloquial alteration of Welsh ''f'' {{IPA-cy|v|}} and ''dd'' {{IPA-cy|\u00f0|}}, and was perhaps also driven by [[folk etymology]] ({{lang|cy|dydd}} is Welsh for 'day' whereas *{{lang|cy|dyf}} has no obvious meaning). This [[sound change]] had probably first occurred in the [[Middle Ages]]; both forms were current in the [[Tudor period]]. {{lang|wlm|Caerdyf}} has its origins in [[sub-Roman Britain|post-Roman]] [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning \"the fort of the [[River Taff|Taff]]\". The [[Cardiff Roman Fort|fort]] probably refers to that established by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. {{lang|cy|Caer}} is Welsh for ''fort'' and {{lang|cy|-dyf}} is in effect a form of {{lang|cy|Taf}} (Taff), the river which flows by Cardiff Castle, with the {{angle bracket|t}} showing [[consonant mutation]] to {{angle bracket|d}} and the vowel showing [[affection (linguistics)|affection]] as a result of a (lost) [[genitive case]] ending.<ref name=hwo>Hywel Wyn Owen and Richard Morgan, ''Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales''.

Cardiff is also famous for Cardiff Castle, [[St David's Hall]], [[Llandaff Cathedral]] and the [[Wales Millennium Centre]].\n\n[[Cardiff Castle]] is a major tourist attraction in the city and is situated in the heart of the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]]. The [[St Fagans National History Museum|National History Museum at St Fagans]] in Cardiff is a large open-air museum housing dozens of buildings from throughout Welsh history that have been moved to the site in Cardiff. The Civic Centre in [[Cathays Park]] comprises a collection of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] buildings such as the [[City Hall, Cardiff|City Hall]], [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum and Gallery of Wales]], [[Cardiff Crown Court]], and buildings forming part of Cardiff University, together with more modern civic buildings. These buildings are laid out around the Queen Alexandra Gardens, a formal park which contains the [[Welsh National War Memorial]] and a number of other, smaller, memorials.\n\nIn addition to Cardiff Castle, [[Castell Coch]] (''Red Castle'') is located in [[Tongwynlais]], in the north of the city. The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian [[folly]] designed by [[William Burges]] for the Marquess and built in the 1870s, as an occasional retreat. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by [[Ifor Bach]], a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions. It rarely fulfilled its intended role as a retreat for the Butes, who seldom stayed there. For the Marquess, the pleasure had been in its creation, a pleasure lost following Burges's death in 1881.\n\nCardiff claims to have the largest concentration of [[castles]] of any city in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html |title=2007 Rugby World Cup City Guides \u2013 Cardiff |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=19 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405094448/http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0%2C21043%2C13092_2689478%2C00.html |archivedate=5 April 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, there are the remains of two Motte and Bailey castles in Radyr and Rhiwbina (both known as the \"Twmpath\", a Welsh word for a small mound),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |title=Twmpath Castle |year=2002 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307035335/http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> which along with a castle at Whitchurch (known as Treoda and destroyed by housing in the 1960s) formed an arc of fortifications which divided the Norman lordship from the Welsh lordship of Senghenydd.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |title=The Gatehouse: Treoda, Whitchurch |date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=28 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815082212/http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/482.html |archive-date=15 August 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Further up the Cefn Cibwr ridge on the boundary with Caerphilly there is also another ruined castle, known as Castell Morgraig. Archaeological evidence suggests this castle was never finished, and it is debated whether the fortification was of Norman or Welsh origin. The concentration of these castles is indicative of the moveable nature of the border between the Norman lordship of Glamorgan, centred at Cardiff, and its Welsh neighbours to the north.\n\nWhile not strictly castles in the historic sense, there is also the ruined [[Bishop's Palace, Llandaff|Llandaff Bishop's Palace]], a fortified residence belonging to the Bishops of Llandaff and [[St Fagans National History Museum|Saint Fagans Castle]], a preserved seventeenth century manor house, once the seat of the Earls of Plymouth.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n|<gallery caption=\"Cardiff's castles\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Cardiff Castle - panoramio (1).jpg|Cardiff Castle\nFile:Castell Coch - exterior.JPG|Castell Coch \nFile:St Fagans castle - Cardiff - geograph.org.uk - 1458954.jpg|St Fagans Castle\nFile:Bishop's Palace, Llandaff 2011 5.jpg|Bishop's Palace, Llandaff\n</gallery>\n|}\nOther major tourist attractions are the [[Cardiff Bay]] regeneration sites which include the recently opened Wales Millennium Centre and the Senedd, and many other cultural and sites of interest including the [[Cardiff Bay Barrage]] and the famous [[Coal Exchange]].

[[Albert Roder]], the chief engineer behind the success story, made it possible that in 1955, NSU became the biggest [[motorcycle]] producer in the world.  NSU also holds four world [[motorcycle land speed record|records]] for speed: 1951, 1953, 1954, and 1955.  In August 1956, Wilhelm Herz at the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]], [[Utah]], became the first man to ride a motorcycle faster than {{convert|200|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1957, NSU re-entered the car market with the new [[NSU Prinz|Prinz]] (Prince), a small car with a doubled NSU Max engine, an [[air-cooled]] two-cylinder engine of {{convert|600|cc|cid|0|abbr=on}} and  {{convert|20|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. Motorbike production continued until 1968.  NSU's last production motorcycle was the [[NSU Quick 50|Quick 50]].<ref name=SparesGallery>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsuquicklyspares.co.uk/gallery.html |title=NSU Quickly Spares Gallery |publisher=Nsuquicklyspares.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502073913/http://www.nsuquicklyspares.co.uk/gallery.html |archivedate=2 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=FredyQ50>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsu-cars.ch/Quick50.htm |title=Fredy's NSU Page:Quick 50 |publisher=Nsu-cars.ch |accessdate=2010-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707001855/http://www.nsu-cars.ch/Quick50.htm |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, NSU offered the world's first [[Wankel engine]]d car: the [[NSU Spider|Wankelspider]]. In development of the project, NSU built the '''Sport Prinz''', with a {{convert|129|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|995|cc|cid|abbr=on}} 2-rotor.<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\">Lyons, Pete. \"10 Best Ahead-of-Their-Time Machines\", in ''Car and Driver'', 1/88, p.78.</ref> In the same year Prinz 1000 and derivatives like the TT and TT/S followed.  The Typ 110 (later called 1200SC) was launched in 1965 as a family car with a more spacious body design.  The last NSU cars with a conventional four-stroke engine had the air-cooled [[OHC]] four-cylinder engine in common. The car was marketed in the U.K. as \"NSU TYP 110\", and [[Karobes]], a major supplier of car accessories, provided a head rest specially for this car: \"A new one which can be fitted without a screw, and may be adjusted forwards and backwards.\"<ref>[[Dudley Noble]]: ''A New and Larger NSU Model''. [[Financial Times]] London, February 26, 1966.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1964, NSU partnered with [[Citro\u00ebn]] to develop the [[Wankel engine]] via the [[Comotor]] subsidiary, which resulted in the abortive 1973  [[Citro\u00ebn GS#GS Birotor|Citro\u00ebn GS Birotor]] production car.\n\nIn 1967, the four-door [[NSU Ro 80]], with a {{convert|115|hp|kW|abbr=on}} version of the same 2-rotor,<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\"/> was presented to the public. Weighing {{convert|1200|kg|abbr=on}}, it had a [[Drag coefficient|C<sub>d</sub>]] of 0.36, [[disc brake]]s, [[independent suspension]], and front wheel drive by [[ZF Sachs|Fichtel & Sachs]] ''Saxomatic'' three-speed [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]].<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\"/> It soon gained several design awards such as \"car of the year 1967\", while drivers liked its performance.<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\"/>  Virtually all the world's major motor manufacturers purchased licenses from NSU to develop and produce the rotary engine, with the notable exception of [[BMW]].<ref name=AutoMotoruSport19961303>{{cite journal| authorlink = Gert Hack (Bernd Ostmann - Ed)| title =In voller Bl\u00fcte. In den sechziger Jahren...| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport|Auto Motor u. Sport]]| volume = Heft 13 1996| pages = Seite 76\u201383|date = 14 June 1996}}</ref>\n\nDespite its public acclaim, sales of the Ro 80 were disappointing. The transmission drew complaints and the engine suffered numerous failures even at low mileage.<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\"/>  Competitor automakers, apart from [[Mazda]], held back from taking a lead in developing and marketing the Wankel technology, and anticipated income associated with those royalty deals failed to materialize.\n\n===Volkswagen Group takeover===\nThe development of the rotary engine was very cost-intensive for the small company.  Problems with the apex seals of the engine rotor significantly damaged the brand's reputation amongst consumers.  In 1969, the company was taken over by [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagenwerk AG]], which merged NSU with [[Auto Union]], the owners of the Audi brand which Volkswagen had acquired five years earlier. The new company was called Audi NSU Auto Union AG and represented the effective end of the NSU marque with all future production to bear the Audi badge (although retaining the four interlocking circles of Auto Union). The management of the new combine was initially based at the Neckarsulm plant, however when the small rear-engined NSU models (Prinz 4, 1000, 1200) were phased out in 1973, the Ro 80 was the last car still in production carrying the NSU badge. Audi never made use of the brand name NSU again after April 1977, when the last Ro 80 was sold.<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\"/>  In 1985, the company name was shortened to '''Audi AG''' and management moved back to Audi's headquarters in [[Ingolstadt]].\n\nEven as production of the Ro 80 continued in the Neckarsulm plant, production of larger Audi models like [[Audi 100|100]] and [[Audi 200|200]] was started.  The [[Porsche 924]] and later [[Porsche 944]] were also assembled at Neckarsulm.  Those models were joint venture projects of [[Porsche]] and [[VW]], but Porsche did not have the internal capacity to build the 924 and 944.  Currently, Neckarsulm is the production plant for Audi's topline vehicles like [[Audi A6|A6]], [[Audi A8|A8]], and [[Audi R8 (road car)|R8]].  It is also the home of the \"Aluminium- und Leichtbauzentrum\" where Audi's aluminium-made space frame bodies are designed and engineered.\n\nNSU is primarily remembered today as the first licensee and one of only four automobile companies to produce cars for sale with rotary [[Wankel engine]]s.  NSU invented the principle of the modern Wankel engine with an inner rotor.  The [[NSU Ro 80]] was the second mass-produced two-rotor Wankel-powered vehicle after the [[Mazda Cosmo]].  In 1967, NSU and [[Citro\u00ebn]] set up a common company, [[Comotor]], to build engines for Citro\u00ebn and other car makers. [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] made motorcycles using Wankel engines. AvtoVaz (Lada) manufactured single and twin rotored Wankel powered cars in the early 1980s. Only [[Mazda]] has continued developing the Wankel engine and made several more cars with the [[Mazda Wankel engine|Wankel engine.]]\nNSU developed their last car in a recognised conventional layout, (front engine front wheel drive, water cooled) -this was the NSU K70, Volkswagen adopted as their first water cooled front engined car the VW K70. The first VW Golf cars used the NSU K70 engine and is almost identical.  Subsequent VW models share no lineage and are descended from Auto-Union designs.\n\n===Lawn mower engine===\nIn the early 1970s, NSU manufactured a vertical-crankshaft [[small engine]] for use as a [[lawn mower]] power unit.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fz0ymWEOyowC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=wankel+rotary+engine+mower#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Now You Can 'Mow' with a Wankel!\" ''Popular Science'', July 1973 p. 18]</ref>\n\n===NSU Museum===\nA museum in Neckarsulm, the [[Deutsches Zweirad- und NSU-Museum]], has many of NSU's products on display.\n\n===Notable riders===\n[[Mike Hailwood]] raced in 1958 on [[Ducati]], NSU, [[MV Agusta]], [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]], [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]], [[Paton (motorcycles)|Paton]] and in 1958 4th in the world championship 250cc (NSU) 5.

The first postwar model was the NSU Fox in 1949, available in [[two-stroke engine|2-stroke]] and [[four-stroke engine|4-stroke]] versions.  In 1953, the NSU Max followed, a 250&nbsp;cc motorbike with a unique overhead camdrive driven by reciprocating rods.  All these new models had an innovative monocoque frame of pressed steel and a central rear suspension unit.  [[Albert Roder]], the chief engineer behind the success story, made it possible that in 1955, NSU became the biggest [[motorcycle]] producer in the world.  NSU also holds four world [[motorcycle land speed record|records]] for speed: 1951, 1953, 1954, and 1955.

In development of the project, NSU built the '''Sport Prinz''', with a {{convert|129|hp|kW|abbr=on}} {{convert|995|cc|cid|abbr=on}} 2-rotor.<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\">Lyons, Pete. \"10 Best Ahead-of-Their-Time Machines\", in ''Car and Driver'', 1/88, p.78.</ref> In the same year Prinz 1000 and derivatives like the TT and TT/S followed.  The Typ 110 (later called 1200SC) was launched in 1965 as a family car with a more spacious body design.  The last NSU cars with a conventional four-stroke engine had the air-cooled [[OHC]] four-cylinder engine in common. The car was marketed in the U.K. as \"NSU TYP 110\", and [[Karobes]], a major supplier of car accessories, provided a head rest specially for this car: \"A new one which can be fitted without a screw, and may be adjusted forwards and backwards.\"<ref>[[Dudley Noble]]: ''A New and Larger NSU Model''. [[Financial Times]] London, February 26, 1966.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1964, NSU partnered with [[Citro\u00ebn]] to develop the [[Wankel engine]] via the [[Comotor]] subsidiary, which resulted in the abortive 1973  [[Citro\u00ebn GS#GS Birotor|Citro\u00ebn GS Birotor]] production car.\n\nIn 1967, the four-door [[NSU Ro 80]], with a {{convert|115|hp|kW|abbr=on}} version of the same 2-rotor,<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\"/> was presented to the public. Weighing {{convert|1200|kg|abbr=on}}, it had a [[Drag coefficient|C<sub>d</sub>]] of 0.36, [[disc brake]]s, [[independent suspension]], and front wheel drive by [[ZF Sachs|Fichtel & Sachs]] ''Saxomatic'' three-speed [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]].<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\"/> It soon gained several design awards such as \"car of the year 1967\", while drivers liked its performance.<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\"/>  Virtually all the world's major motor manufacturers purchased licenses from NSU to develop and produce the rotary engine, with the notable exception of [[BMW]].<ref name=AutoMotoruSport19961303>{{cite journal| authorlink = Gert Hack (Bernd Ostmann - Ed)| title =In voller Bl\u00fcte.

The transmission drew complaints and the engine suffered numerous failures even at low mileage.<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\"/>  Competitor automakers, apart from [[Mazda]], held back from taking a lead in developing and marketing the Wankel technology, and anticipated income associated with those royalty deals failed to materialize.\n\n===Volkswagen Group takeover===\nThe development of the rotary engine was very cost-intensive for the small company.  Problems with the apex seals of the engine rotor significantly damaged the brand's reputation amongst consumers.  In 1969, the company was taken over by [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagenwerk AG]], which merged NSU with [[Auto Union]], the owners of the Audi brand which Volkswagen had acquired five years earlier. The new company was called Audi NSU Auto Union AG and represented the effective end of the NSU marque with all future production to bear the Audi badge (although retaining the four interlocking circles of Auto Union). The management of the new combine was initially based at the Neckarsulm plant, however when the small rear-engined NSU models (Prinz 4, 1000, 1200) were phased out in 1973, the Ro 80 was the last car still in production carrying the NSU badge. Audi never made use of the brand name NSU again after April 1977, when the last Ro 80 was sold.<ref name=\"Lyons, p.78\"/>  In 1985, the company name was shortened to '''Audi AG''' and management moved back to Audi's headquarters in [[Ingolstadt]].\n\nEven as production of the Ro 80 continued in the Neckarsulm plant, production of larger Audi models like [[Audi 100|100]] and [[Audi 200|200]] was started.  The [[Porsche 924]] and later [[Porsche 944]] were also assembled at Neckarsulm.  Those models were joint venture projects of [[Porsche]] and [[VW]], but Porsche did not have the internal capacity to build the 924 and 944.  Currently, Neckarsulm is the production plant for Audi's topline vehicles like [[Audi A6|A6]], [[Audi A8|A8]], and [[Audi R8 (road car)|R8]].  It is also the home of the \"Aluminium- und Leichtbauzentrum\" where Audi's aluminium-made space frame bodies are designed and engineered.\n\nNSU is primarily remembered today as the first licensee and one of only four automobile companies to produce cars for sale with rotary [[Wankel engine]]s.  NSU invented the principle of the modern Wankel engine with an inner rotor.  The [[NSU Ro 80]] was the second mass-produced two-rotor Wankel-powered vehicle after the [[Mazda Cosmo]].  In 1967, NSU and [[Citro\u00ebn]] set up a common company, [[Comotor]], to build engines for Citro\u00ebn and other car makers. [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] made motorcycles using Wankel engines. AvtoVaz (Lada) manufactured single and twin rotored Wankel powered cars in the early 1980s. Only [[Mazda]] has continued developing the Wankel engine and made several more cars with the [[Mazda Wankel engine|Wankel engine.]]\nNSU developed their last car in a recognised conventional layout, (front engine front wheel drive, water cooled) -this was the NSU K70, Volkswagen adopted as their first water cooled front engined car the VW K70. The first VW Golf cars used the NSU K70 engine and is almost identical.  Subsequent VW models share no lineage and are descended from Auto-Union designs.\n\n===Lawn mower engine===\nIn the early 1970s, NSU manufactured a vertical-crankshaft [[small engine]] for use as a [[lawn mower]] power unit.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fz0ymWEOyowC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=wankel+rotary+engine+mower#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Now You Can 'Mow' with a Wankel!\" ''Popular Science'', July 1973 p. 18]</ref>\n\n===NSU Museum===\nA museum in Neckarsulm, the [[Deutsches Zweirad- und NSU-Museum]], has many of NSU's products on display.\n\n===Notable riders===\n[[Mike Hailwood]] raced in 1958 on [[Ducati]], NSU, [[MV Agusta]], [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]], [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]], [[Paton (motorcycles)|Paton]] and in 1958 4th in the world championship 250cc (NSU) 5.

In some cases, the sufferer may believe several people at once are \"secret admirers\". Most commonly, the individual has delusions of being loved by an unattainable man who is usually an acquaintance or someone the person has never met. The sufferer may also experience other types of delusions concurrently with erotomania, such as delusions of reference, wherein the perceived admirer secretly communicates their love by subtle methods such as body posture, arrangement of household objects, colors, license plates on cars from specific states, and other seemingly innocuous acts (or, if the person is a public figure, through clues in the media). Some delusions may be extreme such as the conception, birth, and kidnapping of children that never existed. The delusional objects may be replaced by others over time, and some may be chronic in fixed forms.<ref name=\":1\" /> Denial is characteristic with this disorder as the patients do not accept the fact that their object of delusion may be married, unavailable, or uninterested. The phantom lover may also be imaginary or deceased. Erotomania has two forms: primary and secondary. Primary erotomania is also commonly referred to as de Clerambault's syndrome and Old Maid's Insanity<ref name=\":2\" /> and it exists alone without comorbidities, has a sudden onset and a chronic outcome.<ref name=\":1\" /> The secondary form is found along with mental disorders like paranoid schizophrenia, often includes [[persecutory delusions]], [[hallucination]]s, and grandiose ideas, and has a more gradual onset.<ref name=\":1\" /> Patients with a \"fixed\" condition are more seriously ill with constant delusions and are less responsive to treatment. These individuals are usually timid, dependent women that are often sexually inexperienced.<ref name=\":1\" /> In those with a more mild, recurrent condition, delusions are shorter-lived and the disorder can exist undetected by others for years.<ref name=\":2\" /> Problematic behaviors include actions like calling, sending letters and gifts, making unannounced house visits and other persistent stalking behaviors.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Cause==\nErotomania may present as a primary mental disorder, or as a symptom of another psychiatric illness. With secondary erotomania, the erotomanic delusions are due to other mental disorders such as bipolar I disorder or schizophrenia. Symptoms may also be precipitated by alcoholism and the use of antidepressants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seeman, M.V.|date=2016|title=Erotomania and recommendations for treatment|url=|journal=Psychiatric Quarterly|volume=87|issue=2|pages=355\u2013364|doi=10.1007/s11126-015-9392-0}}</ref> There may be a potential genetic component involved as family histories of first degree relatives with histories of psychiatric disorders are common. [[Sigmund Freud]] explained erotomania as a defense mechanism to ward off homosexual impulses which can lead to strong feelings of paranoia, denial, displacement and projection. Similarly, it has been explained as a way to cope with severe loneliness or ego deficit following a major loss.<ref name=\":1\" /> Erotomania may also be linked to unsatiated urges dealing with homosexuality or narcissism.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Kelly, B.D.|date=2005|title=Erotomania: Epidemiology and management|url=|journal=CNS Drugs|volume=19|pages=657\u2013669|doi=10.2165/00023210-200519080-00002}}</ref> Some research shows brain abnormalities occurring in patients with erotomania such as heightened temporal lobe asymmetry and greater volumes of lateral ventricles than those with no mental disorders.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Treatment==\nPrognosis differs from person to person, and the ideal treatment is not completely understood. Treatment for this disorder gains the best results when tailored specifically for each individual. To date, the mainline pharmacological treatments have been pimozide (a typical antipsychotic which was also approved for treating Tourette's Syndrome),<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> and atypical anti-psychotics like risperidone and clozapine.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Non-pharmacologic treatments that have shown some degree of efficacy are electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), supportive psychotherapy, family and environment therapy,<ref name=\":1\" /> rehousing, risk management and treating underlying disorders in cases of secondary erotomania.<ref name=\":2\" /> ECT may provide temporary remission of delusional beliefs; anti-psychotics help attenuate delusions and reduce agitation or associated dangerous behaviors, and SSRIs may be used to treat secondary depression.<ref name=\":1\" /> In delusional disorder there is some evidence that pimozide has superior efficacy compared with other antipsychotics. Psychosocial psychiatric interventions can enhance the quality of life through allowing some social functioning, and treating comorbid disorders is a priority for secondary erotomania.<ref name=\":2\" /> Family therapy, adjustment of socio-environmental factors, and replacing delusions with something positive may be beneficial to all. In most cases, harsh confrontation should be avoided.<ref name=\":1\" /> Structured risk assessment helps to manage risky behaviors in those individuals more likely to engage in actions that include violence, stalking, and crime.<ref name=\":2\" /> For particularly troublesome cases, neuroleptics and enforced separation may be moderately effective.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Female patient suffering from erotomania, 1843 Wellcome L0022720.jpg|thumb|268x268px|M.S.P. \"Female patient suffering from erotomania,\" from [[Alexander Morison]]'s ''The Physiognomy of Mental Diseases'']]Early references to the condition can be found in the work of [[Hippocrates]], Freud (1911), G.G. de Cl\u00e9rambault (1942),<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Erasistratus]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Galen]].

Some delusions may be extreme such as the conception, birth, and kidnapping of children that never existed. The delusional objects may be replaced by others over time, and some may be chronic in fixed forms.<ref name=\":1\" /> Denial is characteristic with this disorder as the patients do not accept the fact that their object of delusion may be married, unavailable, or uninterested. The phantom lover may also be imaginary or deceased. Erotomania has two forms: primary and secondary. Primary erotomania is also commonly referred to as de Clerambault's syndrome and Old Maid's Insanity<ref name=\":2\" /> and it exists alone without comorbidities, has a sudden onset and a chronic outcome.<ref name=\":1\" /> The secondary form is found along with mental disorders like paranoid schizophrenia, often includes [[persecutory delusions]], [[hallucination]]s, and grandiose ideas, and has a more gradual onset.<ref name=\":1\" /> Patients with a \"fixed\" condition are more seriously ill with constant delusions and are less responsive to treatment. These individuals are usually timid, dependent women that are often sexually inexperienced.<ref name=\":1\" /> In those with a more mild, recurrent condition, delusions are shorter-lived and the disorder can exist undetected by others for years.<ref name=\":2\" /> Problematic behaviors include actions like calling, sending letters and gifts, making unannounced house visits and other persistent stalking behaviors.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Cause==\nErotomania may present as a primary mental disorder, or as a symptom of another psychiatric illness. With secondary erotomania, the erotomanic delusions are due to other mental disorders such as bipolar I disorder or schizophrenia. Symptoms may also be precipitated by alcoholism and the use of antidepressants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seeman, M.V.|date=2016|title=Erotomania and recommendations for treatment|url=|journal=Psychiatric Quarterly|volume=87|issue=2|pages=355\u2013364|doi=10.1007/s11126-015-9392-0}}</ref> There may be a potential genetic component involved as family histories of first degree relatives with histories of psychiatric disorders are common. [[Sigmund Freud]] explained erotomania as a defense mechanism to ward off homosexual impulses which can lead to strong feelings of paranoia, denial, displacement and projection. Similarly, it has been explained as a way to cope with severe loneliness or ego deficit following a major loss.<ref name=\":1\" /> Erotomania may also be linked to unsatiated urges dealing with homosexuality or narcissism.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Kelly, B.D.|date=2005|title=Erotomania: Epidemiology and management|url=|journal=CNS Drugs|volume=19|pages=657\u2013669|doi=10.2165/00023210-200519080-00002}}</ref> Some research shows brain abnormalities occurring in patients with erotomania such as heightened temporal lobe asymmetry and greater volumes of lateral ventricles than those with no mental disorders.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Treatment==\nPrognosis differs from person to person, and the ideal treatment is not completely understood. Treatment for this disorder gains the best results when tailored specifically for each individual. To date, the mainline pharmacological treatments have been pimozide (a typical antipsychotic which was also approved for treating Tourette's Syndrome),<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> and atypical anti-psychotics like risperidone and clozapine.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Non-pharmacologic treatments that have shown some degree of efficacy are electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), supportive psychotherapy, family and environment therapy,<ref name=\":1\" /> rehousing, risk management and treating underlying disorders in cases of secondary erotomania.<ref name=\":2\" /> ECT may provide temporary remission of delusional beliefs; anti-psychotics help attenuate delusions and reduce agitation or associated dangerous behaviors, and SSRIs may be used to treat secondary depression.<ref name=\":1\" /> In delusional disorder there is some evidence that pimozide has superior efficacy compared with other antipsychotics. Psychosocial psychiatric interventions can enhance the quality of life through allowing some social functioning, and treating comorbid disorders is a priority for secondary erotomania.<ref name=\":2\" /> Family therapy, adjustment of socio-environmental factors, and replacing delusions with something positive may be beneficial to all. In most cases, harsh confrontation should be avoided.<ref name=\":1\" /> Structured risk assessment helps to manage risky behaviors in those individuals more likely to engage in actions that include violence, stalking, and crime.<ref name=\":2\" /> For particularly troublesome cases, neuroleptics and enforced separation may be moderately effective.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Female patient suffering from erotomania, 1843 Wellcome L0022720.jpg|thumb|268x268px|M.S.P. \"Female patient suffering from erotomania,\" from [[Alexander Morison]]'s ''The Physiognomy of Mental Diseases'']]Early references to the condition can be found in the work of [[Hippocrates]], Freud (1911), G.G. de Cl\u00e9rambault (1942),<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Erasistratus]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Galen]].
