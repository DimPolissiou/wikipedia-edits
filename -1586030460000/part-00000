It is available in [[DOS]], [[Digital Research|DR]] [[FlexOS]], [[IBM]] [[OS/2]], and [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]]s, and in certain ports of [[FreeBSD]],{{r|f}} [[NetBSD]],{{r|n}} [[OpenBSD]],{{r|o}} [[DragonFly BSD]]{{r|d}} and [[macOS]]{{r|x}} for compatibility reasons. In versions of the [[Windows NT]] operating system line from [[Windows 2000]] onwards, {{code|fdisk}} is replaced by a more advanced tool called <code>[[diskpart]]</code>. Similar utilities exist for [[Unix-like]] systems, for example, [[BSD disklabel]].\n\n==Implementations==\n\n===IBM PC DOS===\n[[IBM]] introduced {{code|fdisk}}, [[Hard disk drive|Fixed Disk]] Setup Program version 1.00, with the March 1983 release of the [[IBM PC/XT]], the first PC to store data on a [[hard disk]], and the [[IBM PC DOS|IBM Personal Computer DOS]] version 2.0.  Version 1 could be used to create one [[FAT12]] DOS partition, delete it, change the [[active partition]], or display partition data.  {{code|fdisk}} writes the [[master boot record]], which supported up to four partitions. The other three were intended for other operating systems such as [[CP/M-86]] and [[Xenix]], which were expected to have their own partitioning utilities as {{code|fdisk}} did not support them.\n\nIn August 1984, PC DOS 3.0 added [[FAT16]] partitions to support larger hard disks more efficiently.\n\nIn April 1987, PC DOS/fdisk 3.30 added support for [[Disk partitioning#Extended partition|extended partitions]], which could hold up to 23 \"logical drives\" or [[Volume (computing)|volumes]].\n\n[[IBM PC DOS#PC DOS 7.10|IBM PC DOS 7.10]] contained {{code|FDISK32}} and {{code|FORMAT32}} utilities.\n\n===Microsoft DOS and Windows===\nThe command is available in [[MS-DOS]] versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\">{{Cite book|author-last=Wolverton|author-first=Van|title=Running MS-DOS Version 6.22 (20th Anniversary Edition), 6th Revised edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=0-7356-1812-7}}</ref>\n\nSupport for [[FAT16B]] was added with Compaq MS-DOS 3.31, and later became available with [[MS-DOS]]/PC DOS 4.0.\n\nMost [[DOS]] {{code|fdisk}} programs, including the {{code|fdisk}} program that came with the original [[Windows 95]], are only capable of creating [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] partitions of types FAT12, FAT16 and FAT16B.\n\nA derivative of the MS-DOS {{code|fdisk}} was provided with Windows 95, [[Windows 98]], and later [[Windows ME]]. Only those {{code|fdisk}} versions shipping with Windows '''95B''' or later are able to manipulate [[FAT32]] partitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/255867|title=How to Use the Fdisk and Format Tools to Partition or Repartition a Hard Disk |work=Support |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=28 June 2012 |edition=6.0}}</ref> [[Windows 2000]] and later do not use {{code|fdisk}}, they have the [[Logical Disk Manager]] feature, as well as {{code|diskpart}}.\n\nUnlike the {{code|fdisk}} programs for other operating systems, the {{code|fdisk}} programs for DOS and [[Windows 9x]]/Me not only alter data in the [[partition table]], but will also overwrite many sectors of data in the partition itself.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} (However, to create an [[extended partition]] any [[partition editor]] must put [[extended boot record]]s before each [[logical drive]] on the disk.) Users must be sure the correct disk/partition has been chosen before using a DOS/Windows {{code|fdisk}} for partitioning. The {{code|fdisk /mbr}} switch is undocumented but well known for repairing the [[master boot record]].\n\nThe {{code|fdisk}} supplied with Windows 95 does not report the correct size of a hard disk that is larger than 64 GB. An updated {{code|fdisk}} is available from Microsoft that corrects this.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/263044 |title=Fdisk Does Not Recognize Full Size of Hard Disks Larger than 64 GB |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=24 August 2012 |edition=4.0 |website=Support}}</ref> Microsoft named the replacement \"263044usa8\" and is Version 4.72.2811.0. Signature May 23, 2000. The original Windows 98 {{code|fdisk}} program size is smaller than the updated one.\n\n===IBM OS/2===\n[[OS/2]] shipped with two partition table managers up until version 4.0.

It is available in [[DOS]], [[Digital Research|DR]] [[FlexOS]], [[IBM]] [[OS/2]], and [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]]s, and in certain ports of [[FreeBSD]],{{r|f}} [[NetBSD]],{{r|n}} [[OpenBSD]],{{r|o}} [[DragonFly BSD]]{{r|d}} and [[macOS]]{{r|x}} for compatibility reasons. In versions of the [[Windows NT]] operating system line from [[Windows 2000]] onwards, {{code|fdisk}} is replaced by a more advanced tool called <code>[[diskpart]]</code>. Similar utilities exist for [[Unix-like]] systems, for example, [[BSD disklabel]].\n\n==Implementations==\n\n===IBM PC DOS===\n[[IBM]] introduced {{code|fdisk}}, [[Hard disk drive|Fixed Disk]] Setup Program version 1.00, with the March 1983 release of the [[IBM PC/XT]], the first PC to store data on a [[hard disk]], and the [[IBM PC DOS|IBM Personal Computer DOS]] version 2.0.  Version 1 could be used to create one [[FAT12]] DOS partition, delete it, change the [[active partition]], or display partition data.  {{code|fdisk}} writes the [[master boot record]], which supported up to four partitions. The other three were intended for other operating systems such as [[CP/M-86]] and [[Xenix]], which were expected to have their own partitioning utilities as {{code|fdisk}} did not support them.\n\nIn August 1984, PC DOS 3.0 added [[FAT16]] partitions to support larger hard disks more efficiently.\n\nIn April 1987, PC DOS/fdisk 3.30 added support for [[Disk partitioning#Extended partition|extended partitions]], which could hold up to 23 \"logical drives\" or [[Volume (computing)|volumes]].\n\n[[IBM PC DOS#PC DOS 7.10|IBM PC DOS 7.10]] contained {{code|FDISK32}} and {{code|FORMAT32}} utilities.\n\n===Microsoft DOS and Windows===\nThe command is available in [[MS-DOS]] versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\">{{Cite book|author-last=Wolverton|author-first=Van|title=Running MS-DOS Version 6.22 (20th Anniversary Edition), 6th Revised edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=0-7356-1812-7}}</ref>\n\nSupport for [[FAT16B]] was added with Compaq MS-DOS 3.31, and later became available with [[MS-DOS]]/PC DOS 4.0.\n\nMost [[DOS]] {{code|fdisk}} programs, including the {{code|fdisk}} program that came with the original [[Windows 95]], are only capable of creating [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] partitions of types FAT12, FAT16 and FAT16B.\n\nA derivative of the MS-DOS {{code|fdisk}} was provided with Windows 95, [[Windows 98]], and later [[Windows ME]]. Only those {{code|fdisk}} versions shipping with Windows '''95B''' or later are able to manipulate [[FAT32]] partitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/255867|title=How to Use the Fdisk and Format Tools to Partition or Repartition a Hard Disk |work=Support |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=28 June 2012 |edition=6.0}}</ref> [[Windows 2000]] and later do not use {{code|fdisk}}, they have the [[Logical Disk Manager]] feature, as well as {{code|diskpart}}.\n\nUnlike the {{code|fdisk}} programs for other operating systems, the {{code|fdisk}} programs for DOS and [[Windows 9x]]/Me not only alter data in the [[partition table]], but will also overwrite many sectors of data in the partition itself.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} (However, to create an [[extended partition]] any [[partition editor]] must put [[extended boot record]]s before each [[logical drive]] on the disk.) Users must be sure the correct disk/partition has been chosen before using a DOS/Windows {{code|fdisk}} for partitioning. The {{code|fdisk /mbr}} switch is undocumented but well known for repairing the [[master boot record]].\n\nThe {{code|fdisk}} supplied with Windows 95 does not report the correct size of a hard disk that is larger than 64 GB. An updated {{code|fdisk}} is available from Microsoft that corrects this.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/263044 |title=Fdisk Does Not Recognize Full Size of Hard Disks Larger than 64 GB |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=24 August 2012 |edition=4.0 |website=Support}}</ref> Microsoft named the replacement \"263044usa8\" and is Version 4.72.2811.0.

{"title_page": "History of Guinea", "text_new": "The modern state of [[Guinea]] did not come into existence until 1958, but the history of the area stretches back well before [[Scramble for Africa|European colonization]]. Its current boundaries were determined during the colonial period by the [[Berlin Conference]] (1884\u20131885) and the French, who ruled Guinea until 1958.\n\n==West African empires==\nWhat is now Guinea was on the fringes of the major [[West Africa]]n empires. The [[Ghana Empire]] is believed to be the earliest of these which grew on trade but contracted and ultimately fell due to the hostile influence of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region.\n\nThe [[Sosso]] kingdom (12th to 13th centuries) briefly flourished in the void but the Islamic [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] [[Mali Empire]] came to prominence when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata K\u00e9\u00efta]] defeated the Sosso ruler, [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9|Sumanguru Kant\u00e9]] at the semi-historical [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. The Mali Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), the most famous being [[Musa I of Mali|Kankou Moussa]], who made a famous [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. Shortly after his reign the Mali Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.\n\nThe most successful of these was the [[Songhai Empire]], expanding its power from about 1460, and eventually surpassing the Mali Empire in both territory and wealth. It continued to prosper until a civil war over succession followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The weakened empire fell to invaders from [[Morocco]] at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] just 3 years later. The Moroccans proved unable to rule the kingdom effectively, however, and it split into many small kingdoms.\n\n==Kingdoms in Guinea==\nAfter the fall of the major West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now Guinea.\n\n===Futa Jallon===\n{{main|Imamate of Futa Jallon}}\n[[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central Guinea and established an Islamic state from 1735 to 1898 with a written constitution and alternate rulers.\n\n===Wassoulou Empire===\n{{Main|Wassoulou Empire}}\nThe Wassoulou empire was a short-lived (1878\u20131898) empire, led by [[Samory Tour\u00e9]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malink\u00e9]] area of what is now upper [[Guinea]] and southwestern [[Mali]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[Ivory Coast]] before being conquered by the French.\n\n==Colonial era==\n[[File:French West Africa 1913 map.png|thumb|Map of [[French West Africa]] circa 1913]]\nThe [[slave trade]] came to the coastal region of Guinea with European colonialists in the 16th century. Slavery had always been part of everyday life but the scale increased as slaves were exported to work elsewhere in the [[triangular trade]].\n\nGuinea's colonial period began with French military penetration into the area in the mid-19th century. French domination was assured by the defeat in 1898 of the armies of [[Samori Tour\u00e9]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malink\u00e9 descent, which gave France control of what today is Guinea and adjacent areas.\n\nFrance negotiated Guinea's present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the British for [[Sierra Leone]], the Portuguese for their Guinea colony (now [[Guinea-Bissau]]), and [[Liberia]]. Under the French, the country formed the [[French Guinea|Territory of Guinea]] within [[French West Africa]], administered by a governor general resident in [[Dakar]]. Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including Guinea.\n\n==Independence (1958)==\nIn 1958 the [[French Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. The founding of a [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was supported by the French people, while French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] made it clear on 8 August 1958 that France's colonies were to be given a stark choice between more [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[French Community]] and immediate independence in the referendum to be held on 28 September 1958.\n\nThe other French colonies chose the former but Guinea \u2014 under the leadership of [[Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]] whose [[Democratic Party of Guinea]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in 1957 territorial elections \u2014 voted overwhelmingly for independence. The French withdrew quickly, and on October 2, 1958, Guinea proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 as president.\n\n===S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9's rule (1958\u20131984)===\n[[File:DF-SC-83-08641.jpg|thumb|300px|President [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]] arrives for a visit to Washington D.C., June 1982.]]\n\nU.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was hostile to Tour\u00e9, so the African nation quickly turned to the Soviet Union--making it the Kremlin's first success story in Africa. Following France's withdrawal, Guinea quickly aligned itself with the [[Soviet Union]] and adopted socialist policies. This alliance was short lived, however, as Guinea moved towards a Chinese model of socialism.  Nevertheless, President John F. Kennedy and his Peace Corps director [[Sargent Shriver]] tried even harder than the Kremlin's [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. By 1963 Guinea had shifted away from Moscow into a closer friendship with Washington.<ref>Philip E. Muehlenbeck, \"Kennedy and Toure: A success in personal diplomacy.\" ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 19.1 (2008): 69-95. [http://www.academia.edu/download/41358717/Diplomacy___Statecraft.pdf  online]</ref>  Guinea relied more and more on aid and investment from the U.S. Even the relationship with France improved, after the election of [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] as president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.\n\nBy 1960, Tour\u00e9 had declared the PDG the only legal party.  For the next 24 years, the government and the PDG were one.  Tour\u00e9 was reelected unopposed to four seven-year terms as president, and every five years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly.  Advocating a hybrid [[African Socialism]] domestically and [[Pan-Africanism]] abroad, Tour\u00e9 quickly became a polarising leader, and his government became intolerant of dissent, imprisoning hundreds, and stifling free press.\n\nAt the same time, the Guinean government nationalised land, removed French appointed and traditional chiefs from power, and broke ties with French government and companies. Vacillating between support for the [[Soviet Union]] and (by the late 1970s) the United States, Guinea's economic situation became as unpredictable as its diplomatic line. Alleging plots and conspiracies against him at home and abroad, Tour\u00e9's regime targeted real and imagined opponents, driving thousands of political opponents into exile.\n\nIn 1970, Portuguese forces, from neighboring [[Portuguese Guinea]], staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid into Guinea with the support of exiled Guinean opposition forces. Among other goals, the Portuguese military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Toure due his support of the [[PAIGC]], a guerilla movement operating inside Portuguese Guinea.<ref>\n\"Mr Sekou Tour\u00e9, who gave the PAIGC unstinted support during its war against the Portuguese,...\"[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13213487 Black revolt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308154755/http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13213487 |date=2009-03-08 }}, [[The Economist]] (Nov 22nd 1980)\n</ref> After several days of fierce fighting, the Portuguese forces retreated without achieving most of their goals. The regime of S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 increased the number of internal arrests and executions.\n\nThe [[Guinean Market Women's Revolt]] in 1977 resulted in the regime's softening of economic restrictions and began a turn away from the radical socialism previously practiced by the government.\n\nS\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 died on March 26, 1984 after a heart operation in the United States, and was replaced by [[Heads of Government of Guinea|Prime Minister]] [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president pending new elections.\n\n===Lansana Cont\u00e9's rule (1984\u20132008)===\nThe PDG was due to elect a new leader on April 3, 1984.  Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president.  However, hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Cont\u00e9]] and [[Diarra Traor\u00e9]] seized power in a bloodless [[coup]]. Cont\u00e9 assumed the role of president, with Traor\u00e9 serving as prime minister until December.\n\nCont\u00e9 immediately denounced the previous regime's record on [[human rights]], released 250 political prisoners and encouraged approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He also made explicit the turn away from socialism, but this did little to alleviate poverty and the country showed no immediate signs of moving towards [[democracy]].\n\nIn 1992, Cont\u00e9 announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993 followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party \u2013 the [[Party of Unity and Progress]] \u2013 won 71 of 114 seats.) Despite his stated commitment to democracy, Cont\u00e9's grip on power remained tight. In September 2001 the opposition leader [[Alpha Cond\u00e9]] was imprisoned for endangering state security, though he was pardoned 8 months later. He subsequently spent a period of exile in France.\n\nIn 2001 Cont\u00e9 organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term and in 2003 begun his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Cont\u00e9 survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a rare public appearance in the capital [[Conakry]]. His opponents claimed that he was a \"tired dictator\" <ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616165043/http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |archive-date=2007-06-16 |url-status=dead }} \n</ref> whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents.

Its current boundaries were determined during the colonial period by the [[Berlin Conference]] (1884\u20131885) and the French, who ruled Guinea until 1958.\n\n==West African empires==\nWhat is now Guinea was on the fringes of the major [[West Africa]]n empires. The [[Ghana Empire]] is believed to be the earliest of these which grew on trade but contracted and ultimately fell due to the hostile influence of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region.\n\nThe [[Sosso]] kingdom (12th to 13th centuries) briefly flourished in the void but the Islamic [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] [[Mali Empire]] came to prominence when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata K\u00e9\u00efta]] defeated the Sosso ruler, [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9|Sumanguru Kant\u00e9]] at the semi-historical [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. The Mali Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), the most famous being [[Musa I of Mali|Kankou Moussa]], who made a famous [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. Shortly after his reign the Mali Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.\n\nThe most successful of these was the [[Songhai Empire]], expanding its power from about 1460, and eventually surpassing the Mali Empire in both territory and wealth. It continued to prosper until a civil war over succession followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The weakened empire fell to invaders from [[Morocco]] at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] just 3 years later. The Moroccans proved unable to rule the kingdom effectively, however, and it split into many small kingdoms.\n\n==Kingdoms in Guinea==\nAfter the fall of the major West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now Guinea.\n\n===Futa Jallon===\n{{main|Imamate of Futa Jallon}}\n[[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central Guinea and established an Islamic state from 1735 to 1898 with a written constitution and alternate rulers.\n\n===Wassoulou Empire===\n{{Main|Wassoulou Empire}}\nThe Wassoulou empire was a short-lived (1878\u20131898) empire, led by [[Samory Tour\u00e9]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malink\u00e9]] area of what is now upper [[Guinea]] and southwestern [[Mali]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[Ivory Coast]] before being conquered by the French.\n\n==Colonial era==\n[[File:French West Africa 1913 map.png|thumb|Map of [[French West Africa]] circa 1913]]\nThe [[slave trade]] came to the coastal region of Guinea with European colonialists in the 16th century. Slavery had always been part of everyday life but the scale increased as slaves were exported to work elsewhere in the [[triangular trade]].\n\nGuinea's colonial period began with French military penetration into the area in the mid-19th century. French domination was assured by the defeat in 1898 of the armies of [[Samori Tour\u00e9]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malink\u00e9 descent, which gave France control of what today is Guinea and adjacent areas.\n\nFrance negotiated Guinea's present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the British for [[Sierra Leone]], the Portuguese for their Guinea colony (now [[Guinea-Bissau]]), and [[Liberia]]. Under the French, the country formed the [[French Guinea|Territory of Guinea]] within [[French West Africa]], administered by a governor general resident in [[Dakar]]. Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including Guinea.\n\n==Independence (1958)==\nIn 1958 the [[French Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. The founding of a [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was supported by the French people, while French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] made it clear on 8 August 1958 that France's colonies were to be given a stark choice between more [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[French Community]] and immediate independence in the referendum to be held on 28 September 1958.\n\nThe other French colonies chose the former but Guinea \u2014 under the leadership of [[Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9]] whose [[Democratic Party of Guinea]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in 1957 territorial elections \u2014 voted overwhelmingly for independence. The French withdrew quickly, and on October 2, 1958, Guinea proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 as president.\n\n===S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9's rule (1958\u20131984)===\n[[File:DF-SC-83-08641.jpg|thumb|300px|President [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]] arrives for a visit to Washington D.C., June 1982.]]\n\nU.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was hostile to Tour\u00e9, so the African nation quickly turned to the Soviet Union--making it the Kremlin's first success story in Africa. Following France's withdrawal, Guinea quickly aligned itself with the [[Soviet Union]] and adopted socialist policies. This alliance was short lived, however, as Guinea moved towards a Chinese model of socialism.  Nevertheless, President John F. Kennedy and his Peace Corps director [[Sargent Shriver]] tried even harder than the Kremlin's [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. By 1963 Guinea had shifted away from Moscow into a closer friendship with Washington.<ref>Philip E. Muehlenbeck, \"Kennedy and Toure: A success in personal diplomacy.\" ''Diplomacy and Statecraft'' 19.1 (2008): 69-95. [http://www.academia.edu/download/41358717/Diplomacy___Statecraft.pdf  online]</ref>  Guinea relied more and more on aid and investment from the U.S. Even the relationship with France improved, after the election of [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] as president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.\n\nBy 1960, Tour\u00e9 had declared the PDG the only legal party.  For the next 24 years, the government and the PDG were one.  Tour\u00e9 was reelected unopposed to four seven-year terms as president, and every five years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly.  Advocating a hybrid [[African Socialism]] domestically and [[Pan-Africanism]] abroad, Tour\u00e9 quickly became a polarising leader, and his government became intolerant of dissent, imprisoning hundreds, and stifling free press.\n\nAt the same time, the Guinean government nationalised land, removed French appointed and traditional chiefs from power, and broke ties with French government and companies. Vacillating between support for the [[Soviet Union]] and (by the late 1970s) the United States, Guinea's economic situation became as unpredictable as its diplomatic line. Alleging plots and conspiracies against him at home and abroad, Tour\u00e9\u2019s regime targeted real and imagined opponents, driving thousands of political opponents into exile.\n\nIn 1970, Portuguese forces, from neighboring [[Portuguese Guinea]], staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid into Guinea with the support of exiled Guinean opposition forces. Among other goals, the Portuguese military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Toure due his support of the [[PAIGC]], a guerilla movement operating inside Portuguese Guinea.<ref>\n\"Mr Sekou Tour\u00e9, who gave the PAIGC unstinted support during its war against the Portuguese,...\"[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13213487 Black revolt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308154755/http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13213487 |date=2009-03-08 }}, [[The Economist]] (Nov 22nd 1980)\n</ref> After several days of fierce fighting, the Portuguese forces retreated without achieving most of their goals. The regime of S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 increased the number of internal arrests and executions.\n\nThe [[Guinean Market Women's Revolt]] in 1977 resulted in the regime's softening of economic restrictions and began a turn away from the radical socialism previously practiced by the government.\n\nS\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9 died on March 26, 1984 after a heart operation in the United States, and was replaced by [[Heads of Government of Guinea|Prime Minister]] [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president pending new elections.\n\n===Lansana Cont\u00e9's rule (1984\u20132008)===\nThe PDG was due to elect a new leader on April 3, 1984.  Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president.  However, hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Cont\u00e9]] and [[Diarra Traor\u00e9]] seized power in a bloodless [[coup]]. Cont\u00e9 assumed the role of president, with Traor\u00e9 serving as prime minister until December.\n\nCont\u00e9 immediately denounced the previous regime\u2019s record on [[human rights]], released 250 political prisoners and encouraged approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He also made explicit the turn away from socialism, but this did little to alleviate poverty and the country showed no immediate signs of moving towards [[democracy]].\n\nIn 1992, Cont\u00e9 announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993 followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party \u2013 the [[Party of Unity and Progress]] \u2013 won 71 of 114 seats.) Despite his stated commitment to democracy, Cont\u00e9's grip on power remained tight. In September 2001 the opposition leader [[Alpha Cond\u00e9]] was imprisoned for endangering state security, though he was pardoned 8 months later. He subsequently spent a period of exile in France.\n\nIn 2001 Cont\u00e9 organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term and in 2003 begun his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Cont\u00e9 survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a rare public appearance in the capital [[Conakry]]. His opponents claimed that he was a \"tired dictator\" <ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |title=Archived copy |access-date=2005-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616165043/http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |archive-date=2007-06-16 |url-status=dead }} \n</ref> whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents.

The ''1301'' and the ''1501'' were the natural evolution of the previous [[Simca 1300/1500|1300 and 1500]] models with which they shared engines and mechanical parts.\n\n=== Features ===\n\nCompared to the two predecessors, the 1301 and 1501 kept the same stylistic approach, although they were slightly modernised: they were then characterised by the same 3 square four door saloon and 2 square 4 door wagon body styles. The most obvious design differences were in the front and rear ends of the car: the front end was longer by 6.9&nbsp;cm, while the rear end on the sedan bodies was increased as well by 13.5&nbsp;cm in order to allow a greater baggage capacity. The result was that 1301 and 1501 sedan models were longer by 21 [[centimetre|cm]] compared to 1300 and 1500. Other differences were both in the front, where it was given a new [[Grille (motor vehicle)|grille]], and redesigned in the side indicator area. Differences stand out in the cockpit instrument panel with a new horizontal and straight design. Despite the disappearance of some luxuries such as the courtesy light inside, they did improve the overall quality and comfort of the seats and their upholstery.\n\nAt first, even the engines used were the same from the 1300/1500 models, although they had in part been revised. The 1301 was equipped with the 1,290 [[cubic centimetre|cc]], [[4-cylinder]] \"Rush\" engine, with overhead valves, and powered by a single barrel [[carburetor|carburettor]] it was capable of delivering 54&nbsp;hp DIN and allowed the car to reach a top speed of 135&nbsp;km/h. Similarly, the Simca 1501 was equipped by the same [[Simca Type 342 and 345 Engines|Type 342]] engine of the previous Simca 1500, a 1,475 cc 4-cylinder originally powered by a single barrel carburettor, and capable of delivering 69&nbsp;hp DIN. The maximum speed for the 1501 was improved slightly, reaching 147 km/h in its earliest rendition.\n\n=== Range and trim levels  ===\n\nAt the start of production, the range 1301/1501 was composed as follows:\n\n*'''1301''' '''Sedan''' and '''1501 Sedan''', with the trim levels '''LS''', '''GL''' and '''GLS''';\n*'''1301 Break''' and '''1501 Break''', with the trim levels '''LS''' and '''GLS''';\n*'''1301 Familiale''' and '''1501 Familiale''', with only one trim level, '''LS''';\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Evolution ===\n[[File:SIMCA 1301 AV.jpg|thumb|Simca 1301]]\n[[File:Biarritz, France (3290723609).jpg|thumb|1973 Simca 1501 Break]]\nThe first deliveries began in late 1966 and early 1967: in March, the range was completed with the arrival of the 1301U, an unprecedented version of the car, a van with the rear windows replaced by sheet metal and only two seats, while the rear part of the passenger compartment has been completely emptied to make it a load compartment.\n\nLike with the ''1300'' and the ''1500'', the new ''1301'' and ''1501'' was came with a two-year warranty on the engine, gearbox and suspension. This was done in order to attract new customers and establish the commercial success of the two models. Unfortunately, the shadow of Chrysler ended up covering the traditional methods of Simca and went to be a problem for the development of subsequent projects of the French Company.\n\nIn autumn 1968 the range was revised and simplified: the Sedan ''1301'' ''LS'' and ''GL'' remained on the list, while the ''1301 Break'' and ''Familiale'' were merged into a single model, the '''1301 GL'''. As for the ''1501'', the ''LS'' and ''GLS'' were cancelled, leaving in the existing list only the ''GL'' and the new '''1501 Special''', which was also available as [[station wagon]]. The ''1501 Special'' was equipped with a redesigned version of the Type 342 engine that came in the GL, the Type 342S, which came with a revised head design and a double barrel carburettor, it delivered 81&nbsp;hp DIN, and had a 160&nbsp;km/h top speed. Another feature of the Special was an increased rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] ratio. The special also came equipped with boosted brakes and a sporty steering wheel. What also disappeared from the lineup was the 1301 U, which received little interest as a commercial vehicle.\n\nIn September 1969, for the ''1501'' there was another redesign, focused mainly on the front end of the car, where it found a completely redesigned grille and headlights which now incorporated a pair of fog lights as factory equipment. The 1301, however, on the outside, remained visually unchanged. Internally, for the whole range there was a new dashboard and a new instrument panel with round elements (two for the 1301 and four for 1501), and also a spot for a radio. Another significant change in the cockpit concerned the use of fabrics and tints that were coordinated and harmonized. Mechanically, all the ''1501'' trims benefited from the ''342S'' engine with 81&nbsp;hp, which had until then only equipped the ''Special''. The latter then differed from the other trims only in the interior and equipment.\n\nIn early 1970, the 1301 saw its Rush engine replaced by a more modern engine based on the Type 342: the [[Simca Type 342 and 345 Engines|Type 345]]. The Type 342 was a debored version of the Type 342 engine, with only 1290cc, which now came in all standard 1301 models, delivering 60hp DIN. The 1301 Special would now come with the Type 342S, a version of the 342 with a twin barrel carb and increased compression, delivering 70 hp DIN. This was in essence the only real news regarding the ''1301'' range since its debut. Other improvements helped to increase the reliability, while lowering power consumption. The 60&nbsp;hp 1.3 engine went to equip the only other 1301 sedan remained, namely the ''LS''. The latter remained in the list until August, only to be replaced by 1301, without additional acronyms. In September 1970, the range was as follows:\n\n*''1301'', with the 1.3 litre, 60&nbsp;hp engine;\n*''1301 Special'', with the 1.3 litre, 70&nbsp;hp engine;\n*''1301 Break Special'', with the 1.3 litre, 70&nbsp;hp engine;\n*''1501 Break Special'', with the 1.5 litre, 81&nbsp;hp engine.\n\nNote the disappearance of sedans in 1501, commissioned by Chrysler (which already held a 95% stake in the Simca) to not hinder the commercial career of the [[Chrysler 160|Type 160]]. A lot of copies of ''1501'' with sedan bodywork continued to be produced for a bit of time for some foreign markets and marketed as '''1501 GLE''', where the E was for export.\n\nIn 1971, the new grille was also adopted by the ''1301''. This was part of a rationalization program wanted by Chrysler Europe, which aimed to standardize as much as possible Simca models, to reduce costs and check the best possible profits. Also in 1971 came the outside rearview mirror and a new steering wheel with horn cup concentric. Among the new options of more details, the vinyl roof should be mentioned, which emphasized the elegance of the car. In the same year, however, the ''1301 base'' and the ''1501 Break'' left the list at which point the range resulted composed solely and exclusively of the ''1301 Sp\u00e9cial'' in ''sedan'' and ''Break'.\n\nIn 1972 there were only updates to the detail of the range for the ''1301'', aimed essentially to the interior (cigarette lighter, rear-view antiglare, better internal soundproofing, etc.) and mechanics (reinforced gearbox, rear brakes, etc.).\n\nIn 1973, however, there were more substantial changes: the lack of success encountered by the ''Type 160'' pushed the leaders of Chrysler to resume production of the ''1501'', then returned to the list as the ''Special'' (and always in two body variants), but with its engine detuned to 73&nbsp;hp. For its part, the ''1301'', not to stand too close to the \"big sister\", deprived itself of some horsepower and went from 70 to 67&nbsp;hp. The weakening of the models, however, was mainly to decrease fuel consumption, given the oil crisis erupted in that year and brought down the intentions (and models) of many car manufacturers.\n\nThe only notable update for 1974 was the introduction of the entire range of the taillights, which become obligatory from September of that year. There was also another, but much less visible: in ''1501'' the power down to 71&nbsp;hp.\n\nIn 1975 Simca presented the [[Simca 1307|1307, 1308 and 1309]]: in July the ''1301'' production was stopped, it was followed in September by the ''1501'', but the range still resisted enough to face its last Paris Motor Show. In January of ''1976'' the ''Break'' also disappeared from the list, while the last examples, in both body configurations, were disposed of by the first half of the following year.\n\n=== Summary characteristics ===\n\nThe following summarizes the characteristics of the various versions of the range of ''1301''/''1501'':\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\"  cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; width:100%\"\n|colspan=13 style=\"height:27px; background:#D5EAFB; text-align:center; font-weight:bold\"|Simca 1301 / 1501\n|-style=\"background:#DCDCDC; font-weight:bold\" \n| Model\n| Bodywork\n| Trim\n| Engine\n| Displacement<br>cm\u00b3\n| Power<br>hp DIN/rpm\n| Torque<br>([[Newton per metre|Nm]]/rpm)\n| Empty mass<br>(kg)\n| Top<br>speed{{Clarify|reason=Are these km/h or mph?|date=April 2020}}\n| Years in production\n|-\n|rowspan=\"9\"|'''1301'''||rowspan=\"5\"|Sedan||LS, GL and GLS||[[Motore Simca Rush|Type 312T (Rush)]]||rowspan=\"5\"|1290||54/5200||87/2600||rowspan=\"3\"|990||135||1966-69\n|-\n|LS||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 345|Type 345]]||rowspan=\"2\"|60/5400||rowspan=\"2\"|87.3/4300||rowspan=\"2\"|140||02/1970-08/1970\n|-\n|base||1970-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|''Sp\u00e9cial''||[[Motore Simca Type 345|Type 345 S]]||70/5400||88.3/4600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.010||rowspan=\"2\"|152||1970-73\n|-\n|[[Motore Simca Type 345|2L2]]||67/5400||99/4000||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Station wagon|Station Wagon]]||LS, LS Familiale, GLS||rowspan=\"2\"|Type 312T (Rush)||rowspan=\"4\"|1290||rowspan=\"2\"|54/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|87/2600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.150||rowspan=\"2\"|130||1967-68\n|-\n|GL||1968-69\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Sp\u00e9cial||Type 345 S||70/5400||88.3/4600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.170||145||1970-73\n|-\n|2L2||67/5400||99/4000||143||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"10\"|'''1501'''||rowspan=\"4\"|Sedan||LS, GL, GLS||[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342]]||rowspan=\"4\"|1475||69/5200||100/2600||1.010||147||1966-68\n|-\n|GL||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342 S]]||rowspan=\"2\"|81/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|122/4000||rowspan=\"3\"|1.020||rowspan=\"3\"|160||1968-70\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Sp\u00e9cial||1968-70\n|-\n|[[Motore Simca Type 342|2N2]]||73/5100||114/3600||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Station Wagon||LS, LS Familiale, GLS||rowspan=\"2\"|Type 342||rowspan=\"6\"|1475||rowspan=\"2\"|69/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|100/2600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.190||rowspan=\"2\"|142||1967-68\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|GL||1968-69\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342 S]]||rowspan=\"2\"|81/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|122/4000||rowspan=\"4\"|1.210||rowspan=\"2\"|150||1969-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|''Sp\u00e9cial''||1968-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2N2||73/5100||rowspan=\"2\"|114/3600||142||1973-74\n|-\n|71/5000||140||1974-75\n|}\n\n== References ==\n*''Les Simca 1300-1500 et 1301/1501'', Christian Caz\u00e9, ETAI\n*''Simca - L'aventure de l'hirondelle'', Adrien Cahuzac, ETAI\n\n==External links==\n*[http://webmaster.simca.free.fr/modeles.php?id=&ref_mod=206 French page dedicated to limited release in 1301 Export]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908015140/http://hometown.aol.com/simcamaniac/Simca13001500pg1.html English site dedicated to the 1300, 1301, 1500 and 1501]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Simca 1301 1501}}\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Simca vehicles|1301]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=October 2015}}\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Simca 1301 Special Front.JPG\n| caption = Simca 1301 Special\n| name = Simca 1301/1501\n| manufacturer = [[Simca]]\n| production = 1966\u20131975\n| predecessor = [[Simca 1300/1500]]\n| successor = [[Simca 1307]]\n| class = [[Compact executive car|Large family car]] ([[D-segment|D]])\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[saloon car|saloon]]<br>5-door [[station wagon]]\n| engine = 1.3&nbsp;L ''Rush'' [[ohv]] [[straight-4|I4]]<br>1.3&nbsp;L [[Simca_Type_342_and_345_Engines#Type_345|Type 345]] [[ohv]] [[straight-4|I4]]<br>1.5&nbsp;L [[Simca_Type_342_and_345_Engines#Type_342|Type 342]] [[ohv]] [[straight-4|I4]]\n| transmission = \n| wheelbase = {{convert|99|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|175.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} <br> ''1301 / 1501 saloon''<br>{{convert|169.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} <br> ''1301 / 1501 estate''\n| width = {{convert|62|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|55|in|mm|abbr=on}} ''unladen''\n| related = \n| designer = \n}}\nThe '''Simca 1301''' and '''Simca 1501''' are two related [[automobile]]s which were produced by the [[France|French]] [[automaker]] [[Simca]] from 1966 to 1975.\n\n== History and Profile ==\n\nThe Simcas 1301 and 1501 were first presented to the public in October 1966, and a preview presentation to the press took place on August 31 of that year.

In the same year, however, the ''1301 base'' and the ''1501 Break'' left the list at which point the range resulted composed solely and exclusively of the ''1301 Sp\u00e9cial'' in ''sedan'' and ''Break'.\n\nIn 1972 there were only updates to the detail of the range for the ''1301'', aimed essentially to the interior (cigarette lighter, rear-view antiglare, better internal soundproofing, etc.) and mechanics (reinforced gearbox, rear brakes, etc.).\n\nIn 1973, however, there were more substantial changes: the lack of success encountered by the ''Type 160'' pushed the leaders of Chrysler to resume production of the ''1501'', then returned to the list as the ''Special'' (and always in two body variants), but with its engine detuned to 73&nbsp;hp. For its part, the ''1301'', not to stand too close to the \"big sister\", deprived itself of some horsepower and went from 70 to 67&nbsp;hp. The weakening of the models, however, was mainly to decrease fuel consumption, given the oil crisis erupted in that year and brought down the intentions (and models) of many car manufacturers.\n\nThe only notable update for 1974 was the introduction of the entire range of the taillights, which become obligatory from September of that year. There was also another, but much less visible: in ''1501'' the power down to 71&nbsp;hp.\n\nIn 1975 Simca presented the [[Simca 1307|1307, 1308 and 1309]]: in July the ''1301'' production was stopped, it was followed in September by the ''1501'', but the range still resisted enough to face its last Paris Motor Show. In January of ''1976'' the ''Break'' also disappeared from the list, while the last examples, in both body configurations, were disposed of by the first half of the following year.\n\n=== Summary characteristics ===\n\nThe following summarizes the characteristics of the various versions of the range of ''1301''/''1501'':\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\"  cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; width:100%\"\n|colspan=13 style=\"height:27px; background:#D5EAFB; text-align:center; font-weight:bold\"|Simca 1301 / 1501\n|-style=\"background:#DCDCDC; font-weight:bold\" \n| Model\n| Bodywork\n| Trim\n| Engine\n| Displacement<br>cm\u00b3\n| Power<br>hp DIN/rpm\n| Torque<br>([[Newton per metre|Nm]]/rpm)\n| Empty mass<br>(kg)\n| Top<br>speed\n| Years in production\n|-\n|rowspan=\"9\"|'''1301'''||rowspan=\"5\"|Sedan||LS, GL and GLS||[[Motore Simca Rush|Type 312T (Rush)]]||rowspan=\"5\"|1290||54/5200||87/2600||rowspan=\"3\"|990||135||1966-69\n|-\n|LS||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 345|Type 345]]||rowspan=\"2\"|60/5400||rowspan=\"2\"|87.3/4300||rowspan=\"2\"|140||02/1970-08/1970\n|-\n|base||1970-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|''Sp\u00e9cial''||[[Motore Simca Type 345|Type 345 S]]||70/5400||88.3/4600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.010||rowspan=\"2\"|152||1970-73\n|-\n|[[Motore Simca Type 345|2L2]]||67/5400||99/4000||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Station wagon|Station Wagon]]||LS, LS Familiale, GLS||rowspan=\"2\"|Type 312T (Rush)||rowspan=\"4\"|1290||rowspan=\"2\"|54/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|87/2600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.150||rowspan=\"2\"|130||1967-68\n|-\n|GL||1968-69\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Sp\u00e9cial||Type 345 S||70/5400||88.3/4600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.170||145||1970-73\n|-\n|2L2||67/5400||99/4000||143||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"10\"|'''1501'''||rowspan=\"4\"|Sedan||LS, GL, GLS||[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342]]||rowspan=\"4\"|1475||69/5200||100/2600||1.010||147||1966-68\n|-\n|GL||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342 S]]||rowspan=\"2\"|81/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|122/4000||rowspan=\"3\"|1.020||rowspan=\"3\"|160||1968-70\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Sp\u00e9cial||1968-70\n|-\n|[[Motore Simca Type 342|2N2]]||73/5100||114/3600||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Station Wagon||LS, LS Familiale, GLS||rowspan=\"2\"|Type 342||rowspan=\"6\"|1475||rowspan=\"2\"|69/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|100/2600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.190||rowspan=\"2\"|142||1967-68\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|GL||1968-69\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342 S]]||rowspan=\"2\"|81/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|122/4000||rowspan=\"4\"|1.210||rowspan=\"2\"|150||1969-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|''Sp\u00e9cial''||1968-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2N2||73/5100||rowspan=\"2\"|114/3600||142||1973-74\n|-\n|71/5000||140||1974-75\n|}\n\n== References ==\n*''Les Simca 1300-1500 et 1301/1501'', Christian Caz\u00e9, ETAI\n*''Simca - L'aventure de l'hirondelle'', Adrien Cahuzac, ETAI\n\n==External links==\n*[http://webmaster.simca.free.fr/modeles.php?id=&ref_mod=206 French page dedicated to limited release in 1301 Export]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908015140/http://hometown.aol.com/simcamaniac/Simca13001500pg1.html English site dedicated to the 1300, 1301, 1500 and 1501]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Simca 1301 1501}}\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Simca vehicles|1301]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n", "name_user": "TKOIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:temp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simca_1301/1501"}
