He won several top championships, including the [[FIP World Heavyweight Championship]] once, the [[HWA Heavyweight Championship]] thrice, and the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship]] twice.\n\nAfter signing with WWE in 2011, he took the name Dean Ambrose and competed in their [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territories]] [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW) and [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. He joined the main roster in November 2012 as a member of [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]], alongside [[Roman Reigns]] and [[Seth Rollins]]. In May 2013, Ambrose won his first championship in WWE, the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]], while in the group, with his 351-day reign being the [[List of WWE United States Champions|longest under the WWE banner]].

He won several top championships, including the [[FIP World Heavyweight Championship]] once, the [[HWA Heavyweight Championship]] thrice, and the [[CZW World Heavyweight Championship]] twice.\n\nAfter signing with WWE in 2011, he took the name Dean Ambrose and competed in their [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territories]] [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW) and [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. He joined the main roster in November 2012 as a member of [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]], alongside [[Roman Reigns]] and [[Seth Rollins]]. In May 2013, Ambrose won his first championship in WWE, the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]], while in the group, with his 351-day reign being the [[List of WWE United States Champions|longest under the WWE banner]].

It was envisioned by [[Satish Ranjan Das]], a [[Kolkata]] lawyer, who prevised a school modelled on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], but conscious of Indian ambitions and desires. Soon after initiating the funding scheme for Doon, Das, considered the school's founder, died in 1928. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

Every year boys are admitted in only two year groups: [[seventh grade]] in January and [[eighth grade]] in April. The school is fully residential, and boys and most teachers live on campus. In tenth grade, students take the [[IGCSE|Cambridge IGCSE]] examinations, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. A wide range of extra-curricular activities, numbering around 80, are offered to the boys, and early British masters such as [[R.L. Holdsworth]], [[J.A.K. Martyn]] and [[Jack Gibson (schoolmaster)|Jack Gibson]] established a strong tradition of [[Role of The Doon School in Indian mountaineering|mountaineering at school]]. The school occupies the former site of the [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] and is home to diverse flora and fauna.

Bhore|Sir Joseph Bhore]], then Railway Minister of [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon's]] Council, became IPSS chairman and, with [[Akbar Hydari|Sir Akbar Hydari]] as secretary, worked to obtain the former estate of the [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]], in [[Dehradun]], from the government on favourable terms.<ref>''The Indian Year Book'', vol. 29 (1942), p. 419: \"Doon School&nbsp;\u2013 This school which is established in the Chand Bagh and Skinner's Estates at Dehra Doon owes its origin to the initiative and enthusiasm of the late SR Das.\"</ref> Sir Frank Noyce also joined the team.

Soon after initiating the funding scheme for Doon, Das, considered the school's founder, died in 1928. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

Every year boys are admitted in only two year groups: [[seventh grade]] in January and [[eighth grade]] in April. The school is fully residential, and boys and most teachers live on campus. In tenth grade, students take the [[IGCSE|Cambridge IGCSE]] examinations, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. A wide range of extra-curricular activities, numbering around 80, are offered to the boys, and early British masters such as [[R.L. Holsworth]], [[J.A.K. Martyn]] and [[Jack Gibson (schoolmaster)|Jack Gibson]] established a strong tradition of [[Role of The Doon School in Indian mountaineering|mountaineering at school]].

Macedonia is the largest and {{nowrap|second-most-populous}} Greek region, with a population of 2.38 million in 2017. The region is highly [[mountain]]ous, with most major urban centers such as [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Kavala]] being concentrated on its southern coastline. Together with [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], and sometimes also [[Thessaly]] and [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], it is part of [[Northern Greece]]. Greek Macedonia encompasses entirely the southern part of the [[region of Macedonia]],<ref>Roy E. H. Mellor, ''Eastern Europe: A Geography of the Comecon Countries'', Macmillan International Higher Education, 1975, {{ISBN|1349155594}}, p. 62.</ref> making up 51% of the total area of the region. It also contains [[Mount Athos]], an autonomous monastic region of Greece. Macedonia forms part of Greece's [[border|national frontier]] with three countries: [[Bulgaria]] to the northeast, [[North Macedonia]] to the north, and [[Albania]] to the northwest.\n\nMacedonia incorporates most of the territories of ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]], a kingdom ruled by the [[Argead Dynasty|Argeads]], whose most celebrated members were [[Alexander the Great]] and his father [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. The name ''Macedonia'' was later applied to a number of widely-differing administrative areas in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires, resulting in [[Macedonia (region)|modern geographical Macedonia]].

The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[palaeolithic]] period, notably with the [[Petralona cave]] in which was found the oldest yet known European humanoid, ''[[Archanthropus europaeus petraloniensis]]''. In the [[Late Neolithic]] period (c.&nbsp;4500 to 3500&nbsp;BC), trade took place with quite distant regions, indicating rapid socio-economic changes. One of the most important innovations was the start of copper working.\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{details|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|The expansion of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom up to the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]]]]\n[[File:Amfipoli, Greece - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Lion of Amphipolis]]; erected in 4th BC in honour of [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], general of Alexander the Great]]\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the history of Macedonia began with the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makednoi]] tribe, among the first to use the name, migrating to the region from [[Histiaeotis]] in the south. There they lived near Thracian tribes such as the [[Bryges]] who would later leave Macedonia for [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and become known as [[Phrygia]]ns. ''[[Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology|Macedonia]]'' was named after the Makednoi. Accounts of other [[toponym]]s such as [[Imathia|Emathia]] are attested to have been in use before that. Herodotus claims that\na branch of the Macedonians invaded Southern Greece towards the end of the second millennium B.C. Upon reaching the Peloponnese the invaders were renamed [[Dorians]], triggering the accounts of the Dorian invasion. For centuries the Macedonian tribes were organized in independent kingdoms, in what is now Central Macedonia, and their role in internal Hellenic politics was minimal, even before the rise of Athens. The Macedonians claimed to be Dorian Greeks (Argive Greeks) and there were many [[Ionians]] in the coastal regions. The rest of the region was inhabited by various Thracian and Illyrian tribes as well as mostly coastal colonies of other Greek states such as [[Amphipolis]], Olynthos, Potidea, Stageira and many others, and to the north another tribe dwelt, called the [[Paeonians]]. During the late 6th and early 5th century BC, the region came under Persian rule until the destruction of Xerxes at [[Plataea]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Macedonia became the theatre of many military actions by the [[Peloponnesian League]] and the Athenians, and saw incursions of Thracians and Illyrians, as attested by Thucydides. Many Macedonian cities were allied to the Spartans (both the Spartans and the Macedonians were Dorian, while the Athenians were Ionian), but Athens maintained the colony of Amphipolis under her control for many years. The kingdom of [[Macedon]], was reorganized by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and achieved the union of Greek states by forming the [[League of Corinth]]. After his assassination, his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] succeeded to the throne of Macedon and carrying the title of [[Hegemon]] of [[League of Corinth]] started his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|long campaign]] towards the east.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also|Macedonian Wars|Macedonia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:\u0391\u03a8\u0399\u0394\u0391 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 2.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman-era [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] in Thessaloniki, capital of Roman Macedonia]]\n\nMacedonia remained an important and powerful kingdom until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (June 22, 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia. For a brief period a Macedonian republic called the \"Koinon of the Macedonians\" was established. It was divided into four administrative districts by the Romans in the hope that this would make revolts more difficult, but this manoeuvre failed.

The passage reports that Paul and his companions responded immediately to the invitation.\n\nSubsequently the provinces of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] as well as other regions to the north were incorporated into a new Provincia Macedonia, but in 297 AD under a [[Diocletian]]ic reform many of these regions were removed and two new provinces were created: Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris (from 479 to 482 AD Macedonia Secunda). Macedonia Prima coincided approximately with Strabo's definition of Macedonia and with the modern administrative district of Greece<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\" /> and had [[Thessalonica|Thessaloniki]] as its capital, while Macedonia Salutaris had the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city of [[Stobi]] (near [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]]) as its capital. This subdivision is mentioned in [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]]' Synecdemon (527\u2013528) and remained through the reign of emperor [[Justinian]].\n\nThe [[Slav]]ic, [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions in the 6\u20137th centuries devastated both provinces<ref>{{cite book |first=John Julius |last=Norwich |title=A short history of Byzantium |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 }}</ref> with only parts of Macedonia Prima in the coastal areas and nearer [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] remaining in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] hands, while most of the hinterland was disputed between the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Macedonian regions under Byzantine control passed under the [[tourma]] of Macedonia to the province of [[Thrace]].\n\nA new system of administration came into place in 789\u2013802 AD, following the [[Byzantine empire]]'s recovery from these invasions. The new system was based on administrative divisions called [[Themata]]. The region of Macedonia Prima (the territory of modern Greek administrative district of Macedonia) was divided between the Thema of Thessaloniki and the Thema of Strymon, so that only the region of the area from [[Nestos (river)|Nestos]] eastwards continued to carry the name Macedonia, referred to as the [[Macedonia (theme)|Thema of Macedonia]] or the Thema of \"Macedonia in Thrace\".

The remainder of the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula also enjoyed an autonomous status: the \"Koinon of Mademochoria\" was governed by a locally appointed council due to privileges obtained on account of its wealth, coming from the gold and silver mines in the area.\n\nThere were several uprisings in Macedonia during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], including an uprising after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] that ended in massacres of the Greek population, the uprising in [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] of the armatolos [[Zisis Karademos]] in 1705, a rebellion in the area of [[Grevena]] by a [[Klepht]] called Ziakas (1730\u20131810) and the Greek Declaration of Independence in Macedonia by [[Emmanouel Pappas|Emmanuel Pappas]] in 1821, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In 1854 [[Theodoros Ziakas]], the son of the klepht Ziakas, together with [[Dimitrios Karatasos]], who had been among  the captains at the siege of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] in 1821, led another uprising in Western Macedonia that has been profusely commemorated in Greek folk song.\n\n===Modern history===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Balkan Wars|Macedonian Front|Movement of National Defence}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The 1st Battalion of the [[Provisional Government of National Defence|National Defence]] marches on its way to the Front, during WWI.]]\n\nGreece gained the southern parts of the region with Thessaloniki from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and expanded its share in the [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria. The boundaries of Greek Macedonia were finalized in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In [[World War I]], Macedonia became a battlefield. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], favoured entering the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], while the Germanophile King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] favored neutrality. Invited by Venizelos, in autumn 1915, the Allies landed forces in Thessaloniki to aid [[Serbia]] in [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|its war]] against Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, but their intervention came too late to prevent the Serbian collapse. The [[Macedonian front]] was established, with Thessaloniki at its heart, while in summer 1916 the Bulgarians [[Struma operation|took over]] Greek eastern Macedonia without opposition. This provoked a military uprising among pro-Venizelist officers in Thessaloniki, resulting in the establishment of a \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\" in the city, headed by Venizelos, which entered the war alongside the Allies. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an [[Noemvriana|armed confrontation]] in Athens between Entente and royalist forces the King abdicated, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens in June 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nIn [[World War II]] Macedonia was [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied by the Axis]] (1941\u201344), with Germany taking western and central Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Bulgaria occupying and annexing eastern Macedonia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Slavic peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region, or as \"[[Rum Millet]]\", i.e. members of the Greek-dominated community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as \"Bulgarians\", but the word \"Bulgarian\" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant.  By the middle of the 19th century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions with [[rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]]. From then, the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic speaking communities of northern Greece]] split into two hostile and opposed groups with two different national identities - Greek and Bulgarian.<ref>Gounaris, Basil G. (1995). \"Social Cleavages and National \"Awakening\" in Ottoman Macedonia\". East European Quarterly. 29 (4): 409\u2013426.</ref> By the Second World War and following the defeat of Bulgaria, another further split between the Slavic groups occurred. Conservatives departed with the occupying Bulgarian Army to Bulgaria. Leftists who identified as Macedonians (Slavic), joined the communist-dominated rebel [[Democratic Army of Greece]]. At the conclusion of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349), most Macedonians of Slavic background were evacuated by the [[Greek Communist Party]] and forced to flee to the [[Socialist Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>cite web|https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415|cite-title=Macedonian Refugee Children: Exodus Anniversary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415</ref> Some also immigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref>Panayiotis Diamadis et al.

The earliest signs of human habitation date back to the [[palaeolithic]] period, notably with the [[Petralona cave]] in which was found the oldest yet known European humanoid, ''[[Archanthropus europaeus petraloniensis]]''. In the [[Late Neolithic]] period (c.&nbsp;4500 to 3500&nbsp;BC), trade took place with quite distant regions, indicating rapid socio-economic changes. One of the most important innovations was the start of copper working.\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{details|Macedonia (ancient kingdom)}}\n[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|The expansion of the ancient Macedonian Kingdom up to the death of [[Philip II of Macedon|Phillip II]]]]\n[[File:Amfipoli, Greece - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Lion of Amphipolis]]; erected in 4th BC in honour of [[Laomedon of Mytilene]], general of Alexander the Great]]\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the history of Macedonia began with the [[Ancient Macedonians|Makednoi]] tribe, among the first to use the name, migrating to the region from [[Histiaeotis]] in the south. There they lived near Thracian tribes such as the [[Bryges]] who would later leave Macedonia for [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and become known as [[Phrygia]]ns. ''[[Macedonia (terminology)#Etymology|Macedonia]]'' was named after the Makednoi. Accounts of other [[toponym]]s such as [[Imathia|Emathia]] are attested to have been in use before that. Herodotus claims that\na branch of the Macedonians invaded Southern Greece towards the end of the second millennium B.C. Upon reaching the Peloponnese the invaders were renamed [[Dorians]], triggering the accounts of the Dorian invasion. For centuries the Macedonian tribes were organized in independent kingdoms, in what is now Central Macedonia, and their role in internal Hellenic politics was minimal, even before the rise of Athens. The Macedonians claimed to be Dorian Greeks (Argive Greeks) and there were many [[Ionians]] in the coastal regions. The rest of the region was inhabited by various Thracian and Illyrian tribes as well as mostly coastal colonies of other Greek states such as [[Amphipolis]], Olynthos, Potidea, Stageira and many others, and to the north another tribe dwelt, called the [[Paeonians]]. During the late 6th and early 5th century BC, the region came under Persian rule until the destruction of Xerxes at [[Plataea]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], Macedonia became the theatre of many military actions by the [[Peloponnesian League]] and the Athenians, and saw incursions of Thracians and Illyrians, as attested by Thucydides. Many Macedonian cities were allied to the Spartans (both the Spartans and the Macedonians were Dorian, while the Athenians were Ionian), but Athens maintained the colony of Amphipolis under her control for many years. The kingdom of [[Macedon]], was reorganized by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] and achieved the union of Greek states by forming the [[League of Corinth]]. After his assassination, his son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] succeeded to the throne of Macedon and carrying the title of [[Hegemon]] of [[League of Corinth]] started his [[Wars of Alexander the Great|long campaign]] towards the east.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also|Macedonian Wars|Macedonia (Roman province)}}\n[[File:\u0391\u03a8\u0399\u0394\u0391 \u0393\u0391\u039b\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u039f\u03a5 2.jpg|thumb|View of the Roman-era [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Arch of Galerius]] in Thessaloniki, capital of Roman Macedonia]]\n\nMacedonia remained an important and powerful kingdom until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (June 22, 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia. For a brief period a Macedonian republic called the \"Koinon of the Macedonians\" was established. It was divided into four administrative districts by the Romans in the hope that this would make revolts more difficult, but this manoeuvre failed.

Therefore ancient Macedonia did not significantly extend beyond its current borders (in Greece).

The passage reports that Paul and his companions responded immediately to the invitation.\n\nSubsequently the provinces of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] as well as other regions to the north were incorporated into a new Provincia Macedonia, but in 297 AD under a [[Diocletian]]ic reform many of these regions were removed and two new provinces were created: Macedonia Prima and Macedonia Salutaris (from 479 to 482 AD Macedonia Secunda). Macedonia Prima coincided approximately with Strabo's definition of Macedonia and with the modern administrative district of Greece<ref name=\"Moutsopoulos\" /> and had [[Thessalonica|Thessaloniki]] as its capital, while Macedonia Salutaris had the [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonian]] city of [[Stobi]] (near [[Gradsko, North Macedonia|Gradsko]]) as its capital. This subdivision is mentioned in [[Hierocles of Alexandria|Hierocles]]' Synecdemon (527\u2013528) and remained through the reign of emperor [[Justinian]].\n\nThe [[Slav]]ic, [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] invasions in the 6\u20137th centuries devastated both provinces<ref>{{cite book |first=John Julius |last=Norwich |title=A short history of Byzantium |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 }}</ref> with only parts of Macedonia Prima in the coastal areas and nearer [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] remaining in [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] hands, while most of the hinterland was disputed between the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantium]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The Macedonian regions under Byzantine control passed under the [[tourma]] of Macedonia to the province of [[Thrace]].\n\nA new system of administration came into place in 789\u2013802 AD, following the [[Byzantine empire]]'s recovery from these invasions.

Following the campaigns of [[Basil II]], all of Macedonia returned to the Byzantine state. Following the [[Fourth Crusade]] 1203&ndash;1204, a short-lived [[Crusader states|Crusader]] realm, the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], was established in the region. It was subdued by the co-founder of the Greek [[Despotate of Epirus]], [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] in 1224, when Greek Macedonia and the city of [[Thessaloniki]] were at the heart of the short-lived [[Empire of Thessalonica]]. Returning to the restored [[Byzantine Empire]] shortly thereafter, Greek Macedonia remained in Byzantine hands until the 1340s, when all of Macedonia (except Thessaloniki, and possibly [[Veria]]) was conquered by the Serbian ruler [[Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia|Stefan Du\u0161an]].<ref>Fine, ''The Late Medieval Balkans'', 301&ndash;302</ref> Divided between Serbia and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] after Du\u0161an's death, the region fell quickly to the advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], with Thessaloniki alone holding out until 1387.

The memory of the event has survived through folk traditions containing fact and myths. Apostolos Vacalopoulos records the following Turkish tradition connected with the capture of Thessaloniki:<ref>Vacalopoulos, ''History of Macedonia 1354&ndash;1833'', [http://www.promacedonia.org/en/av/av_3_4.htm 97]</ref>\n{{quote|\"While [[Murad II|Murad]] was asleep in his palace at Yenitsa, the story has it that, God appeared to him in a dream and gave him a lovely rose to smell, full of perfume. The sultan was so amazed by its beauty that he begged God to give it to him. God replied, \"This rose, Murad, is Thessalonica. Know that it is to you granted by heaven to enjoy it. Do not waste time; go and take it\". Complying with this exhortation from, Murad marched against Thessalonica and, as it has been written, captured it.\"}}\n\n[[Thessaloniki]] became a centre of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration in the Balkans. While most of Macedonia was ruled by the Ottomans, in [[Mount Athos]] the monastic community continued to exist in a state of autonomy. The remainder of the [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula also enjoyed an autonomous status: the \"Koinon of Mademochoria\" was governed by a locally appointed council due to privileges obtained on account of its wealth, coming from the gold and silver mines in the area.\n\nThere were several uprisings in Macedonia during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], including an uprising after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] that ended in massacres of the Greek population, the uprising in [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] of the armatolos [[Zisis Karademos]] in 1705, a rebellion in the area of [[Grevena]] by a [[Klepht]] called Ziakas (1730\u20131810) and the Greek Declaration of Independence in Macedonia by [[Emmanouel Pappas|Emmanuel Pappas]] in 1821, during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. In 1854 [[Theodoros Ziakas]], the son of the klepht Ziakas, together with [[Dimitrios Karatasos]], who had been among  the captains at the siege of [[Naousa, Imathia|Naousa]] in 1821, led another uprising in Western Macedonia that has been profusely commemorated in Greek folk song.\n\n===Modern history===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence|Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Balkan Wars|Macedonian Front|Movement of National Defence}}\n[[File:1st Battalion of the National Defence army marches for the front.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|The 1st Battalion of the [[Provisional Government of National Defence|National Defence]] marches on its way to the Front, during WWI.]]\n\nGreece gained the southern parts of the region with Thessaloniki from the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the [[First Balkan War]], and expanded its share in the [[Second Balkan War]] against Bulgaria. The boundaries of Greek Macedonia were finalized in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In [[World War I]], Macedonia became a battlefield. The Greek Prime Minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], favoured entering the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], while the Germanophile King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]] favored neutrality. Invited by Venizelos, in autumn 1915, the Allies landed forces in Thessaloniki to aid [[Serbia]] in [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|its war]] against Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, but their intervention came too late to prevent the Serbian collapse. The [[Macedonian front]] was established, with Thessaloniki at its heart, while in summer 1916 the Bulgarians [[Struma operation|took over]] Greek eastern Macedonia without opposition. This provoked a military uprising among pro-Venizelist officers in Thessaloniki, resulting in the establishment of a \"[[Provisional Government of National Defence]]\" in the city, headed by Venizelos, which entered the war alongside the Allies. After intense diplomatic negotiations and an [[Noemvriana|armed confrontation]] in Athens between Entente and royalist forces the King abdicated, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens in June 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies.\n\nIn [[World War II]] Macedonia was [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupied by the Axis]] (1941\u201344), with Germany taking western and central Macedonia with Thessaloniki and Bulgaria occupying and annexing eastern Macedonia.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Slavic peasants identified themselves based on belonging to their family, village, or local region, or as \"[[Rum Millet]]\", i.e. members of the Greek-dominated community of Orthodox Christians. The Slavs of Macedonia generally referred to themselves and were known as \"Bulgarians\", but the word \"Bulgarian\" invoked the idea of a poor, Slav-speaking peasant.  By the middle of the 19th century, peasant communities of Macedonia experienced the formation of deep divisions with [[rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]]. From then, the [[Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia|Slavic speaking communities of northern Greece]] split into two hostile and opposed groups with two different national identities - Greek and Bulgarian.<ref>Gounaris, Basil G. (1995). \"Social Cleavages and National \"Awakening\" in Ottoman Macedonia\". East European Quarterly. 29 (4): 409\u2013426.</ref> By the Second World War and following the defeat of Bulgaria, another further split between the Slavic groups occurred. Conservatives departed with the occupying Bulgarian Army to Bulgaria. Leftists who identified as Macedonians (Slavic), joined the communist-dominated rebel [[Democratic Army of Greece]]. At the conclusion of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349), most Macedonians of Slavic background were evacuated by the [[Greek Communist Party]] and forced to flee to the [[Socialist Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref>cite web|https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415|cite-title=Macedonian Refugee Children: Exodus Anniversary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/2019*/https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/North-Macedonia/Macedonian-Refugee-Children-Exodus-Anniversary-42415</ref> Some also immigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].<ref>Panayiotis Diamadis et al.
