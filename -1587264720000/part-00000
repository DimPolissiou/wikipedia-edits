SPURA covers five vacant plots of land acquired as part of a 1965 urban renewal plan, near Delancey and [[Grand Street (Manhattan)|Grand Street]]s. These sites were originally part of the broader [[Seward Park (Manhattan)|Seward Park]] Urban Renewal Area, a federal program designed to tear down several [[tenement]]s to develop [[social housing|low-income housing]], called the [[Cooperative Village]].

However, political corruption abounded, and the new apartments were never built.<ref name=\"nytimes march 2014\"/> The competing forces within the neighborhood had been debating whether the SPURA area should be used to develop [[affordable housing]] within [[Manhattan Community Board 3]]; or be developed as mixed-use \u2013 low- and middle-income as well as commercial; or whether it should be all large commercial retail use.

His report on [[slavery in Mauritania]] has been widely cited. The ''John Mercer Human Rights Trust'', set up after his death, commemorates this strand of his life.  <br>\n\nMercer's first books were for young people, ''Lizard Island Expedition'' and ''The Cormorant and the Stranger'', drawing on his own experiences in the Balearics. He wrote a illustrated guidebook to the islands of [[Colonsay]], [[Gigha]] and [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]]  and several books on the [[Canary Islands]]. An independent thinker  with eclectic interests, he also wrote about, amongst other topics, hand-spinning, communes, and [[Scottish devolution]]. <br>\n\nHe was a Fellow of the Institute of Linguists, of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, and of  the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. <br>\n\nJohn Mercer died from motor neurone disease at Lealt at the age of 48.\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n''Lizard Island Expedition'', Oliver and Boyd, 1965.<br>\n''The Cormorant and the Stranger'', Deutsch, 1971 <br>\n''Canary Islands: Fuerteventura'', David & Charles, 1973.<br>\n''Hebridean Islands: Colonsay, Gigha, Jura'', Blackie, 1974.<br>\n''Spanish Sahara'', Allen & Unwin, 1976<br>\n''The Spinner's Workshop'', Prism Press, 1978<br>\n''Scotland: the Devolution of Power'', Platform Books, Calder, 1978 <br>\n''The Sahwaris of Western Sahara'', Minority Rights Group, 1979 <br>\n''The Canary Islanders: their prehistory, conquest, and survival'', Collings, 1980.<br>\n''Slavery in Mauritania Today'', Anti-Slavery Society, 1981, and also Edinburgh Human Rights Group 1982 <br>\n''Communes: a Social History and Guide'', Prism, 1984\n===Academic papers===\n*\"Stone tools from a washing-limit deposit of the highest postglacial transgression, Lealt Bay, Isle of Jura\", ''Proceedings of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] (Proc Soc Antiq Scot)'', 100 (1967\u20138), 1\u201346.\n* \"Flint tools from the present tidal zone, Lussa Bay, Isle of Jura, Argyll\", ''Proc Soc Antiq Scot'', 102, (1969\u201370), 1\u201330.\n* \"A regression-time stone-workers' camp, 33&nbsp;ft OD, Lussa River, Isle of Jura\", ''Proc Soc Antiq Scot'', 103 (1970-1), 1\u201332.\n* \"Roomed and Roomless Grain-Drying Kilns: the Hebridean Boundary?\", ''Transactions of the [[Ancient Monuments Society]] (Trans Ancient Mon Soc)'', New Series, 19 (1972), 27\u201336.\n* \"Microlithic and Bronze Age camps, 75\u201326&nbsp;ft OD, N Cam, Isle of  Jura\", ''Proc Soc Antiq Scot'', 104 (1971\u20132), 1\u201322.\n* \"Glenbatrick Waterhole, a microlithic site on the Isle of Jura\", ''Proc Soc Antiq Scot'', 105 (1972-4), 9\u201332.\n* \"Lussa Wood I: the late-glacial and early post-glacial occupation of Jura\", ''Proc Soc Antiq Scot'', 110 (1979\u201380), 1\u201331.\n* (with S.

The mount lies right in front of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. Monte Pellegrino's cliff was described in the 19th century by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], as \"the most beautiful promontory in the world\", in his essay \"[[Italian Journey]]\".\n\n===Rivers===\nToday both the [[Papireto]] river and the [[cemonia|Kemonia]] are covered up by buildings. However, the shape of the former watercourses can still be recognised today, because the streets that were built on them follow their shapes. Today the only waterway not drained yet is the Oreto river that divides the downtown of the city from the western uptown and the industrial districts. In the basins there were, though, many seasonal torrents that helped formed swampy plains, reclaimed during history; a good example of which can be found in the borough of [[Mondello]].\n{{wide image|Palermo panorama monte pellegrino.JPG|1000px|View of Palermo from Monte Pellegrino}}\n\n===Districts===\n{{See also|Mayor of Palermo|Boroughs of Palermo}}\n[[File:Quarters of Palermo.png|{{largethumb}}|Quarters of Palermo]]\n\n{| style=\"width:60%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Municipality\n! style=\"width:50%;\"| Quarters\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||I|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kalsa]], Albergheria, Seralcadio & La Loggia\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|II|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Settecannoli, [[Brancaccio]] & [[Ciaculli|Ciaculli-Oreto]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||III|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Villagrazia-Falsomiele & Stazione-Oreto\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|IV|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Montegrappa, S.

Built at the end of the 15th century for the prefect of the city, Francesco Abatellis. It is a massive though elegant construction, in typical [[Gothic architecture|Catalan Gothic]] style, with [[Renaissance]] influences. The Gallery houses an Eleonora of Aragon bust by [[Francesco Laurana]] (1471) and the ''Malvagna Triptych'' ({{circa}} 1510), by [[Jan Mabuse|Jan Gossaert]] and the famous ''Annunziata'' by [[Antonello da Messina]].\n*The [[Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas]] is one of the main museums of Italy: it includes numerous remains from [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Carthage|Carthaginian]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] civilisations.

In his ''Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily'', F. Elliot described it as \"...&nbsp;totally oriental... it would fit well in [[Baghdad]] or [[Damascus]]\". The bell tower is an example of Norman architecture.\n*[[Martorana|Chiesa della Martorana]]: Also known as ''Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio'' (''St Mary of the Admiral''), the church is annexed to the next-door church of [[San Cataldo, Palermo|San Cataldo]] and overlooks the Piazza Bellini in central Palermo. The original layout was a compact [[cross-in-square]] (\"Greek cross plan\"), a common south Italian and Sicilian variant of the middle Byzantine period church style. Three eastern [[apse]]s adjoin directly to the [[Shrine|naos]], instead of being separated by an additional bay, as was usual in eastern Byzantine architecture.<ref>Kitzinger, ''Mosaics'', 29\u201330.</ref> The bell tower, lavishly decorated, still serves as the main entrance to the church.

It has a single, airy nave, with [[stucco]] decorations from the early 18th century.\n*[[Santa Maria dello Spasimo]] was built in 1506 and later turned into a hospital. This church inspired [[Raphael]] to paint his famous ''[[Christ Falling on the Way to Calvary (Raphael)|Sicilia's Spasimo]]'', now in the [[Museo del Prado]]. The church today is a fascinating open-air auditorium, which occasionally houses exhibitions and musical shows.\n*Church of the Gesu (''Church of Jesus''): Located in the city centre, the church was built in 1564 in the late-Renaissance style by the Jesuits. It was built over a pre-existing convent of [[Basilian monk]]s. Alterations in 1591 were completed in a Sicilian Baroque. The church was heavily damaged after the 1943 bombings, which destroyed most of the [[fresco]]s. The interior has a [[Christian cross|Latin cross]] plan with a nave and two aisles, and has a particularly rich decoration of marbles, intarsia and stuccoes, especially in [[Saint Anne|St Anne's]] Chapel. At the right is the Casa Professa, with a 1685 portal and a precious 18th century cloister. The building has been home to the Municipal Library since 1775.\n*[[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco di Assisi]]: this church was built between 1255 and 1277 in what was once the market district of the city, at the site of two pre-existing churches and was largely renovated in the 15th, 16th, 18th and 19th centuries, the last after an [[earthquake]]. After the 1943 bombings, the church was restored to its Medieval appearance, which now includes part of the original building such as part of the right side, the apses and the Gothic portal in the fa\u00e7ade. The interior has a typical Gothic flavour, with a nave and two aisles separated by two rows of cylindrical pilasters. Some of the chapels are in [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]], as well as the late 16th century side portals. The church includes precious sculptures by [[Antonello Gagini|Antonio]], [[Giacomo Gagini]] and [[Francesco Laurana]]. Of note are also statues built by Giacomo Serpotta in 1723.\n*Church of the Magione: Officially known as the church of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. This church was built in the Norman style in 1191 by Matteo d'Ajello, who donated it to the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]].\n\n===Squares and public monuments===\n[[File:Sicilia Palermo1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|Piazza Pretoria.]]\n\n*[[Quattro Canti]] is a small square at the crossing of the ancient main roads (now: Corso [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele]] and Via Maqueda) dividing the town into its quarters (''[[Mandamento (administrative district)|mandamenti]]''). The buildings at the corner have diagonal baroque fa\u00e7ades so the square has an almost octagonal form.\n*[[Piazza Pretoria]] was planned in the 16th century near the Quattro Canti as the site of a fountain by [[Francesco Camilliani]], the Fontana Pretoria. \n*The [[Charles V Monument (Palermo)|monument to Charles V]] on Piazza Bologni, erected in 1631. \n\n===City walls===\n[[File:Palermo palazzo normanni.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo dei Normanni]]]]\nPalermo has at least two rings of [[city wall]]s, many pieces of which still survive. The first ring surrounded the ancient core of the Phoenician city \u2013 the so-called Palaeopolis (in the area east of Porta Nuova) and the Neapolis. Via Vittorio Emanuele was the main road east\u2013west through this early walled city. The eastern edge of the walled city was on Via Roma and the ancient port in the vicinity of Piazza Marina. The wall circuit was approximately Porto Nuovo, Corso Alberti, Piazza Peranni, Via Isodoro, Via Candela, Via Venezia, Via Roma, Piazza Paninni, Via Biscottari, Via Del Bastione, [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] and back to Porto Nuovo.\n\nIn the medieval period the walled city was expanded. Via Vittorio Emanuele continued to be the main road east\u2013west through the walled city. The west gate was still Porta Nuova, the walls continued to Corso Alberti, to Piazza Vittorio Emanuele Orlando where it turned east along Via Volturno to Piazza Verdi and along the line of Via Cavour. At this northeast corner there was a defence, [[Castello a Mare]], to protect the port at La Cala. A huge chain was used to block La Cala with the other end at [[Santa Maria della Catena, Palermo|Santa Maria della Catena]] (St Mary of the Chain). The sea-side wall was along the western side of Foro Italico Umberto. The wall turns west along the northern side of Via Abramo Lincoln, continues along Corso Tukory. The wall turns north approximately on Via Benedetto, to [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] and back to Porta Nuova.<ref>Palermo - City Guide by Adriana Chirco, 1998, Dario Flaccovio Editore.</ref>\n\nSeveral gates in the city wall survive.

It is the biggest in Italy ({{convert|8000|m2|sqft|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), and one of the largest of Europe (the third after the [[Paris Opera]] and the [[Vienna State Opera]]), renowned for its perfect acoustics. [[Enrico Caruso]] sang in a performance of ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'' during the opening season, returning for ''[[Rigoletto]]'' at the very end of his career. Closed for renovation from 1974 until 1997, it is now restored and has an active schedule.\n*The [[Teatro Politeama, Palermo|Teatro Politeama]] was built between 1867 and 1874.\n\n===Other sights===\n[[File:Orto botanico Palermo 04.jpg|thumb|[[Orto botanico di Palermo|Palermo Botanical Garden]]: the Winter Garden greenhouses.]]\n\nThe cathedral has a [[heliometer]] (solar observatory) dating to 1690, one of a number<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite web |url=http://cis.alma.unibo.it/NewsLetter/090496Nw/Heilbron.htm |title=A paper from University of Bologna describing Heliometers in Italian Cathedrals |publisher=Cis.alma.unibo.it |date=1995-12-06 |accessdate=2011-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413205139/http://cis.alma.unibo.it/NewsLetter/090496Nw/Heilbron.htm |archivedate=2011-04-13 }}</ref> built in Italy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as [[pinhole camera]], projecting an image of the sun onto the floor at [[noon|solar noon]] (12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer). There is a bronze line, ''[[Meridian (astronomy)|la Meridiana]]'', on the floor, running precisely north\u2013south. The ends of the line mark the positions as at the summer and winter [[solstice]]s; [[zodiac|signs of the zodiac]] show the various other dates throughout the year.\n\nThe purpose of the instrument was to standardise the measurement of [[time in physics|time]] and the [[Gregorian calendar|calendar]]. The convention in Sicily had been that the (24\u2011hour) day was measured from the moment of dawn, which of course meant that no two locations had the same time and, more importantly, did not have the same time as in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]]. It was also important to know when the [[Equinox|vernal equinox]] occurred, to provide the correct date for [[Easter]].\n\nThe [[Orto botanico di Palermo]] (Palermo Botanical Garden), founded in 1785, is the largest in Italy with a surface of {{convert|10|ha}}.\n\nOne site of interest is the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] [[Capuchin catacombs of Palermo|Catacombs]], with many [[mummy|mummified]] [[Cadaver|corpse]]s in varying degrees of preservation.\n\nClose to the city is the {{convert|600|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Monte Pellegrino]], offering a panorama of the city, its surrounding mountains and the sea.\n\nAnother good panoramic viewpoint is the promontory of Monte Gallo ({{convert|586|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), near Mondello Beach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siciliaincammino.it/promontori-sul-mare-ascesa-monte-gallo-da-partanna-mondellopalermo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231619/http://www.siciliaincammino.it/promontori-sul-mare-ascesa-monte-gallo-da-partanna-mondellopalermo |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nMoreton Bay fig of >30 m girth and of 32m height can be found on the Piazza Marina.

However, the remains of the Phoenician presence in the city are few and mostly preserved in the very populated center of the downtown area, making any excavation efforts costly and logistically difficult. The site chosen by the Phoenicians made it easy to connect the port to the mountains with a straight road that today has become Corso Calatifimi. This road helped the Phoenicians in trading with the populations that lived beyond the mountains that surround the gulf.\n\nThe first settlement is known as ''Paleapolis'' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}}), meaning \"Old City\", in order to distinguish it from a second settlement built during the 5th century BC, called ''Neapolis'' ({{lang|grc|\u039d\u03b5\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}}) or \"New City\". Neapolis was erected towards the east and along with it, monumental walls around the whole settlement were built to prevent attacks from foreign threats. Some part of this structure can still be seen in the Cassaro district. This district was named after the walls themselves; the word Cassaro deriving from the Arab ''al-qa\u1e63r'' (castle, stronghold, see also [[alc\u00e1zar]]). Along the walls there were few doors to access and exit the city, suggesting that trade even toward the inner part of the island occurred frequently. Moreover, according to some studies, it may be possible that there were some walls that divided the old city from the new one too. The colony developed around a central street ([[decumanus maximus|decumanus]]), cut perpendicularly by minor streets. This street today has become Corso Vittorio Emanuele.\n\n[[Carthage]] was Palermo's major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period. Palermo came into contact with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the [[Sicilian Wars]], a conflict fought between the Greeks of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and the Phoenicians of Carthage for control over the island of Sicily. During this war the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] named the settlement '''P\u00e1normos''' ({{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}), meaning \"all port\" due to its large anchorage, from which the present name of the city developed.

Palermo was also under [[Savoy]] control between 1713 and 1717 and 1718\u20131720 as a result of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. It was ruled by [[Austria]] between 1720 and 1734.\n\n===Two Sicilies===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), Sicily was handed over to the [[House of Savoy]], but by 1734 it was in [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] possession.

A parliament and constitution were proclaimed. The first president was [[Ruggero Settimo]]. The Bourbons reconquered Palermo in 1849, and remained under their rule until the time of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].

These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the [[Art Nouveau]] style. Many of these were designed by the architect [[Ernesto Basile]].

The term is used to indicate the speculative building practices that have filled the city with poor buildings, mainly during the 1950s to the 1980s. The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size, leading to rapid expansion towards the north. The regulatory plans for expansion was largely ignored in the boom.

The Festino is a procession which goes through the main street of Palermo to commemorate the miracle attributed to Saint Rosalia who, it is believed, freed the city from the [[Black Death]] in 1624. Her remains were discovered in a cave on Monte Pellegrino, and her remains were carried around the city three times, banishing the plague. There is a [[sanctuary]] marking the spot where her remains were found which can be reached via a scenic bus ride from the city.\n\nBefore 1624 Palermo had four [[patron saint]]s, one for each of the four major parts of the city. They were [[Agatha of Sicily|Saint Agatha]], [[Saint Christina of Bolsena|Saint Christina]], [[Tryphon, Respicius, and Nympha|Saint Nympha]] and [[Saint Olivia]].\n\n[[Saint Lucy]] is also honoured with a peculiar celebration, during which the inhabitants of Palermo do not eat anything made with flour, but boil wheat in its natural state and use it to prepare a special dish called [[cucc\u00eca]]. This commemorates the saving of the city from famine due to a miracle attributed to Saint Lucy; A ship full of grain mysteriously arrived in the city's harbour and the hungry population wasted no time in making flour but ate the grain as it arrived.\n\n[[Saint Benedict the Moor]] is the heavenly protector of the city of Palermo.\n\nThe ancient patron of the city was the [[Genius of Palermo]], [[genius loci]] and [[numen]] protector of the place, that became the [[layperson|laic]] patron of the modern Palermo.<ref>{{in lang|it}} Alberto Samon\u00e0.

PALERMO - Monte Pellegrino.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Pellegrino]] pictured at the end of the 19th century; the mountain is visible from everywhere in the city]]\n\nPalermo is surrounded by mountains, which form a cirque around the city. Some districts of the city are divided by the mountains themselves. Historically, it was relatively difficult to reach the inner part of Sicily from the city because of the mounts. The tallest peak of the range is La Pizzuta, about {{convert|1333|m}} high. However, historically, the most important mount is [[Monte Pellegrino]], which is geographically separated from the rest of the range by a plain. The mount lies right in front of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]. Monte Pellegrino's cliff was described in the 19th century by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], as \"the most beautiful promontory in the world\", in his essay \"[[Italian Journey]]\".\n\n===Rivers===\nToday both the [[Papireto]] river and the [[cemonia|Kemonia]] are covered up by buildings. However, the shape of the former watercourses can still be recognised today, because the streets that were built on them follow their shapes. Today the only waterway not drained yet is the Oreto river that divides the downtown of the city from the western uptown and the industrial districts. In the basins there were, though, many seasonal torrents that helped formed swampy plains, reclaimed during history; a good example of which can be found in the borough of [[Mondello]].\n{{wide image|Palermo panorama monte pellegrino.JPG|1000px|View of Palermo from Monte Pellegrino}}\n\n===Districts===\n{{See also|Mayor of Palermo|Boroughs of Palermo}}\n[[File:Quarters of Palermo.png|{{largethumb}}|Quarters of Palermo]]\n\n{| style=\"width:60%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Municipality\n! style=\"width:50%;\"| Quarters\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||I|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kalsa]], Albergheria, Seralcadio & La Loggia\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|II|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Settecannoli, [[Brancaccio]] & [[Ciaculli|Ciaculli-Oreto]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||III|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Villagrazia-Falsomiele & Stazione-Oreto\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|IV|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|Montegrappa, S.

Built at the end of the 15th century for the prefect of the city, Francesco Abatellis. It is a massive though elegant construction, in typical [[Gothic architecture|Catalan Gothic]] style, with [[Renaissance]] influences. The Gallery houses an Eleonora of Aragon bust by [[Francesco Laurana]] (1471) and the ''Malvagna Triptych'' ({{circa}} 1510), by [[Jan Mabuse|Jan Gossaert]] and the famous ''Annunziata'' by [[Antonello da Messina]].\n*The [[Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas]] is one of the main museums of Italy: it includes numerous remains from [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Carthage|Carthaginian]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] civilisations.

In his ''Diary of an Idle Woman in Sicily'', F. Elliot described it as \"...&nbsp;totally oriental... it would fit well in [[Baghdad]] or [[Damascus]]\". The bell tower is an example of [[Gothic architecture]].\n*[[Martorana|Chiesa della Martorana]]: Also known as ''Santa Maria dell'Ammiraglio'' (''St Mary of the Admiral''), the church is annexed to the next-door church of [[San Cataldo, Palermo|San Cataldo]] and overlooks the Piazza Bellini in central Palermo. The original layout was a compact [[cross-in-square]] (\"Greek cross plan\"), a common south Italian and Sicilian variant of the middle Byzantine period church style. Three eastern [[apse]]s adjoin directly to the [[Shrine|naos]], instead of being separated by an additional bay, as was usual in eastern Byzantine architecture.<ref>Kitzinger, ''Mosaics'', 29\u201330.</ref> The bell tower, lavishly decorated, still serves as the main entrance to the church. The interior decoration is elaborate, and includes Byzantine mosaics.\n*[[San Cataldo, Palermo|San Cataldo]]: Church, on the central Piazza Bellini, which is a good example of [[Norman architecture]]. \n*[[Santa Maria della Gancia, Palermo|Santa Maria della Gancia]]\n*Santa Caterina: This church is located behind Piazza Pretoria and built between 1566 and 1596 in the baroque style.\n*[[Santa Maria della Catena, Palermo|Santa Maria della Catena]]: This church was built between 1490\u20131520.

It has a single, airy nave, with [[stucco]] decorations from the early 18th century.\n*[[Santa Maria dello Spasimo]] was built in 1506 and later turned into a hospital. This church inspired [[Raphael]] to paint his famous ''[[Christ Falling on the Way to Calvary (Raphael)|Sicilia's Spasimo]]'', now in the [[Museo del Prado]]. The church today is a fascinating open-air auditorium, which occasionally houses exhibitions and musical shows.\n*Church of the Gesu (''Church of Jesus''): Located in the city centre, the church was built in 1564 in the late-Renaissance style by the Jesuits. It was built over a pre-existing convent of [[Basilian monk]]s. Alterations in 1591 were completed in a Sicilian Baroque. The church was heavily damaged after the 1943 bombings, which destroyed most of the [[fresco]]s. The interior has a [[Christian cross|Latin cross]] plan with a nave and two aisles, and has a particularly rich decoration of marbles, intarsia and stuccoes, especially in [[Saint Anne|St Anne's]] Chapel. At the right is the Casa Professa, with a 1685 portal and a precious 18th century cloister. The building has been home to the Municipal Library since 1775.\n*[[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, Palermo|San Francesco di Assisi]]: this church was built between 1255 and 1277 in what was once the market district of the city, at the site of two pre-existing churches and was largely renovated in the 15th, 16th, 18th and 19th centuries, the last after an [[earthquake]]. After the 1943 bombings, the church was restored to its Medieval appearance, which now includes part of the original building such as part of the right side, the apses and the Gothic portal in the fa\u00e7ade. The interior has a typical Gothic flavour, with a nave and two aisles separated by two rows of cylindrical pilasters. Some of the chapels are in [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]], as well as the late 16th century side portals. The church includes precious sculptures by [[Antonello Gagini|Antonio]], [[Giacomo Gagini]] and [[Francesco Laurana]]. Of note are also statues built by Giacomo Serpotta in 1723.\n*Church of the Magione: Officially known as the church of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. This church was built in the Norman style in 1191 by Matteo d'Ajello, who donated it to the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]].\n\n===Squares and public monuments===\n[[File:Sicilia Palermo1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|Piazza Pretoria.]]\n\n*[[Quattro Canti]] is a small square at the crossing of the ancient main roads (now: Corso [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele]] and Via Maqueda) dividing the town into its quarters (''[[Mandamento (administrative district)|mandamenti]]''). The buildings at the corner have diagonal baroque fa\u00e7ades so the square has an almost octagonal form.\n*[[Piazza Pretoria]] was planned in the 16th century near the Quattro Canti as the site of a fountain by [[Francesco Camilliani]], the Fontana Pretoria. \n*The [[Charles V Monument (Palermo)|monument to Charles V]] on Piazza Bologni, erected in 1631. \n\n===City walls===\n[[File:Palermo palazzo normanni.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo dei Normanni]]]]\nPalermo has at least two rings of [[city wall]]s, many pieces of which still survive. The first ring surrounded the ancient core of the Phoenician city \u2013 the so-called Palaeopolis (in the area east of Porta Nuova) and the Neapolis. Via Vittorio Emanuele was the main road east\u2013west through this early walled city. The eastern edge of the walled city was on Via Roma and the ancient port in the vicinity of Piazza Marina. The wall circuit was approximately Porto Nuovo, Corso Alberti, Piazza Peranni, Via Isodoro, Via Candela, Via Venezia, Via Roma, Piazza Paninni, Via Biscottari, Via Del Bastione, [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] and back to Porto Nuovo.\n\nIn the medieval period the walled city was expanded. Via Vittorio Emanuele continued to be the main road east\u2013west through the walled city. The west gate was still Porta Nuova, the walls continued to Corso Alberti, to Piazza Vittorio Emanuele Orlando where it turned east along Via Volturno to Piazza Verdi and along the line of Via Cavour. At this northeast corner there was a defence, [[Castello a Mare]], to protect the port at La Cala. A huge chain was used to block La Cala with the other end at [[Santa Maria della Catena, Palermo|Santa Maria della Catena]] (St Mary of the Chain). The sea-side wall was along the western side of Foro Italico Umberto. The wall turns west along the northern side of Via Abramo Lincoln, continues along Corso Tukory. The wall turns north approximately on Via Benedetto, to [[Palazzo dei Normanni]] and back to Porta Nuova.<ref>Palermo - City Guide by Adriana Chirco, 1998, Dario Flaccovio Editore.</ref>\n\nSeveral gates in the city wall survive.

It is the biggest in Italy ({{convert|8000|m2|sqft|abbr=on|disp=comma}}), and one of the largest of Europe (the third after the [[Paris Opera]] and the [[Vienna State Opera]]), renowned for its perfect acoustics. [[Enrico Caruso]] sang in a performance of ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]'' during the opening season, returning for ''[[Rigoletto]]'' at the very end of his career. Closed for renovation from 1974 until 1997, it is now restored and has an active schedule.\n*The [[Teatro Politeama, Palermo|Teatro Politeama]] was built between 1867 and 1874.\n\n===Other sights===\n[[File:Orto botanico Palermo 04.jpg|thumb|[[Orto botanico di Palermo|Palermo Botanical Garden]]: the Winter Garden greenhouses.]]\n\nThe cathedral has a [[heliometer]] (solar observatory) dating to 1690, one of a number<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite web |url=http://cis.alma.unibo.it/NewsLetter/090496Nw/Heilbron.htm |title=A paper from University of Bologna describing Heliometers in Italian Cathedrals |publisher=Cis.alma.unibo.it |date=1995-12-06 |accessdate=2011-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413205139/http://cis.alma.unibo.it/NewsLetter/090496Nw/Heilbron.htm |archivedate=2011-04-13 }}</ref> built in Italy in the 17th and 18th centuries. The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as [[pinhole camera]], projecting an image of the sun onto the floor at [[noon|solar noon]] (12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer). There is a bronze line, ''[[Meridian (astronomy)|la Meridiana]]'', on the floor, running precisely north\u2013south. The ends of the line mark the positions as at the summer and winter [[solstice]]s; [[zodiac|signs of the zodiac]] show the various other dates throughout the year.\n\nThe purpose of the instrument was to standardise the measurement of [[time in physics|time]] and the [[Gregorian calendar|calendar]].

However, the remains of the Phoenician presence in the city are few and mostly preserved in the very populated center of the downtown area, making any excavation efforts costly and logistically difficult. The site chosen by the Phoenicians made it easy to connect the port to the mountains with a straight road that today has become Corso Calatifimi. This road helped the Phoenicians in trading with the populations that lived beyond the mountains that surround the gulf.\n\nThe first settlement is known as ''Paleapolis'' ({{lang-grc-gre|\u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}}), meaning \"Old City\", in order to distinguish it from a second settlement built during the 5th century BC, called ''Neapolis'' ({{lang|grc|\u039d\u03b5\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}}) or \"New City\". Neapolis was erected towards the east and along with it, monumental walls around the whole settlement were built to prevent attacks from foreign threats. Some part of this structure can still be seen in the Cassaro district. This district was named after the walls themselves; the word Cassaro deriving from the Arab ''al-qa\u1e63r'' (castle, stronghold, see also [[alc\u00e1zar]]). Along the walls there were few doors to access and exit the city, suggesting that trade even toward the inner part of the island occurred frequently. Moreover, according to some studies, it may be possible that there were some walls that divided the old city from the new one too. The colony developed around a central street ([[decumanus maximus|decumanus]]), cut perpendicularly by minor streets. This street today has become Corso Vittorio Emanuele.\n\n[[Carthage]] was Palermo's major trading partner under the Phoenicians and the city enjoyed a prolonged peace during this period. Palermo came into contact with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] between the 6th and the 5th centuries BC which preceded the [[Sicilian Wars]], a conflict fought between the Greeks of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] and the Phoenicians of Carthage for control over the island of Sicily. During this war the [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] named the settlement '''P\u00e1normos''' ({{lang|grc|\u03a0\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}), meaning \"all port\" due to its large anchorage, from which the present name of the city developed.

The Italian state effectively has had to share control of the territory, economically and administratively, with the Mafia.\n\nThe so-called \"[[Sack of Palermo]]\" is one of the major visible faces of the problem. The term is used to indicate the speculative building practices that have filled the city with poor buildings, mainly during the 1950s to the 1980s. The reduced importance of agriculture in the Sicilian economy has led to a massive migration to the cities, especially Palermo, which swelled in size, leading to rapid expansion towards the north. The regulatory plans for expansion was largely ignored in the boom. New parts of town appeared almost out of nowhere, but without parks, schools, public buildings, proper roads and the other amenities that characterise a modern city.\n\nThe Cosa Nostra has traditionally been the most powerful group in Palermo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4727672/italy-police-arrest-alleged-new-mafia-boss-in-sicily/|title=Italy police arrest alleged new mafia boss in Sicily|website=Global News}}</ref> A [[CNN]] article in July 2019 indicated that [[Sicilian Mafia]] activity in Palermo was particularly notorious in one area: the town of Passo Rigano. \"According to Italian police, the mafia not only engages in extortion there, but also has a large role in the town's legal economy -- with its involvement in business such as wholesale food supplies, online betting and gambling.\" The police investigation at the time also confirmed strong links between the Palermo area mafia and American organized crime,  particularly the [[Gambino crime family]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/europe/mafia-arrests-fbi-italy-intl/index.html|title=19 mafia suspects arrested in joint transatlantic raids|author1=Hada Messia |author2=Lauren Kent|website=CNN}}</ref> According to [[La Repubblica]], \"Off they go, through the streets of Passo di Rigano, Boccadifalco, Torretta and at the same time, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey.

The Festino is a procession which goes through the main street of Palermo to commemorate the miracle attributed to Saint Rosalia who, it is believed, freed the city from the [[Black Death]] in 1624. Her remains were discovered in a cave on Monte Pellegrino, and her remains were carried around the city three times, banishing the plague. There is a [[sanctuary]] marking the spot where her remains were found which can be reached via a scenic bus ride from the city.\n\nBefore 1624 Palermo had four [[patron saint]]s, one for each of the four major parts of the city. They were [[Agatha of Sicily|Saint Agatha]], [[Saint Christina of Bolsena|Saint Christina]], [[Tryphon, Respicius, and Nympha|Saint Nympha]] and [[Saint Olivia]].\n\n[[Saint Lucy]] is also honoured with a peculiar celebration, during which the inhabitants of Palermo do not eat anything made with flour, but boil wheat in its natural state and use it to prepare a special dish called [[cucc\u00eca]]. This commemorates the saving of the city from famine due to a miracle attributed to Saint Lucy; A ship full of grain mysteriously arrived in the city's harbour and the hungry population wasted no time in making flour but ate the grain as it arrived.\n\n[[Saint Benedict the Moor]] is the heavenly protector of the city of Palermo.\n\nThe ancient patron of the city was the [[Genius of Palermo]], [[genius loci]] and [[numen]] protector of the place, that became the [[layperson|laic]] patron of the modern Palermo.<ref>{{in lang|it}} Alberto Samon\u00e0.
