An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.''\n|-\n|''15''\n|''King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.''\n|-\n|''16''\n|''Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.''\n|-\n|''17''\n|''Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage.

One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.''\n|-\n|18\n|''Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse.

Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.''\n|-\n|20\n|''Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity.'' \n|-\n|21\n|''Vishwamitra reaches Harishchandra court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle.''\n|-\n|22\n|\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.

Almost immediately, it ran into disputes with most of its neighbours. Slovenia was difficult to determine, since it had been an integral part of Austria for 400 years. The Vojvodina region was disputed with Hungary, Macedonia with Bulgaria, [[Fiume]] with Italy.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nA [[Carinthian Plebiscite|plebiscite]] was also held in the [[Carinthia (duchy)|Province of Carinthia]], which opted to remain in [[Austria]]. Austrians had formed a majority in this region although numbers reflected that some Slovenes did vote for Carinthia to become part of Austria. The Dalmatian port city of [[Zadar]] ({{lang-it|Zara}}) and a few of the [[Dalmatia]]n islands were given to Italy. The city of [[Rijeka]] ({{lang-it|Fiume}}) was declared to be the [[Free State of Fiume]], but it was soon occupied, and in 1924 annexed, by Italy, which had also been promised the Dalmatian coast during World War I, and Yugoslavia claiming [[Istria]], a part of the former [[Austrian Littoral]] which had been annexed to Italy, but which contained a considerable population of Croats and Slovenes.\n\nThe formation of the constitution of 1921 sparked tensions between the different Yugoslav nationalities.<ref name=\"Spencer Tucker 2005\"/> Trumbi\u0107 opposed the 1921 constitution and over time grew increasingly hostile towards the Yugoslav government that he saw as being centralized in the favour of Serb hegemony over Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"Spencer Tucker 2005\"/>\n\n==Economy==\n\n=== Farming ===\n[[File:Strojna mlatev p\u0161enice v \u0160marci pri Vavpeti\u010du okoli leta 1930.jpg|thumb|Slovene farmers threshing wheat (1930s)]]\n\nThree-quarters of the Yugoslav workforce was engaged in agriculture. A few commercial farmers existed, but most were subsistence peasants. Those in the south were especially poor, living in a hilly, infertile region. No large estates existed except in the north, and all of those were owned by foreigners. Indeed, one of the first actions undertaken by the new Yugoslav state in 1919 was to break up the estates and dispose of foreign, and in particular [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] landowners. Nearly 40% of the rural population was surplus (i.e., excess people not needed to maintain current production levels), and despite a warm climate, Yugoslavia was also relatively dry. Internal communications were poor, damage from World War I had been extensive, and with few exceptions agriculture was devoid of machinery or other modern farming technologies.\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nManufacturing was limited to [[Belgrade]] and the other major population centers, and consisted mainly of small, comparatively primitive facilities that produced strictly for the domestic market. The commercial potential of Yugoslavia's [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] ports went to waste because the nation lacked the capital or technical knowledge to operate a shipping industry. On the other hand, the mining industry was well developed due to the nation's abundance of mineral resources, but since it was primarily owned and operated by foreigners, most production was exported. Yugoslavia was the third least industrialized nation in Eastern Europe after [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and Albania.\n\n=== Debt ===\n[[File:K\u00f6nigreich der Serben, Kroaten und Slowenen 1921.JPG|thumb|Bond of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes for the liquidation of the agro-debts from Bosnia and Herzegovina, issued 18 June 1921]]\n\nYugoslavia was typical of Eastern European nations in that it borrowed large sums of money from the West during the 1920s. When the [[Great Depression]] began in 1929, the Western lenders called in their debts, which could not be paid back. Some of the money was lost to graft, although most was used by farmers to improve production and export potential. Agricultural exports, however, were always an unstable prospect as their export earnings were heavily reliant on volatile world market prices. The Great Depression caused the market for them to collapse as global demand contracted heavily and the situation for export-oriented farmers further deteriorated when nations everywhere started to erect trade barriers. Italy was a major trading partner of Yugoslavia in the initial years after World War I, but ties fell off after [[Benito Mussolini]] came to power in 1922. In the grim economic situation of the 1930s, Yugoslavia followed the lead of its neighbors in allowing itself to become a dependent of [[Nazi Germany]].\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n {{see also|Ethnic groups in Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Passport of Kingdom of Yugoslavia.jpg|thumb|Passport of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]\nThe small middle class occupied the major population centers and almost everyone else were peasants engaged in subsistence agriculture. The largest ethnic group were Serbs followed by Croats, Slovenes, Bosnian Muslims, Macedonians and Albanians. Religion followed the same pattern with half the population following Orthodox Christianity, around 40 percent being Catholic, and the rest Muslim. In such a polyglot nation, tensions were frequent, but especially between Serbs and Croats. Other quarrels were those between Serbs and Macedonians, as the Yugoslav government had as its official position that the latter were ethnic Serbs. In the early 20th century the international community viewed the Macedonians predominantly as regional variety of Bulgarians, but during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the Allies sanctioned the Serbian control of Vardar Macedonia and its view, that Macedonian Slavs were in fact Southern Serbs.<ref>Nationalism and Territory: Constructing Group Identity in Southeastern Europe, Geographical perspectives on the human past, George W. White, Rowman & Littlefield, 2000, {{ISBN|0847698092}}, p. 236.</ref>\n\nThe predominantly Muslim Bosniaks won some concessions from the government in Belgrade. Albanians fared worse since they did not speak Serbo-Croatian, but all Muslims were the subject of widespread prejudice{{Citation needed|reason=which sources explain that there were widespread prejudices?|date=January 2017}} in Yugoslavia.

Aside from the Romanians, the Yugoslav government awarded no special treatment to them in terms of respect for their language, culture, or political autonomy, not surprising given that all of their native countries had territorial disputes with Yugoslavia. Several thousand Jews lived mostly in major cities; they were well-assimilated and there were no significant problems with anti-Semitism.\n\n=== Education ===\nAlthough Yugoslavia had enacted a compulsory public education policy, it was inaccessible to many peasants in the countryside. Official literacy figures for the population stood at 50%, but it varied widely throughout the country. Less than 10% of Slovenes were illiterate, whereas over 80% of Macedonians and Bosnians could not read or write. Only 10% of initial elementary school students went on to attend higher forms of education, at one of the country's three universities in [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade]], [[University of Ljubljana|Ljubljana]], and [[University of Zagreb|Zagreb]].\n\n==Political history==\n\n===Early politics===\n[[File:NikolaPasic--serbiaherpeopleh00petruoft.png|thumb|upright|Between 1918 and 1926, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] held the position of [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia]] three times.]]\nImmediately after the 1 December proclamation, negotiations between the [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the Serbian government resulted in agreement over the new government which was to be headed by [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]].

Many regarded this rejection as a violation of parliamentary principles, but the matter was resolved when the regent suggested replacing Pa\u0161i\u0107 with [[Stojan Proti\u0107]], a leading member of Pa\u0161i\u0107's Radical Party. The National Council and the Serbian government agreed and the new government came into existence on 20 December 1918.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=112}}<ref>Gligorijevi\u0107, Branislav (1979) ''Parliament i politi\u010dke stranke u Jugoslaviji 1919\u20131929'' Institut za savremenu istoriju, Narodna knjiga, Belgrade, {{OCLC|6420325}} {{page needed|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn this period before the election of the Constituent Assembly, a [[Provisional Representation]] served as a parliament which was formed by delegates from the various elected bodies that had existed before the creation of the state. A realignment of parties combining several members of the Serbian opposition with political parties from the former Austria\u2013Hungary led to the creation of a new party, The Democratic Party, that dominated the Provisional Representation and the government.\n\nBecause the Democratic Party led by [[Ljubomir Davidovi\u0107]] pushed a highly centralized agenda a number of Croatian delegates moved into opposition. However, the radicals themselves were not happy that they had only three ministers to the Democratic Party's 11 and, on 16 August 1919, Proti\u0107 handed in his resignation. Davidovi\u0107 then formed a coalition with the Social Democrats. This government had a majority, but the quorum of the Provisional Representation was half plus one vote. The opposition then began to boycott the parliament. As the government could never guarantee that all of its supporters would turn up, it became impossible to hold a quorate meeting of the parliament. Davidovi\u0107 soon resigned, but as no one else could form a government he again became prime minister. As the opposition continued their boycott, the government decided it had no alternative but to rule by decree. This was denounced by the opposition who began to style themselves as the Parliamentary Community. Davidovi\u0107 realized that the situation was untenable and asked the King to hold immediate elections for the Constituent Assembly. When the King refused, he felt he had no alternative but to resign.\n\nThe Parliamentary Community now formed a government led by Stojan Proti\u0107 committed to the restoration of parliamentary norms and mitigating the centralization of the previous government. Their opposition to the former governments program of radical land reform also united them. As several small groups and individuals switched sides, Proti\u0107 now even had a small majority. However, the Democratic Party and the Social Democrats now boycotted parliament and Proti\u0107 was unable to muster a quorum. Hence the Parliamentary Community, now in government, was forced to rule by decree.\n\nFor the Parliamentary Community to thus violate the basic principle around which they had formed put them in an extremely difficult position. In April 1920, widespread worker unrest and a railway strike broke out. According to Gligorijevi\u0107, this put pressure on the two main parties to settle their differences. After successful negotiations, Proti\u0107 resigned to make way for a new government led by the neutral figure of Milenko Vesni\u0107. The Social Democrats did not follow the Democratic Party, their former allies, into government because they were opposed to the anti-communist measures to which the new government was committed.\n\nThe controversies that had divided the parties earlier were still very much live issues. The Democratic Party continued to push its agenda of centralization and still insisted on the need for radical land reform. A disagreement over electoral law finally led the Democratic Party to vote against the government in Parliament and the government was defeated. Though this meeting had not been quorate, Vesni\u0107 used this as a pretext to resign. His resignation had the intended effect: the Radical Party agreed to accept the need for centralization, and the Democratic Party agreed to drop its insistence on land reform. Vesni\u0107 again headed the new government. The Croatian Community and the Slovenian People's Party were however not happy with the Radicals' acceptance of centralization. Neither was Stojan Proti\u0107, and he withdrew from the government on this issue.\n\nIn September 1920 a peasant revolt broke out in Croatia, the immediate cause of which was the branding of the peasants' cattle. The Croatian community blamed the centralizing policies of the government and of minister [[Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107]] in particular.\n\n===Constituent assembly to dictatorship===\n[[File:Scs kingdom provinces 1920 1922 en.png|thumb|right|200px|Provinces of the Kingdom in 1920\u20131922]]\n[[File:Scs kingdom oblasts 1922 1929 en.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]]]\nOne of the few laws successfully passed by the Provisional Representation was the electoral law for the constituent assembly. During the negotiations that preceded the foundation of the new state, it had been agreed that voting would be secret and based on universal suffrage. It had not occurred to them that universal might include women until the beginning of a movement for women's suffrage appeared with the creation of the new state. The Social Democrats and the Slovenian People's Party supported women's suffrage but the Radicals opposed it. The Democratic Party was open to the idea but not committed enough to make an issue of it so the proposal fell. Proportional Representation was accepted in principle but the system chosen ([[d'Hondt method|d'Hondt]] with very small constituencies) favored large parties and parties with strong regional support.\n\nThe election was held on 28 November 1920. When the votes were counted the Democratic Party had won the most seats, more than the Radicals \u2013 but only just. For a party that had been so dominant in the Provisional Representation, that amounted to a defeat. Further it had done rather badly in all former Austria-Hungarian areas. That undercut the party's belief that its centralization policy represented the will of the Yugoslavian people as a whole. The Radicals had done no better in that region but this presented them far less of a problem because they had campaigned openly as a Serbian party. The most dramatic gains had been made by the two anti-system parties. The [[Croatian Peasant Party|Croatian Republican Peasant Party's]] leadership had been released from prison only as the election campaign began to get underway. According to Gligorijevi\u0107, this had helped them more than active campaigning. The Croatian community (that had in a timid way tried to express the discontent that Croatian Republican Peasant Party mobilized) had been too tainted by their participation in government and was all but eliminated. The other gainers were the communists who had done especially well in the wider [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] region. The remainder of the seats were taken up by smaller parties that were at best skeptical of the centralizing platform of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe results left Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 in a very strong position as the Democrats had no choice but to ally with the Radicals if they wanted to get their concept of a centralized Yugoslavia through. Pa\u0161i\u0107 was always careful to keep open the option of a deal with the Croatian opposition. The Democrats and the Radicals were not quite strong enough to get the constitution through on their own and they made an alliance with the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (JMO). The Muslim party sought and got concessions over the preservation of Bosnia in its borders and how the land reform would affect Muslim landowners in Bosnia.\n\nThe Croatian Republican Peasant Party refused to swear allegiance to the King on the grounds that this presumed that Yugoslavia would be a monarchy, something that it contended only the Constituent Assembly could decide. The party was unable to take its seats. Most of the opposition though initially taking their seats declared boycotts as time went so that there were few votes against. However, the constitution decided against 1918 agreement between the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], which stated that a 66% majority that 50% plus one vote would be needed to pass, irrespective of how many voted against. Only last minute concessions to [[D\u017eemijet]], a group of Muslims from [[Vardar Macedonia|Macedonia]] and Kosovo, saved it.\n\n[[File:Ustav21.png|thumb|upright|The [[Vidovdan Constitution]]]]\nOn 28 June 1921, the [[Vidovdan]] (St [[Vitus]]'s Day) Constitution was passed, establishing a [[unitary state|unitary]] monarchy. The pre\u2013World War I traditional regions were abolished and 33 new administrative ''[[Oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|oblasts]]'' (provinces) ruled from the center were instituted. During this time, King Peter I died (16 August 1921), and the prince-regent succeeded to the throne as King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]].\n\nLjubomir Davidovi\u0107 of the Democrats began to have doubts about the wisdom of his party's commitment to centralization and opened up negotiations with the opposition. This threatened to provoke a split in his party as his action was opposed Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107. It also gave Pa\u0161i\u0107 a pretext to end the coalition. At first the King gave Pa\u0161i\u0107 a mandate to form a coalition with Pribi\u0107evi\u0107's Democrats. However, Pa\u0161i\u0107 offered Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 too little for there to be much chance that Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 would agree. A purely Radical government was formed with a mandate to hold elections. The Radicals made gains at the expense of the Democrats but elsewhere there were gains by Radi\u0107's Peasant's Party.\n\nSerb politicians around Radic regarded Serbia as the standard bearer of Yugoslav unity, as the state of [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] had been for Italy, or [[Prussia]] for the [[German Empire]]; a kind of \"[[Greater Serbia]]\". Over the following years, Croatian resistance against a Serbo-centric policy increased.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Yugoslav government of prime minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846181,00.html |title = Yugoslavia: Balkan Politics|work = [[Time Magazine]]|date= 31 March 1923|url-access = subscription}}</ref> and other measure to [[rigged election|rig elections]].

In this they mobilised nationalist opposition in Serbia but provoked a violent reaction from the governing majority including death threats. On 20 June 1928, a member of the government majority, the Serb deputy [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]], shot five members of the Croatian Peasant Party, including their leader Stjepan Radi\u0107, after Radi\u0107 refused to apologize for earlier offense in which he accused Ra\u010di\u0107 of stealing from civilian population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=John Paul|date=2017|title=War Veterans, Fascism, and Para-Fascist Departures in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, 1918\u20131941|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318166421_War_Veterans_Fascism_and_Para-Fascist_Departures_in_the_Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_1918-1941|journal=FASCISM|volume=6|pages=63|via=}}</ref> Two died on the floor of the Assembly while the life of Radi\u0107 hung in the balance.\n\nThe opposition now completely withdrew from parliament, declaring that they would not return to a parliament in which several of their representatives had been killed, and insisting on new elections. On 1 August, at a meeting in Zagreb, they renounced 1 December Declaration of 1920. They demanded that the negotiations for unification should begin from scratch. On 8 August Stjepan Radi\u0107 died.\n\n===6 January dictatorship===\n {{main|6 January Dictatorship}}\n[[File:Banovine Jugoslavia.png|thumb|200px|In 1929, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was subdivided into [[Banovinas of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|nine banovinas]]. This became eight in 1939, when two were merged to form the [[Banovina of Croatia]].]]\n[[File:Locator map Croatia Banovina in Yugoslavia 1939-1941.svg|thumb|200px|In 1939, the [[Banovina of Croatia]] was founded, aimed at solving the \"[[Croatian question]]\". It was formed from the [[Sava Banovina]] and [[Littoral Banovina]], with small parts ceded from the [[Drina Banovina|Drina]], [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta]], and [[Danube Banovina|Danube]] banovinas.]]\n\nOn 6 January 1929, using as a pretext the political crisis triggered by the shooting, King Alexander abolished the Constitution, prorogued the Parliament and introduced a personal dictatorship (known as the \"January 6 Dictatorship\", ''\u0160estosije\u010danjska diktatura'', ''\u0160estojanuarska diktatura''). He changed the name of the country to \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\", and changed the internal divisions from the 33 oblasts to nine new ''[[banovinas of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]]'' on 3 October. A Court for the Protection of the State was soon established to act as the new regime's tool for putting down any dissent. Opposition politicians [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]] and [[Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107]] were arrested under charges by the court. Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 later went into exile, whereas over the course of the 1930s Ma\u010dek would become the leader of the entire opposition bloc.\n\nImmediately after the dictatorship was proclaimed, Croatian deputy [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] left for exile from the country. The following years Paveli\u0107 worked to establish a revolutionary organization, the [[Usta\u0161e]], allied with the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) against the state.\n\nIn 1931, Alexander decreed [[1931 Yugoslav Constitution|a new Constitution]] which made executive power the gift of the King. Elections were to be by universal male suffrage. The provision for a secret ballot was dropped, and pressure on public employees to vote for the governing party was to be a feature of all elections held under Alexander's constitution. Further, half the upper house was directly appointed by the King, and legislation could become law with the approval of one of the houses alone if also approved by the King.\n\nThat same year, Croatian historian and anti-Yugoslavist intellectual<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=K0VWAgAAQBAJ|title=The Racial Idea in the Independent State of Croatia: Origins and Theory|last=Bartulin|first=Nevenko|year=2013|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|page=124}}</ref> [[Milan \u0160ufflay]] was assassinated in Zagreb.

The government reacted by imprisoning many political opponents including the new Croatian Peasant Party leader Vladko Ma\u010dek. Despite these measures, opposition to the dictatorship continued, with Croats calling for a solution to what was called the \"Croatian question\". In late 1934, the King planned to release Ma\u010dek from prison, introduce democratic reforms, and attempt find common ground between Serbs and Croats.\n\nHowever, on 9 October 1934, the king was assassinated in [[Marseille]], [[France]] by [[Bulgaria]]n Veli\u010dko Kerin (also known by his revolutionary [[nom de guerre|pseudonym]] [[Vlado Chernozemski]]), an activist of IMRO, in a conspiracy with Yugoslav exiles and radical members of banned political parties in cooperation with the Croatian extreme nationalist Usta\u0161e organisation.\n\n===Yugoslav regency===\n{{main|Yugoslav regency}}\nBecause Alexander's eldest son, [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]], was a minor, a regency council of three, specified in Alexander's will, took over the new king's royal powers and duties. The council was dominated by the 11-year-old king's first cousin once removed [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]].\n\nIn the late 1930s, internal tensions continued to increase with Serbs and Croats seeking to establish ethnic federal subdivisions. Serbs wanted [[Vardar Banovina]] (later known within Yugoslavia as Vardar Macedonia), [[Vojvodina]], Montenegro united with the Serb lands, and Croatia wanted Dalmatia and some of Vojvodina. Both sides claimed territory in present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] populated by [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] Muslims. The expansion of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938 gave new momentum to efforts to solve these problems and, in 1939, Prince Paul appointed [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]] as prime minister, with the goal of reaching an agreement with the Croatian opposition. Accordingly, on 26 August 1939, Vladko Ma\u010dek became vice premier of Yugoslavia and an autonomous [[Banovina of Croatia]] was established with its own parliament.\n\nThese changes satisfied neither Serbs who were concerned with the status of the Serb minority in the new Banovina of Croatia and who wanted more of Bosnia and Herzegovina as Serbian territory. The Croatian nationalist Usta\u0161e were also angered by any settlement short of full independence for a [[Greater Croatia]] including all of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n===Downfall===\n{{main|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right |direction=vertical |width=220\n|header=\n|image1=Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1941-43.png|caption1=Occupation and partition of Yugoslavia, 1941\u201343\n|image2=Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1943-44.png|caption2=Occupation and partition of Yugoslavia, 1943\u201344\n}}\n\nFearing an invasion by the [[Axis powers]], Yugoslavia [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|signed the Tripartite Pact]] on 25 March 1941, pledging cooperation with the Axis. Massive anti-Axis demonstrations followed in [[Belgrade]].\n\nOn 27 March, the regime of Prince Paul was overthrown by a [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup d'\u00e9tat]] with British support. The 17-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] was declared to be of age and placed in power. General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] became his Prime Minister. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia withdrew its support for the Axis ''de facto'' without formally renouncing the Tripartite Pact. Although the new rulers opposed [[Nazi Germany]], they also feared that if German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] attacked Yugoslavia, the [[United Kingdom]] was not in any real position to help. Regardless of this, on 6 April 1941, the Axis powers launched the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and quickly conquered it. The royal family, including Prince Paul, escaped abroad and were interned by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[Kenya]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.27mart.com/images/File/the_times.pdf |title=Prince Paul of Yugoslavia exonerated of war crimes |work=[[The Times]] |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom of Yugoslavia was soon divided by the Axis into several entities. [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]], and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] annexed some border areas outright. A [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] was expanded to include most of [[Slovenia]]. Italy added the [[Governorship of Dalmatia]], part of Macedonia and Kosovo, [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Montenegro]], southerly part of Croatia, and more than a third of [[Province of Ljubljana|western Slovenia]] to the [[Italian Empire]]. An expanded [[Croatia]] was recognized by the Axis as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (''[[Independent State of Croatia|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska]]'', NDH). On paper, the NDH was a kingdom and the [[Tomislav II of Croatia, 4th Duke of Aosta|4th Duke of Aosta]] was crowned as [[Tomislav II of Croatia, 4th Duke of Aosta|King Tomislav II of Croatia]]. The [[rump state|rump]] [[Serbia (1941\u20131944)|Serbian territory]] became a military administration of Germany run by military governors and a Serb civil government led by [[Milan Nedi\u0107]]. Nedi\u0107 attempted to gain German recognition of Serbia as a successor state to Yugoslavia and claimed [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]] as Serbia's monarch. Hungary [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|occupied several northern regions]].\n\n===Exile of the king===\n[[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]], who had escaped into exile, was still recognized as King of the whole state of Yugoslavia by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. From 13 May 1941, the largely [[Serbs|Serbian]] \"[[Chetniks|Yugoslav Army of the Fatherland]]\" (''Jugoslovenska vojska u otad\u017ebini'', or JVUO, or [[\u010cetniks]]) resisted the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia. This anti-German and anti-communist [[resistance movement]] was commanded by Royalist General [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]. For a long time, the \u010cetniks were supported by the [[United Kingdom|British]], the [[United States]], and the Yugoslavian royal government in exile of King Peter II.\n\nHowever, over the course of the war, effective power changed to the hands of [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s Communist [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]]. In 1943, Tito proclaimed the creation of the [[Democratic Federative Yugoslavia]] (''Demokratska federativna Jugoslavija''). The Allies gradually recognized Tito's forces as the stronger opposition forces to the German occupation. They began to send most of their aid to Tito's Partisans, rather than to the Royalist [[\u010cetniks]]. On 16 June 1944, the [[Treaty of Vis|Tito\u2013\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement]] was signed which merged the ''de facto'' and the ''de jure'' government of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn early 1945, after the Germans had been driven out, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was formally restored on paper. But real political power was held by Tito's Communist Partisans. On 29 November, King Peter II was deposed (and the monarchy abolished) by Yugoslavia's Communist Constituent Assembly while he was still in exile. On 2 December, the Communist authorities claimed the entire territory as part of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. The new Yugoslavia covered roughly the same territory as the Kingdom had, but it was no longer a unitary monarchy but a federal republic ruled by a Communist Party.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n\n===Pro-Allied government===\nThe Kingdom nourished a close relationship with the [[Allies of World War I]]. This was especially the case between 1920 and 1934 with Yugoslavia's traditional supporters of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]].\n\n====Little Entente====\nFrom 1920, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had formed the ''[[Little Entente]]'' with [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], with the support of [[French Third Republic|France]]. The primary aim of the alliance was to prevent [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] from regaining the territories it had lost after the First World War. The alliance lost its significance in 1937 when Yugoslavia and Romania refused to support Czechoslovakia, then threatened by Germany, in the event of military aggression.\n\n====Balkan alliances====\nIn 1924, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia formed a ''[[Balkan Bloc]]'' with [[Second Hellenic Republic|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Turkey]] that was intent on keeping balance on the [[Balkan peninsula]]. The alliance was formalized and entrenched on 9 February 1934 when it became the \"[[Balkan Entente]]\". In 1934, with the assassination of King Alexander I by [[Vlado Chernozemski]] in [[Marseille]] and the shifting of Yugoslav foreign policy, the alliance crumbled.\n\n====Italian coalition====\nThe [[Kingdom of Italy]] had territorial ambitions against the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Relations between Italy and the kingdom's predecessors, the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] became sour and hostile during World War I, as Italian and Yugoslav politicians were in dispute over the region of [[Dalmatia]] which Italy demanded as part of Italy. These hostile relations were demonstrated on 1 November 1918, when Italian forces sunk the recently captured Austro-Hungarian battleship [[SMS Viribus Unitis]] being used by the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Italy formed a coalition against it with states with similar state designs, heavily influenced by Italy and/or fascism: [[Albanian Republic|Albania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] which lasted from 1924 to 1927.\n\nThe 1927 cooperation with Britain and France made Italy withdraw from its anti-Yugoslav alliance. Italian Fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] accepted the extreme Croatian nationalist [[Ustase]] movement of [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] to reside in Italy and use training grounds in Italy to prepare for war with Yugoslavia. Hungary also permitted such Ustase training camps as well. Mussolini allowed Paveli\u0107 to reside in Rome.\n\n=====Friendship agreement=====\nIn 1927, in response to the growing Italian expansionism, the royal government of Yugoslavia signed an agreement of friendship and cooperation with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]].\n\n===1935\u20131941===\n{{Original research section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:Yugoslavia-Stamp-1939-King Peter II.jpg|thumb|upright|1939 Yugoslav postage stamp featuring King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]]]]\nOfficially, the last words of King Aleksandar had been \"Save Yugoslavia, and the friendship with France\". His successors were well aware of the need to try and do the first, but the second, maintaining close ties with France, was increasingly difficult. There were several reasons for this. By the mid-1930s, France, internally divided, was increasingly unable to play an important role in Eastern Europe and support its allies, many of whom had suffered badly from the economic crisis of that period. By contrast, Germany was increasingly willing to get into barter agreements with the countries of south east Europe. In the process those countries felt it was against their interests to closely follow France. An additional motive to improve relations with Italy and Germany was Italy's support of the Ustase movement. As Ma\u010dek intimated Italy would support Croatian secession from Yugoslavia, First Regent Prince Paul judged closer relations with Italy were inevitable. In an effort to rob the HSS from potential Italian support, a treaty of friendship was signed between the two countries in 1937. This diminished the Ustasa threat somewhat since Mussolini imprisoned some of their leaders and temporarily withdrew financial support. In 1938, Germany, annexing Austria, became a neighbour of Yugoslavia. The feeble reaction of France and Britain, later that year, during the Sudeten Crisis convinced Belgrade that a European war was inevitable and that it would be unwise to support France and Britain. Instead, Yugoslavia tried to stay aloof, this in spite of Paul's personal sympathies for Britain and Serbia's establishment's predilections for France. In the meantime, Germany and Italy tried to exploit Yugoslavia's domestic problems, and so did Ma\u010dek. In the end, the regency agreed to the formation of the ''Banovina hrvatska'' in August 1939. This did not put an end to the pressures from Germany and Italy, and Yugoslavia's strategic position deteriorated by the day. It was increasingly dependent on the German market, about 90% of its exports went to Germany, and in April 1939 Italy invaded and annexed Albania. In October 1940 it attacked Greece, by when France had already been eliminated from the scene, leaving Britain as Yugoslavia's only potential ally \u2013 given that Belgrade had not recognized the Soviet Union. London however wanted to involve Yugoslavia in the war, which it rejected.\n\nFrom late 1940, Hitler wanted Belgrade to unequivocally choose sides. Pressure intensified, culminating in the signing of the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. Two days later, Prince Paul was deposed in a coup d'\u00e9tat and his nephew Peter II was proclaimed of age, but the new government, headed by General Simovi\u0107, assured Germany it would adhere to the Pact. Hitler nonetheless ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia. On 6 April 1941, Belgrade was bombed; on 10 April, the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed; and on 17 April, the weak Yugoslav Army capitulated.\n\n===1941\u20131945===\nAfter the invasion, the Yugoslav royal government went into exile and local Yugoslav forces rose up in resistance to the occupying [[Axis powers]]. Initially the monarchy preferred [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] and his Serb-dominated [[Chetniks|\u010cetnik]] resistance. However, in 1944, the [[Tito\u2013\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement]] recognised the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia as [[Provisional Government of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|a provisional government]], with the status of the monarchy to be decided at a later date. Three regents\u2014[[Sr\u0111an Budisavljevi\u0107]], a Serb; [[Ante Mandi\u0107]], a Croat; and [[Du\u0161an Sernec]], a Slovene\u2014were sworn in at Belgrade on 3 March 1945. They appointed the new government, to be headed by Tito as prime minister and minister of war, with \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 as foreign minister, on 7 March.<ref>Josef Korbel, ''Tito's Communism'' (University of Denver Press, 1951), 22.</ref>\n\nOn 29 November 1945, while still in exile, [[King of Yugoslavia|King]] [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] was deposed by the [[constituent assembly]]. The Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was internationally recognized as Yugoslavia and Peter II became a [[pretender]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Demographics==<!--This section linked from [[Demographics of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

From 1918 to 1922, the kingdom maintained the pre\u2013World War I subdivisions of Yugoslavia's predecessor states. In 1922, the state was divided into thirty-three ''oblasts'' (provinces). In 1929, after the establishment of the [[January 6 Dictatorship]], a new system of nine ''banovinas'' (regions) was implemented by royal decree. In 1939, as an accommodation to Yugoslav [[Croats]] in the [[Cvetkovi\u0107-Ma\u010dek Agreement]], a single [[Banovina of Croatia]] was formed from two of these ''banovinas'' (and from sections of others).\n\n==Sport==\nThe most popular sport in the Kingdom was [[association football]]. The [[Football Association of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Football Association]] was founded in Zagreb in 1919. It was based in Zagreb until the 6 January Dictatorship, when the association was moved to Belgrade. From 1923, a [[Yugoslav First League|national championship]] was held annually. The national team played its first match at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. It also participated in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural]] [[FIFA World Cup]], finishing fourth.\n\nOther popular sports included [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia Water Polo Championship|water polo]], which was dominated nationally by the Croatian side [[VK Jug]].\n\nThe Kingdom participated at the Olympic Games from 1920 until 1936. During this time, the country won eight medals, all in gymnastics and six of these were won by [[Leon \u0160tukelj]], a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] who was the most nominated gymnast of that time.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Finance Ministers of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]\n* [[1923 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes parliamentary election]]\n* [[Republic of Prekmurje]]\n* [[Slovene March (Kingdom of Hungary)]]\n* [[Women in Yugoslavia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Banac|first=Ivo |title=The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC|year=1988|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-9493-1}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Batakovi\u0107|editor-first=Du\u0161an T.|editor-link=Du\u0161an T.

A few commercial farmers existed, but most were subsistence peasants. Those in the south were especially poor, living in a hilly, infertile region. No large estates existed except in the north, and all of those were owned by foreigners. Indeed, one of the first actions undertaken by the new Yugoslav state in 1919 was to break up the estates and dispose of foreign, and in particular [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] landowners. Nearly 40% of the rural population was surplus (i.e., excess people not needed to maintain current production levels), and despite a warm climate, Yugoslavia was also relatively dry. Internal communications were poor, damage from World War I had been extensive, and with few exceptions agriculture was devoid of machinery or other modern farming technologies.\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nManufacturing was limited to [[Belgrade]] and the other major population centers, and consisted mainly of small, comparatively primitive facilities that produced strictly for the domestic market. The commercial potential of Yugoslavia's [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] ports went to waste because the nation lacked the capital or technical knowledge to operate a shipping industry. On the other hand, the mining industry was well developed due to the nation's abundance of mineral resources, but since it was primarily owned and operated by foreigners, most production was exported. Yugoslavia was the third least industrialized nation in Eastern Europe after [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and Albania.\n\n=== Debt ===\n[[File:K\u00f6nigreich der Serben, Kroaten und Slowenen 1921.JPG|thumb|Bond of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes for the liquidation of the agro-debts from Bosnia and Herzegovina, issued 18 June 1921]]\n\nYugoslavia was typical of Eastern European nations in that it borrowed large sums of money from the West during the 1920s. When the [[Great Depression]] began in 1929, the Western lenders called in their debts, which could not be paid back. Some of the money was lost to graft, although most was used by farmers to improve production and export potential. Agricultural exports, however, were always an unstable prospect as their export earnings were heavily reliant on volatile world market prices. The Great Depression caused the market for them to collapse as global demand contracted heavily and the situation for export-oriented farmers further deteriorated when nations everywhere started to erect trade barriers. Italy was a major trading partner of Yugoslavia in the initial years after World War I, but ties fell off after [[Benito Mussolini]] came to power in 1922. In the grim economic situation of the 1930s, Yugoslavia followed the lead of its neighbors in allowing itself to become a dependent of [[Nazi Germany]].\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n {{see also|Ethnic groups in Yugoslavia}}\n[[File:Passport of Kingdom of Yugoslavia.jpg|thumb|Passport of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]\nThe small middle class occupied the major population centers and almost everyone else were peasants engaged in subsistence agriculture. The largest ethnic group were Serbs followed by Croats, Slovenes, Bosnian Muslims, Macedonians and Albanians. Religion followed the same pattern with half the population following Orthodox Christianity, around 40 percent being Catholic, and the rest Muslim. In such a polyglot nation, tensions were frequent, but especially between Serbs and Croats. Other quarrels were those between Serbs and Macedonians, as the Yugoslav government had as its official position that the latter were ethnic Serbs. In the early 20th century the international community viewed the Macedonians predominantly as regional variety of Bulgarians, but during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the Allies sanctioned the Serbian control of Vardar Macedonia and its view, that Macedonian Slavs were in fact Southern Serbs.<ref>Nationalism and Territory: Constructing Group Identity in Southeastern Europe, Geographical perspectives on the human past, George W. White, Rowman & Littlefield, 2000, {{ISBN|0847698092}}, p. 236.</ref>\n\nThe predominantly Muslim Bosniaks won some concessions from the government in Belgrade. Albanians fared worse since they did not speak Serbo-Croatian, but all Muslims were the subject of widespread prejudice{{Citation needed|reason=which sources explain that there were widespread prejudices?|date=January 2017}} in Yugoslavia. Some regions of the country were allowed to exist as enclaves of [[Islamic law]] regarding personal status, which was a concession made to the Muslim population of Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"Schlesinger1988\">{{cite book|author=Rudolf B.

Aside from the Romanians, the Yugoslav government awarded no special treatment to them in terms of respect for their language, culture, or political autonomy, not surprising given that all of their native countries had territorial disputes with Yugoslavia. Several thousand Jews lived mostly in major cities; they were well-assimilated and there were no significant problems with anti-Semitism.\n\n=== Education ===\nAlthough Yugoslavia had enacted a compulsory public education policy, it was inaccessible to many peasants in the countryside. Official literacy figures for the population stood at 50%, but it varied widely throughout the country. Less than 10% of Slovenes were illiterate, whereas over 80% of Macedonians and Bosnians could not read or write. Only 10% of initial elementary school students went on to attend higher forms of education, at one of the country's three universities in [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade]], [[University of Ljubljana|Ljubljana]], and [[University of Zagreb|Zagreb]].\n\n==Political history==\n\n===Early politics===\n[[File:NikolaPasic--serbiaherpeopleh00petruoft.png|thumb|upright|Between 1918 and 1926, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] held the position of [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia]] three times.]]\nImmediately after the 1 December proclamation, negotiations between the [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the Serbian government resulted in agreement over the new government which was to be headed by [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]]. However, when this agreement was submitted to the approval of the regent, Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, it was rejected, producing the new state's first governmental crisis. Many regarded this rejection as a violation of parliamentary principles, but the matter was resolved when the regent suggested replacing Pa\u0161i\u0107 with [[Stojan Proti\u0107]], a leading member of Pa\u0161i\u0107's Radical Party. The National Council and the Serbian government agreed and the new government came into existence on 20 December 1918.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=112}}<ref>Gligorijevi\u0107, Branislav (1979) ''Parliament i politi\u010dke stranke u Jugoslaviji 1919\u20131929'' Institut za savremenu istoriju, Narodna knjiga, Belgrade, {{OCLC|6420325}} {{page needed|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn this period before the election of the Constituent Assembly, a [[Provisional Representation]] served as a parliament which was formed by delegates from the various elected bodies that had existed before the creation of the state. A realignment of parties combining several members of the Serbian opposition with political parties from the former Austria\u2013Hungary led to the creation of a new party, The Democratic Party, that dominated the Provisional Representation and the government.\n\nBecause the Democratic Party led by [[Ljubomir Davidovi\u0107]] pushed a highly centralized agenda a number of Croatian delegates moved into opposition. However, the radicals themselves were not happy that they had only three ministers to the Democratic Party's 11 and, on 16 August 1919, Proti\u0107 handed in his resignation. Davidovi\u0107 then formed a coalition with the Social Democrats. This government had a majority, but the quorum of the Provisional Representation was half plus one vote. The opposition then began to boycott the parliament. As the government could never guarantee that all of its supporters would turn up, it became impossible to hold a quorate meeting of the parliament. Davidovi\u0107 soon resigned, but as no one else could form a government he again became prime minister. As the opposition continued their boycott, the government decided it had no alternative but to rule by decree. This was denounced by the opposition who began to style themselves as the Parliamentary Community. Davidovi\u0107 realized that the situation was untenable and asked the King to hold immediate elections for the Constituent Assembly. When the King refused, he felt he had no alternative but to resign.\n\nThe Parliamentary Community now formed a government led by Stojan Proti\u0107 committed to the restoration of parliamentary norms and mitigating the centralization of the previous government. Their opposition to the former governments program of radical land reform also united them. As several small groups and individuals switched sides, Proti\u0107 now even had a small majority. However, the Democratic Party and the Social Democrats now boycotted parliament and Proti\u0107 was unable to muster a quorum. Hence the Parliamentary Community, now in government, was forced to rule by decree.\n\nFor the Parliamentary Community to thus violate the basic principle around which they had formed put them in an extremely difficult position. In April 1920, widespread worker unrest and a railway strike broke out. According to Gligorijevi\u0107, this put pressure on the two main parties to settle their differences. After successful negotiations, Proti\u0107 resigned to make way for a new government led by the neutral figure of Milenko Vesni\u0107. The Social Democrats did not follow the Democratic Party, their former allies, into government because they were opposed to the anti-communist measures to which the new government was committed.\n\nThe controversies that had divided the parties earlier were still very much live issues. The Democratic Party continued to push its agenda of centralization and still insisted on the need for radical land reform. A disagreement over electoral law finally led the Democratic Party to vote against the government in Parliament and the government was defeated. Though this meeting had not been quorate, Vesni\u0107 used this as a pretext to resign. His resignation had the intended effect: the Radical Party agreed to accept the need for centralization, and the Democratic Party agreed to drop its insistence on land reform. Vesni\u0107 again headed the new government. The Croatian Community and the Slovenian People's Party were however not happy with the Radicals' acceptance of centralization. Neither was Stojan Proti\u0107, and he withdrew from the government on this issue.\n\nIn September 1920 a peasant revolt broke out in Croatia, the immediate cause of which was the branding of the peasants' cattle. The Croatian community blamed the centralizing policies of the government and of minister [[Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107]] in particular.\n\n===Constituent assembly to dictatorship===\n[[File:Scs kingdom provinces 1920 1922 en.png|thumb|right|200px|Provinces of the Kingdom in 1920\u20131922]]\n[[File:Scs kingdom oblasts 1922 1929 en.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]]]\nOne of the few laws successfully passed by the Provisional Representation was the electoral law for the constituent assembly. During the negotiations that preceded the foundation of the new state, it had been agreed that voting would be secret and based on universal suffrage. It had not occurred to them that universal might include women until the beginning of a movement for women's suffrage appeared with the creation of the new state. The Social Democrats and the Slovenian People's Party supported women's suffrage but the Radicals opposed it. The Democratic Party was open to the idea but not committed enough to make an issue of it so the proposal fell. Proportional Representation was accepted in principle but the system chosen ([[d'Hondt method|d'Hondt]] with very small constituencies) favored large parties and parties with strong regional support.\n\nThe election was held on 28 November 1920. When the votes were counted the Democratic Party had won the most seats, more than the Radicals \u2013 but only just. For a party that had been so dominant in the Provisional Representation, that amounted to a defeat. Further it had done rather badly in all former Austria-Hungarian areas. That undercut the party's belief that its centralization policy represented the will of the Yugoslavian people as a whole. The Radicals had done no better in that region but this presented them far less of a problem because they had campaigned openly as a Serbian party. The most dramatic gains had been made by the two anti-system parties. The [[Croatian Peasant Party|Croatian Republican Peasant Party's]] leadership had been released from prison only as the election campaign began to get underway. According to Gligorijevi\u0107, this had helped them more than active campaigning. The Croatian community (that had in a timid way tried to express the discontent that Croatian Republican Peasant Party mobilized) had been too tainted by their participation in government and was all but eliminated. The other gainers were the communists who had done especially well in the wider [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] region. The remainder of the seats were taken up by smaller parties that were at best skeptical of the centralizing platform of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe results left Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 in a very strong position as the Democrats had no choice but to ally with the Radicals if they wanted to get their concept of a centralized Yugoslavia through. Pa\u0161i\u0107 was always careful to keep open the option of a deal with the Croatian opposition. The Democrats and the Radicals were not quite strong enough to get the constitution through on their own and they made an alliance with the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (JMO). The Muslim party sought and got concessions over the preservation of Bosnia in its borders and how the land reform would affect Muslim landowners in Bosnia.\n\nThe Croatian Republican Peasant Party refused to swear allegiance to the King on the grounds that this presumed that Yugoslavia would be a monarchy, something that it contended only the Constituent Assembly could decide. The party was unable to take its seats. Most of the opposition though initially taking their seats declared boycotts as time went so that there were few votes against. However, the constitution decided against 1918 agreement between the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], which stated that a 66% majority that 50% plus one vote would be needed to pass, irrespective of how many voted against. Only last minute concessions to [[D\u017eemijet]], a group of Muslims from [[Vardar Macedonia|Macedonia]] and Kosovo, saved it.\n\n[[File:Ustav21.png|thumb|upright|The [[Vidovdan Constitution]]]]\nOn 28 June 1921, the [[Vidovdan]] (St [[Vitus]]'s Day) Constitution was passed, establishing a [[unitary state|unitary]] monarchy. The pre\u2013World War I traditional regions were abolished and 33 new administrative ''[[Oblasts of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|oblasts]]'' (provinces) ruled from the center were instituted. During this time, King Peter I died (16 August 1921), and the prince-regent succeeded to the throne as King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]].\n\nLjubomir Davidovi\u0107 of the Democrats began to have doubts about the wisdom of his party's commitment to centralization and opened up negotiations with the opposition. This threatened to provoke a split in his party as his action was opposed Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107. It also gave Pa\u0161i\u0107 a pretext to end the coalition. At first the King gave Pa\u0161i\u0107 a mandate to form a coalition with Pribi\u0107evi\u0107's Democrats. However, Pa\u0161i\u0107 offered Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 too little for there to be much chance that Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 would agree. A purely Radical government was formed with a mandate to hold elections. The Radicals made gains at the expense of the Democrats but elsewhere there were gains by Radi\u0107's Peasant's Party.\n\nSerb politicians around Radic regarded Serbia as the standard bearer of Yugoslav unity, as the state of [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]] had been for Italy, or [[Prussia]] for the [[German Empire]]; a kind of \"[[Greater Serbia]]\". Over the following years, Croatian resistance against a Serbo-centric policy increased.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Yugoslav government of prime minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] used police pressure over voters and ethnic minorities, confiscation of opposition pamphlets<ref>{{cite magazine|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846181,00.html |title = Yugoslavia: Balkan Politics|work = [[Time Magazine]]|date= 31 March 1923|url-access = subscription}}</ref> and other measure to [[rigged election|rig elections]].

In this they mobilised nationalist opposition in Serbia but provoked a violent reaction from the governing majority including death threats. On 20 June 1928, a member of the government majority, the Serb deputy [[Puni\u0161a Ra\u010di\u0107]], shot five members of the Croatian Peasant Party, including their leader Stjepan Radi\u0107, after Radi\u0107 refused to apolagize for earlier offense in which he accused Ra\u010di\u0107 of stealing from civilian population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=John Paul|date=2017|title=War Veterans, Fascism, and Para-Fascist Departures in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, 1918\u20131941|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318166421_War_Veterans_Fascism_and_Para-Fascist_Departures_in_the_Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia_1918-1941|journal=FASCISM|volume=6|pages=63|via=}}</ref> . Two died on the floor of the Assembly while the life of Radi\u0107 hung in the balance.\n\nThe opposition now completely withdrew from parliament, declaring that they would not return to a parliament in which several of their representatives had been killed, and insisting on new elections. On 1 August, at a meeting in Zagreb, they renounced 1 December Declaration of 1920. They demanded that the negotiations for unification should begin from scratch. On 8 August Stjepan Radi\u0107 died.\n\n===6 January dictatorship===\n {{main|6 January Dictatorship}}\n[[File:Banovine Jugoslavia.png|thumb|200px|In 1929, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was subdivided into [[Banovinas of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|nine banovinas]]. This became eight in 1939, when two were merged to form the [[Banovina of Croatia]].]]\n[[File:Locator map Croatia Banovina in Yugoslavia 1939-1941.svg|thumb|200px|In 1939, the [[Banovina of Croatia]] was founded, aimed at solving the \"[[Croatian question]]\".

He changed the name of the country to \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\", and changed the internal divisions from the 33 oblasts to nine new ''[[banovinas of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]]'' on 3 October. A Court for the Protection of the State was soon established to act as the new regime's tool for putting down any dissent. Opposition politicians [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]] and [[Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107]] were arrested under charges by the court. Pribi\u0107evi\u0107 later went into exile, whereas over the course of the 1930s Ma\u010dek would become the leader of the entire opposition bloc.\n\nImmediately after the dictatorship was proclaimed, Croatian deputy [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] left for exile from the country. The following years Paveli\u0107 worked to establish a revolutionary organization, the [[Usta\u0161e]], allied with the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) against the state.\n\nIn 1931, Alexander decreed [[1931 Yugoslav Constitution|a new Constitution]] which made executive power the gift of the King. Elections were to be by universal male suffrage. The provision for a secret ballot was dropped, and pressure on public employees to vote for the governing party was to be a feature of all elections held under Alexander's constitution. Further, half the upper house was directly appointed by the King, and legislation could become law with the approval of one of the houses alone if also approved by the King.\n\nThat same year, Croatian historian and anti-Yugoslavist intellectual<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=K0VWAgAAQBAJ|title=The Racial Idea in the Independent State of Croatia: Origins and Theory|last=Bartulin|first=Nevenko|year=2013|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|page=124}}</ref> [[Milan \u0160ufflay]] was assassinated in Zagreb.

The government reacted by imprisoning many political opponents including the new Croatian Peasant Party leader Vladko Ma\u010dek. Despite these measures, opposition to the dictatorship continued, with Croats calling for a solution to what was called the \"Croatian question\". In late 1934, the King planned to release Ma\u010dek from prison, introduce democratic reforms, and attempt find common ground between Serbs and Croats.\n\nHowever, on 9 October 1934, the king was assassinated in [[Marseille]], [[France]] by [[Bulgaria]]n Veli\u010dko Kerin (also known by his revolutionary [[nom de guerre|pseudonym]] [[Vlado Chernozemski]]), an activist of IMRO, in a conspiracy with Yugoslav exiles and radical members of banned political parties in cooperation with the Croatian extreme nationalist Usta\u0161e organisation.\n\n===Yugoslav regency===\n{{main|Yugoslav regency}}\nBecause Alexander's eldest son, [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]], was a minor, a regency council of three, specified in Alexander's will, took over the new king's royal powers and duties. The council was dominated by the 11-year-old king's first cousin once removed [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]].\n\nIn the late 1930s, internal tensions continued to increase with Serbs and Croats seeking to establish ethnic federal subdivisions. Serbs wanted [[Vardar Banovina]] (later known within Yugoslavia as Vardar Macedonia), [[Vojvodina]], Montenegro united with the Serb lands, and Croatia wanted Dalmatia and some of Vojvodina. Both sides claimed territory in present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] populated by [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] Muslims. The expansion of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938 gave new momentum to efforts to solve these problems and, in 1939, Prince Paul appointed [[Dragi\u0161a Cvetkovi\u0107]] as prime minister, with the goal of reaching an agreement with the Croatian opposition. Accordingly, on 26 August 1939, Vladko Ma\u010dek became vice premier of Yugoslavia and an autonomous [[Banovina of Croatia]] was established with its own parliament.\n\nThese changes satisfied neither Serbs who were concerned with the status of the Serb minority in the new Banovina of Croatia and who wanted more of Bosnia and Herzegovina as Serbian territory. The Croatian nationalist Usta\u0161e were also angered by any settlement short of full independence for a [[Greater Croatia]] including all of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n===Downfall===\n{{main|Invasion of Yugoslavia}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right |direction=vertical |width=220\n|header=\n|image1=Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1941-43.png|caption1=Occupation and partition of Yugoslavia, 1941\u201343\n|image2=Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1943-44.png|caption2=Occupation and partition of Yugoslavia, 1943\u201344\n}}\n\nFearing an invasion by the [[Axis powers]], Yugoslavia [[Yugoslav accession to the Tripartite Pact|signed the Tripartite Pact]] on 25 March 1941, pledging cooperation with the Axis. Massive anti-Axis demonstrations followed in [[Belgrade]].\n\nOn 27 March, the regime of Prince Paul was overthrown by a [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup d'\u00e9tat]] with British support. The 17-year-old [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] was declared to be of age and placed in power. General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] became his Prime Minister. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia withdrew its support for the Axis ''de facto'' without formally renouncing the Tripartite Pact. Although the new rulers opposed [[Nazi Germany]], they also feared that if German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] attacked Yugoslavia, the [[United Kingdom]] was not in any real position to help. Regardless of this, on 6 April 1941, the Axis powers launched the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and quickly conquered it. The royal family, including Prince Paul, escaped abroad and were interned by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in [[Kenya]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.27mart.com/images/File/the_times.pdf |title=Prince Paul of Yugoslavia exonerated of war crimes |work=[[The Times]] |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom of Yugoslavia was soon divided by the Axis into several entities. [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]], and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] annexed some border areas outright. A [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]] was expanded to include most of [[Slovenia]]. Italy added the [[Governorship of Dalmatia]], part of Macedonia and Kosovo, [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Montenegro]], southerly part of Croatia, and more than a third of [[Province of Ljubljana|western Slovenia]] to the [[Italian Empire]]. An expanded [[Croatia]] was recognized by the Axis as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (''[[Independent State of Croatia|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska]]'', NDH). On paper, the NDH was a kingdom and the [[Tomislav II of Croatia, 4th Duke of Aosta|4th Duke of Aosta]] was crowned as [[Tomislav II of Croatia, 4th Duke of Aosta|King Tomislav II of Croatia]]. The [[rump state|rump]] [[Serbia (1941\u20131944)|Serbian territory]] became a military administration of Germany run by military governors and a Serb civil government led by [[Milan Nedi\u0107]]. Nedi\u0107 attempted to gain German recognition of Serbia as a successor state to Yugoslavia and claimed [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]] as Serbia's monarch. Hungary [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|occupied several northern regions]].\n\n===Exile of the king===\n[[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]], who had escaped into exile, was still recognized as King of the whole state of Yugoslavia by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. From 13 May 1941, the largely [[Serbs|Serbian]] \"[[Chetniks|Yugoslav Army of the Fatherland]]\" (''Jugoslovenska vojska u otad\u017ebini'', or JVUO, or [[\u010cetniks]]) resisted the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia. This anti-German and anti-communist [[resistance movement]] was commanded by Royalist General [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]. For a long time, the \u010cetniks were supported by the [[United Kingdom|British]], the [[United States]], and the Yugoslavian royal government in exile of King Peter II.\n\nHowever, over the course of the war, effective power changed to the hands of [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s Communist [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]]. In 1943, Tito proclaimed the creation of the [[Democratic Federative Yugoslavia]] (''Demokratska federativna Jugoslavija''). The Allies gradually recognized Tito's forces as the stronger opposition forces to the German occupation. They began to send most of their aid to Tito's Partisans, rather than to the Royalist [[\u010cetniks]]. On 16 June 1944, the [[Treaty of Vis|Tito\u2013\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement]] was signed which merged the ''de facto'' and the ''de jure'' government of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn early 1945, after the Germans had been driven out, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was formally restored on paper. But real political power was held by Tito's Communist Partisans. On 29 November, King Peter II was deposed (and the monarchy abolished) by Yugoslavia's Communist Constituent Assembly while he was still in exile. On 2 December, the Communist authorities claimed the entire territory as part of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. The new Yugoslavia covered roughly the same territory as the Kingdom had, but it was no longer a unitary monarchy but a federal republic ruled by a Communist Party.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n\n===Pro-Allied government===\nThe Kingdom nourished a close relationship with the [[Allies of World War I]]. This was especially the case between 1920 and 1934 with Yugoslavia's traditional supporters of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]].\n\n====Little Entente====\nFrom 1920, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had formed the ''[[Little Entente]]'' with [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], with the support of [[French Third Republic|France]]. The primary aim of the alliance was to prevent [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungary]] from regaining the territories it had lost after the First World War. The alliance lost its significance in 1937 when Yugoslavia and Romania refused to support Czechoslovakia, then threatened by Germany, in the event of military aggression.\n\n====Balkan alliances====\nIn 1924, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia formed a ''[[Balkan Bloc]]'' with [[Second Hellenic Republic|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Turkey]] that was intent on keeping balance on the [[Balkan peninsula]]. The alliance was formalized and entrenched on 9 February 1934 when it became the \"[[Balkan Entente]]\". In 1934, with the assassination of King Alexander I by [[Vlado Chernozemski]] in [[Marseille]] and the shifting of Yugoslav foreign policy, the alliance crumbled.\n\n====Italian coalition====\nThe [[Kingdom of Italy]] had territorial ambitions against the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Relations between Italy and the kingdom's predecessors, the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] became sour and hostile during World War I, as Italian and Yugoslav politicians were in dispute over the region of [[Dalmatia]] which Italy demanded as part of Italy. These hostile relations were demonstrated on 1 November 1918, when Italian forces sunk the recently captured Austro-Hungarian battleship [[SMS Viribus Unitis]] being used by the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Italy formed a coalition against it with states with similar state designs, heavily influenced by Italy and/or fascism: [[Albanian Republic|Albania]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] which lasted from 1924 to 1927.\n\nThe 1927 cooperation with Britain and France made Italy withdraw from its anti-Yugoslav alliance. Italian Fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] accepted the extreme Croatian nationalist [[Ustase]] movement of [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] to reside in Italy and use training grounds in Italy to prepare for war with Yugoslavia. Hungary also permitted such Ustase training camps as well. Mussolini allowed Paveli\u0107 to reside in Rome.\n\n=====Friendship agreement=====\nIn 1927, in response to the growing Italian expansionism, the royal government of Yugoslavia signed an agreement of friendship and cooperation with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]].\n\n===1935\u20131941===\n{{Original research section|date=November 2012}}\n[[File:Yugoslavia-Stamp-1939-King Peter II.jpg|thumb|upright|1939 Yugoslav postage stamp featuring King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]]]]\nOfficially, the last words of King Aleksandar had been \"Save Yugoslavia, and the friendship with France\". His successors were well aware of the need to try and do the first, but the second, maintaining close ties with France, was increasingly difficult. There were several reasons for this. By the mid-1930s, France, internally divided, was increasingly unable to play an important role in Eastern Europe and support its allies, many of whom had suffered badly from the economic crisis of that period. By contrast, Germany was increasingly willing to get into barter agreements with the countries of south east Europe. In the process those countries felt it was against their interests to closely follow France. An additional motive to improve relations with Italy and Germany was Italy's support of the Ustase movement. As Ma\u010dek intimated Italy would support Croatian secession from Yugoslavia, First Regent Prince Paul judged closer relations with Italy were inevitable. In an effort to rob the HSS from potential Italian support, a treaty of friendship was signed between the two countries in 1937. This diminished the Ustasa threat somewhat since Mussolini imprisoned some of their leaders and temporarily withdrew financial support. In 1938, Germany, annexing Austria, became a neighbour of Yugoslavia. The feeble reaction of France and Britain, later that year, during the Sudeten Crisis convinced Belgrade that a European war was inevitable and that it would be unwise to support France and Britain. Instead, Yugoslavia tried to stay aloof, this in spite of Paul's personal sympathies for Britain and Serbia's establishment's predilections for France. In the meantime, Germany and Italy tried to exploit Yugoslavia's domestic problems, and so did Ma\u010dek. In the end, the regency agreed to the formation of the ''Banovina hrvatska'' in August 1939. This did not put an end to the pressures from Germany and Italy, and Yugoslavia's strategic position deteriorated by the day. It was increasingly dependent on the German market, about 90% of its exports went to Germany, and in April 1939 Italy invaded and annexed Albania. In October 1940 it attacked Greece, by when France had already been eliminated from the scene, leaving Britain as Yugoslavia's only potential ally \u2013 given that Belgrade had not recognized the Soviet Union. London however wanted to involve Yugoslavia in the war, which it rejected.\n\nFrom late 1940, Hitler wanted Belgrade to unequivocally choose sides. Pressure intensified, culminating in the signing of the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. Two days later, Prince Paul was deposed in a coup d'\u00e9tat and his nephew Peter II was proclaimed of age, but the new government, headed by General Simovi\u0107, assured Germany it would adhere to the Pact. Hitler nonetheless ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia. On 6 April 1941, Belgrade was bombed; on 10 April, the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed; and on 17 April, the weak Yugoslav Army capitulated.\n\n===1941\u20131945===\nAfter the invasion, the Yugoslav royal government went into exile and local Yugoslav forces rose up in resistance to the occupying [[Axis powers]]. Initially the monarchy preferred [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] and his Serb-dominated [[Chetniks|\u010cetnik]] resistance. However, in 1944, the [[Tito\u2013\u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 agreement]] recognised the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia as [[Provisional Government of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|a provisional government]], with the status of the monarchy to be decided at a later date. Three regents\u2014[[Sr\u0111an Budisavljevi\u0107]], a Serb; [[Ante Mandi\u0107]], a Croat; and [[Du\u0161an Sernec]], a Slovene\u2014were sworn in at Belgrade on 3 March 1945. They appointed the new government, to be headed by Tito as prime minister and minister of war, with \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107 as foreign minister, on 7 March.<ref>Josef Korbel, ''Tito's Communism'' (University of Denver Press, 1951), 22.</ref>\n\nOn 29 November 1945, while still in exile, [[King of Yugoslavia|King]] [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] was deposed by the [[constituent assembly]]. The Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was internationally recognized as Yugoslavia and Peter II became a [[pretender]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Demographics==<!--This section linked from [[Demographics of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

From 1918 to 1922, the kingdom maintained the pre\u2013World War I subdivisions of Yugoslavia's predecessor states. In 1922, the state was divided into thirty-three ''oblasts'' (provinces). In 1929, after the establishment of the [[January 6 Dictatorship]], a new system of nine ''banovinas'' (regions) was implemented by royal decree. In 1939, as an accommodation to Yugoslav [[Croats]] in the [[Cvetkovi\u0107-Ma\u010dek Agreement]], a single [[Banovina of Croatia]] was formed from two of these ''banovinas'' (and from sections of others).\n\n==Sport==\nThe most popular sport in the Kingdom was [[association football]]. The [[Football Association of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Football Association]] was founded in Zagreb in 1919. It was based in Zagreb until the 6 January Dictatorship, when the association was moved to Belgrade. From 1923, a [[Yugoslav First League|national championship]] was held annually. The national team played its first match at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. It also participated in the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|inaugural]] [[FIFA World Cup]], finishing fourth.\n\nOther popular sports included [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia Water Polo Championship|water polo]], which was dominated nationally by the Croatian side [[VK Jug]].\n\nThe Kingdom participated at the Olympic Games from 1920 until 1936. During this time, the country won eight medals, all in gymnastics and six of these were won by [[Leon \u0160tukelj]], a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] who was the most nominated gymnast of that time.\n\n==See also==\n* [[1923 Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes parliamentary election]]\n* [[Republic of Prekmurje]]\n* [[Slovene March (Kingdom of Hungary)]]\n* [[List of Finance Ministers of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]\n* [[Women in Yugoslavia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book|last=Banac|first=Ivo |title=The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KfqbujXqQBkC|year=1988|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-9493-1}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Batakovi\u0107|editor-first=Du\u0161an T.|editor-link=Du\u0161an T.
