In Paramapadam (Sri Vaikuntham) Sri Devi is seated to the left of the Lord (and therefore in Kausthubham, heart of Lord,in his left side), and Bhu Devi and Nila Devi to His right as Bhu Devi is first wife and Sri Devi the second wife. First wife always occupies Dakshina/Right hand side of Husband. Younger wife occupies the Vama/left hand side. The misconception of Sri Devi to right, and Bhu Devi and Nila Devi to the left arises from a common wrong equating of Sri Devi with \"Mahalakshmi\". Mahalakshmi is singular form of all three wives mixed together. She obviously is to the right while only two forms Bhu Devi and Sri Devi are seated to his left. In such pictures, Nila is absent or indirectly present unified with Bhu Devi. Nila Devi is older than Lord and is sometimes therefore called Jestha Devi, when Vishnu is called Lord Shani. So even though she is third wife, being older in age occupies right side of Lord along with Bhu Devi. Nila is basically Bhu Devi modified and both are symbol for patience and burden. Nila Devi is embodiment of simplicity of Lord Vishnu. Bhu Devi is embodiment of rulership of the lord on earth. While Sri Devi is embodiment of Grandeur of the lord. The Veda sings the glory of Goddess Nila in Nila Suktam.\n\n==Nappinnai==\n\nWhat Bhu Devi ([[Bh\u016bmi]] devi, Goddess of earth) is to [[Varaha]] [[avatara]] and Sri Devi (Sita) to [[Rama]] avatara, is Neela devi to [[Krishna]] avatara. Neela devi took avatar as Nappinnai, daughter of Kumbagan (brother of [[Yashoda]]) and [[Krishna]] won her hand after conquering the seven ferocious bulls of her father. Nappinnai's brother is Sudama. Sri [[Parasara Bhattar]] describes Krishna, intoxicated by her beauty, as \"Neela thunga sthana giri thati suptham\". \n\nNappinnai \u2013 Krishna cult is mainly limited to the Tamil speaking world. Nappinnai is often referred to as Radha or R\u0101dh\u0101r\u0101n\u012b or \"Radhika\" in North India.\n\n[[Andal]] (one of the [[Alvars]]) wanted to perform devotion to her Lord Krishna like Gopikas did in Dwaparayuga. She in her Thiruppavai, wakes up Nappinai before waking up Lord Krishna. As per [[Srivaishnavism]], [[saranagati]] (complete surrender to the Lord) is performed through His consort and in Sri Krishnaavatharam specifically it is performed through Nappinai.\n\nVelukkudi Swamy, a proponent of [[Vishishtadvaita]] Philosophy says that [[Andal]], singing Nachiar Tirumozhi as the daughter of [[Periyalvar]], mentions about [[Rukmini]]. But singing as a Gopika in [[Thiruppavai]] she mentions only Nappinnai. Alvar mentions the three nachiars (consorts) as Pon mangai(Sri devi), nila mangai (Bhudevi) and pula mangai (Neela Devi) the consort of senses. It is Neela devi who keeps Bhagavan under control by her bhogam. Swami [[Vedanta Desika]] says in Daya satakam - \"nisAmayatu mAm nIla yat bhOga patalai: druvam\". Lord Krishna was a [[Yadava]] kshatriya varna by birth, thus he married Rukmini according to that. He was brought up as a [[Yadava]] vaishya by varna ([[gopa]]), hence he married Nappinnai according to that. Neela suuktam also says - ghruNAhi - ghrutavai - payasvati, etc., mentioning the characteristics of a gopika.\n\nThe name Nappinnai is found in [[Divya Prabandha]] of Alvars and [[Silappadikaram]].\n\n==Krishna\u2019s wedding to Nappinnai==\n\nAfter waking up Nanda Gopalan and Yashoda, the gopis proceeded to wake Goddess Nappinnai who is the consort of Lord Krishna and the incarnation of Neela Devi Nachiar.\u2018Oh daughter in law of Nanda Gopalan,\u2019 addressed the girls. We know that Lord Krishna was only a child while residing in Vrindavan. Yashoda and Nanda Gopan hadn\u2019t even performed the Upanayanam ceremony for Him. Then how did the Lord marry Nappinnai while at Vrindavan? After lord Krishna\u2019s incarnation Neela Devi Nachiar incarnated as the daughter of Yashoda\u2019s brother Kumban near Nepal. As she incarnated after the Lord, she came to be called as \u201cPinnai\u201d and as she is always good, the prefix \u201cnal\u201d was added to her name thus changing her name to Nappinnai. As soon as Nappinnai incarnated the happy Kumban purchased seven identical male calves from the market. \u2018I am going to raise these seven bulls with my daughter. The young man who controls these seven when my daughter comes off age will get her hand in marriage!\u2019The next day when Kumban visited the barn, he was surprised to see that the calves had grown into adult bulls overnight as they were Asuras in disguise. The bulls started to torment the people and Kumban was unable to find a person who could control them. Soon Nappinnai turned three years old when Yashoda visited her brother along with a five year old Krishna.\n\u2018Your son is very beautiful! I can see that He will turn into a handsome youth. I wish I can promise Nappinnai to Him but I made a foolish vow that I will give her hand in marriage only to the man who can control all seven bulls tied in my barn,\u2019 said Kumban.\u2018Uncle, don\u2019t worry,\u2019 said Krishna, \u2018I will subdue those bulls this very second!\u2019Kumban laughed at the sweet child but was terrified when Krishna went in search of the bulls. \u2018Yashoda stop your son! I am afraid that He might get hurt!\u2019\nAs Yashoda and Kumban rushed to the barn they found that Krishna had killed all seven bulls with one blow!\n\u2018What a marvel!\u2019 exclaimed Kumban. As promised he gave Nappinnai in marriage to Krishna but as they were only children, Kumban allowed Yashoda to take Nappinnai with her so that she could raise the two together.\nThis story is mentioned by Swami Desikan in Yadhavabudhayam. \n\n[[Category:Hindu goddesses]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=March 2014}}\nNila Devi also Known as NEELA DEVI is the ferocious form of Durga- She is also called TARA, one of the TEN Manifestations of the FEMININE ENERGY (DEVI) Ref; DASHA MAHAVIDYA,  Reference of NEELA DEVI as the third consort of Maha Vishnu, as I understand is not referred in any Puranas, but NEELA DEVI, TARA, has reference in TANTRA SHASTRAS<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Radha krishna.jpg.jpg|right|thumb|Neela Devi in Krishna avatar as Radha(Nappinnai)]] -->\n\n'''Nila Devi''' (or '''Neela Devi''') is the third consort of Lord [[Vishnu|Maha Vishnu]], the other two being [[Lakshmi|Sri Devi]] and [[Bhudevi|Bhu Devi]].

He was the king of [[Kingdom of Ayutthaya|Ayutthaya Kingdom]] from 1656 to 1688 and arguably the most famous king of the [[List of monarchs of Thailand|Prasat Thong dynasty]]. \n\nHis reign was the most prosperous during the Ayutthaya period and saw the great commercial and diplomatic activities with foreign nations including the Middle East and the West. During the later years of his reign, Narai gave his favorite \u2013 the Greek adventurer [[Constantine Phaulkon]] \u2013 so much power that Phaulkon technically became the chancellor of the state. Through the arrangements of Phaulkon, the Siamese kingdom came into close diplomatic relations with the court of [[Louis XIV]] and French soldiers and missionaries filled the Siamese aristocracy and defense. The dominance of French officials led to frictions between them and the native [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)#History and use of the term|mandarin]]s and led to the turbulent [[Siamese revolution of 1688|revolution of 1688]] towards the end of his reign. \n\nNarai\u2019s reign was also known for the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1662\u20131664)|1662\u20131664 invasion of Burma]], the destruction of the briefly independent port city of the [[Sultanate of Singgora]] (1605\u20131680), and the conflict with the [[East India Company]] as a result of piratical activities carried out by Ayutthaya\u2019s English subjects.\n\nThe presence of numerous foreigners from the French Jesuits to the Persian delegates has left historians with rich sources of material on the city of Ayutthaya and its conflicts and courtly life in the seventeenth century that otherwise would not have survived the complete destruction of the capital in 1767.\n\n==Birth and name==\nPrince Narai was born on 16 February 1633 to King [[Prasat Thong]] and his consort, Princess Sirithida<ref name=\"siri\"/> ({{lang-th|\u0e28\u0e34\u0e23\u0e34\u0e18\u0e34\u0e14\u0e32}}), who was a daughter of [[Songtham]]. Prasat Thong had just usurped the throne from the ruling [[Sukhothai dynasty]] in 1629 and founded a dynasty of his own. Narai had an siblings younger sister Princess Si Suphan (or ''Princess Ratcha Kanlayani''), elder half-brother Prince Chai, and an uncle Prince Si Suthammaracha.\n\nThe ''[[Royal Chronicle of Ayutthaya: Royal Recension Version]]'' recorded that \"In that year [1633], the princess consort gave birth to a son. When the royal family glanced at the infant, they saw the baby had four arms before having two arms as normal. Upon learning this, the king thought it was a miracle. He therefore named his son Narai.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e1e\u0e07\u0e28\u0e32\u0e27\u0e14\u0e32\u0e23\u0e09\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e15\u0e16\u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e32 |trans-title=Royal Chronicle of Ayutthaya: Royal Recension Version | location = Bangkok | publisher = Fine Arts Department of Thailand | year = 1991 | isbn = 9744171448 | quote = \u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e35\u0e19\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19 \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e40\u0e17\u0e27\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e15\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e15\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07 \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0d\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34\u0e27\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e48\u0e01\u0e23\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e01\u0e15\u0e34\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e23 \u0e2a\u0e21\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e08\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27\u0e15\u0e23\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e41\u0e08\u0e49\u0e07\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21 \u0e40\u0e2b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e28\u0e08\u0e23\u0e23\u0e22\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e47\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e19\u0e32\u0e21\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32 \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e19\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e38\u0e21\u0e32\u0e23 }}</ref> The name ''Narai'' is from Sanskrit ''[[Narayana]]'', a name of Hindu god [[Vishnu]] who has four arms.<ref>{{cite book | title = Siam & the West, 1500-1700 | author = Dirk Van der Cruysse | publisher = Silkworm Books | year = 2002 | location = Bangkok | isbn = 9781630411626 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=adYGBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT57&lpg=PT57&dq=king+narai+four+arms&source=bl&ots=Dw6Wh4dTn5&sig=WhvAO2DH_KgvLa9a8NsC7r0FNI4&hl=th&sa=X&ei=9rIpVKyjFIjJuASjv4BA&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>\n\n==Succession==\nUpon Prasat Thong\u2019s death in 1656, Prince Chai succeeded his father as King Sanpet VI.\n\nHowever, it was a Thai tradition to give brothers a higher priority over sons in succession. Prince Sudharmmaraja plotted with his nephew, Prince Narai, to bring Sanpet VI down. After nine months of ascension, Sanpet VI was executed following a coup. Narai and his uncle marched<ref>{{cite book |author=Wyatt, DK |title=Thailand: A Short History |publisher=Silkworm |location=Chiang Mai |year=1984 |pages=107}}</ref> into the palace, and Si Suthammaracha crowned himself king. Si Suthammaracha appointed Narai as the ''Uparaja'', or Viceroy of the [[Front Palace]]. However, Narai was also an ambitious prince and had requested Dutch support against his uncle. Si Suthammaracha\u2019s rule was weak and he fell under the control of ''Chao Phraya'' Chakri, an ambitious mandarin who also wanted the throne.\n\nIn 1656, Narai and his uncle finally alienated each other. Si Suthammaracha lusted after Narai\u2019s sister, Princess Ratcha Kanlayani. He ordered his soldiers to surround her residence and entered the house. The princess hid in a book chest and it was smuggled into the Front Palace, where she reunited with her brother.\n\nEnraged at his uncle's behavior, Narai decided to take action. He drew his support from the Persian and Japanese mercenaries that had been persecuted during his father's reign. He was also supported by the [[Dutch East India Company]], as well as his brothers and the ''Okya'' Sukhothai, a powerful nobleman. On the [[Day of Ashura]], the Persians, Japanese and Dutch stormed the palace. The prince engaged in single combat with his uncle, until the king fled to the Rear Palace. Si Suthammaracha was captured and was executed at Wat Khok Phraya on 26 October 1656.\n\n==Domestic policy==\n[[File:Lopburi King Narai plate.jpg|thumb|Memorial plate in [[Lopburi]] showing king Narai with French ambassadors.]]\nDomestic policies in King Narai's reign were greatly affected by the interference of foreign powers most notably the [[Qing dynasty|Chinese]] to the north, the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] to the South, and the [[East India Company|English]] who were making their first forays into India to the west. Policies revolved around either directly countering the influence, or creating a delicate balance of power between the different parties.<ref name=prince>Chakrabongse, C., 1960, Lords of Life, London: Alvin Redman Limited</ref>{{rp|58}}\n\nIn 1660, the Chinese invaded the Burmese capital at [[Inwa|Ava]] to capture [[Zhu Youlang]], the last [[Southern Ming]] emperor. Sensing a possible weakening of Burmese influence in the northern vassal states, King Narai began the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1662\u201364)|Burmese\u2013Siamese War of 1662\u201364]] to bring [[Chiang Mai#Histor|Chiang Mai]] under the direct control of Ayutthya. Although the expedition was successful in taking control of [[Lampang#History|Lampang]] and other smaller cities, a second expedition had to be conducted to bring Chiang Mai under control in 1662. After stopping a Burmese army incursion in 1663 at [[Sai Yok District|Sai Yok]], Narai led an army of 60,000 in an invasion of Burma, capturing [[Martaban]], [[Syriam]], [[Rangoon]], [[Hongsawadi]], and then in 1664 laid siege to [[Bagan|Pagan]]. After \"causing many casualties in dead and wounded and capturing many prisoners of war\", the Siamese retreated.<ref name=Damrong>Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co. Ltd., {{ISBN|9747534584}}</ref>{{rp|220\u2013227,229\u2013233,234\u2013239}}\n\nNarai also handed over control of Mergui to French officer [[Chevalier de Beauregard]] and his small French garrison.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wyatt, DK |title=Thailand: A Short History|pages=115}}</ref> At the same time, he also granted a concession of the strategic port of [[Thonburi|Bangkok]] to Beauregard, with the view of countering Dutch influence.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cruysse, Dirk van der |title=Siam and the West |publisher=Silkworm |location=Chiang Mai |year=2002 |pages=343}}</ref>\n\nKing Narai also built a [[King Narai's Palace|new palace]] at present-day [[Lopburi#History|Lopburi]] (\"Louvo\" in the French accounts) utilising the expertise of [[Jesuit]] architects and engineers. European influences are clearly evident in the architectural style, especially the use of wide windows. The move to Lopburi was arguably prompted by the Dutch naval blockade of Ayutthaya in 1664 to enforce a fur monopoly.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|250\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:Narai observatory.jpg|thumb|King Narai observes a lunar eclipse with French Jesuits at Lopburi, 1685]]\n\nAlthough Catholic missions had been present in Ayutthaya as early as 1567 under Portuguese Dominicans, King Narai's reign saw the first concerted attempt to convert the monarch to Catholicism under the auspices of French Jesuits who were given permission to settle in Ayutthaya in 1662.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|243\u2013244}} The conversion attempt ultimately failed and arguably backfired but Catholics were to remain in Siam up to the present day.\n\nMost controversially, King Narai allowed the rise of [[Constantine Phaulkon]], a Greek adventurer who arrived in Ayutthaya in 1675. Within a few years, Phaulkon had managed to ingratiate himself with the king and became Narai's closest counselor. Under Phaulkon's guidance, King Narai balanced the influence of the Dutch by favouring the French. Phaulkon also encouraged French interest by initially leading them to believe that the king was about to convert to Catholicism. Although King Narai did display a degree of interest in Catholicism, he also displayed an equal interest in Islam and there is no concrete evidence that he wished to convert to either.<ref>{{cite book |author=Muhammad Rabi' ibn Muhammad Ibrahim |translator=J. O'Kane |title=The Ship of Sulaiman |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1972 |pages=98\u20139}}</ref> However, both Catholic and Islamic missions were to come to the conclusion that Phaulkon was responsible for their failures.<ref>{{cite book |author=Muhammad Rabi'ibn Muhammad Ibrahim |title=The Ship of Sulaiman |pages=59}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Cruysse, Dirk van der |title=Siam and the West |pages=429}}</ref> Siamese courtiers also resented Phaulkon's influence and he quickly became the focus of xenophobic sentiments at court, with the future King [[Phetracha]] at their head.\n\n==Foreign missions==\n{{See also|France-Thailand relations}}\nThe most remarkable aspect of King Narai's reign were the diplomatic missions that he sent and received during his reign. Missions were sent as far afield as France, England, and the Vatican, although at least two missions were lost at sea. Ties with states closer to Ayutthaya were not neglected as missions were also sent to Persia, Golconda (India), China, as well as other neighbouring states.\n\nUndoubtedly, the most celebrated of these missions were those to Europe, in particular France. In 1673, a French ecclesiastical mission arrived at the Siamese court with letters from [[Pope Clement IX]] and King [[Louis XIV]] of France. King Narai reciprocated by sending a mission to France in 1680 led by [[Phya Pipatkosa]].<ref name=\"francethai\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.go.th/web/117.php |title=The Beginning of Relations with European Nations and Japan (sic) |year=2006 |publisher=Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=2010-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621210217/http://www.mfa.go.th/web/117.php |archivedate=2009-06-21 }}</ref> Although the mission was lost at sea near Madagascar,<ref>{{cite book |author=Smithies, M |title=A Siamese Embassy Lost in Africa, 1686 |publisher=Silkworm |location=Chiang Mai |year=1999 |pages=1}}</ref> the French responded positively by sending a commercial mission to Ayutthaya headed by Monsignor Pallu in 1682.\n\n[[File:Siamese envoys at Versailles.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kosa Pan]] presents King Narai's letter to Louis XIV at Versailles, 1 September 1686]]\n\n==Rising French influence==\n{{See also|Siamese embassy to France (1686)}}\n\nThe second half of Narai\u2019s reign was a period of growing French influence until the coup of 1688. This was facilitated by a Greek adventurer with the Latinized name of [[Constantine Phaulkon]] who formerly worked for the [[English East India Company]]. Phaulkon was introduced into the court by Kosa Lek in 1681 as a quick-witted interpreter and quickly gained the royal favor.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|254\u2013260}} In 1682 he served as the interpreter during the royal audience with [[Fran\u00e7ois Pallu]], who arrived with letters from Louis XIV. Phaulkon suggested a plan for the reconstruction of the fort of [[Mergui]] in polygonal European style, which was strongly opposed by Kosa Lek. Kosa Lek was later accused of receiving bribes from peasants who did not want to be drafted into the Mergui construction. He was flogged to death under royal orders.\n\nNarai responded the French by the dispatch of Siamese mission to France in January 1684 led by ''Khun'' Pijaivanit and ''Khun'' Pijitmaitri accompanied by missionary Benigne Vachet. They reached [[Calais]] by November and eventually had the French royal audience. Louis XIV sent [[Chevalier de Chaumont|de Chaumont]] as chief ambassador,<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|261}} and [[Abb\u00e9 de Choisy|de Choisy]] to lead the French mission in 1685 to return the Siamese ambassadors and to convert Narai to [[Catholicism]].<ref name=prince/>{{rp|62}} The mission contained a large number of Jesuit priests and scientists. [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] sent his letter to Phaulkon to instruct him to persuade the Siamese king to concede to French requests with the promises of granting him the rank of count.\n\n[[File:SiameseEmbassyToLouisXIV1686NicolasLarmessin.jpg|thumb|Siamese embassy to [[Louis XIV]] in 1686, by [[Nicolas Larmessin]].]]\nThough he did not convert to Christianity, Narai agreed to allow the French troops to be stationed in Siamese ports. [[Claude de Forbin|Chevalier de Forbin]] was made commander of the [[Bangkok]] fort and trained Siamese armies in Western warfare.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|263}} Several Siamese forts including Mergui, [[Ligor]], Singora ([[Songkhla]]), [[Lavo]], and Ayutthaya itself were reconstructed in European style. [[Siamese embassy to France (1686)|Another Siamese mission to France]] was led by ''Phra'' Visutsundhorn ([[Kosa Pan]], younger brother of Kosa Lek) and [[Guy Tachard]] in 1686 with enthusiastic European reception. A fragmentary Siamese account of the mission compiled by Kosa Pan was re-discovered in Paris in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Smithies, M. |author2=Cruysse, Dirk van der |title=The Diary of Kosa Pan: Thai Ambassador to France, June\u2013July 1686 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |year=2002}}</ref> In 1686, a [[Makassar Revolt (1686)|revolt]] broke out in Ayutthaya, caused by the Makassars whom were seeking asylum in Siam after being expelled by the [[Dutch Empire]]. [[Constantine Phaulkon]] and [[Forbin]] mobilized the defence of the Kingdom, with the forces of Ayutthaya made up from a coalition of French, English and Siamese troops. The Makassars were subsequently defeated and Narai had many burnt at the stake.  \n\n[[Samuel White (governor)|Samuel White]], the English governor of Mergui fort, appointed by Narai and a close associate of Phaulkon, entered into conflict with the English fleets from India in 1687, leading to the [[Anglo-Siamese War|English blockade of Mergui]]. The Siamese native mandarins massacred the local Englishmen out of frustration. With English fleets threatening his kingdom, Narai decided to placate the English and executed the mandarins.\n\n[[File:Innocent XI Dec 1688.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Innocent XI]] receives the Siamese envoys, led by [[Father Tachard]] who reads the translation of the message from King Narai, December 1688]]\n\nIn 1687 the new French mission left [[Brest, France|Brest]] for Ayutthaya. The mission included Kosa Pan returning home, Guy Tachard again, [[Simon de La Loub\u00e8re]], [[Claude C\u00e9beret du Boullay]], and [[General Desfarges]].

The last Siamese embassy was led by [[Ok-khun Chamnan]] in 1688 visiting [[Rome]] and [[Pope Innocent XI]].\n\n==The \"Revolution\" of 1688==\n{{main|Siamese revolution (1688)}}\nNarai spent his whole reign reducing the power of native mandarins that had caused much bloodshed during his predecessors\u2019 time. He firstly supported Persian and later the French guards and advisors against the Thai mandarins. Even his ascension to the throne was orchestrated by Persian mercenaries. The French eventually enjoyed special favors from religious affairs to the military activities. One of the critical turning points concerned with the construction of the French forts and military barracks in [[Bangkok]], at the river mouth. In dealing with the activities, the French mostly depended on [[Constantine Phaulkon]], the king's favorite. The threat of the French military presence, reportedly, was felt among the court nobles. All in all, [[Political faction|factionalism]], [[Cronyism|favoritism]] and [[nepotism]] became widespread.  The native mandarins somehow managed to retain their powers, most notably Kosa Lek.\n\n[[Petracha]], Commander of the Royal Regiment of Elephants, emerged as the leading \"nationalist\".<ref name=prince/>{{rp|63}} Petracha had familial connections to Narai, with his mother being the king\u2019s wet nurse and his sister being the king\u2019s concubine.\n\nNarai was said to fear fathering a son. He therefore ordered abortions to be carried out on any of his impregnated consorts. However he adopted the son of a minor mandarin with the name of Phra Piya and named him his successor. The young prince was embraced by the French who managed to convert him to Catholicism.\n\nMatters were brought to a head when King Narai fell gravely ill in March 1688 while staying in his [[Lopburi]] palaces. Aware of the coming succession dispute, in May 1688 Narai called together his closest councillors: Phaulkon, Phra Phetracha, and Mom Pi and nominated his daughter, Kromluang Yothathep to succeed him. The three councillors were to act as regents until the princess took on a partner of her choice from one of the two Siamese councillors.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cruysse, Dirk van der |title=Siam and the West |pages=444}}</ref>\n\nWhen Narai was seriously ill with no hope of recovery, Phetracha arrested Phaulkon and the French officers.  After questioning Mom Pi, he discovered Mom Pi had conspired with Phaulkon to assume the throne, and Mom Pi was executed.  Further questioning of Phaulkon revealed a plot to raise a rebellion, and he too was executed.  Narai, on his deathbed, was unable to do anything, except curse Phetracha and his son, [[Suriyenthrathibodi|Luang Sorasak]].  Luang Sorasak then had Narai's two brothers executed.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|271\u2013273}}\n\nOn the death of King Narai, Phetracha proclaimed himself king.  Siamese troops attacked the French troops during the [[Siege of Bangkok]].  Finally, the French soldiers were allowed to return to France.  Only the Dutch were allowed to trade in the capital before the French and English finally ended their dispute with Siam.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|273\u2013276}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:French depiction of King Narai.jpg|thumb|Contemporary French depiction of King Narai.]]\nAlthough King Narai's reign witnessed the greatest extent of foreign influence at the Siamese court, his diplomatic achievements were to be reversed by his successor. It is debatable whether the new introspective attitude of his successors contributed to the weakening and eventual fall of Ayutthaya. On the other hand, the curtailing of foreign influences in the court may have prevented the colonisation of Ayutthaya. Nevertheless, his reign's diplomatic achievements contributed to him being posthumously styled \"the Great,\" one of seven recognised as such in the history of Thailand.\n\nAt the same time, the records of those involved in the diplomatic missions, particularly those from the west, have allowed historians to obtain a rare glimpse into the world of the Ayutthayan court as most original Ayutthaya records were destroyed with the city in 1767. These include the French accounts of the Chevalier de Chaumont, the Abb\u00e9 de Choisy, Fr. Tachard, Claude de Forbin, de la Loubere and the Persian account of Muhammad Rabi' ibn Muhammad Ibrahim. Domestically, the relative stability during his reign also gave rise to the revival of Siamese literature during his reign.<ref>[http://www.thaimain.org/eng/monarchy/ayutthaya/narai.html Kings of Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912182015/http://www.thaimain.org/eng/monarchy/ayutthaya/narai.html |date=2006-09-12 }}</ref>\n\nFurther afield, one of the main streets of the city of [[Brest, France|Brest]] as well as another in [[Marseilles]] have been named \"[[Rue de Siam]]\" to commemorate Narai's missions, whilst an ancient street in [[Lop Buri Province]], where Narai dwelt at the time he received the Chevalier de Chaumont, has been named \"[[Rue de France]]\" by the Thai government in 1985 to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the relations between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xSCzVY7synAJ:www.lopburi.go.th/RM8/RM8/RM01/8antine.doc+&cd=3&hl=th&ct=clnk&gl=th | archive-url = https://archive.is/20141013081812/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xSCzVY7synAJ:www.lopburi.go.th/RM8/RM8/RM01/8antine.doc+&cd=3&hl=th&ct=clnk&gl=th | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2014-10-13 | script-title = th:\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e41\u0e27\u0e14\u0e25\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e28\u0e34\u0e25\u0e1b\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21 | publisher = Lop Buri Province | quote = \u0e1b\u0e31\u0e08\u0e08\u0e38\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e16\u0e19\u0e19\u0e1d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e28\u0e2a \u0e0b\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e16\u0e19\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e25\u0e1e\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e02\u0e36\u0e49\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e08\u0e31\u0e14\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e09\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e19\u0e18\u0e4c\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e17\u0e39\u0e15\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u2013\u0e1d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e28\u0e2a\u0e04\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e1a 300 \u0e1b\u0e35 \u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e35 \u0e1e.\u0e28. 2528 \u0e21\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e2a\u0e01\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e17\u0e38\u0e01 \u0e46 \u0e40\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e01\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e02\u0e32\u0e22\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e33\u0e21\u0e32\u0e27\u0e32\u0e07\u0e02\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e19\u0e16\u0e19\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e08\u0e30\u0e21\u0e35\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e21\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e19\u0e33\u0e21\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e1d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e28\u0e2a\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e44\u0e27\u0e49 \u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e40\u0e27\u0e13\u0e42\u0e04\u0e19\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49\u0e01\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e17\u0e34\u0e49\u0e07\u0e02\u0e22\u0e30\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e28\u0e31\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e40\u0e27\u0e13\u0e16\u0e19\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49 \u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e04\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e31\u0e15\u0e34\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c | language = Thai | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2014-10-13 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, among the gifts that were exchanged between the Siamese and the French courts, two items from Siam were to have an unexpected impact on French history.

After failing to find usable weapons at the Arsenal, rioting Parisians broke into the Repository and discovered some 20 cannons.

He was the king of [[Kingdom of Ayutthaya|Ayutthaya Kingdom]] from 1656 to 1688 and arguably the most famous king of the [[List of monarchs of Thailand|Prasat Thong dynasty]]. \n\nHis reign was the most prosperous during the Ayutthaya period and saw the great commercial and diplomatic activities with foreign nations including the Middle East and the West. During the later years of his reign, Narai gave his favorite \u2013 the Greek adventurer [[Constantine Phaulkon]] \u2013 so much power that Phaulkon technically became the chancellor of the state. Through the arrangements of Phaulkon, the Siamese kingdom came into close diplomatic relations with the court of [[Louis XIV]] and French soldiers and missionaries filled the Siamese aristocracy and defense. The dominance of French officials led to frictions between them and the native [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)#History and use of the term|mandarin]]s and led to the turbulent [[Siamese revolution of 1688|revolution of 1688]] towards the end of his reign. \n\nNarai\u2019s reign was also known for the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1662\u20131664)|1662\u20131664 invasion of Burma]], the destruction of the briefly independent port city of the [[Sultanate of Singgora]] (1605\u20131680), and the conflict with the [[East India Company]] as a result of piratical activities carried out by Ayutthaya\u2019s English subjects.\n\nThe presence of numerous foreigners from the French Jesuits to the Persian delegates has left historians with rich sources of material on the city of Ayutthaya and its conflicts and courtly life in the seventeenth century that otherwise would not have survived the complete destruction of the capital in 1767.\n\n==Birth and name==\nPrince Narai was born on 16 February 1633 to King [[Prasat Thong]] and his consort, Princess Sirithida<ref name=\"siri\"/> ({{lang-th|\u0e28\u0e34\u0e23\u0e34\u0e18\u0e34\u0e14\u0e32}}), who was a daughter of [[Songtham]]. Prasat Thong had just usurped the throne from the ruling [[Sukhothai dynasty]] in 1629 and founded a dynasty of his own. Narai had an siblings younger sister Princess Si Suphan (or ''Princess Ratcha Kanlayani''), elder half-brother Prince Chai, and an uncle Prince Si Suthammaracha.\n\nThe ''[[Royal Chronicle of Ayutthaya: Royal Recension Version]]'' recorded that \"In that year [1633], the princess consort gave birth to a son. When the royal family glanced at the infant, they saw the baby had four arms before having two arms as normal. Upon learning this, the king thought it was a miracle. He therefore named his son Narai.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e1e\u0e07\u0e28\u0e32\u0e27\u0e14\u0e32\u0e23\u0e09\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e15\u0e16\u0e40\u0e25\u0e02\u0e32 |trans-title=Royal Chronicle of Ayutthaya: Royal Recension Version | location = Bangkok | publisher = Fine Arts Department of Thailand | year = 1991 | isbn = 9744171448 | quote = \u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e35\u0e19\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19 \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e40\u0e17\u0e27\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e15\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e15\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07 \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0d\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34\u0e27\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e48\u0e01\u0e23\u0e41\u0e25\u0e49\u0e27\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e01\u0e15\u0e34\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e23 \u0e2a\u0e21\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e08\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27\u0e15\u0e23\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e41\u0e08\u0e49\u0e07\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21 \u0e40\u0e2b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e28\u0e08\u0e23\u0e23\u0e22\u0e4c \u0e01\u0e47\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e19\u0e32\u0e21\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32 \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e19\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22\u0e13\u0e4c\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e38\u0e21\u0e32\u0e23 }}</ref> The name ''Narai'' is from Sanskrit ''[[Narayana]]'', a name of Hindu god [[Vishnu]] who has four arms.<ref>{{cite book | title = Siam & the West, 1500-1700 | author = Dirk Van der Cruysse | publisher = Silkworm Books | year = 2002 | location = Bangkok | isbn = 9781630411626 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=adYGBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT57&lpg=PT57&dq=king+narai+four+arms&source=bl&ots=Dw6Wh4dTn5&sig=WhvAO2DH_KgvLa9a8NsC7r0FNI4&hl=th&sa=X&ei=9rIpVKyjFIjJuASjv4BA&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>\n\n==Succession==\nUpon Prasat Thong\u2019s death in 1656, Prince Chai succeeded his father as King Sanpet VI.\n\nHowever, it was a Thai tradition to give brothers a higher priority over sons in succession. Prince Sudharmmaraja plotted with his nephew, Prince Narai, to bring Sanpet VI down. After nine months of ascension, Sanpet VI was executed following a coup. Narai and his uncle marched<ref>{{cite book |author=Wyatt, DK |title=Thailand: A Short History |publisher=Silkworm |location=Chiang Mai |year=1984 |pages=107}}</ref> into the palace, and Si Suthammaracha crowned himself king. Si Suthammaracha appointed Narai as the ''Uparaja'', or Viceroy of the [[Front Palace]]. However, Narai was also an ambitious prince and had requested Dutch support against his uncle. Si Suthammaracha\u2019s rule was weak and he fell under the control of ''Chao Phraya'' Chakri, an ambitious mandarin who also wanted the throne.\n\nIn 1656, Narai and his uncle finally alienated each other. Si Suthammaracha lusted after Narai\u2019s sister, Princess Ratcha Kanlayani. He ordered his soldiers to surround her residence and entered the house. The princess hid in the book chest and this was moved to the Front Palace, where she met her brother.\n\nEnraged at his uncle's behavior, Narai decided to take action. He drew his support from the Persian and Japanese mercenaries that had been persecuted during his father's reign. He was also supported by the [[Dutch East India Company]], as well as his brothers and the ''Okya'' Sukhothai, a powerful nobleman. On the [[Day of Ashura]], the Persians, Japanese and Dutch stormed the palace. The prince engaged in single combat with his uncle, until the king fled to the Rear Palace. Si Suthammaracha was captured and was executed at Wat Khok Phraya on 26 October 1656.\n\n==Domestic policy==\n[[File:Lopburi King Narai plate.jpg|thumb|Memorial plate in [[Lopburi]] showing king Narai with French ambassadors.]]\nDomestic policies in King Narai's reign were greatly affected by the interference of foreign powers most notably the [[Qing dynasty|Chinese]] to the north, the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] to the South, and the [[East India Company|English]] who were making their first forays into India to the west. Policies revolved around either directly countering the influence, or creating a delicate balance of power between the different parties.<ref name=prince>Chakrabongse, C., 1960, Lords of Life, London: Alvin Redman Limited</ref>{{rp|58}}\n\nIn 1660, the Chinese invaded the Burmese capital at [[Inwa|Ava]] to capture [[Zhu Youlang]], the last [[Southern Ming]] emperor. Sensing a possible weakening of Burmese influence in the northern vassal states, King Narai began the [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1662\u201364)|Burmese\u2013Siamese War of 1662\u201364]] to bring [[Chiang Mai#Histor|Chiang Mai]] under the direct control of Ayutthya. Although the expedition was successful in taking control of [[Lampang#History|Lampang]] and other smaller cities, a second expedition had to be conducted to bring Chiang Mai under control in 1662. After stopping a Burmese army incursion in 1663 at [[Sai Yok District|Sai Yok]], Narai led an army of 60,000 in an invasion of Burma, capturing [[Martaban]], [[Syriam]], [[Rangoon]], [[Hongsawadi]], and then in 1664 laid siege to [[Bagan|Pagan]]. After \"causing many casualties in dead and wounded and capturing many prisoners of war\", the Siamese retreated.<ref name=Damrong>Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co.

European influences are clearly evident in the architectural style, especially the use of wide windows. The move to Lopburi was arguably prompted by the Dutch naval blockade of Ayutthaya in 1664 to enforce a fur monopoly.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|250\u2013251}}\n\n[[File:Narai observatory.jpg|thumb|King Narai observes a lunar eclipse with French Jesuits at Lopburi, 1685]]\n\nAlthough Catholic missions had been present in Ayutthaya as early as 1567 under Portuguese Dominicans, King Narai's reign saw the first concerted attempt to convert the monarch to Catholicism under the auspices of French Jesuits who were given permission to settle in Ayutthaya in 1662.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|243\u2013244}} The conversion attempt ultimately failed and arguably backfired but Catholics were to remain in Siam up to the present day.\n\nMost controversially, King Narai allowed the rise of [[Constantine Phaulkon]], a Greek adventurer who arrived in Ayutthaya in 1675. Within a few years, Phaulkon had managed to ingratiate himself with the king and became Narai's closest counselor. Under Phaulkon's guidance, King Narai balanced the influence of the Dutch by favouring the French. Phaulkon also encouraged French interest by initially leading them to believe that the king was about to convert to Catholicism. Although King Narai did display a degree of interest in Catholicism, he also displayed an equal interest in Islam and there is no concrete evidence that he wished to convert to either.<ref>{{cite book |author=Muhammad Rabi' ibn Muhammad Ibrahim |translator=J. O'Kane |title=The Ship of Sulaiman |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1972 |pages=98\u20139}}</ref> However, both Catholic and Islamic missions were to come to the conclusion that Phaulkon was responsible for their failures.<ref>{{cite book |author=Muhammad Rabi'ibn Muhammad Ibrahim |title=The Ship of Sulaiman |pages=59}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Cruysse, Dirk van der |title=Siam and the West |pages=429}}</ref> Siamese courtiers also resented Phaulkon's influence and he quickly became the focus of xenophobic sentiments at court, with the future King [[Phetracha]] at their head.\n\n==Foreign missions==\n{{See also|France-Thailand relations}}\nThe most remarkable aspect of King Narai's reign were the diplomatic missions that he sent and received during his reign. Missions were sent as far afield as France, England, and the Vatican, although at least two missions were lost at sea. Ties with states closer to Ayutthaya were not neglected as missions were also sent to Persia, Golconda (India), China, as well as other neighbouring states.\n\nUndoubtedly, the most celebrated of these missions were those to Europe, in particular France. In 1673, a French ecclesiastical mission arrived at the Siamese court with letters from [[Pope Clement IX]] and King [[Louis XIV]] of France. King Narai reciprocated by sending a mission to France in 1680 led by [[Phya Pipatkosa]].<ref name=\"francethai\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.go.th/web/117.php |title=The Beginning of Relations with European Nations and Japan (sic) |year=2006 |publisher=Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=2010-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621210217/http://www.mfa.go.th/web/117.php |archivedate=2009-06-21 }}</ref> Although the mission was lost at sea near Madagascar,<ref>{{cite book |author=Smithies, M |title=A Siamese Embassy Lost in Africa, 1686 |publisher=Silkworm |location=Chiang Mai |year=1999 |pages=1}}</ref> the French responded positively by sending a commercial mission to Ayutthaya headed by Monsignor Pallu in 1682.\n\n[[File:Siamese envoys at Versailles.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kosa Pan]] presents King Narai's letter to Louis XIV at Versailles, 1 September 1686]]\n\n==Rising French influence==\n{{See also|Siamese embassy to France (1686)}}\n\nThe second half of Narai\u2019s reign was a period of growing French influence until the coup of 1688. This was facilitated by a Greek adventurer with the Latinized name of [[Constantine Phaulkon]] who formerly worked for the [[English East India Company]]. Phaulkon was introduced into the court by Kosa Lek in 1681 as a quick-witted interpreter and quickly gained the royal favor.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|254\u2013260}} In 1682 he served as the interpreter during the royal audience with [[Fran\u00e7ois Pallu]], who arrived with letters from Louis XIV. Phaulkon suggested a plan for the reconstruction of the fort of [[Mergui]] in polygonal European style, which was strongly opposed by Kosa Lek. Kosa Lek was later accused of receiving bribes from peasants who did not want to be drafted into the Mergui construction. He was flogged to death under royal orders.\n\nNarai responded the French by the dispatch of Siamese mission to France in January 1684 led by ''Khun'' Pijaivanit and ''Khun'' Pijitmaitri accompanied by missionary Benigne Vachet. They reached [[Calais]] by November and eventually had the French royal audience. Louis XIV sent [[Chevalier de Chaumont|de Chaumont]] as chief ambassador,<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|261}} and [[Abb\u00e9 de Choisy|de Choisy]] to lead the French mission in 1685 to return the Siamese ambassadors and to convert Narai to [[Catholicism]].<ref name=prince/>{{rp|62}} The mission contained a large number of Jesuit priests and scientists. [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] sent his letter to Phaulkon to instruct him to persuade the Siamese king to concede to French requests with the promises of granting him the rank of count.\n\n[[File:SiameseEmbassyToLouisXIV1686NicolasLarmessin.jpg|thumb|Siamese embassy to [[Louis XIV]] in 1686, by [[Nicolas Larmessin]].]]\nThough he did not convert to Christianity, Narai agreed to allow the French troops to be stationed in Siamese ports. [[Claude de Forbin|Chevalier de Forbin]] was made commander of the [[Bangkok]] fort and trained Siamese armies in Western warfare.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|263}} Several Siamese forts including Mergui, [[Ligor]], Singora ([[Songkhla]]), [[Lavo]], and Ayutthaya itself were reconstructed in European style. [[Siamese embassy to France (1686)|Another Siamese mission to France]] was led by ''Phra'' Visutsundhorn ([[Kosa Pan]], younger brother of Kosa Lek) and [[Guy Tachard]] in 1686 with enthusiastic European reception. A fragmentary Siamese account of the mission compiled by Kosa Pan was re-discovered in Paris in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book |author=Smithies, M. |author2=Cruysse, Dirk van der |title=The Diary of Kosa Pan: Thai Ambassador to France, June\u2013July 1686 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |year=2002}}</ref> In 1686, a [[Makassar Revolt (1686)|revolt]] broke out in Ayutthaya, caused by the Makassars whom were seeking asylum in Siam after being expelled by the [[Dutch Empire]]. [[Constantine Phaulkon]] and [[Forbin]] mobilized the defence of the Kingdom, with the forces of Ayutthaya made up from a coalition of French, English and Siamese troops. The Makassars were subsequently defeated and Narai had many burnt at the stake.  \n\n[[Samuel White (governor)|Samuel White]], the English governor of Mergui fort, appointed by Narai and a close associate of Phaulkon, entered into conflict with the English fleets from India in 1687, leading to the [[Anglo-Siamese War|English blockade of Mergui]]. The Siamese native mandarins massacred the local Englishmen out of frustration. With English fleets threatening his kingdom, Narai decided to placate the English and executed the mandarins.\n\n[[File:Innocent XI Dec 1688.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Innocent XI]] receives the Siamese envoys, led by [[Father Tachard]] who reads the translation of the message from King Narai, December 1688]]\n\nIn 1687 the new French mission left [[Brest, France|Brest]] for Ayutthaya. The mission included Kosa Pan returning home, Guy Tachard again, [[Simon de La Loub\u00e8re]], [[Claude C\u00e9beret du Boullay]], and [[General Desfarges]]. A French army regiment was sent with this mission to be stationed in Siamese forts with Desfarges as the military commander.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|267}} Narai agreed to station French troops at Mergui and Bangkok, both with Western-style forts.<ref name=prince/>{{rp|64,65}}  Desfarges was stationed at Bangkok.

The last Siamese embassy was led by [[Ok-khun Chamnan]] in 1688 visiting [[Rome]] and [[Pope Innocent XI]].\n\n==The \"Revolution\" of 1688==\n{{main|Siamese revolution (1688)}}\nNarai spent his whole reign reducing the power of native mandarins that had caused much bloodshed during his predecessors\u2019 time. He firstly supported Persian and later the French guards and advisors against the Thai mandarins. Even his ascension to the throne was orchestrated by Persian mercenaries. The French eventually enjoyed special favors from religious affairs to the military activities. One of the critical turning points concerned with the construction of the French forts and military barracks in [[Bangkok]], at the river mouth. In dealing with the activities, the French mostly depended on [[Constantine Phaulkon]], the king's favorite. The threat of the French military presence, reportedly, was felt among the court nobles. All in all, [[Political faction|factionalism]], [[Cronyism|favoritism]] and [[nepotism]] became widespread.  The native mandarins somehow managed to retain their powers, most notably Kosa Lek.\n\n[[Petracha]], Commander of the Royal Regiment of Elephants, emerged as the leading \"nationalist\".<ref name=prince/>{{rp|63}} Petracha had familial connections to Narai, with his mother being the king\u2019s wet nurse and his sister being the king\u2019s concubine.\n\nNarai was said to fear fathering a son. He therefore ordered abortions to be carried out on any of his impregnated consorts. However he adopted the son of a minor mandarin with the name of Phra Piya and named him his successor. The young prince was embraced by the French who managed to convert him to Catholicism.\n\nMatters were brought to a head when King Narai fell gravely ill in March 1688 while staying in his [[Lopburi]] palaces. Aware of the coming succession dispute, in May 1688 Narai called together his closest councillors: Phaulkon, Phra Phetracha, and Mom Pi and nominated his daughter, Kromluang Yothathep to succeed him. The three councillors were to act as regents until the princess took on a partner of her choice from one of the two Siamese councillors.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cruysse, Dirk van der |title=Siam and the West |pages=444}}</ref>\n\nWhen Narai was seriously ill with no hope of recovery, Phetracha arrested Phaulkon and the French officers.  After questioning Mom Pi, he discovered Mom Pi had conspired with Phaulkon to assume the throne, and Mom Pi was executed.  Further questioning of Phaulkon revealed a plot to raise a rebellion, and he too was executed.  Narai, on his deathbed, was unable to do anything, except curse Phetracha and his son, [[Suriyenthrathibodi|Luang Sorasak]].  Luang Sorasak then had Narai's two brothers executed.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|271\u2013273}}\n\nOn the death of King Narai, Phetracha proclaimed himself king.  Siamese troops attacked the French troops during the [[Siege of Bangkok]].  Finally, the French soldiers were allowed to return to France.  Only the Dutch were allowed to trade in the capital before the French and English finally ended their dispute with Siam.<ref name=Damrong/>{{rp|273\u2013276}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:French depiction of King Narai.jpg|thumb|Contemporary French depiction of King Narai.]]\nAlthough King Narai's reign witnessed the greatest extent of foreign influence at the Siamese court, his diplomatic achievements were to be reversed by his successor. It is debatable whether the new introspective attitude of his successors contributed to the weakening and eventual fall of Ayutthaya. On the other hand, the curtailing of foreign influences in the court may have prevented the colonisation of Ayutthaya. Nevertheless, his reign's diplomatic achievements contributed to him being posthumously styled \"the Great,\" one of seven recognised as such in the history of Thailand.\n\nAt the same time, the records of those involved in the diplomatic missions, particularly those from the west, have allowed historians to obtain a rare glimpse into the world of the Ayutthayan court as most original Ayutthaya records were destroyed with the city in 1767. These include the French accounts of the Chevalier de Chaumont, the Abb\u00e9 de Choisy, Fr. Tachard, Claude de Forbin, de la Loubere and the Persian account of Muhammad Rabi' ibn Muhammad Ibrahim. Domestically, the relative stability during his reign also gave rise to the revival of Siamese literature during his reign.<ref>[http://www.thaimain.org/eng/monarchy/ayutthaya/narai.html Kings of Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912182015/http://www.thaimain.org/eng/monarchy/ayutthaya/narai.html |date=2006-09-12 }}</ref>\n\nFurther afield, one of the main streets of the city of [[Brest, France|Brest]] as well as another in [[Marseilles]] have been named \"[[Rue de Siam]]\" to commemorate Narai's missions, whilst an ancient street in [[Lop Buri Province]], where Narai dwelt at the time he received the Chevalier de Chaumont, has been named \"[[Rue de France]]\" by the Thai government in 1985 to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the relations between the two countries.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xSCzVY7synAJ:www.lopburi.go.th/RM8/RM8/RM01/8antine.doc+&cd=3&hl=th&ct=clnk&gl=th | archive-url = https://archive.is/20141013081812/http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xSCzVY7synAJ:www.lopburi.go.th/RM8/RM8/RM01/8antine.doc+&cd=3&hl=th&ct=clnk&gl=th | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2014-10-13 | script-title = th:\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e48\u0e07\u0e41\u0e27\u0e14\u0e25\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e28\u0e34\u0e25\u0e1b\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21 | publisher = Lop Buri Province | quote = \u0e1b\u0e31\u0e08\u0e08\u0e38\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e19 \u0e16\u0e19\u0e19\u0e1d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e28\u0e2a \u0e0b\u0e36\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e16\u0e19\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e25\u0e1e\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e35\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e02\u0e36\u0e49\u0e19\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e08\u0e31\u0e14\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e09\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e19\u0e18\u0e4c\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e17\u0e39\u0e15\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u2013\u0e1d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e28\u0e2a\u0e04\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e1a 300 \u0e1b\u0e35 \u0e43\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e35 \u0e1e.\u0e28. 2528 \u0e21\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e2a\u0e01\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e30\u0e17\u0e38\u0e01 \u0e46 \u0e40\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e01\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e02\u0e32\u0e22\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e19\u0e33\u0e21\u0e32\u0e27\u0e32\u0e07\u0e02\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e19\u0e16\u0e19\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e08\u0e30\u0e21\u0e35\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e21\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e19\u0e33\u0e21\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e1d\u0e23\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e40\u0e28\u0e2a\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e39\u0e01\u0e44\u0e27\u0e49 \u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e40\u0e27\u0e13\u0e42\u0e04\u0e19\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e21\u0e49\u0e01\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e17\u0e34\u0e49\u0e07\u0e02\u0e22\u0e30\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e28\u0e31\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e40\u0e27\u0e13\u0e16\u0e19\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49 \u0e42\u0e14\u0e22\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e04\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e17\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e31\u0e15\u0e34\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c | language = Thai | date = n.d. | accessdate = 2014-10-13 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, among the gifts that were exchanged between the Siamese and the French courts, two items from Siam were to have an unexpected impact on French history.
