LG Group missed the first sale of the domain in 2008 from the original owner the chemical company [[Lockwood Greene]] to the dot-com entrepreneur Andy Booth; Booth had used it to launch a footballing website known as LifeGames. LG Corp bought \"lg.com\" one year later, in 2009. Following the purchase, LG Group changed worldwide marketing to LG.com, which is now their central internet address for all countries.

ICANN oversees a process for determining registration rules that involves wide-ranging stakeholder input and assorted Working Groups.

A single letter domain does not provide the context found in a longer string or group of words. They may appear similar to one another, or look like English / Latin characters.

LG Group missed the first sale of the domain in 2008 from the original owner the chemical company [[Lockwood Greene]] to the dot-com entrepreneur Andy Booth; Booth had used it to launch a footballing website known as LifeGames. LG Corp bought \"lg.com\" one year later, in 2009. Following the purchase, LG Group changed worldwide marketing to LG.com, which is now their central internet address for all countries. All national LG country domains like \"LG.de\" or \"LG.com.mx\" redirect to \"LG.com\".\n\nThe value of the initially secret November 2010 [[Facebook]] purchase of FB.com was revealed two months later to be $8.5 million in cash and the rest in stocks.<ref>[http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/facebook-paid-8-5-million-for-fb-com/332105 Transaction of the FB.com domain]</ref>\n\n[[IG Group]] paid $4.7 million in September 2013 to buy IG.com <ref>{{cite web|url=http://morganlinton.com/ig-com-sells-for-4-7-million/|title=IG.com sells for $4.7 Million|work=morganlinton.com}}</ref>\n\n[[GMO Internet, Inc.]] purchased Z.com for nearly $6.8 million from [[Nissan]], who previously used it for the [[Nissan]] Z series cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedomains.com/2014/11/21/z-com-sold-for-6-8-million-dollars/|title=Z.com Sold For $6.8 Million Dollars|author=Michael Berkens|work=TheDomains.com}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nWith the 2005 announcement that registration of the remaining single-letter names might become available, some companies have attempted to establish a right to the names by claiming trademark rights over single letters used in such a context.
