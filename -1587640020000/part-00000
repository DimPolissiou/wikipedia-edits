Some 11,000 of its residents live in the village of [[Scartho]], which was absorbed into Grimsby before 20th-century laws on the [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] were passed.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} All three areas come under the jurisdiction of the same [[unitary authority]], North East Lincolnshire. It is close to the main terminus of the [[M180 motorway|A180]], which ends in Cleethorpes.\n\nGrimsby lies in the [[national character area]]s of the Humber, and the Lincolnshire coast and Marshes; it is predominantly low in topography. The town was historically settled on low-lying islands and raised areas of the Humber marsh, and subsequently expanded onto the surrounding marshes as they were drained. The town still has areas named East Marsh and West Marsh. The [[Lincolnshire Wolds]] are situated to the south west of the town, from which the town's [[River Freshney]] rises.\n\n==History==\nThere is some [[archeological|archaeological]] evidence of a small town of Roman workers sited in the area in the second century. Located on the [[River Haven]], which flowed into the [[Humber]], this provided an ideal location for ships to shelter from approaching storms. It was also well situated to exploit the rich fishing grounds in the [[North Sea]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Vikings===\nGrimsby was settled by [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] sometime in the 9th century AD.

The legendary founding of Grimsby is described in a medieval romance, the ''[[Lay of Havelock the Dane]],'' but historians consider this account to be myth.\n\nIn Norse mythology, ''Grim'' (Mask) and ''Grimnir'' (Masked One) are names adopted by the deity [[Odin]] (Anglo-Saxon ''[[Woden]]'') when travelling incognito amongst mortals, as in the short poem known as 'Grimnir's Sayings' (''Grimnismal'') in the ''[[Poetic Edda]].''<ref>Grimnir's Sayings (verses 46,49), ''The [[Poetic Edda]]''</ref> The intended audience of the Havelock tale (recorded much later in the form of the ''[Lay of Havelock the Dane)'' may have understood the fisherman Grim to be Odin in disguise. The Odinic name \"Grimr/Grim\" occurs in many English place names within the historical [[Danelaw]] and elsewhere in Britain, examples being the numerous earthworks named ''Grimsdyke''.<ref>''Mysterious Britain'', Janet and Colin Bord, (1972) Garnstone Press Ltd., p. 88</ref> Other British place names containing the element ''Grim'' are explained as referring to [[Woden]]/[[Odin]] (e.g. Grimsbury, Grimspound, Grime's Graves, Grimsditch, Grimsworne), and Grimsby is likely to have the same derivation.\n\nGrimsby is listed in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as having a population of around 200, a priest, a mill and a ferry.\n\n===Medieval period===\nDuring the 12th century, Grimsby developed into a fishing and trading port, at one point ranking twelfth in importance to the Crown in terms of tax revenue. The town was granted its charter by [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1201. The first mayor was installed in 1202.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shaw |first=George |title=Old Grimsby |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tSmDDJyouIIC&pg=PA136 |accessdate=6 June 2013 |publisher=Wellowgate Publications Ltd. |isbn=978-1-4092-3671-9 |page=136|date=November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nGrimsby is noted in the {{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga Saga]]|italic=yes}} in this {{lang|non|[[Dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt]]}} stanza by [[Kali Kolsson]]:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|V\u00e9r h\u01ebfum va\u00f0nar leirur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vikur fimm megingrimmar;\nsaurs vara vant, er v\u00e1rum,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi\u00f0r, \u00ed Gr\u00edmsb\u0153 mi\u00f0jum.\nN\u00fa'r \u00feat's m\u00e1s of m\u00fdrar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;megink\u00e1tliga l\u00e1tum\nbranda elg \u00e1 bylgjur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bj\u01ebrgynjar til dynja.\n|We have waded in mire for five terrible weeks;\nthere was no lack of mud where we were, in the middle of Grimsby.\nBut now away we let our beaked moose [[kenning|{{!(}}ship{{)!}}]] resound merrily\non the waves over the seagull's swamp [sea] to Bergen.\n}}\n\n[[File:St. James' Church, Grimsby.jpg|thumb|St James' Church, now [[Grimsby Minster]], before its extension]]\n\nGrimsby does not have town walls. It was too small and was protected by the marshy land around it. However, the town did have a ditch.\n\nIn medieval times, Grimsby had two parish churches, [[St Mary's Church, Grimsby|St Mary's]] and [[St. James' Church, Grimsby|St James]]. Only St James, now known as [[Grimsby Minster]], remains. St James is associated with a folk tale of an [[Imp]] who played tricks in the church and was turned into stone by an angel (a similar story is told for [[Lincoln Cathedral]]; see [[Lincoln Imp]]).\n\nIn the mid-14th century, the town benefited from the generosity of [[Edmund de Grimsby]], a local man who became a senior Crown official and judge in Ireland.\n\nIn the 15th century, The Haven began to silt up, preventing ships in the Humber from docking. As a result, Grimsby entered a long period of decline which lasted until the late 18th century. By 1801, the population of Grimsby numbered 1,524,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} around the same size that it had been in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n===Rise of fishing and maritime industry===\nThe [[Grimsby Haven Company]] was formed by Act of Parliament in May 1796 (the Grimsby Haven Act) for the purpose of \"widening, deepening, enlarging, altering and improving the Haven of the Town and Port of Great Grimsby\". After dredging of The Haven and related improvement, in the early 19th century the town grew rapidly as the port was revived. Grimsby's port boomed, importing iron, timber, wheat, hemp and flax. New docks were needed to cope with the expansion. The Grimsby Docks Act of 1845 allowed the necessary building works.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Alexandra Docks.jpg|thumb|right|Alexandra Docks and [[National Fishing Heritage Centre]] ]]\n\nThe arrival of the railway in 1848 made it easier to transport goods to and from the port to markets and farms. Coal mined in the South [[Yorkshire]] coalfields was brought by rail and exported through Grimsby. Rail links direct to London and the [[Billingsgate Fish Market]] allowed for fresh \"Grimsby Fish\" to gain renown nationwide. The first true fish dock opened in Grimsby in 1856, and the town became a centre for the development of the commercial fishing industry.\n\nThe [[Dock Tower]] was completed in 1851, followed by the [[Royal Dock, Grimsby|Royal Dock]] in 1852. [[No.1 Fish Dock]] was completed in 1856, followed by [[No.2 Fish Dock]] in 1877. [[Alexandra Dock, Grimsby|Alexandra Dock]] and [[Union Dock, Grimsby|Union Dock]] were completed in 1879. During this period, the fishing fleet was greatly expanded. In a rare reversal of the usual trends, large numbers of fishermen from the South-East and Devon travelled North to join the Grimsby fleet. Over 40 per cent of these newcomers came from Barking in East London, and other Thames-side towns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.localpopulationstudies.org.uk/PDF/LPS50_1993_39-50.pdf |title=Following the Fish to Grimsby |last=Gerrish |first=Dr. Margaret |publisher=University of Hull |accessdate=11 August 2010}} {{Dead link |date=September 2010 |bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nIn 1857 there were 22 vessels in Grimsby.

The first enclosed dock, later known as the [[Old Dock, Grimsby|Old Dock]], was built in the 1790s by the [[Grimsby Haven Company]]. Major expansion came with the coming of the railways, and construction of the [[Royal Dock, Grimsby]] in the 1840s. A [[No.1 Fish Dock|Fish Dock]] was added in 1857, and the fish docks expanded over the next 80 years, with Grimsby becoming a major fishing centre. The Old dock was expanded to form [[Alexandra Dock, Grimsby|Alexandra Dock]] in the 1880s.\n\nFishing activities were reduced to a fraction of former levels in the second half of the twentieth century. The current port is a centre for car import (and export). Since 1975, it handles general cargo.

Hammerson's UK Ltd began a \u00a3100&nbsp;million redevelopment of the retail centre, doubling it in size. The expanded centre was covered in a glass roof. Two multi-storey car parks were constructed at each end of the centre; with this development, the old ''Top Town'' area of Grimsby was effectively privatised and roofed over. Stores are serviced at the first floor by ramps at the western end, which can accommodate even large vehicles. The ramp also provides access to the car park on the roof of the indoor market, which is operated by the local council.

This was a dominant shopping area with close connections to the docks, but industry and demographic changes have caused it to struggle since the late 1970s. Previously the town centre area was rivalled by the Freeman Street shopping area, located closer to the docks. Freeman Street retains its covered market. Grimsby town centre has re-emerged in prominence as the docks declined and shops such as Marks and Spencer relocated to central Grimsby.\n\nOther developments near the town centre since the 1980s include the Alexandra Retail Park and Sainsbury's to the west of Alexandra Dock, an Asda store between the town centre and Freeman Street, the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/716956 Victoria Mills] Retail Park off the [[Peaks Parkway|Peaks Parkway A16]], which is home to several chain stores, including [[Next (retailer)|Next]] and close to a [[Tesco Extra]] (the [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/368832 second] in the area).

The Grimsby Electric was a normal gauge tramway opened in 1912 between [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/52622 Corporation Bridge] at Grimsby and [[Immingham]]. There was no physical connection with the railway system. The tramway served the town with a passenger service between Grimsby and Immingham until closure in 1961. It is claimed that once this was controlled by the Corporation, they were more interested in supporting the motorbus service, now number&nbsp;45.\n\nThe Grimsby Light Railway opened in 1881 using horse-drawn trams. In 1901, these were replaced with electric tramways.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 1925 the Grimsby Transport Company bought the tramway company and in 1927 moved the depot to the Victoria Street Depot, an old [[sea plane]] hangar.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} This system closed in 1937. The depot continues to be used by Stagecoach, though the old Grimsby Tramways livery is still visible on the front of the building.\n\nOperating in the area until the 1950s was a network of electrically operated trolley buses which received their power from overhead power lines.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Airport===\n[[Humberside Airport]] is {{convert|14|mi|km}} west of Grimsby and mainly caters for charter holidays.

It is close to the main terminus of the [[M180 motorway|A180]], which ends in Cleethorpes.\n\nGrimsby lies in the [[national character area]]s of the Humber, and the Lincolnshire coast and Marshes; it is predominantly low in topography. The town was historically settled on low-lying islands and raised areas of the Humber marsh, and subsequently expanded onto the surrounding marshes as they were drained. The town still has areas named East Marsh and West Marsh. The [[Lincolnshire Wolds]] are situated to the south west of the town, from which the town's [[River Freshney]] rises.\n\n==History==\nThere is some [[archeological|archaeological]] evidence of a small town of Roman workers sited in the area in the second century. Located on the [[River Haven]], which flowed into the [[Humber]], this provided an ideal location for ships to shelter from approaching storms. It was also well situated to exploit the rich fishing grounds in the [[North Sea]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Vikings===\nGrimsby was settled by [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] sometime in the 9th century AD.

The legendary founding of Grimsby is described in a medieval romance, the ''[[Lay of Havelock the Dane]],'' but historians consider this account to be myth.\n\nIn Norse mythology, ''Grim'' (Mask) and ''Grimnir'' (Masked One) are names adopted by the deity [[Odin]] (Anglo-Saxon ''[[Woden]]'') when travelling incognito amongst mortals, as in the short poem known as 'Grimnir's Sayings' (''Grimnismal'') in the ''[[Poetic Edda]].''<ref>Grimnir's Sayings (verses 46,49), ''The [[Poetic Edda]]''</ref> The intended audience of the Havelock tale (recorded much later in the form of the ''[Lay of Havelock the Dane)'' may have understood the fisherman Grim to be Odin in disguise. The Odinic name \"Grimr/Grim\" occurs in many English place names within the historical [[Danelaw]] and elsewhere in Britain, examples being the numerous earthworks named ''Grimsdyke''.<ref>''Mysterious Britain'', Janet and Colin Bord, (1972) Garnstone Press Ltd., p. 88</ref> Other British place names containing the element ''Grim'' are explained as referring to [[Woden]]/[[Odin]] (e.g. Grimsbury, Grimspound, Grime's Graves, Grimsditch, Grimsworne), and Grimsby is likely to have the same derivation.\n\nGrimsby is listed in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 as having a population of around 200, a priest, a mill and a ferry.\n\n===Medieval period===\nDuring the 12th century, Grimsby developed into a fishing and trading port, at one point ranking twelfth in importance to the Crown in terms of tax revenue. The town was granted its charter by [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1201. The first mayor was installed in 1202.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shaw |first=George |title=Old Grimsby |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tSmDDJyouIIC&pg=PA136 |accessdate=6 June 2013 |publisher=Wellowgate Publications Ltd. |isbn=978-1-4092-3671-9 |page=136|date=November 2010 }}</ref>\n\nGrimsby is noted in the {{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga Saga]]|italic=yes}} in this {{lang|non|[[Dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt]]}} stanza by [[Kali Kolsson]]:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|V\u00e9r h\u01ebfum va\u00f0nar leirur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vikur fimm megingrimmar;\nsaurs vara vant, er v\u00e1rum,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vi\u00f0r, \u00ed Gr\u00edmsb\u0153 mi\u00f0jum.\nN\u00fa'r \u00feat's m\u00e1s of m\u00fdrar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;megink\u00e1tliga l\u00e1tum\nbranda elg \u00e1 bylgjur&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bj\u01ebrgynjar til dynja.\n|We have waded in mire for five terrible weeks;\nthere was no lack of mud where we were, in the middle of Grimsby.\nBut now away we let our beaked moose [[kenning|{{!(}}ship{{)!}}]] resound merrily\non the waves over the seagull's swamp [sea] to Bergen.\n}}\n\n[[File:St. James' Church, Grimsby.jpg|thumb|St James' Church, now [[Grimsby Minster]], before its extension]]\n\nGrimsby does not have town walls. It was too small and was protected by the marshy land around it. However, the town did have a ditch.\n\nIn medieval times, Grimsby had two parish churches, [[St Mary's Church, Grimsby|St Mary's]] and [[St. James' Church, Grimsby|St James]]. Only St James, now known as [[Grimsby Minster]], remains. St James is associated with a folk tale of an [[Imp]] who played tricks in the church and was turned into stone by an angel (a similar story is told for [[Lincoln Cathedral]]; see [[Lincoln Imp]]).\n\nIn the mid-14th century, the town benefited from the generosity of [[Edmund de Grimsby]], a local man who became a senior Crown official and judge in Ireland.\n\nIn the 15th century, The Haven began to silt up, preventing ships in the Humber from docking. As a result, Grimsby entered a long period of decline which lasted until the late 18th century. By 1801, the population of Grimsby numbered 1,524,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} around the same size that it had been in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n===Rise of fishing and maritime industry===\nThe [[Grimsby Haven Company]] was formed by Act of Parliament in May 1796 (the Grimsby Haven Act) for the purpose of \"widening, deepening, enlarging, altering and improving the Haven of the Town and Port of Great Grimsby\". After dredging of The Haven and related improvement, in the early 19th century the town grew rapidly as the port was revived. Grimsby's port boomed, importing iron, timber, wheat, hemp and flax. New docks were needed to cope with the expansion. The Grimsby Docks Act of 1845 allowed the necessary building works.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Alexandra Docks.jpg|thumb|right|Alexandra Docks and [[National Fishing Heritage Centre]] ]]\n\nThe arrival of the railway in 1848 made it easier to transport goods to and from the port to markets and farms. Coal mined in the South [[Yorkshire]] coalfields was brought by rail and exported through Grimsby. Rail links direct to London and the [[Billingsgate Fish Market]] allowed for fresh \"Grimsby Fish\" to gain renown nationwide. The first true fish dock opened in Grimsby in 1856, and the town became a centre for the development of the commercial fishing industry.\n\nThe [[Dock Tower]] was completed in 1851, followed by the [[Royal Dock, Grimsby|Royal Dock]] in 1852. [[No.1 Fish Dock]] was completed in 1856, followed by [[No.2 Fish Dock]] in 1877. [[Alexandra Dock, Grimsby|Alexandra Dock]] and [[Union Dock, Grimsby|Union Dock]] were completed in 1879. During this period, the fishing fleet was greatly expanded. In a rare reversal of the usual trends, large numbers of fishermen from the South-East and Devon travelled North to join the Grimsby fleet. Over 40 per cent of these newcomers came from Barking in East London, and other Thames-side towns.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.localpopulationstudies.org.uk/PDF/LPS50_1993_39-50.pdf |title=Following the Fish to Grimsby |last=Gerrish |first=Dr. Margaret |publisher=University of Hull |accessdate=11 August 2010}} {{Dead link |date=September 2010 |bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nIn 1857 there were 22 vessels in Grimsby.

It was founded in 1922 by Ernest Bevin and [[James Flowers]] with Bevin serving as its first [[general secretary]].\n\nIn 2007, it merged with [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]] to form [[Unite the Union]].\n\n==History==\nAt the time of its creation in 1922, the TGWU was the largest and most ambitious amalgamation brought about within trade unionism. Its structure combined regional organisation, based on Districts and Areas, with committee organisation by occupation, based on six broad Trade Groups. Trade groups were not closely linked to trades, but were elected by activists. Officials of the union were grouped by region, and could be asked to serve each or any trade group.\n\n===Docks Group===\nThe Docks Group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the following unions:\n*[[Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union|Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland]]\n*[[South Side Labour Protection League|Labour Protection League]] (London, est. 1889)\n*[[National Amalgamated Coal Porters' Union of Inland and Seaborne Coal Workers]] (London, est. 1889)\n*[[National Amalgamated Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland]] (Cardiff, est. 1889)\n*[[North of England Trimmers' and Teemers' Association]] (est. 1871)\n\nThe group originally had a subsection for coal shipping.<ref name=\"eaton\">{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Jack|last2=Gill|first2=Colin|title=The Trade Union Directory|date=1981|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=0861043502|pages=54-68}}</ref>  In 1928, it had 96,000 members, but over time, membership of the group declined along with employment on the docks, dropping to 56,000 in 1966, and had 51,153 in 1980.<ref name=\"eaton\" /><ref name=\"hyman\">{{cite book |last1=Hyman |first1=Richard |title=The Workers' Union |date=1971 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |page=170}}</ref>\n\n===Waterways Group===\nThe Waterways Group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the [[Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen]].  Always one of the smallest sections, it had only 8,000 members in 1928, and 16,000 in 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />  In 1970, it was merged into the Docks Group.\n\n===Administrative, Clerical and Supervisory Group===\nThe Administrative, Clerical and Supervisory Group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the following unions:\n*[[National Union of Ships' Clerks, Grain Weighers and Coalmeters|National Association of Ships' Clerks, Grain Weighers and Coalmeters]]\n*[[National Union of Docks, Wharves and Shipping Staffs]]\n\nThere was often ambiguity in the TGWU over the actual name of its white-collar section. From the 1960s it was generally known as ACTS (Administrative, Clerical, Technical and Supervisory) but also sometimes as the ACTSS (Association of Clerical, Technical and Supervisory Staff) and enamel union badges bearing both sets of initials were produced for members. It was noted for an enquiry by the Certification Office in 2006 into board members who had joined the union within six months of being elected to senior posts.\n\nThe group grew significantly over time, having only 5,000 members in 1928, but 62,000 by 1966, and 149,801 members in 1980.<ref name=\"eaton\" /><ref name=\"hyman\" />\n\n===Road Transport (Passenger and Commercial) Groups===\nThe Road Transport group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the following unions:\n*[[Amalgamated Association of Carters and Motormen]] (Leeds, est. 1916)\n*[[Amalgamated Carters, Lurrymen and Motormen's Union]] (Bolton, est. 1890)\n*[[Associated Horsemen's Union]] (Greenock, est. 1894)\n*[[National Union of Vehicle Workers]]\n*[[North of Scotland Horse and Motormen's Association]] (Dundee, 1911)\n*[[United Vehicle Workers]]\n\nLater in 1922, the group was split into Road Transport (Passenger) and Road Transport (Commercial) groups.<ref name=\"eaton\" />  The Passenger group had 79,000 members in 1928 and 181,000 in 1966, but by 1980, the renamed Passenger Services group had dropped to only 44,501 members.  The Commercial Services group rose from 37,000 members in 1928 to 219,000 in 1966, and 226,290 in 1980.<ref name=\"eaton\" /><ref name=\"hyman\" />\n\n===General Workers Group===\nThe General Workers Group was created in 1922 to cater for all workers in jobs which did not fall into another group.  Initially, it had subsections for workers in metal and chemical trades.  Once it was considered that a particular field had enough members to justify its own trade group, it was split out.  These decisions were made at the Biennial Delegate Conference, and although there were many applications to form new trade groups, most were unsuccessful.  The group had 68,000 members in 1928, and it then doubled in size when the [[Workers' Union]] merged into the TGWU.<ref name=\"eaton\" />  By 1966, it had 338,000 members and, despite the splitting out of further groups in 1970, by 1980 it still had 269,845 members.<ref name=\"eaton\" /><ref name=\"hyman\" />\n\nThe first groups to be split out were:\n* Power Workers, formed in 1926 from the [[National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and Electrical Workers]].  It had 20,000 members in 1928, rising to 41,000 by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Engineering, formed in 1931, principally from members of the [[Workers' Union]].  By 1966, it had 269,000 members.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Government, formed in 1943, with 58,000 members by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Municipal, formed in 1945, with 44,000 members by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Agricultural, formed in 1945, with 13,000 members by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Building, formed in 1953, with 53,000 members by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Chemical, formed in 1953, with 61,000 members by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n\n===Later mergers===\n{{main|list of TGWU amalgamations}}\nThe [[Scottish Union of Dock Labourers]] and [[National Union of Dock Labourers|National Union of Dock, Riverside and General Workers in Great Britain and Ireland]] initially voted not to amalgamate, but a new voted changed their position, and they joined before the end of 1922, along with the [[Amalgamated Carters, Lurrymen and Motormen's Union]], [[Greenock Sugar Porters' Association|Greenock Sugar Porters' Union]], Dundee Flax and Jute Stowers' Society, [[National Union of British Fishermen]], and [[Belfast Breadservers' Trade Union|Belfast Breadservers' Association]].  Some of these unions retained a great deal of autonomy and in many ways effectively functioned as separate unions, even being registered separately with the [[Registrar of Friendly Societies]].  The biggest merger was with the [[Workers' Union]] in 1929, the union being fully integrated into the TGWU in 1931.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n\n==Campaigns==\nThe Transport and General Workers' Union spearheaded the campaign for the registration of [[Gangmaster]]s in the UK, sponsoring an [[Act of Parliament]] which received the [[Royal Assent]] on 8 July 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tgwu.org.uk/Templates/Campaign.asp?Action=Display&NodeID=89606&int1stParentNodeID=42467&int2ndParentNodeID=42467 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319144039/http://www.tgwu.org.uk/Templates/Campaign.asp?Action=Display&NodeID=89606&int1stParentNodeID=42467&int2ndParentNodeID=42467 |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Merger with Amicus ==\nDuring 2005 discussions started between the TGWU, [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]] and the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] about the possibility of merging the three unions into one organisation with potentially 2.5 million members covering almost every sector of the economy. On 14 June 2006 the GMB Conference voted not to continue with discussions although the other two unions are proceeding, with delegates approving the proposed 'Instrument of Amalgamation' at a special conference on 18 December 2006.  The ballot of both unions' membership during February and early March 2007, also approved the merger.  The result of the ballot was announced on 8 March 2007: 86.4 per cent of T&G members and 70.1 per cent of Amicus members voted to support the merger, from a turnout of 27%.  The press release announced that the resulting union had the working title \"New Union\" and the name would be decided by a ballot of the membership.<ref>{{cite web

It was founded in 1922, and its first [[general secretary]] was Ernest Bevin.\n\nIn 2007, it merged with [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]] to form [[Unite the Union]].\n\n==History==\nAt the time of its creation in 1922, the TGWU was the largest and most ambitious amalgamation brought about within trade unionism. Its structure combined regional organisation, based on Districts and Areas, with committee organisation by occupation, based on six broad Trade Groups. Trade groups were not closely linked to trades, but were elected by activists. Officials of the union were grouped by region, and could be asked to serve each or any trade group.\n\n===Docks Group===\nThe Docks Group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the following unions:\n*[[Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union|Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland]]\n*[[South Side Labour Protection League|Labour Protection League]] (London, est. 1889)\n*[[National Amalgamated Coal Porters' Union of Inland and Seaborne Coal Workers]] (London, est. 1889)\n*[[National Amalgamated Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland]] (Cardiff, est. 1889)\n*[[North of England Trimmers' and Teemers' Association]] (est. 1871)\n\nThe group originally had a subsection for coal shipping.<ref name=\"eaton\">{{cite book|last1=Eaton|first1=Jack|last2=Gill|first2=Colin|title=The Trade Union Directory|date=1981|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=0861043502|pages=54-68}}</ref>  In 1928, it had 96,000 members, but over time, membership of the group declined along with employment on the docks, dropping to 56,000 in 1966, and had 51,153 in 1980.<ref name=\"eaton\" /><ref name=\"hyman\">{{cite book |last1=Hyman |first1=Richard |title=The Workers' Union |date=1971 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |page=170}}</ref>\n\n===Waterways Group===\nThe Waterways Group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the [[Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen]].  Always one of the smallest sections, it had only 8,000 members in 1928, and 16,000 in 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />  In 1970, it was merged into the Docks Group.\n\n===Administrative, Clerical and Supervisory Group===\nThe Administrative, Clerical and Supervisory Group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the following unions:\n*[[National Union of Ships' Clerks, Grain Weighers and Coalmeters|National Association of Ships' Clerks, Grain Weighers and Coalmeters]]\n*[[National Union of Docks, Wharves and Shipping Staffs]]\n\nThere was often ambiguity in the TGWU over the actual name of its white-collar section. From the 1960s it was generally known as ACTS (Administrative, Clerical, Technical and Supervisory) but also sometimes as the ACTSS (Association of Clerical, Technical and Supervisory Staff) and enamel union badges bearing both sets of initials were produced for members. It was noted for an enquiry by the Certification Office in 2006 into board members who had joined the union within six months of being elected to senior posts.\n\nThe group grew significantly over time, having only 5,000 members in 1928, but 62,000 by 1966, and 149,801 members in 1980.<ref name=\"eaton\" /><ref name=\"hyman\" />\n\n===Road Transport (Passenger and Commercial) Groups===\nThe Road Transport group was created in 1922 to represent former members of the following unions:\n*[[Amalgamated Association of Carters and Motormen]] (Leeds, est. 1916)\n*[[Amalgamated Carters, Lurrymen and Motormen's Union]] (Bolton, est. 1890)\n*[[Associated Horsemen's Union]] (Greenock, est. 1894)\n*[[National Union of Vehicle Workers]]\n*[[North of Scotland Horse and Motormen's Association]] (Dundee, 1911)\n*[[United Vehicle Workers]]\n\nLater in 1922, the group was split into Road Transport (Passenger) and Road Transport (Commercial) groups.<ref name=\"eaton\" />  The Passenger group had 79,000 members in 1928 and 181,000 in 1966, but by 1980, the renamed Passenger Services group had dropped to only 44,501 members.  The Commercial Services group rose from 37,000 members in 1928 to 219,000 in 1966, and 226,290 in 1980.<ref name=\"eaton\" /><ref name=\"hyman\" />\n\n===General Workers Group===\nThe General Workers Group was created in 1922 to cater for all workers in jobs which did not fall into another group.  Initially, it had subsections for workers in metal and chemical trades.  Once it was considered that a particular field had enough members to justify its own trade group, it was split out.  These decisions were made at the Biennial Delegate Conference, and although there were many applications to form new trade groups, most were unsuccessful.  The group had 68,000 members in 1928, and it then doubled in size when the [[Workers' Union]] merged into the TGWU.<ref name=\"eaton\" />  By 1966, it had 338,000 members and, despite the splitting out of further groups in 1970, by 1980 it still had 269,845 members.<ref name=\"eaton\" /><ref name=\"hyman\" />\n\nThe first groups to be split out were:\n* Power Workers, formed in 1926 from the [[National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and Electrical Workers]].  It had 20,000 members in 1928, rising to 41,000 by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Engineering, formed in 1931, principally from members of the [[Workers' Union]].  By 1966, it had 269,000 members.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Government, formed in 1943, with 58,000 members by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Municipal, formed in 1945, with 44,000 members by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Agricultural, formed in 1945, with 13,000 members by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Building, formed in 1953, with 53,000 members by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n* Chemical, formed in 1953, with 61,000 members by 1966.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n\n===Later mergers===\n{{main|list of TGWU amalgamations}}\nThe [[Scottish Union of Dock Labourers]] and [[National Union of Dock Labourers|National Union of Dock, Riverside and General Workers in Great Britain and Ireland]] initially voted not to amalgamate, but a new voted changed their position, and they joined before the end of 1922, along with the [[Amalgamated Carters, Lurrymen and Motormen's Union]], [[Greenock Sugar Porters' Association|Greenock Sugar Porters' Union]], Dundee Flax and Jute Stowers' Society, [[National Union of British Fishermen]], and [[Belfast Breadservers' Trade Union|Belfast Breadservers' Association]].  Some of these unions retained a great deal of autonomy and in many ways effectively functioned as separate unions, even being registered separately with the [[Registrar of Friendly Societies]].  The biggest merger was with the [[Workers' Union]] in 1929, the union being fully integrated into the TGWU in 1931.<ref name=\"hyman\" />\n\n==Campaigns==\nThe Transport and General Workers' Union spearheaded the campaign for the registration of [[Gangmaster]]s in the UK, sponsoring an [[Act of Parliament]] which received the [[Royal Assent]] on 8 July 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tgwu.org.uk/Templates/Campaign.asp?Action=Display&NodeID=89606&int1stParentNodeID=42467&int2ndParentNodeID=42467 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319144039/http://www.tgwu.org.uk/Templates/Campaign.asp?Action=Display&NodeID=89606&int1stParentNodeID=42467&int2ndParentNodeID=42467 |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Merger with Amicus ==\nDuring 2005 discussions started between the TGWU, [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]] and the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] about the possibility of merging the three unions into one organisation with potentially 2.5 million members covering almost every sector of the economy. On 14 June 2006 the GMB Conference voted not to continue with discussions although the other two unions are proceeding, with delegates approving the proposed 'Instrument of Amalgamation' at a special conference on 18 December 2006.  The ballot of both unions' membership during February and early March 2007, also approved the merger.  The result of the ballot was announced on 8 March 2007: 86.4 per cent of T&G members and 70.1 per cent of Amicus members voted to support the merger, from a turnout of 27%.  The press release announced that the resulting union had the working title \"New Union\" and the name would be decided by a ballot of the membership.<ref>{{cite web

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\n\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983\u201384 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985\u201386 season, but Indiana's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.<ref name=SPLIT>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/about+the+ncaa/overview/history.html |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |title=History of the NCAA |work=NCAA.org |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924162754/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fncaa%2Fncaa%2Fabout+the+ncaa%2Foverview%2Fhistory.html |archivedate=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> These lists are updated through the end of the [[2018\u201319 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|2018\u201319]] season.\n\n==Scoring==\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Career\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Indiana Hoosiers|Rank|Player|Points|Seasons}}\n|-\n|1||[[Calbert Cheaney]]||2,613|| style=\"font-size:80%;\"|[[1989\u201390 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1989\u201390]] [[1990\u201391 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1990\u201391]] [[1991\u201392 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1991\u201392]] [[1992\u201393 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1992\u201393]]\n|-\n|2||[[Steve Alford]]|| 2,438|| style=\"font-size:80%;\"|[[1983\u201384 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1983\u201384]] [[1984\u201385 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1984\u201385]] [[1985\u201386 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1985\u201386]] [[1986\u201387 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1986\u201387]]\n|-\n|3||[[Don Schlundt]]|| 2,192|| style=\"font-size:80%;\"|[[1951\u201352 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1951\u201352]] [[1952\u201353 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1952\u201353]] [[1953\u201354 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1953\u201354]] [[1954\u201355 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1954\u201355]]\n|-\n|4||[[A.J.

However, the school's record book does not generally list records from before the 1950s, as records from before this period are often incomplete and inconsistent. Since scoring was much lower in this era, and teams played much fewer games during a typical season, it is likely that few or no players from this era would appear on these lists anyway.\n\nThe NCAA did not officially record assists as a stat until the 1983\u201384 season, and blocks and steals until the 1985\u201386 season, but Indiana's record books includes players in these stats before these seasons.<ref name=SPLIT>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/about+the+ncaa/overview/history.html |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |title=History of the NCAA |work=NCAA.org |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924162754/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fncaa%2Fncaa%2Fabout+the+ncaa%2Foverview%2Fhistory.html |archivedate=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> These lists are updated through the end of the [[2018\u201319 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|2018\u201319]] season.\n\n==Scoring==\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Career\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Indiana Hoosiers|Rank|Player|Points|Seasons}}\n|-\n|1||[[Calbert Cheaney]]||2,613|| style=\"font-size:80%;\"|[[1989\u201390 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1989\u201390]] [[1990\u201391 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1990\u201391]] [[1991\u201392 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1991\u201392]] [[1992\u201393 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1992\u201393]]\n|-\n|2||[[Steve Alford]]|| 2,438|| style=\"font-size:80%;\"|[[1983\u201384 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1983\u201384]] [[1984\u201385 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1984\u201385]] [[1985\u201386 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1985\u201386]] [[1986\u201387 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1986\u201387]]\n|-\n|3||[[Don Schlundt]]|| 2,192|| style=\"font-size:80%;\"|[[1951\u201352 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1951\u201352]] [[1952\u201353 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1952\u201353]] [[1953\u201354 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1953\u201354]] [[1954\u201355 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|1954\u201355]]\n|-\n|4||[[A.J.

If so, please consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the deceased \"notable\". If you report the death of a subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, please consider starting one, provided that the deceased is notable. Please include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid overlinking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, please include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n\n==December 2018==\n===1===\n*[[Ken Berry]], 85, American actor (''[[F Troop]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Mama's Family]]'').<ref>[https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/ken-berry-dead-dies-f-troop-mayberry-r-f-d-1203071348/ Ken Berry, TV Actor in \u2018F-Troop,\u2019 \u2018Mayberry R.F.D,\u2019 Dies at 85]</ref>\n*[[Taramon Bibi]], 62, Bangladeshi independence militant ([[Mukti Bahini]]).<ref>[https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2018/12/01/bir-pratik-taramon-bibi-dies-at-62 Bir Pratik Taramon Bibi dies at 62]</ref>\n*[[Averroes Bucaram]], 64, Ecuadorian politician, Speaker of [[National Congress (Ecuador)|National Congress]] (1985\u20131986, 1990) and [[National Congress (Ecuador)|MP]] (1984\u20131986, 1988\u20131992).<ref>[https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/politica/3/fallecio-averroes-bucaram Falleci\u00f3 expresidente del Congreso, Averroes Bucaram Z\u00e1ccida] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n*[[Ennio Fantastichini]], 63, Italian actor (''[[Open Doors (film)|Open Doors]]'', ''[[At the End of the Night]]'', ''[[Loose Cannons (2010 film)|Loose Cannons]]''), [[David di Donatello for Best Supporting Actor|Donatello]] winner (2010), leukemia.<ref>[https://www.corriere.it/spettacoli/18_dicembre_01/morto-ennio-fantastichini-l-attore-stroncato-leucemia-a1e0d436-f597-11e8-9c84-9babb02b8ffd.shtml Morto Ennio Fantastichini: l\u2019attore stroncato dalla leucemia] {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n*[[Frederick Fasehun]], 83, Nigerian physician and politician, founder of the [[Oodua Peoples Congress]].<ref>[https://leadership.ng/2018/12/01/just-in-founder-of-opc-dr-frederick-fasehun-dies-at-83/ Founder of OPC, Dr Frederick Fasehun Dies at 83]</ref>\n*[[P.

This was a result after Jio complained to TRAI and [[Department of Telecom]] (DoT) about other operators not honoring their commercial agreements to let Jio use their network resources. The company further added that the operators are trying to sabotage its entry into the telecom scene. However, DoT dismissed the request and directed TRAI to help settle the dispute amicably. Moreover, the [[Cellular Operators Association of India]] (COAI) requested TRAI to include all the operators in the discussion instead of the three.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/truce-in-sight-trai-summons-airtel-vodafone-and-idea-to-settle-fight-with-reliance-jio/articleshow/54170767.cms|title=Truce in sight?

So, we are waiting. These are all great companies. They have their own reputations to protect. I am confident they won't violate the law.\" Commenting about number portability, he added, \"The number belongs to the consumer.
