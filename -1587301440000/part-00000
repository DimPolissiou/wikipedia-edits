Cantor's eyes became his [[trademark look|trademark]], often exaggerated in illustrations, and leading to his appearance on Broadway in the musical ''[[Banjo Eyes]]'' (1941).\n\nHis charity and humanitarian work was extensive, and he is credited with coining the phrase, and helping to develop the [[March of Dimes]]. He was awarded an honorary [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 1956 for distinguished service to the film industry.\n\n==Biography==\nReports and accounts of Cantor's early life often conflict with one another.

Cantor and Ida were married in 1914. They had five daughters, Marjorie, Natalie, Edna, Marilyn, and Janet, who provided comic fodder for Cantor's longtime running gag, especially on radio, about his five unmarriageable daughters. Several radio historians, including [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] (''Raised on Radio''), have said that this gag did not always sit well with the girls.

He invented the title \"The March of [[Dime (United States coin)|Dimes]]\" for the donation campaigns of the [[National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]], which was organized to combat [[polio]]. It was a [[Play on words|play]] on ''[[The March of Time]]'' [[newsreels]] popular at the time. He began the first campaign on his radio show in January 1938, asking listeners to mail a dime to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].  At that time, Roosevelt was the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|most notable American victim of polio]].  Other entertainers joined in the appeal via their own shows, and the [[White House]] mail room was deluged with 2,680,000 dimes\u2014a large sum at the time.\n\nCantor wed Ida Tobias (1892 \u2013 1962) on June 6, 1914.

One of his earliest paying jobs was doubling as a waiter and performer, singing for tips at Carey Walsh's [[Coney Island]] saloon, where a young [[Jimmy Durante]] accompanied him on piano. He made his first public appearance in [[Vaudeville]] in 1907 at New York's Clinton Music Hall. In 1912, he was the only performer over the age of 20 to appear in [[Gus Edwards (songwriter)|Gus Edwards]]'s ''Kid Kabaret'', where he created his first [[blackface]] character, \"Jefferson\". He later toured with [[Al Lee]] as the team \"Cantor and Lee\". Critical praise from that show got the attention of Broadway's top producer, Florenz Ziegfeld, who gave Cantor a spot in the Ziegfeld rooftop post-show, ''Midnight Frolic'' (1917).<ref name=eddie/>\n\n===Broadway===\nA year later, Cantor made his Broadway debut in the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1917]]''.

The program of entertainment which included some of the stars of Broadway musical comedy and vaudeville was broadcast from the [[Newark, N. J.]] station [[WDY]] and the [[Pittsburgh]] station [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]], both of the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company]]. The Newark entertainment started at 7 o'clock: a children's half-hour of music and fairy stories; 7:[35?], Hawaiian airs and violin solo; 8:00, news of the day; and at 8:20, a radio party with nationally known comedians participating; 9:55, Arlington time signals and 10:01, a government weather report. G. E. Nothnagle, who conducts a radiophone station at his home 176 Waldemere Avenue said last night that he was delighted with the program, especially with the numbers sung by Eddie Cantor. The weather conditions are excellent for receiving, he continued, the tone and the quality of the messages was fine.<ref>\"Radio Operators Hear a Good Concert\", ''Bridgeport Telegram'', February 4, 1922.</ref>\n[[File:Bert Gordon Eddie Cantor NBC.JPG|thumb|180px|Cantor (right) with Bert Gordon, AKA \"the Mad Russian\".]]\nCantor's appearance with [[Rudy Vallee]] on Vallee's ''[[The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour]]'' on February 5, 1931 led to a four-week tryout with [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour]]''. Replacing [[Maurice Chevalier]], who was returning to Paris, Cantor joined ''Chase and Sanborn'' on September 13, 1931. This hour-long Sunday evening variety series teamed Cantor with announcer Jimmy Wallington and violinist Dave Rubinoff. The show established Cantor as a leading comedian, and his scriptwriter, [[David Freedman]], as \u201cthe Captain of Comedy.\u201d Freedman's team included, among others, Samuel \"Doc\" Kurtzman, who also wrote for song-and-dance man, Al Jolson, and the comedian Jack Benny. Cantor soon became the world's highest-paid radio star. His shows began with a crowd chanting \"We want Can-tor! We want Can-tor!\", a phrase said to have originated in vaudeville, when the audience chanted to chase off an act on the bill before Cantor. Cantor's [[theme song]] was his own lyric to the Leo Robin/Richard Whiting song, \"One Hour with You\".  His radio sidekicks included [[Bert Gordon (comedian)|Bert Gordon]], (comic Barney Gorodetsky, AKA \"The Mad Russian\") and [[Harry Parke]] (better known as \"Parkyakarkus\"). Cantor also discovered and helped guide the career of singer [[Dinah Shore]], first featuring her on his radio show in 1940, as well as other performers, including [[Deanna Durbin]], [[Bobby Breen]] in 1936 and [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] in 1949.\n\nIndicative of his effect on the mass audience, he agreed in November 1934 to introduce a new song by the songwriters [[J. Fred Coots]] and [[Haven Gillespie]] that other well-known artists had rejected as being \"silly\" and \"childish\". The song, \"[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]]\", immediately had orders for 100,000 copies of sheet music the next day. It sold 400,000 copies by Christmas of that year.<ref name=\"Book Ref\">{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Ace|title=Stories Behind the Greatest Hits of Christmas|date=5 October 2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0310327950|page=[https://archive.org/details/storiesbehindgre0000coll/page/224 224]|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/storiesbehindgre0000coll|chapter-url-access=registration|quote=Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.|accessdate=20 August 2014|ref=Stories Behind|chapter=4 Santa Claus Is Coming to Town}}</ref>\n\nHis NBC radio show, ''Time to Smile'', was broadcast from 1940 to 1946, followed by his ''[[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] Show'' from 1946 through 1949. He also served as emcee of ''[[The $64 Question]]'' during 1949\u201350, and hosted a weekly disc jockey program for [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] during the 1952\u201353 season. In addition to film and radio, Cantor recorded for [[Hit of the Week Records]], then again for Columbia, for [[Banner Records|Banner]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]] and various small labels.\n\nIn the early 1960s he [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] a short radio segment, \"Ask Eddie Cantor\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioechoes.com/?page=series&genre=OTR-Talk&series=Ask+Eddie+Cantor|title=RadioEchoes.com|website=www.radioechoes.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Weinstein2017\">{{cite book|author=David Weinstein|title=The Eddie Cantor Story: A Jewish Life in Performance and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA226|date=7 November 2017|publisher=Brandeis University Press|isbn=978-1-5126-0134-3|pages=226\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHis heavy political involvement began early in his career, including his participation in the strike to form Actors Equity in 1919, provoking the anger of father figure and producer, Florenz Ziegfeld. At the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], Cantor publicly denounced [[antisemitic]] radio personality [[Father Charles Coughlin]] and, subsequently,  dropped by his radio sponsor, [[Camel cigarettes]]. A year and a half later, Eddie was able to return to the air thanks to help from his friend [[Jack Benny]].\n\n===Recordings===\nCantor began making phonograph records in 1917, recording both comedy songs and routines and popular songs of the day, first for [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]], then for [[Aeoleon-Vocalion]], [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]], and [[Emerson Records|Emerson]]. From 1921 through 1925, he had an exclusive contract with [[Columbia Records]], returning to Victor for the remainder of the decade.\n\nCantor was one of the era's most successful entertainers, but the 1929 [[stock market crash]] took away his multimillionaire status and left him deeply in debt. However, Cantor's relentless attention to his own earnings to avoid the poverty he knew growing up caused him to use his writing talent, quickly building a new bank account with his highly popular, bestselling books of humor and cartoons about his experience, ''Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street''<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/caught-short-a-saga-of-wailing-wall-street/oclc/381325 \"'Caught short! A saga of wailing Wall street', OCLC Number: 381325\"] worldcat.org, accessed September 5, 2011</ref> in 1929 \"A.C.\" (After Crash), and ''Yoo-Hoo, Prosperity!''\n\nCantor was also a composer, with his most famous song seldom attributed to him. In 1935, along with Charles Tobias and Murray Mencher, Cantor wrote \"Merrily We Roll Along\", which he recorded in the 1950s. It was adapted as the themesong for the ''Merrie Melodies'' series of [[animated cartoons]], distributed by [[Warner Brothers Pictures]] between 1937 and 1964. Cantor himself was frequently caricatured in Warner cartoons of the period, (see Film and television: Animation).\n\n==Film and television==\n[[File:Eddie Cantor - 1933.jpg|thumb|in ''[[Roman Scandals]]'' (1933)]]\nCantor also bounced between films and radio. He had previously appeared in a number of short films, performing his ''Follies'' songs and comedy routines, and two silent features (''Special Delivery'' and ''Kid Boots'') in the 1920s. He was offered the lead in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' after it was turned down by [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]]. Cantor also turned the role down (so it went to [[Al Jolson]]), but he became a leading Hollywood star in 1930 with the film version of ''[[Whoopee! (film)|Whoopee!]],'' shot in two-color [[Technicolor]]. He continued making films over the next two decades until his last starring role in ''If You Knew Susie'' (1948). In the 1950s Eddie Cantor had his own television show, entertaining a live audience.\n\n==Filmography==\n* ''[[A Few Moments with Eddie Cantor|A Few Moments With Eddie Cantor, Star of \"Kid Boots\"]]'' (1923) (DeForest [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film short film)\n* ''[[Kid Boots (film)|Kid Boots]]'' (1926)\n* ''[[Special Delivery (1927 film)|Special Delivery]]'' (1927)\n* ''A Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic'' (1929) (short)\n* ''[[Glorifying the American Girl]]'' (1929)\n* ''[[That Party in Person]]'' (1928) (short)\n* ''[[Insurance (1930 film)|Insurance]]'' (1930) (short)\n* ''[[Getting a Ticket]]'' (1930) (short)\n* ''[[Whoopee!

Cantor, one of the first major stars to agree to appear on television, was to sing \"We're Havin' a Baby, My Baby and Me\".  Arriving shortly before airtime at the New York studios, Cantor was reportedly told to cut the song because the NBC New York censors considered some of the lyrics too risqu\u00e9. Cantor refused, claiming no time to prepare an alternative number. NBC relented, but the sound was cut and the picture blurred on certain lines in the song. This is considered the first instance of television censorship.<ref>\"Cantor Censored in Televised Act\". ''The New York Times''. May 27, 1944</ref>\n\nIn 1950,  he became the first of several hosts alternating on the NBC television variety show ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'', in which he would introduce musical acts, stage and film stars and play comic characters such as \"Maxie the Taxi\". In the spring of 1952, Cantor landed in an unlikely controversy when a young [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], appeared as a guest performer. Cantor embraced Davis and mopped Davis's brow with his handkerchief after his performance. When worried sponsors led NBC to threaten cancellation of the show, Cantor's response was to book Davis for two more weeks.  Cantor suffered a heart attack following a September 1952 Colgate broadcast, and thereafter, curtailed his appearances until his final program in 1954.  In 1955, he appeared in a filmed series for syndication and a year later, appeared in two dramatic roles (\"George Has A Birthday\", on NBC's ''Matinee Theatre'' broadcast in color, and \"Sizeman and Son\" on CBS's ''Playhouse 90'').  He continued to appear as a guest on several shows, and was last seen on the NBC color broadcast of ''The Future Lies Ahead'' on January 22, 1960, which also featured [[Mort Sahl]].\n\n===Animation===\nCantor appears in caricature form in numerous ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons produced for Warner Bros., although he was often voiced by an imitator. Beginning with ''I Like Mountain Music'' (1933), other animated Cantor [[cameo role|cameos]] include ''Shuffle Off to Buffalo'' ([[Harman-Ising]], 1933) and ''[[Billboard Frolics]]'' ([[Friz Freleng]], 1935).  Eddie Cantor is one of the four \"down on their luck\" stars (along with [[Bing Crosby]], Al Jolson, and Jack Benny) snubbed by [[Elmer Fudd]] in ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1950 film)|What\u2019s Up, Doc?]]'' ([[Bob McKimson]], 1950). In ''[[Farm Frolics]]'' ([[Bob Clampett]], 1941), a horse, asked by the narrator to \"do a canter\", promptly launches into a singing, dancing, eye-rolling impression. The Cantor gag that got the most mileage, however, was his oft-repeated wish for a son after five famous daughters. ''[[Slap-Happy Pappy]]'' (Clampett, 1940) features an \"Eddie Cackler\" rooster that wants a boy, to little avail. Other references can be found in ''[[Baby Bottleneck]]'' (Clampett, 1946) and ''Circus Today'' ([[Tex Avery]], 1940). In ''Merrie Melodies'', ''[[The Coo-Coo Nut Grove]]'' Cantor's many daughters are referenced by a group of singing quintuplet girls. In ''Porky\u2019s Naughty Nephew'' (Clampett, 1938) a swimming Cantor gleefully adopts a \"buoy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.i-foo.com/~eocostello/wbcc/eowbcc-c.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007104507/http://www.i-foo.com/~eocostello/wbcc/eowbcc-c.html|url-status=dead|title=From ''The Warner Bros.

In 1933, a set of 12 Eddie Cantor caricatures by Frederick J. Garner was <!-- set is singular -->published by Brown and Bigelow. These advertising cards were purchased in bulk as a direct-mail item by such businesses as auto body shops, funeral directors, dental laboratories, and vegetable wholesale dealers. With the full set, companies could mail a single Cantor card each month for a year to their selected special customers as an ongoing promotion. Cantor was often caricatured on the covers of [[sheet music]] and in magazines and newspapers. Cantor was depicted as a balloon in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/galleries/entertainment/entertainment.html |title=Floating back in time with Macy's balloons, 1940, photo No.11|author=New York Daily News|date=2008-11-28|accessdate=2008-11-28}}</ref> one of the very few balloons based on a real person.\n\nIn addition to ''Caught Short!'', Cantor wrote or co-wrote at least seven other books, including booklets released by the then-fledgling firm of [[Simon & Schuster]], with Cantor's name on the cover. (Some were \"as told to\" or written with [[David Freedman]].) Customers paid a dollar and received the booklet with a penny embedded in the hardcover. They sold well, and [[H. L.

Cantor was the only subject who was told of the \"surprise\" in advance; he was recovering from a heart attack and it was felt that the shock might harm him.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nOn October 29, 1995, as part of a nationwide celebration of the 75th anniversary of radio, Cantor was posthumously inducted into the [[Radio Hall of Fame]] at Chicago's Museum of Broadcasting Communication.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nWarner Bros., in an attempt to duplicate the box-office success of ''[[The Jolson Story]]'', filmed a big-budget [[Technicolor]] feature film, ''[[The Eddie Cantor Story]]'' (1953). The film found an audience but might have done better with someone else in the leading role. Actor [[Keefe Brasselle]] played Cantor as a caricature with high-pressure dialogue and bulging eyes wide open; the fact that Brasselle was considerably taller than Cantor did not lend realism, either. Eddie and Ida Cantor were seen in a brief prologue and epilogue set in a projection room, where they are watching Brasselle in action; at the end of the film, Eddie tells Ida, \"I never looked better in my life\"... and gives the audience a knowing, incredulous look.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[George Burns]], in his memoir ''All My Best Friends'', claimed that Warner Bros. created a miracle producing the movie in that \"it made Eddie Cantor's life boring\".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nSomething closer to the real Eddie Cantor story is his self-produced feature ''Show Business'' (1944), a valentine to vaudeville and show folks, which was [[RKO]]'s top-grossing film that year.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nProbably the best summary of Cantor's career is on one of the ''[[Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' shows.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pondillo|first1=Bob|title=Racial Discourse and Censorship on NBC-TV, 1948-60|journal=Journal of Popular Film & Television|date=2005|volume=33|issue=2|page=106|doi=10.3200/JPFT.33.2.102-114}}</ref> Re-issued on DVD as ''Eddie Cantor in Person'', the hour-long episode is a virtual video autobiography, with Eddie recounting his career, singing his greatest hits, and recreating his singing-waiter days with another vaudeville legend, his old pal [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nCantor appears as a recurring character, played by [[Stephen DeRosa]], on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=Goldman, Herbert G.|title= Banjo Eyes: Eddie Cantor and the Birth of Modern Stardom |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|id=}}\n* Weinstein, David (2018).

The Newark entertainment started at 7 o'clock: a children's half-hour of music and fairy stories; 7:[35?], Hawaiian airs and violin solo; 8:00, news of the day; and at 8:20, a radio party with nationally known comedians participating; 9:55, Arlington time signals and 10:01, a government weather report. G. E. Nothnagle, who conducts a radiophone station at his home 176 Waldemere Avenue said last night that he was delighted with the program, especially with the numbers sung by Eddie Cantor. The weather conditions are excellent for receiving, he continued, the tone and the quality of the messages was fine.<ref>\"Radio Operators Hear a Good Concert\", ''Bridgeport Telegram'', February 4, 1922.</ref>\n[[File:Bert Gordon Eddie Cantor NBC.JPG|thumb|180px|Cantor (right) with Bert Gordon, AKA \"the Mad Russian\".]]\nCantor's appearance with [[Rudy Vallee]] on Vallee's ''[[The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour]]'' on February 5, 1931 led to a four-week tryout with [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Chase and Sanborn Hour]]''. Replacing [[Maurice Chevalier]], who was returning to Paris, Cantor joined ''Chase and Sanborn'' on September 13, 1931. This hour-long Sunday evening variety series teamed Cantor with announcer Jimmy Wallington and violinist Dave Rubinoff. The show established Cantor as a leading comedian, and his scriptwriter, [[David Freedman]], as \u201cthe Captain of Comedy.\u201d Freedman's team included, among others, Samuel \"Doc\" Kurtzman, who also wrote for song-and-dance man, Al Jolson, and the comedian Jack Benny. Cantor soon became the world's highest-paid radio star. His shows began with a crowd chanting \"We want Can-tor! We want Can-tor!\", a phrase said to have originated in vaudeville, when the audience chanted to chase off an act on the bill before Cantor. Cantor's [[theme song]] was his own lyric to the Leo Robin/Richard Whiting song, \"One Hour with You\".  His radio sidekicks included [[Bert Gordon (comedian)|Bert Gordon]], (comic Barney Gorodetsky, AKA \"The Mad Russian\") and [[Harry Parke]] (better known as \"Parkyakarkus\"). Cantor also discovered and helped guide the career of singer [[Dinah Shore]], first featuring her on his radio show in 1940, as well as other performers, including [[Deanna Durbin]], [[Bobby Breen]] in 1936 and [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] in 1949.\n\nIndicative of his effect on the mass audience, he agreed in November 1934 to introduce a new song by the songwriters [[J. Fred Coots]] and [[Haven Gillespie]] that other well-known artists had rejected as being \"silly\" and \"childish\". The song, \"[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]]\", immediately had orders for 100,000 copies of sheet music the next day. It sold 400,000 copies by Christmas of that year.<ref name=\"Book Ref\">{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Ace|title=Stories Behind the Greatest Hits of Christmas|date=5 October 2010|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=978-0310327950|page=[https://archive.org/details/storiesbehindgre0000coll/page/224 224]|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/storiesbehindgre0000coll|chapter-url-access=registration|quote=Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.|accessdate=20 August 2014|ref=Stories Behind|chapter=4 Santa Claus Is Coming to Town}}</ref>\n\nHis NBC radio show, ''Time to Smile'', was broadcast from 1940 to 1946, followed by his ''[[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] Show'' from 1946 through 1949. He also served as emcee of ''[[The $64 Question]]'' during 1949\u201350, and hosted a weekly disc jockey program for [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]] during the 1952\u201353 season. In addition to film and radio, Cantor recorded for [[Hit of the Week Records]], then again for Columbia, for [[Banner Records|Banner]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]] and various small labels.\n\nIn the early 1960s he [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] a short radio segment, \"Ask Eddie Cantor\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioechoes.com/?page=series&genre=OTR-Talk&series=Ask+Eddie+Cantor|title=RadioEchoes.com|website=www.radioechoes.com}}</ref><ref name=\"Weinstein2017\">{{cite book|author=David Weinstein|title=The Eddie Cantor Story: A Jewish Life in Performance and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA226|date=7 November 2017|publisher=Brandeis University Press|isbn=978-1-5126-0134-3|pages=226\u2013}}</ref>\n\nHis heavy political involvement began early in his career, including his participation in the strike to form Actors Equity in 1919, provoking the anger of father figure and producer, Florenz Ziegfeld. At the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], Cantor publicly denounced [[antisemitic]] radio personality [[Father Charles Coughlin]] and, subsequently,  dropped by his radio sponsor, [[Camel cigarettes]]. A year and a half later, Eddie was able to return to the air thanks to help from his friend [[Jack Benny]].\n\n===Recordings===\nCantor began making phonograph records in 1917, recording both comedy songs and routines and popular songs of the day, first for [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]], then for [[Aeoleon-Vocalion]], [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]], and [[Emerson Records|Emerson]]. From 1921 through 1925, he had an exclusive contract with [[Columbia Records]], returning to Victor for the remainder of the decade.\n\nCantor was one of the era's most successful entertainers, but the 1929 [[stock market crash]] took away his multimillionaire status and left him deeply in debt. However, Cantor's relentless attention to his own earnings to avoid the poverty he knew growing up caused him to use his writing talent, quickly building a new bank account with his highly popular, bestselling books of humor and cartoons about his experience, ''Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street''<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/caught-short-a-saga-of-wailing-wall-street/oclc/381325 \"'Caught short! A saga of wailing Wall street', OCLC Number: 381325\"] worldcat.org, accessed September 5, 2011</ref> in 1929 \"A.C.\" (After Crash), and ''Yoo-Hoo, Prosperity!''\n\nCantor was also a composer, with his most famous song seldom attributed to him. In 1935, along with Charles Tobias and Murray Mencher, Cantor wrote \"Merrily We Roll Along\", which he recorded in the 1950s. It was adapted as the themesong for the ''Merrie Melodies'' series of [[animated cartoons]], distributed by [[Warner Brothers Pictures]] between 1937 and 1964. Cantor himself was frequently caricatured in Warner cartoons of the period, (see Film and television: Animation).\n\n==Film and television==\n[[File:Eddie Cantor - 1933.jpg|thumb|in ''[[Roman Scandals]]'' (1933)]]\nCantor also bounced between films and radio. He had previously appeared in a number of short films, performing his ''Follies'' songs and comedy routines, and two silent features (''Special Delivery'' and ''Kid Boots'') in the 1920s. He was offered the lead in ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' after it was turned down by [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]]. Cantor also turned the role down (so it went to [[Al Jolson]]), but he became a leading Hollywood star in 1930 with the film version of ''[[Whoopee! (film)|Whoopee!]],'' shot in two-color [[Technicolor]]. He continued making films over the next two decades until his last starring role in ''If You Knew Susie'' (1948). In the 1950s Eddie Cantor had his own television show, entertaining a live audience.\n\n==Filmography==\n* ''[[A Few Moments with Eddie Cantor|A Few Moments With Eddie Cantor, Star of \"Kid Boots\"]]'' (1923) (DeForest [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film short film)\n* ''[[Kid Boots (film)|Kid Boots]]'' (1926)\n* ''[[Special Delivery (1927 film)|Special Delivery]]'' (1927)\n* ''A Ziegfeld Midnight Frolic'' (1929) (short)\n* ''[[Glorifying the American Girl]]'' (1929)\n* ''[[That Party in Person]]'' (1928) (short)\n* ''[[Insurance (1930 film)|Insurance]]'' (1930) (short)\n* ''[[Getting a Ticket]]'' (1930) (short)\n* ''[[Whoopee!

Cantor, one of the first major stars to agree to appear on television, was to sing \"We're Havin' a Baby, My Baby and Me\".  Arriving shortly before airtime at the New York studios, Cantor was reportedly told to cut the song because the NBC New York censors considered some of the lyrics too risqu\u00e9. Cantor refused, claiming no time to prepare an alternative number. NBC relented, but the sound was cut and the picture blurred on certain lines in the song. This is considered the first instance of television censorship.<ref>\"Cantor Censored in Televised Act\". ''The New York Times''. May 27, 1944</ref>\n\nIn 1950,  he became the first of several hosts alternating on the NBC television variety show ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'', in which he would introduce musical acts, stage and film stars and play comic characters such as \"Maxie the Taxi\". In the spring of 1952, Cantor landed in an unlikely controversy when a young [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], appeared as a guest performer. Cantor embraced Davis and mopped Davis's brow with his handkerchief after his performance. When worried sponsors led NBC to threaten cancellation of the show, Cantor's response was to book Davis for two more weeks.  Cantor suffered a heart attack following a September 1952 Colgate broadcast, and thereafter, curtailed his appearances until his final program in 1954.  In 1955, he appeared in a filmed series for syndication and a year later, appeared in two dramatic roles (\"George Has A Birthday\", on NBC's ''Matinee Theatre'' broadcast in color, and \"Sizeman and Son\" on CBS's ''Playhouse 90'').  He continued to appear as a guest on several shows, and was last seen on the NBC color broadcast of ''The Future Lies Ahead'' on January 22, 1960, which also featured [[Mort Sahl]].\n\n===Animation===\nCantor appears in caricature form in numerous ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons produced for Warner Bros., although he was often voiced by an imitator. Beginning with ''I Like Mountain Music'' (1933), other animated Cantor [[cameo role|cameos]] include ''Shuffle Off to Buffalo'' ([[Harman-Ising]], 1933) and ''[[Billboard Frolics]]'' ([[Friz Freleng]], 1935).  Eddie Cantor is one of the four \"down on their luck\" stars (along with [[Bing Crosby]], Al Jolson, and Jack Benny) snubbed by [[Elmer Fudd]] in ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1950 film)|What\u2019s Up, Doc?]]'' ([[Bob McKimson]], 1950). In ''[[Farm Frolics]]'' ([[Bob Clampett]], 1941), a horse, asked by the narrator to \"do a canter\", promptly launches into a singing, dancing, eye-rolling impression. The Cantor gag that got the most mileage, however, was his oft-repeated wish for a son after five famous daughters. ''[[Slap-Happy Pappy]]'' (Clampett, 1940) features an \"Eddie Cackler\" rooster that wants a boy, to little avail. Other references can be found in ''[[Baby Bottleneck]]'' (Clampett, 1946) and ''Circus Today'' ([[Tex Avery]], 1940). In ''Merrie Melodies'', ''[[The Coo-Coo Nut Grove]]'' Cantor's many daughters are referenced by a group of singing quintuplet girls. In ''Porky\u2019s Naughty Nephew'' (Clampett, 1938) a swimming Cantor gleefully adopts a \"buoy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.i-foo.com/~eocostello/wbcc/eowbcc-c.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007104507/http://www.i-foo.com/~eocostello/wbcc/eowbcc-c.html|url-status=dead|title=From ''The Warner Bros.

In 1933, a set of 12 Eddie Cantor caricatures by Frederick J. Garner was <!-- set is singular -->published by Brown and Bigelow. These advertising cards were purchased in bulk as a direct-mail item by such businesses as auto body shops, funeral directors, dental laboratories, and vegetable wholesale dealers. With the full set, companies could mail a single Cantor card each month for a year to their selected special customers as an ongoing promotion. Cantor was often caricatured on the covers of [[sheet music]] and in magazines and newspapers. Cantor was depicted as a balloon in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/galleries/entertainment/entertainment.html |title=Floating back in time with Macy's balloons, 1940, photo No.11|author=New York Daily News|date=2008-11-28|accessdate=2008-11-28}}</ref> one of the very few balloons based on a real person.\n\nIn addition to ''Caught Short!'', Cantor wrote or co-wrote at least seven other books, including booklets released by the then-fledgling firm of [[Simon & Schuster]], with Cantor's name on the cover. (Some were \"as told to\" or written with [[David Freedman]].) Customers paid a dollar and received the booklet with a penny embedded in the hardcover. They sold well, and [[H. L. Mencken]] asserted that these books did more to pull America out of the [[Great Depression]] than all government measures combined.\n\n===Bibliography===\n* ''My Life Is in Your Hands'' by Eddie Cantor (1928) with David Freedman; Harper & Bros.\n* ''Caught Short!: A Saga of Wailing Wall Street'' by Eddie Cantor (1929) Simon & Schuster\n* ''Between the Acts'' by Eddie Cantor (1930) Simon & Schuster\n* ''Yoo-Hoo, Prosperity!: The Eddie Cantor Five-Year Plan'' by Eddie Cantor (1931) with David Freedman; Simon & Schuster\n* ''The Rise of the Goldbergs'' by Gertrude Berg (1931) Foreword by Eddie Cantor; Barse & Co.\n* ''Your Next President!'' by Eddie Cantor (1932) with David Freedman, Illus. by S.L.

The film found an audience but might have done better with someone else in the leading role. Actor [[Keefe Brasselle]] played Cantor as a caricature with high-pressure dialogue and bulging eyes wide open; the fact that Brasselle was considerably taller than Cantor did not lend realism, either. Eddie and Ida Cantor were seen in a brief prologue and epilogue set in a projection room, where they are watching Brasselle in action; at the end of the film, Eddie tells Ida, \"I never looked better in my life\"... and gives the audience a knowing, incredulous look.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} [[George Burns]], in his memoir ''All My Best Friends'', claimed that Warner Bros. created a miracle producing the movie in that \"it made Eddie Cantor's life boring\".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nSomething closer to the real Eddie Cantor story is his self-produced feature ''Show Business'' (1944), a valentine to vaudeville and show folks, which was [[RKO]]'s top-grossing film that year.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nProbably the best summary of Cantor's career is on one of the ''[[Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' shows.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pondillo|first1=Bob|title=Racial Discourse and Censorship on NBC-TV, 1948-60|journal=Journal of Popular Film & Television|date=2005|volume=33|issue=2|page=106|doi=10.3200/JPFT.33.2.102-114}}</ref> Re-issued on DVD as ''Eddie Cantor in Person'', the hour-long episode is a virtual video autobiography, with Eddie recounting his career, singing his greatest hits, and recreating his singing-waiter days with another vaudeville legend, his old pal [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nCantor appears as a recurring character, played by [[Stephen DeRosa]], on the [[HBO]] series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=Goldman, Herbert G.|title= Banjo Eyes: Eddie Cantor and the Birth of Modern Stardom |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|id=}}\n* Weinstein, David (2018).
