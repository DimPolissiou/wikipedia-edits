It consists of two concentric tubes and a central protrusion. Propellant A (usually the oxidizer, represented with blue in the image) flows through an outer tube, coming out as a cylindrical stream, while propellant B (usually the fuel, represented with red in the image) flows within an inner tube and impinges on a central [[pintle]]-shaped protrusion, (similar in shape to a [[poppet valve]] like those found on [[four-stroke engine]]s), spraying out in a broad cone or a flat sheet that intersects the cylindrical stream of propellant A.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> \nIn the typical pintle-based engine design, only a single central injector is used, differing from \"showerhead\" injector plates which use multiple parallel injector ports.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nThrottleability can be obtained either by placing valves before the injector, or by moving the inner pintle or outer sleeve.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nMany people have experienced throttleable pintle sprayers in the form of standard garden hose-end sprayers.<ref name=\":4\">\n{{cite web|url=http://blog.nss.org/?p=1900|title=Pintle Injector Rocket Engines|last=Fischer|first=Dave|work=National Space Society Blog|publisher=National Space Society|accessdate=2013-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712163852/http://blog.nss.org/?p=1900|archive-date=2012-07-12|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n[[File:Pintle injector, inner flow only.jpg|alt=A pintle injector is shown during a cold flow test. The inner flow path is active.|thumb|A pintle injector is shown during a [[cold flow test]]. The inner flow path is active.]]\n\n=== Variants ===\nIn pintle engines that do not require throttling, the pintle is fixed in place, and propellant valves for startup and shutdown are placed somewhere else.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nA movable pintle allows for throttleability, and, if the moving part is the sleeve, the pintle itself can act as the propellant valve. This is called a Face Shutoff pintle. A fast-moving sleeve allows for the engine to be operated in pulses, and this is usually done in pintle-based [[Reaction control system|RCS]] thrusters and missile divert thrusters.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn a variant of the Face Shutoff pintle, the pintle itself is hydraulically actuated by the fuel via a pilot valve, and no extra valves are required between the engine and tanks. This is called an FSO (Face Shutoff Only) pintle.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn some variants the pintle has grooves or orifices cut into it to produce radial jets in the flow of propellant B, this allows for extra unburned fuel to impinge on the walls of the combustion chamber, and provide fuel film cooling.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The pintle pictured here is of this type.\n[[File:Pintle injector, outer flow only.jpg|alt=A pintle injector is shown during a cold flow test. The outer flow path is active.|thumb|A pintle injector is shown during a cold flow test. The outer flow path is active.]]\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n\n=== Advantages ===\nCompared to some injector design archetypes, pintle injectors allow greater throttling of bipropellant flow rates, though it is worth noting that throttling rocket engines in general is still very difficult. If only one central injector is used, the mass flow inside the combustion chamber will include two main recirculation zones which decrease acoustic instability without necessarily requiring acoustic cavities or baffles.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe pintle injector design can deliver high combustion efficiency (typically 96\u201399%).<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n[[File:Pintle injector, inner and outer flow.png|alt=A pintle injector is shown during a cold flow test. Both flow paths are active.|thumb|A pintle injector is shown during a cold flow test. Both flow paths are active.]]\nIf fuel is chosen for the inner flow (which is the case in most pintle-based engines), the injector can be tuned so that any excess fuel which is not reacted immediately as it passes through the oxidizer stream is projected onto the combustion chamber walls and cools them through evaporation, thus providing fuel film cooling to the combustion chamber walls, without incurring the mass penalty of a dedicated coolant subsystem.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://selenianboondocks.com/2006/01/some-spacex-commentary/ |title=Some SpaceX Commentary {{!}} Selenian Boondocks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref>\n\nWhile pintle injectors have been developed for applications in rocket propulsion, due to their relative simplicity, they could easily be adapted for industrial fluid handling processes requiring high flowrate and thorough mixing.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Atomization and Sprays: Theory and Applications |last1=Heister |first1=S.D. |date=25 February 2011 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-7263-7 |editor1-last=Ashgriz |editor1-first=Nasser |edition=2011 |location=New York |pages=647\u2013655 |language=en |chapter=Chapter 28: Pintle Injectors |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-7264-4_28}}</ref>\n\nA given injector's performance can be easily optimized by varying the geometries of the outer propellant's annular gap and the central propellant slots (and/or continuous gap, if used). As this requires only two new pieces to be made, trying variations is usually cheaper and less time-consuming than with regular injectors.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nBecause combustion tends to occur in the surface of a [[frustum]], peak thermal stresses are localized on the combustion chamber wall rather than a more evenly distributed combustion across the chamber section and more even heating. This has to be contemplated when designing the cooling system, or it might cause burn-through.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe pintle injector is known to have caused throat erosion problems in the early ablatively cooled Merlin engines due to uneven mixing causing hot streaks in the flow, however, as of 2019, it is not clear whether this is a problem that applies to all pintle-based engines, or if this was a design problem of the Merlin.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1098644877259096064 |title=Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks.

Elverum Jr.|'''''Gerard W. Elverum Jr.''''']] was employed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], and working under the supervision of [[Art Grant]] to characterize the reaction rates of new rocket propellants by using a device consisting of two concentric tubes, through which propellants were fed at a known flowrate, and a set of [[thermocouple]]s to measure their reaction rates. The device encountered problems, because as the propellants were flowing parallel to each other, not much mixing was happening. '''Elverum''' then placed a tip at the end of the innermost tube, attached to an internal support, which forced the inner propellant to flow outwards and mix with the outer propellant. This device worked fine for low energy propellants, but when high energy combinations started being tested, it proved impractical due to nearly instantaneous reaction times at the mixing point. In order to keep the device from blowing itself apart during high energy tests, the outer tube was retracted, constituting then a primitive pintle injector.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nWorking under the supervision of Program Manager [[Gerard W. Elverum Jr.|'''''Gerard W. Elverum Jr''''']], Peter Staudhammer had a technician cut multiple slots across the end of an available inner tube and subsequent tests of this new configuration showed a substantial improvement in mixing efficiency.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== 1960s ===\nBy 1960, Elverum, Grant, and Staudhammer had moved to the newly-formed Space Technology Laboratories, Inc. (Later [[TRW Inc.|TRW, Inc]].) to pursue development of [[Monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] and [[Liquid rocket propellant|bipropellant]] rocket engines. By 1961, the pintle injector was developed into a design usable in rocket engines, and subsequently, the pintle injector design was matured and developed by a number of TRW employees, adding such features as throttling, rapid pulsing capability, and face shutoff.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nThrottling was tested in the 1961 [[MIRA 500]], at 25 to 500 [[Pound (force)|lbf]] (111 to 2,224 [[Newton (unit)|N]]) and its 1962 successor, the [[MIRA 5000]], at 250 to 5,000&nbsp;lbf (1,112 to 22,241 N).<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn 1963, TRW introduced the [[MIRA 150A]] as a backup for the [[Thiokol]] [[TD-339]] [[vernier thruster]] to be used in the [[Surveyor program|Surveyor probes]], and started development of the [[Apollo Program|Apollo]] [[Lunar Excursion Module]]'s [[Descent Propulsion System]]. Near this time, a pintle injector was considered for simplicity and lower cost on the [[Sea Dragon (rocket)|Sea Dragon]].<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn parallel with those projects, TRW continued development of other pintle engines, including by 1966 the URSA ([[Universal Rocket for Space Applications]]) series. These were bipropellant engines offered at fixed thrusts of 25, 100, or 200&nbsp;lbf, (111, 445, or 890 N) with options for either ablative or radiatively cooled combustion chambers. These engines were capable of pulsing at 35 [[Hertz|Hz]], with pulse widths as small as .02 seconds, but also had design steady state firing life in excess of 10,000 seconds (with radiatively-cooled chambers).<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn 1967 the Apollo Descent Propulsion System was qualified for flight.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nFrom 1968 to 1970, a 250,000&nbsp;lbf (1,112,055 N) engine was tested.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn 1972 the Apollo Descent Propulsion System ended production, but starting in 1974, and continuing through 1988, the [[TR-201]], a simplified, low cost derivative of it, featuring ablative cooling and fixed thrust, was used in the second stage of the [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta 2914 and 3914]] launch vehicles.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn October 1972, the pintle injector design was patented and made public.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn the early 1980s, a series of design refinements were applied to the pintle injector obtaining exceptionally fast and repeatable pulses on command and linear throttling capability. By enabling shutoff of propellants at their injection point into the combustion chamber, the pintle injector provided excellent pulse response by eliminating injector \"dribble volume\" effects.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nStarting in 1981, a very compact, 8,200&nbsp;lbf [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]]/[[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]] engine employing this feature was developed as a pitch and yaw thruster for the army's [[Sentry program|SENTRY]] missile program. This engine could throttle over a 19:1 thrust range and deliver repeatable \"on\" pulses as small as 8 milliseconds at any thrust level.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nA further refinement of the face shutoff injector was used on the Army Strategic Defense Command's [[Exoatmospheric Reentry-vehicle Interceptor Subsystem]] (ERIS). In its 900&nbsp;lbf lateral divert engines the injector shutoff element provided the only control of propellant flow. The large bipropellant valve normally required in such engines was replaced by a small pilot valve that used high pressure fuel ([[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]]) to hydraulically actuate the moveable injector sleeve. This feature, called FSO (Face Shutoff Only) greatly improved overall thruster response and significantly reduced engine size and mass.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nAnother design challenge from the mid 1980s and early 1990s was that of obtaining miniaturization of rocket engines. As part of the Air Force [[Brilliant Pebbles]] program, TRW developed a very small 5&nbsp;lbf (22 N) [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]]/[[hydrazine]] thruster using a pintle injector. This radiatively-cooled engine weighed 0.3&nbsp;lb (135 grams) and was successfully tested in August 1993, delivering over 300 seconds [[Specific impulse|''I''<sub>sp</sub>]] with a 150:1 nozzle expansion ratio. The pintle diameter was 0.066 inches (1.6764&nbsp;mm) and [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] was needed to verify the dimensions on the 0.0030 inch \u00b10.0003 inch (0.0762&nbsp;mm \u00b10.00762&nbsp;mm) radial metering orifices.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe preceding technology innovations enabled the first exoatmospheric kinetic kill of a simulated reentry warhead off [[Kwajalein Atoll|Kwajalein atoll]] on 28 January 1991 on the first flight of [[Exoatmospheric Reentry-vehicle Interceptor Subsystem|ERIS]].<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn the late '90s, FSO pintle injectors were used with gelled propellants, which have a normal consistency like that of smooth [[peanut butter]]. Gelled propellants typically use either aluminum powder or carbon powder to increase the energy density of the liquid fuel base (typically [[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]]) and they use additives to [[Rheology|rheologically]] match the oxidizer (typically [[Red fuming nitric acid|IRFNA]] based) to the fuel. For gelled propellants to be used on a rocket, face shutoff is mandatory to prevent dry-out of the base liquid during off times between pulses, which would otherwise result in the solids within the gels plugging the injector passages. FSO pintle injectors were used on a variety of programs, the [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[Advanced Crew Escape Seat]] \u2013 Experimental (ACES-X) program and its successor, the [[Gel Escape System Propulsion]] (GESP) program.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nAnother major design adaptation in this time period was the use of pintle injectors with [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel. Beginning in 1991, TRW joined with McDonnell Douglas and NASA Lewis (now Glenn) Research Center to demonstrate that TRW's pintle engine could use direct injection of liquid hydrogen to simplify the design of high-performance booster engines. Attempts to use direct injection of cryogenic hydrogen in other types of injectors had until then consistently resulted in the onset of combustion instabilities.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn late 1991 and early 1992, a 16,000&nbsp;lbf (71,172 N) [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH2]] test engine was successfully operated with direct injection of liquid hydrogen and [[liquid oxygen]] propellants. A total of 67 firings were conducted, and the engine demonstrated excellent performance and total absence of combustion instabilities. Subsequently, this same test engine was adapted for and was successfully tested with [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH2]] at 40,000&nbsp;lbf (177,929 N) and with [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[RP-1]] at 13,000 and 40,000&nbsp;lbf. (57,827 and 177,929 N).<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nAt the same time, [[TR-306]] liquid apogee engines were used on the [[Anik (satellite)|Anik E-1/E-2]] and [[Intelsat K]] spacecraft.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn August 1999 the dual mode [[TR-308]] was used to place [[NASA]]'s [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] spacecraft on its final orbit.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nThe early FSO injector and gel propellant development work of the late 1980s and early 1990s led to the world's first missile flights using gelled oxidizer and gelled fuel propellants on the Army's/AMCOM's [[Future Missile Technology Integration]] (FMTI) program, with the first flight in March 1999 and the second flight in May 2000.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn the early 2000s TRW continued development of large [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH2]] pintle engines, and test-fired the [[TR-106]] at NASA's [[John C. Stennis Space Center]]. This was a 650,000&nbsp;lbf (2,892,000 N) engine, a 16:1 scale-up from the largest previous [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH2]] pintle engine and about a 3:1 scale-up from the largest previous pintle engine ever tested.

It consists of two concentric tubes and a central protrusion. Propellant A (usually the oxidizer, represented with blue in the image) flows through an outer tube, coming out as a cylindrical stream, while propellant B (usually the fuel, represented with red in the image) flows within an inner tube and impinges on a central [[pintle]]-shaped protrusion, (similar in shape to a [[poppet valve]] like those found on [[four-stroke engine]]s), spraying out in a broad cone or a flat sheet that intersects the cylindrical stream of propellant A.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> \nIn the typical pintle-based engine design, only a single central injector is used, differing from \"showerhead\" injector plates which use multiple parallel injector ports.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nThrottleability can be obtained either by placing valves before the injector, or by moving the inner pintle or outer sleeve.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nMany people have experienced throttleable pintle sprayers in the form of standard garden hose-end sprayers.<ref name=\":4\">\n{{cite web|url=http://blog.nss.org/?p=1900|title=Pintle Injector Rocket Engines|last=Fischer|first=Dave|work=National Space Society Blog|publisher=National Space Society|accessdate=2013-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712163852/http://blog.nss.org/?p=1900|archive-date=2012-07-12|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n[[File:Pintle injector, inner flow only.jpg|alt=A pintle injector is shown during a cold flow test. The inner flow path is active.|thumb|A pintle injector is shown during a [[cold flow test]]. The inner flow path is active.]]\n\n=== Variants ===\nIn pintle engines that do not require throttling, the pintle is fixed in place, and propellant valves for startup and shutdown are placed somewhere else.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nA movable pintle allows for throttleability, and, if the moving part is the sleeve, the pintle itself can act as the propellant valve. This is called a Face Shutoff pintle. A fast-moving sleeve allows for the engine to be operated in pulses, and this is usually done in pintle-based [[Reaction control system|RCS]] thrusters and missile divert thrusters.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn a variant of the Face Shutoff pintle, the pintle itself is hydraulically actuated by the fuel via a pilot valve, and no extra valves are required between the engine and tanks. This is called an FSO (Face Shutoff Only) pintle.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn some variants the pintle has grooves or orifices cut into it to produce radial jets in the flow of propellant B, this allows for extra unburned fuel to impinge on the walls of the combustion chamber, and provide fuel film cooling.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The pintle pictured here is of this type.\n[[File:Pintle injector, outer flow only.jpg|alt=A pintle injector is shown during a cold flow test. The outer flow path is active.|thumb|A pintle injector is shown during a cold flow test. The outer flow path is active.]]\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\n\n=== Advantages ===\nCompared to some injector design archetypes, pintle injectors allow greater throttling of bipropellant flow rates, though it is worth noting that throttling rocket engines in general is still very difficult. If only one central injector is used, the mass flow inside the combustion chamber will include two main recirculation zones which decrease acoustic instability without necessarily requiring acoustic cavities or baffles.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe pintle injector design can deliver high combustion efficiency (typically 96\u201399%).<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n[[File:Pintle injector, inner and outer flow.png|alt=A pintle injector is shown during a cold flow test. Both flow paths are active.|thumb|A pintle injector is shown during a cold flow test. Both flow paths are active.]]\nIf fuel is chosen for the inner flow (which is the case in most pintle-based engines), the injector can be tuned so that any excess fuel which is not reacted immediately as it passes through the oxidizer stream is projected onto the combustion chamber walls and cools them through evaporation, thus providing fuel film cooling to the combustion chamber walls, without incurring the mass penalty of a dedicated coolant subsystem.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://selenianboondocks.com/2006/01/some-spacex-commentary/ |title=Some SpaceX Commentary {{!}} Selenian Boondocks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref>\n\nWhile pintle injectors have been developed for applications in rocket propulsion, due to their relative simplicity, they could easily be adapted for industrial fluid handling processes requiring high flowrate and thorough mixing.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook of Atomization and Sprays: Theory and Applications |last1=Heister |first1=S.D. |date=25 February 2011 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4419-7263-7 |editor1-last=Ashgriz |editor1-first=Nasser |edition=2011 |location=New York |pages=647\u2013655 |language=en |chapter=Chapter 28: Pintle Injectors |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-7264-4_28}}</ref>\n\nA given injector's performance can be easily optimized by varying the geometries of the outer propellant's annular gap and the central propellant slots (and/or continuous gap, if used). As this requires only two new pieces to be made, trying variations is usually cheaper and less time-consuming than with regular injectors.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nBecause combustion tends to occur in the surface of a [[frustum]], peak thermal stresses are localized on the combustion chamber wall rather than a more evenly distributed combustion across the chamber section and more even heating. This has to be contemplated when designing the cooling system, or it might cause burn-through.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe pintle injector is known to have caused throat erosion problems in the early ablatively cooled Merlin engines due to uneven mixing causing hot streaks in the flow, however, as of 2019, it is not clear whether this is a problem that applies to all pintle-based engines, or if this was a design problem of the Merlin.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1098644877259096064 |title=Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks.

Elverum Jr.|'''''Gerard W. Elverum Jr.''''']] was employed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], and working under the supervision of [[Art Grant]] to characterize the reaction rates of new rocket propellants by using a device consisting of two concentric tubes, through which propellants were fed at a known flowrate, and a set of [[thermocouple]]s to measure their reaction rates. The device encountered problems, because as the propellants were flowing parallel to each other, not much mixing was happening. '''Elverum''' then placed a tip at the end of the innermost tube, attached to an internal support, which forced the inner propellant to flow outwards and mix with the outer propellant. This device worked fine for low energy propellants, but when high energy combinations started being tested, it proved impractical due to nearly instantaneous reaction times at the mixing point. In order to keep the device from blowing itself apart during high energy tests, the outer tube was retracted, constituting then a primitive pintle injector.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nWorking under the supervision of Program Manager [[Gerard W. Elverum Jr.|'''''Gerard W. Elverum Jr''''']], [[Peter Staudhammer]] had a technician cut multiple slots across the end of an available inner tube and subsequent tests of this new configuration showed a substantial improvement in mixing efficiency.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== 1960s ===\nBy 1960, Elverum, Grant, and Staudhammer had moved to the newly-formed Space Technology Laboratories, Inc. (Later [[TRW Inc.|TRW, Inc]].) to pursue development of [[Monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] and [[Liquid rocket propellant|bipropellant]] rocket engines. By 1961, the pintle injector was developed into a design usable in rocket engines, and subsequently, the pintle injector design was matured and developed by a number of TRW employees, adding such features as throttling, rapid pulsing capability, and face shutoff.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nThrottling was tested in the 1961 [[MIRA 500]], at 25 to 500 [[Pound (force)|lbf]] (111 to 2,224 [[Newton (unit)|N]]) and its 1962 successor, the [[MIRA 5000]], at 250 to 5,000&nbsp;lbf (1,112 to 22,241 N).<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn 1963, TRW introduced the [[MIRA 150A]] as a backup for the [[Thiokol]] [[TD-339]] [[vernier thruster]] to be used in the [[Surveyor program|Surveyor probes]], and started development of the [[Apollo Program|Apollo]] [[Lunar Excursion Module]]'s [[Descent Propulsion System]]. Near this time, a pintle injector was considered for simplicity and lower cost on the [[Sea Dragon (rocket)|Sea Dragon]].<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn parallel with those projects, TRW continued development of other pintle engines, including by 1966 the URSA ([[Universal Rocket for Space Applications]]) series. These were bipropellant engines offered at fixed thrusts of 25, 100, or 200&nbsp;lbf, (111, 445, or 890 N) with options for either ablative or radiatively cooled combustion chambers. These engines were capable of pulsing at 35 [[Hertz|Hz]], with pulse widths as small as .02 seconds, but also had design steady state firing life in excess of 10,000 seconds (with radiatively-cooled chambers).<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn 1967 the Apollo Descent Propulsion System was qualified for flight.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nFrom 1968 to 1970, a 250,000&nbsp;lbf (1,112,055 N) engine was tested.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn 1972 the Apollo Descent Propulsion System ended production, but starting in 1974, and continuing through 1988, the [[TR-201]], a simplified, low cost derivative of it, featuring ablative cooling and fixed thrust, was used in the second stage of the [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta 2914 and 3914]] launch vehicles.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn October 1972, the pintle injector design was patented and made public.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn the early 1980s, a series of design refinements were applied to the pintle injector obtaining exceptionally fast and repeatable pulses on command and linear throttling capability. By enabling shutoff of propellants at their injection point into the combustion chamber, the pintle injector provided excellent pulse response by eliminating injector \"dribble volume\" effects.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nStarting in 1981, a very compact, 8,200&nbsp;lbf [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]]/[[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]] engine employing this feature was developed as a pitch and yaw thruster for the army's [[Sentry program|SENTRY]] missile program. This engine could throttle over a 19:1 thrust range and deliver repeatable \"on\" pulses as small as 8 milliseconds at any thrust level.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nA further refinement of the face shutoff injector was used on the Army Strategic Defense Command's [[Exoatmospheric Reentry-vehicle Interceptor Subsystem]] (ERIS). In its 900&nbsp;lbf lateral divert engines the injector shutoff element provided the only control of propellant flow. The large bipropellant valve normally required in such engines was replaced by a small pilot valve that used high pressure fuel ([[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]]) to hydraulically actuate the moveable injector sleeve. This feature, called FSO (Face Shutoff Only) greatly improved overall thruster response and significantly reduced engine size and mass.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nAnother design challenge from the mid 1980s and early 1990s was that of obtaining miniaturization of rocket engines. As part of the Air Force [[Brilliant Pebbles]] program, TRW developed a very small 5&nbsp;lbf (22 N) [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]]/[[hydrazine]] thruster using a pintle injector. This radiatively-cooled engine weighed 0.3&nbsp;lb (135 grams) and was successfully tested in August 1993, delivering over 300 seconds [[Specific impulse|''I''<sub>sp</sub>]] with a 150:1 nozzle expansion ratio. The pintle diameter was 0.066 inches (1.6764&nbsp;mm) and [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] was needed to verify the dimensions on the 0.0030 inch \u00b10.0003 inch (0.0762&nbsp;mm \u00b10.00762&nbsp;mm) radial metering orifices.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe preceding technology innovations enabled the first exoatmospheric kinetic kill of a simulated reentry warhead off [[Kwajalein Atoll|Kwajalein atoll]] on 28 January 1991 on the first flight of [[Exoatmospheric Reentry-vehicle Interceptor Subsystem|ERIS]].<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn the late '90s, FSO pintle injectors were used with gelled propellants, which have a normal consistency like that of smooth [[peanut butter]]. Gelled propellants typically use either aluminum powder or carbon powder to increase the energy density of the liquid fuel base (typically [[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]]) and they use additives to [[Rheology|rheologically]] match the oxidizer (typically [[Red fuming nitric acid|IRFNA]] based) to the fuel. For gelled propellants to be used on a rocket, face shutoff is mandatory to prevent dry-out of the base liquid during off times between pulses, which would otherwise result in the solids within the gels plugging the injector passages. FSO pintle injectors were used on a variety of programs, the [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[Advanced Crew Escape Seat]] \u2013 Experimental (ACES-X) program and its successor, the [[Gel Escape System Propulsion]] (GESP) program.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nAnother major design adaptation in this time period was the use of pintle injectors with [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] [[liquid hydrogen]] fuel. Beginning in 1991, TRW joined with McDonnell Douglas and NASA Lewis (now Glenn) Research Center to demonstrate that TRW's pintle engine could use direct injection of liquid hydrogen to simplify the design of high-performance booster engines. Attempts to use direct injection of cryogenic hydrogen in other types of injectors had until then consistently resulted in the onset of combustion instabilities.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn late 1991 and early 1992, a 16,000&nbsp;lbf (71,172 N) [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH2]] test engine was successfully operated with direct injection of liquid hydrogen and [[liquid oxygen]] propellants. A total of 67 firings were conducted, and the engine demonstrated excellent performance and total absence of combustion instabilities. Subsequently, this same test engine was adapted for and was successfully tested with [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH2]] at 40,000&nbsp;lbf (177,929 N) and with [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[RP-1]] at 13,000 and 40,000&nbsp;lbf. (57,827 and 177,929 N).<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nAt the same time, [[TR-306]] liquid apogee engines were used on the [[Anik (satellite)|Anik E-1/E-2]] and [[Intelsat K]] spacecraft.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nIn August 1999 the dual mode [[TR-308]] was used to place [[NASA]]'s [[Chandra X-ray Observatory|Chandra]] spacecraft on its final orbit.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\nThe early FSO injector and gel propellant development work of the late 1980s and early 1990s led to the world's first missile flights using gelled oxidizer and gelled fuel propellants on the Army's/AMCOM's [[Future Missile Technology Integration]] (FMTI) program, with the first flight in March 1999 and the second flight in May 2000.<ref name=\"trwpintle\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn the early 2000s TRW continued development of large [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH2]] pintle engines, and test-fired the [[TR-106]] at NASA's [[John C. Stennis Space Center]]. This was a 650,000&nbsp;lbf (2,892,000 N) engine, a 16:1 scale-up from the largest previous [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH2]] pintle engine and about a 3:1 scale-up from the largest previous pintle engine ever tested.

Pero's own son [[Vladan Giljen]] became a successful goalkeeper after learning his trade in Sutjeska. Four years after the famed 1976 generation made its first mark in Yugoslav football, Sutjeska won the Yugoslav Cup in 1980&nbsp;\u2013 becoming the only Yugoslav club at the time to have won both trophies.\n\nIn 2010, Sutjeska's cadet team (for under-17 players) were champions of Montenegro in the country's U-17 league. During the same year, Sutjeska's U-19 team won the Gallipoli Cup in [[Italy]], one of the most prestigious international tournaments for players of this age group. The U-19 teams of [[U.S. Lecce]], [[A.S. Bari]], [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg]], and [[FC Krylia Sovetov Samara]] all competed for the title which Sutjeska's youth team won.\n\nMost notably, Sutjeska was the club in which the famous [[Juventus F.C.]] former striker [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] began his career.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=mne/news/newsid=827186.html Sutjeska colts racing like thoroughbreds&nbsp;\u2013 May 6, 2009 UEFA.com]</ref>\n\n== Stadium ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Niksic Stadium.jpg||300px|right|thumb|Stadium Kraj Bistrice]] -->\n{{main article|Stadion Gradski (Nik\u0161i\u0107)}}\n[[Stadion Gradski (Nik\u0161i\u0107)|City stadium \u201cKraj Bistrice\u201d]] is built during the 1946.

After the 2000, there was a new renovation of stadium. In 2001, old south and north stands were torn down, and a new east stand was built, so capacity of stadium was reduced to 10,800. After the Montenegrin independence, following the UEFA rules, stadium capacity is reduced to 5,214 seats. At 2015, floodlights were installed, and first match in the night-term occurred on 7 August 2016 (FK Sutjeska - [[FK Lov\u0107en]]). Located around the building is a spacious parking lot.

The first Sutjeska player to have been selected for the [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslav national team]] was [[Vojin Lazarevi\u0107]], who would later have a bright career with [[Red Star Belgrade]].

Pero's own son [[Vladan Giljen]] became a successful goalkeeper after learning his trade in Sutjeska. Four years after the famed 1976 generation made its first mark in Yugoslav football, Sutjeska won the Yugoslav Cup in 1980&nbsp;\u2013 becoming the only Yugoslav club at the time to have won both trophies.\n\nIn 2010, Sutjeska's cadet team (for under-17 players) were champions of Montenegro in the country's U-17 league. During the same year, Sutjeska's U-19 team won the Gallipoli Cup in [[Italy]], one of the most prestigious international tournaments for players of this age group. The U-19 teams of [[U.S. Lecce]], [[A.S. Bari]], [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg]], and [[FC Krylia Sovetov Samara]] all competed for the title which Sutjeska's youth team won.\n\nMost notably, Sutjeska was the club in which the famous [[Juventus F.C.]] former striker [[Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107]] began his career.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=mne/news/newsid=827186.html Sutjeska colts racing like thoroughbreds&nbsp;\u2013 May 6, 2009 UEFA.com]</ref>\n\n== Stadium ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Niksic Stadium.jpg||300px|right|thumb|Stadium Kraj Bistrice]] -->\n{{main article|Stadion Gradski (Nik\u0161i\u0107)}}\n[[Stadion Gradski (Nik\u0161i\u0107)|City stadium \u201cKraj Bistrice\u201d]] is built during the 1946. During the history, Stadium Kraj Bistrice, as a home of FK Sutjeska, was renovated a few times. During the 60's, there was stands from all four sides, and capacity of stadium was 15,000. After the 2000, there was a new renovation of stadium. In 2001, old south and north stands were torn down, and a new east stand was built, so capacity of stadium was reduced to 10,800. After the Montenegrin independence, following the UEFA rules, stadium capacity is reduced to 5,214 seats. At 2015, floodlights were installed, and first match in the night-term occurred on 7 August 2016 (FK Sutjeska - [[FK Lov\u0107en]]). Located around the building is a spacious parking lot. The sports complex adjacent to the stadium is a modern training field with synthetic surface and a mini auditorium space.\n\n== Current squad ==\n{{updated|24 January 2020}}\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=MNE|pos=GK|name=[[Vladan Giljen]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=MNE|pos=DF|name=Nikola Janji\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=3|nat=MNE|pos=DF|name=Dragan Grivi\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat=SRB||pos=DF|name=Bojan Ciger}}\n{{Fs player|no=6|nat=MNE|pos=DF|name=Nemanja Nedi\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat=MNE||pos=MF|name=[[Damir Koja\u0161evi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=MNE|pos=MF|name=[[Branislav Jankovi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=MNE||pos=FW|name=[[Stefan Nikoli\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=MNE|pos=MF|name=[[Marko \u0106etkovi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=MNE|pos=MF|name=Novica Erakovi\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=MNE||pos=DF|name=[[Aleksandar \u0160ofranac]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=MNE|pos=DF|name=[[Darko Bulatovi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=MNE|pos=MF|name=Bal\u0161a Dubljevi\u0107}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=MNE|pos=FW|name=[[Bojan Bo\u017eovi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=MNE|pos=FW|name=Milutin Osmaji\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=MNE|pos=MF|name=Vladan Bubanja}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=MNE|pos=FW|name=Aleksa Maru\u0161i\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=MNE|pos=GK|name=Darko Mi\u0107anovi\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=MNE|pos=DF|name=Anto Babi\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=30|nat=MNE|pos=DF|name=Marko Vu\u010di\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=31|nat=MNE|pos=GK|name=Suad Li\u010dina}}\n{{Fs player|no=50|nat=MNE|pos=FW|name=Bo\u017eo Markovi\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=58|nat=MNE|pos=DF|name=[[Stefan Cicmil]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=77|nat=MNE|pos=MF|name=Miljan Vlaisavljevi\u0107}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=MNE|pos=MF|name=Marko Vukovi\u0107}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n=== Coaching staff ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border: #FF0000 solid 1px; background: #FFFFFF; font-size: 88%\"\n|+ style=\"background:#FF0000; color:#FFFFFF; font-size: 120%\" | '''Current technical staff'''\n|\n* '''Manager''': {{flagicon|MNE}} [[Nikola Rakojevi\u0107]]\n* Coach: {{flagicon|MNE}} [[Sr\u0111an Radonji\u0107]]\n* Goalkeeping coach: {{flagicon|MNE}} [[Dragoslav Albijani\u0107]]\n* Fitness coach: {{flagicon|MNE}} [[Kosta Goranovi\u0107]]\n* Physiotherapist: {{flagicon|MNE}} [[Ivan Matovi\u0107]]\n* Doctor: {{flagicon|MNE}} [[Veselin Bulatovi\u0107]]\n|}\n\n==Coaching and players history==\n===Records===\n*'''Most performances:''' {{flagicon|MNE}} [[Brajan Nenezi\u0107]] - '''293/37''' ''(1975-1989)''\n*'''Top goalscorer:''' {{flagicon|MNE}} [[\u017deljko Baj\u010deta]] - '''43''' ''(1980-1990)''\n\n=== Notable players ===\n''For the list of former and current players with Wikipedia article, please see [[:Category:FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107 players]].''\n\nDuring the history, several notable players started their career or played for FK Sutjeska.

In 1819, the merchant captain James Henderson of the [[East India Company]] ship ''Hercules,'' sailing from South America to Calcutta, India, sighted it. The local newspaper, some time after his arrival, would publish his report of three recently ''discovered'' islands by Henderson, but it (or he himself) unfortunately failed to state the exact date of his discovery for modern Starbuck Island. [[Henry Evans Maude]], in an educated attempt to guess at it, thought it to be early in February 1819. The second captain known to have seen it, was his full nephew, Capt. [[Obed Starbuck]] of whaler ''Hero'' of Nantucket, three months and one week before first cousin Valentine would.

Bush's election efforts in Florida), Harris was a central figure in the [[2000 US presidential election]] in Florida. She was involved in purging many individuals from the voter rolls, and the election between [[Al Gore]] and [[George W. Bush]] was so close in Florida, separated by 537 votes, that a recount of the votes was called for.\n\nAfter several recounts were inconclusive, Harris halted the recounting process, arguing that the laws governing recounts were unclear. The official vote totals showed the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] candidate, Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]], as to be the winner of the statewide popular vote in Florida, and so Harris certified the Republican slate of [[United States Electoral College|electors]]. This victory in Florida would allow Bush to obtain a majority in the Electoral College and win the election. Her certification was upheld in the state circuit court, but subsequently overturned on appeal by the Florida Supreme Court.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court decision was reversed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000). In a [[per curiam decision]], by a 7-2 vote, the Court held that the [[Florida Supreme Court]]'s method for recounting ballots was a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Furthermore, it held, by a 5\u20134 vote, that no alternative method for a recount could be established within the time limits set by the State of Florida.\n\nThis decision allowed Harris' previous certification of Bush as the winner of Florida's electoral votes to stand. Florida's 25 electoral votes gave Bush, the Republican candidate, 271 electoral votes, thus defeating Gore, who ended up with 266 electoral votes (with one D.C. elector abstaining).\n\nHarris later published ''Center of the Storm,'' her memoir of the 2000 election controversy. It was later revealed that, unimpressed with her performance in the media spotlight of the recount, the Bush Campaign had assigned a staff member to her, essentially as a handler.<ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/10/florida-election-2000</ref>\n\n==United States Congresswoman==\nIn 2002, Harris ran against [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]] Attorney [[Jan Schneider]] for the congressional district vacated by retiring Republican Rep.

Bush's election efforts in Florida), Harris was a central figure in the [[2000 US presidential election]] in Florida. She was involved in purging many individuals from the voter rolls, and the election between [[Al Gore]] and [[George W. Bush]] was so close in Florida, separated by 537 votes, that a recount of the votes was called for.\n\nAfter several recounts were inconclusive, Harris halted the recounting process, arguing that the laws governing recounts were unclear. The official vote totals showed the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] candidate, Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]], as to be the winner of the statewide popular vote in Florida, and so Harris certified the Republican slate of [[United States Electoral College|electors]]. This victory in Florida would allow Bush to obtain a majority in the Electoral College and win the election. Her certification was upheld in the state circuit court, but subsequently overturned on appeal by the Florida Supreme Court.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court decision was reversed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' (2000). In a [[per curiam decision]], by a 7-2 vote, the Court held that the [[Florida Supreme Court]]'s method for recounting ballots was a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Furthermore, it held, by a 5\u20134 vote, that no alternative method for a recount could be established within the time limits set by the State of Florida.\n\nThis decision allowed Harris' previous certification of Bush as the winner of Florida's electoral votes to stand. Florida's 25 electoral votes gave Bush, the Republican candidate, 271 electoral votes, thus defeating Gore, who ended up with 266 electoral votes (with one D.C. elector abstaining).\n\nHarris later published ''Center of the Storm,'' her memoir of the 2000 election controversy. It was later revealed that, unimpressed with her performance in the media spotlight of the recount, the Bush Campaign had assigned a staff member to her, essentially as a handler.<ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/10/florida-election-2000</ref>\n\n==United States Congresswoman==\nIn 2002, Harris ran against [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]] Attorney [[Jan Schneider]] for the congressional district vacated by retiring Republican Rep. [[Dan Miller (Florida politician)|Dan Miller]], winning by 10 percentage points in this solidly Republican district, a victory helped with one of the biggest first term campaign fund raising efforts in the history of this district and substantial support from the Bush family.\n\nHarris considered running for the seat of retiring Senator [[Bob Graham]] in 2004 but was reportedly dissuaded by the Bush White House to allow [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] [[Mel Martinez]] to run instead. Martinez went on to narrowly beat challenger [[Betty Castor]].
