They meet a group of village girls who tell them the story of Unai. In the story, two men, Sasada and Chinu, declare their love for Unai. Unwilling to incur the jealousy of one by favouring the other, Unai declined to make a choice. Her parents make the two suitors compete for her hand, but each contest results in a draw. In torment, Unai drowns herself in Ikuta River. After her funeral, Sasada and Chinu were inconsolable, and they commit suicide by stabbing each other to death. Unai's ghost bears the karmic responsibility for their demise. The priest intones prayers for her soul. She hears the prayers, but they are of no avail; she is unable to escape from the [[Upaya#Parable of the burning house|Burning House]] (a Buddhist metaphor for the secular world) and the [[The Eight Cold Hells|Eight Great Hells]], through which she is eternally tormented by her demons. In another version of the story, Unai is depicted as being pulled in different directions by the deceased lovers in a metaphorical tug of war. There is a clear allusion to Y\u016bko's relationship with Ippei and K\u014dji. The [[love triangle]] between Unai, Sasada, and Chinu corresponds to that of ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' with Y\u016bko, Ippei, and K\u014dji, as well as in Kiyoshi's and Matsukichi's quarrel over Kimi's love.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> It is interesting to note that in the traditional Noh theatre, immorality was always regarded as a sin which would lead to eternal damnation in the fires of hell (echoing Unai's fate in ''Motomezuka'' and Y\u016bko's anguish in prison).\n\nThe name ''Motomezuka'' is likely to be a corruption of Otomezuka (the \"Maiden's Grave\"), the original story being contained in an episode of the Yamato Monogatari, a tale combining narrative fiction with waka poetry from he mid-tenth century. The earliest references to the story appear in poem form in the Many\u014dsh\u016b, the oldest and greatest anthology of Japanese poems, compiled during the late Nara period.\n\nNoh theatre performances are characterised by their use of meticulously designed masks that represent specific characters and facial expressions. N\u014d masks are referenced throughout ''The Frolic of the Beasts''.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> At the beginning of the novel's first chapter, K\u014dji humours himself with the thought that his own face \"is like a well-crafted, carved wooden mask.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=14}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> In the novel's prologue, Ippei's expression is described as an \"interminable smile\", which recalls the fixed expression of N\u014d masks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi17DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6|year=2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43415-3|page=6}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lithub.com/the-frolic-of-the-beasts/ |title=The Frolic of the Beasts |date=28 November 2018 |website=[[Literary Hub]] |accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref> Also, the \"dark grape luster\" of Y\u016bko's \"characteristic thick lipstick\" is likely a direct reference to the archetypal \"young woman\" (Wakaonna) character portrayed in Noh productions.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT20|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=20}}</ref> In his review for ''[[The Japan Times]]'', Damian Flanagan also compared the \"jumbled\" nature of the novel's nonlinear narrative as creating a \"transcendent unearthliness\" similar to that of a Noh play.<ref name=\"The Japan Times\"/>\n\nMiyoko Tanaka, the commentator in the original Shinchosha paperback edition of the novel says that both in the form of the story, which is \"like a dream rising from weed-infested ruins,\" and from the descriptions of the faces of the characters, \"we Japanese clearly recognize vestiges of the traditional Noh theater performance.\"\n\nMishima was infatuated with the Noh theater and he wrote several Noh plays himself (adapted from ancient Noh performances). All of his plays were performed in Japan and some of them in other cities around the world, including New York. There is some speculation that Mishima was partly influenced in his choice of subject matter by the theme of Noh masks running through [[Fumiko Enchi]]'s novel, ''[[Masks (novel)|Masks]]''. It seems certain that Mishima rated Enchi highly and described this book as an \"esoteric masterpiece.\" Enchi's novel was published in 1958, three years before ''The Frolic of the Beasts''.\n\nThe story is considered to be a variation on the theme of Mishima's stream of consciousness novel, \"Thirst for Love\" in that it portrays a dysfunctional family unit, whose members have been thrown together with ultimately tragic consequences.\n\n==Plot==\n===Prologue===\nIn a photograph, three smiling individuals\u2013Ippei Kusakado, his wife Y\u016bko, and the youthful K\u014dji\u2013are seen standing on the harbor wall in Iro Village, a rural fishing port in the western part of the [[Izu Peninsula]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. The photograph was taken on a hot summer day. It was taken only days before \"the final wretched incident\". It was immediately sent to the chief priest of Taisenji temple. In Iro, there are also rice paddies as well as the Kusakado greenhouses, located beside the Kusakado family home. On the mountainside lies a new graveyard, reaching halfway up the slope of the mountain from its base. In spite of opposition from the villagers, the chief priest of Taisenji temple erected the new graves with the money that was entrusted to him. Ippei's grave lies on the right, K\u014dji's on the left, and Y\u016bko's in the center. Y\u016bko's, however, is only a \"living monument\", reserved for her eventual death.\n\n===Chapter 1===\n[[File:Nishiizu 20121019.jpg|thumb|Izu coastline in Nishiizu.]]\nK\u014dji is released from prison. He travels by boat from [[Numazu]] to Iro Village, where Y\u016bko is waiting for him. K\u014dji tells himself that he has repented and is a different person, but once he arrives he is immediately told by Y\u016bko that he hasn't changed. Y\u016bko had become his guarantor upon his release, but they both question whether they have made a mistake in K\u014dji coming to Iro. Y\u016bko closed the Tokyo shop a year ago, moved to Iro, and started the Kusakado greenhouse, which K\u014dji will work in. The two of them walk through Iro to the Kusakado house. Greeted by villagers on the way, K\u014dji is ashamed knowing rumours of his past will spread but Y\u016bko tells him to keep his head up. K\u014dji is seized by fear when he sees Ippei in front of the gate of the house.\n\n===Chapter 2===\nTwo years earlier, when he was a 21-year-old university student, K\u014dji was hired to work at a Western ceramics shop in Ginza, Tokyo. Ippei Kusakado, a 40-year-old man, is the owner and manager of the ceramics shop but also translates and reviews German literature in his spare time. While drinking together at a bar, Ippei tells K\u014dji about his unhappiness with his wife Y\u016bko's lack of jealousy. He says he has tried everything to make her jealous, confessing to his numerous affairs. K\u014dji, jealous of Ippei's \"corrupt heart\", falls in love with Y\u016bko that night, despite not having met her before. K\u014dji begins a secret affair with Y\u016bko. One night, Y\u016bko told K\u014dji that she knows Ippei has been adulterous, showing him documentation from a private investigator who tracked his infidelity. She cried, but told K\u014dji not to tell her husband of her suffering. On a summer's day, six months after he first met Y\u016bko, K\u014dji is waiting for Y\u016bko outside a hospital. He spots a black wrench laying on the ground and puts it in his jacket pocket. Much later while in prison, K\u014dji reflected on the wrench, viewing it as a manifestation of \"[[Will (philosophy)|will]]\" that had become a material phenomen which sought to \"upset the very foundations\" of the order of his world. That evening, Y\u016bko and K\u014dji walk in on Ippei and find him with a lover, Machiko. Y\u016bko simply asks Ippei to \"return home quietly\". K\u014dji expected a grand confrontation, where \"the truth of\nperverse human nature begins to shine\". He instead sees it as \"nothing other than things he had grown utterly tired of seeing: the mediocre concealment of human shame, the irony of keeping up appearances.\" Y\u016bko, crying and jabbering, is struck across the cheek twice by Ippei. K\u014dji immediately reacts without \"emotion, objective, or motive\", and repeatedly bashes the left side of Ippei's head with the wrench he had placed in the pocket of his jacket.\n\n===Chapter 3===\nIn Iro, K\u014dji meets Ippei for the first time since he was imprisoned. K\u014dji's assault leaves Ippei with a fractured cranium and a cerebral contusion. Ippei is diagnosed with [[aphasia]] and [[Hemiplegia|paralysis on his right side]], and is left with an \"interminable smile\". K\u014dji explains his assault as driven by an extreme unease with enduring that \"world bereft of logic\", and chose to impart the \"cold, hard, black logic of iron\" of the wrench. K\u014dji works in the Kusakado greenhouse with fellow gardener Teijiro. One day, K\u014dji, Y\u016bko and Ippei go for a picnic at the nearby waterfall and greet Kakujin, the priest of Taisenji temple, on the way. They stop at the village shrine to make a peace offering with a lily, but Y\u016bko is unimpressed with the shrine's appearance and size. Y\u016bko's sacrilege scares K\u014dji. Y\u016bko suddenly begins to taunt Ippei, asking him if he understands \"sacrifice\". Ippei replies that he does not understand and K\u014dji tries to defend him but Y\u016bko cuts K\u014dji off and calls Ippei an idiot. Y\u016bko throws the lily into the plunge pool, and Ippei's face displays \"a look of pure anxiety born of being cut off from all understanding\". She asks Ippei if he understands the word \"kiss\", then passionately kisses K\u014dji in front of him. K\u014dji scolds Y\u016bko for using him for Ippei's sake. She answers, asserting she has used K\u014dji from the beginning and that he surely likes it. K\u014dji strikes Y\u016bko across the cheek and turns to Ippei, who has a fixed smile on his face. Terrified, K\u014dji embraces Y\u016bko to erase the fear from his mind, but her kiss \"had lost completely its exquisite taste\".\n\n===Chapter 4===\nOne evening, K\u014dji is drinking alone at the Storm Petrel, the only bar in Iro Village. He gossips with the bar's owner about Teijir\u014d's young daughter, Kimi. K\u014dji has never heard Teijir\u014d speak about Kimi, and senses that there are ill feelings between them. After Kimi's mother died, they had lived together until Kimi suddenly left for Hamamatsu to become a factory girl. Kimi has not interacted with Teijir\u014d since returning to Iro for a ten-day vacation from her work at the Imperial Instruments factory in Hamamatsu. Kimi is strikingly beautiful and makes the village girls of Iro jealous by her presence. She carries a ukulele with her wherever she goes. At around 9:00 p.m., Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi enter the bar and K\u014dji joins them at their table. Matsukichi is a fisherman and Kiyoshi is a member of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force ground crew. They are both Kimi's childhood friends, and have quarrelled with each other over her love ever since. K\u014dji envies Kiyoshi's \"simple lyrical spirit\", but considers Matsukichi \"a dull-witted young animal\". Looking at the three characters, K\u014dji thinks of Y\u016bko, who has not permitted him to kiss her since the incident during the picnic. He realises the depth of his love for Y\u016bko and repeats \"I have repented\" to himself. Together in the bar, K\u014dji, Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi all get drunk and Kimi offers up her ukulele, swearing that whichever of the young men gets it will be the one who gets her love. Interested, they all leave in a small boat and travel to Urayasu where they go nude swimming. They walk into Urayasu forest and start a bonfire, where Kimi refuses to give up her ukulele. Matsukichi steals the instrument from Kimi, then passes it to Kiyoshi. The two men pass it back and forth to each other as Kimi attempts to take it back. Matsukichi and Kiyoshi take the ukulele and jump into the boat together, rowing into the bay by themselves. K\u014dji and Kimi return to the forest bonfire. Kimi says she purposely did not swim after the boat because she wished be alone with K\u014dji. Kimi says she respects K\u014dji's love for Y\u016bko, but is \"prepared to make a sacrifice and act as a stand-in\". K\u014dji and Kimi have sex, but K\u014dji cannot suppress the thought that the experience is \"nothing but a poor imitation\" of the \"perfect flesh\" that he created and refined with his imagination while in prison. They swim across the bay and return home. Several days later, K\u014dji hears rumours that Kiyoshi kept the ukulele, carrying it around wherever he went to the envy of the other young men in the village. That night, after drinking at the bar, Matsukichi confesses to K\u014dji that he and Kiyoshi made a secret pact. Kiyoshi only cared about his reputation, and agreed to never lay a hand on Kimi. The night after they went to Urayasu, Kimi gave herself to Matsukichi. When Matsukichi told Kimi of their pact, she laughed but accepted his proposal nonetheless. K\u014dji is surprised that Matsukichi has no inkling that he and Kimi had sex while alone on the island together.\n\n===Chapter 5===\nWhile working in the greenhouse, Teijir\u014d suddenly confesses to K\u014dji that he raped Kimi. Teijir\u014d then shows K\u014dji a pornographic photograph of a boy in a student's uniform having sex with a girl in a sailor uniform, and remarks that the girl has a similar appearance to that of Kimi. K\u014dji is disturbed by Teijir\u014d's unsolicited confession, and questions what the purpose of his confession was. Kimi stops by the Kusakado house to say goodbye before leaving to return to the factory in Hamamatsu. Looking at her, K\u014dji theorises that Kimi had slept with him and persuaded Matsukichi to love her only in order to infect them with the \"germ-like secret of her father's crime\" without letting them know her truth. He imagines she was quitely picturing \"the origin of her burning, rejuvenating humiliation and self-loathing\" while they had sex. Kimi says goodbye and squeezes K\u014dji's hands, gazing in his eyes. K\u014dji stares only at Y\u016bko, who takes out a hairpin from her hair and pricks the back of Kimi's hand. Kimi leaves, running down the slope laughing maniacally, while Y\u016bko turns away with a frown on her face. In the heat of that night, K\u014dji is lying on his bed while covered by a mosquito net. Y\u016bko enters K\u014dji's room and tells him she stuck her hairpin in the hand of the \"conceited\" Kimi to warn her, not out of jealously. Y\u016bko compares her action to that of K\u014dji with the wrench, and reveals that she is jealous of Koji's crime. She is jealous of \"not having a crime to her name\" that would allow her to at least \"stand beside him\". K\u014dji and Y\u016bko passionately embrace between the mosquito net, but Y\u016bko sees a figure outside and loudly screams that her husband is approaching. K\u014dji realises Y\u016bko wishes to be caught by Ippei, that it would liberate her from her \"long-continued suffering\". He is infuriated by Y\u016bko and refuses to let her through the mosquito net, not wanting to be caught by Ippei in an adulterous position with Y\u016bko. Ippei climbs the stairs and tells Y\u016bko he wants to sleep there because it is cool. Several days later, after a typhoon passes and misses West Izu, K\u014dji speaks with Kakujin the priest at Taisenji temple. He sees Y\u016bko and Ippei coming down the slope, and Y\u016bko asks K\u014dji to accompany Ippei on his daily walk. K\u014dji decides to confront Ippei on their walk, vehemently questioning him and accusing him of elaborately tormenting Y\u016bko and him under the guise of his mental incapacity. He calls him a \"hollow cavern\" and \"empty hole\" which the household revolves around. K\u014dji asks Ippei what he wants, to which Ippei responds he wishes to go home. K\u014dji is angered by this \"childlike supplication\" and further presses Ippei, asking him what he really wants. Ippei responds, \"Death. I want to die.\" They meet back up with Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji tells her that he feels his life is being lived solely for Ippei's sake. There is a tacit understanding between them, and Y\u016bko says, \"There's no going back now after all of this.\" The three of them arrive at the harbor, and Y\u016bko says they should travel to the other side of the bay one day. She suggests Teijir\u014d take them over in the boat in the middle of the day and that they should take \"lots of pictures\".\n\n===Epilogue===\nOn a summer vacation, a folklore researcher travels to Iro and speaks with a priest, Kakujin, who recounts his memories of Ippei, Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji. Kakujin tells of the time Y\u016bko and K\u014dji appeared at Taisenji temple, confessing to strangling Ippei to death. Kakujin shows the researcher the photo described in the novel's prologue. It had been given to him the day before Ippei was murdered. K\u014dji testified that he murdered Ippei at Ippei's request, but K\u014dji's gifting of the photograph to the priest was used as indelible evidence of [[Malice aforethought|premeditated]] murder. K\u014dji was given the death penalty, and Y\u016bko was sentenced to life imprisonment. While in prison, Y\u016bko requested Kakujin to arrange their graves side by side, with Y\u016bko in between. The researcher visits the graves, and takes a photograph. The priest asks the researcher to deliver the photograph on his behalf to Y\u016bko in person. The researcher later travels to Tochigi prison and meets Y\u016bko. Looking at the photograph, she thanks the researcher and says, \"Now I can serve my time in peace.\" Y\u016bko puts the photograph in her pocket and leaves.\n\n==Setting==\n[[File:Westcoast@izu - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|270px|The harbor in Tago, [[Nishiizu]], just south of present-day Arari.]]\n\"Iro Village\" is a fictional place set in the former fishing village of [[:ja:\u5b89\u826f\u91cc\u6751|Arari]], which was merged into the current town of [[Nishiizu]]. Similarly, a reference to Mt Taiya is also fictional. However, nearby Arari is a real mountain called \"Ono-san\" or \"Ono-yama.\" The Japanese characters \"Ono\" can also be read \"Taiya.\" Mishima stayed at a [[Ryokan (inn)|ryokan]] in Arari and also visited the Air Self Defense Force base at nearby Hamamatsu while writing ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' (Mishima is known to have been assiduous with his on-site research).

They meet a group of village girls who tell them the story of Unai. In the story, two men, Sasada and Chinu, declare their love for Unai. Unwilling to incur the jealousy of one by favouring the other, Unai declined to make a choice. Her parents make the two suitors compete for her hand, but each contest results in a draw. In torment, Unai drowns herself in Ikuta River. After her funeral, Sasada and Chinu were inconsolable, and they commit suicide by stabbing each other to death. Unai's ghost bears the karmic responsibility for their demise. The priest intones prayers for her soul. She hears the prayers, but they are of no avail; she is unable to escape from the [[Upaya#Parable of the burning house|Burning House]] (a Buddhist metaphor for the secular world) and the [[The Eight Cold Hells|Eight Great Hells]], through which she is eternally tormented by her demons. In another version of the story, Unai is depicted as being pulled in different directions by the deceased lovers in a metaphorical tug of war. There is a clear allusion to Y\u016bko's relationship with Ippei and K\u014dji. The [[love triangle]] between Unai, Sasada, and Chinu corresponds to that of ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' with Y\u016bko, Ippei, and K\u014dji, as well as in Kiyoshi's and Matsukichi's quarrel over Kimi's love.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> It is interesting to note that in the traditional Noh theatre, immorality was always regarded as a sin which would lead to eternal damnation in the fires of hell (echoing Unai's fate in ''Motomezuka'' and Y\u016bko's anguish in prison).\n\nThe name ''Motomezuka'' is likely to be a corruption of Otomezuka (the \"Maiden's Grave\"), the original story being contained in an episode of the Yamato Monogatari, a tale combining narrative fiction with waka poetry from he mid-tenth century. The earliest references to the story appear in poem form in the Many\u014dsh\u016b, the oldest and greatest anthology of Japanese poems, compiled during the late Nara period.\n\nNoh theatre performances are characterised by their use of meticulously designed masks that represent specific characters and facial expressions. N\u014d masks are referenced throughout ''The Frolic of the Beasts''.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> At the beginning of the novel's first chapter, K\u014dji humours himself with the thought that his own face \"is like a well-crafted, carved wooden mask.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=14}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> In the novel's prologue, Ippei's expression is described as an \"interminable smile\", which recalls the fixed expression of N\u014d masks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi17DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6|year=2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43415-3|page=6}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lithub.com/the-frolic-of-the-beasts/ |title=The Frolic of the Beasts |date=28 November 2018 |website=[[Literary Hub]] |accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref> Also, the \"dark grape luster\" of Y\u016bko's \"characteristic thick lipstick\" is likely a direct reference to the archetypal \"young woman\" (Wakaonna) character portrayed in Noh productions.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT20|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=20}}</ref> In his review for ''[[The Japan Times]]'', Damian Flanagan also compared the \"jumbled\" nature of the novel's nonlinear narrative as creating a \"transcendent unearthliness\" similar to that of a Noh play.<ref name=\"The Japan Times\"/>\n\nMiyoko Tanaka, the commentator in the original Shinchosha paperback edition of the novel says that both in the form of the story, which is \"like a dream rising from weed-infested ruins,\" and from the descriptions of the faces of the characters, \"we Japanese clearly recognize vestiges of the traditional Noh theater performance.\"\n\nMishima was infatuated with the Noh theater and he wrote several Noh plays himself (adapted from ancient Noh performances). All of his plays were performed in Japan and some of them in other cities around the world, including New York. There is some speculation that Mishima was partly influenced in his choice of subject matter by the theme of Noh masks running through [[Fumiko Enchi]]'s novel, ''[[Masks (novel)|Masks]]''. It seems certain that Mishima rated Enchi highly and described this book as an \"esoteric masterpiece.\" Enchi's novel was published in 1958, three years before ''The Frolic of the Beasts''.\n\n==Plot==\n===Prologue===\nIn a photograph, three smiling individuals\u2013Ippei Kusakado, his wife Y\u016bko, and the youthful K\u014dji\u2013are seen standing on the harbor wall in Iro Village, a rural fishing port in the western part of the [[Izu Peninsula]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. The photograph was taken on a hot summer day. It was taken only days before \"the final wretched incident\". It was immediately sent to the chief priest of Taisenji temple. In Iro, there are also rice paddies as well as the Kusakado greenhouses, located beside the Kusakado family home. On the mountainside lies a new graveyard, reaching halfway up the slope of the mountain from its base. In spite of opposition from the villagers, the chief priest of Taisenji temple erected the new graves with the money that was entrusted to him. Ippei's grave lies on the right, K\u014dji's on the left, and Y\u016bko's in the center. Y\u016bko's, however, is only a \"living monument\", reserved for her eventual death.\n\n===Chapter 1===\n[[File:Nishiizu 20121019.jpg|thumb|Izu coastline in Nishiizu.]]\nK\u014dji is released from prison. He travels by boat from [[Numazu]] to Iro Village, where Y\u016bko is waiting for him. K\u014dji tells himself that he has repented and is a different person, but once he arrives he is immediately told by Y\u016bko that he hasn't changed. Y\u016bko had become his guarantor upon his release, but they both question whether they have made a mistake in K\u014dji coming to Iro. Y\u016bko closed the Tokyo shop a year ago, moved to Iro, and started the Kusakado greenhouse, which K\u014dji will work in. The two of them walk through Iro to the Kusakado house. Greeted by villagers on the way, K\u014dji is ashamed knowing rumours of his past will spread but Y\u016bko tells him to keep his head up. K\u014dji is seized by fear when he sees Ippei in front of the gate of the house.\n\n===Chapter 2===\nTwo years earlier, when he was a 21-year-old university student, K\u014dji was hired to work at a Western ceramics shop in Ginza, Tokyo. Ippei Kusakado, a 40-year-old man, is the owner and manager of the ceramics shop but also translates and reviews German literature in his spare time. While drinking together at a bar, Ippei tells K\u014dji about his unhappiness with his wife Y\u016bko's lack of jealousy. He says he has tried everything to make her jealous, confessing to his numerous affairs. K\u014dji, jealous of Ippei's \"corrupt heart\", falls in love with Y\u016bko that night, despite not having met her before. K\u014dji begins a secret affair with Y\u016bko. One night, Y\u016bko told K\u014dji that she knows Ippei has been adulterous, showing him documentation from a private investigator who tracked his infidelity. She cried, but told K\u014dji not to tell her husband of her suffering. On a summer's day, six months after he first met Y\u016bko, K\u014dji is waiting for Y\u016bko outside a hospital. He spots a black wrench laying on the ground and puts it in his jacket pocket. Much later while in prison, K\u014dji reflected on the wrench, viewing it as a manifestation of \"[[Will (philosophy)|will]]\" that had become a material phenomen which sought to \"upset the very foundations\" of the order of his world. That evening, Y\u016bko and K\u014dji walk in on Ippei and find him with a lover, Machiko. Y\u016bko simply asks Ippei to \"return home quietly\". K\u014dji expected a grand confrontation, where \"the truth of\nperverse human nature begins to shine\". He instead sees it as \"nothing other than things he had grown utterly tired of seeing: the mediocre concealment of human shame, the irony of keeping up appearances.\" Y\u016bko, crying and jabbering, is struck across the cheek twice by Ippei. K\u014dji immediately reacts without \"emotion, objective, or motive\", and repeatedly bashes the left side of Ippei's head with the wrench he had placed in the pocket of his jacket.\n\n===Chapter 3===\nIn Iro, K\u014dji meets Ippei for the first time since he was imprisoned. K\u014dji's assault leaves Ippei with a fractured cranium and a cerebral contusion. Ippei is diagnosed with [[aphasia]] and [[Hemiplegia|paralysis on his right side]], and is left with an \"interminable smile\". K\u014dji explains his assault as driven by an extreme unease with enduring that \"world bereft of logic\", and chose to impart the \"cold, hard, black logic of iron\" of the wrench. K\u014dji works in the Kusakado greenhouse with fellow gardener Teijiro. One day, K\u014dji, Y\u016bko and Ippei go for a picnic at the nearby waterfall and greet Kakujin, the priest of Taisenji temple, on the way. They stop at the village shrine to make a peace offering with a lily, but Y\u016bko is unimpressed with the shrine's appearance and size. Y\u016bko's sacrilege scares K\u014dji. Y\u016bko suddenly begins to taunt Ippei, asking him if he understands \"sacrifice\". Ippei replies that he does not understand and K\u014dji tries to defend him but Y\u016bko cuts K\u014dji off and calls Ippei an idiot. Y\u016bko throws the lily into the plunge pool, and Ippei's face displays \"a look of pure anxiety born of being cut off from all understanding\". She asks Ippei if he understands the word \"kiss\", then passionately kisses K\u014dji in front of him. K\u014dji scolds Y\u016bko for using him for Ippei's sake. She answers, asserting she has used K\u014dji from the beginning and that he surely likes it. K\u014dji strikes Y\u016bko across the cheek and turns to Ippei, who has a fixed smile on his face. Terrified, K\u014dji embraces Y\u016bko to erase the fear from his mind, but her kiss \"had lost completely its exquisite taste\".\n\n===Chapter 4===\nOne evening, K\u014dji is drinking alone at the Storm Petrel, the only bar in Iro Village. He gossips with the bar's owner about Teijir\u014d's young daughter, Kimi. K\u014dji has never heard Teijir\u014d speak about Kimi, and senses that there are ill feelings between them. After Kimi's mother died, they had lived together until Kimi suddenly left for Hamamatsu to become a factory girl. Kimi has not interacted with Teijir\u014d since returning to Iro for a ten-day vacation from her work at the Imperial Instruments factory in Hamamatsu. Kimi is strikingly beautiful and makes the village girls of Iro jealous by her presence. She carries a ukulele with her wherever she goes. At around 9:00 p.m., Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi enter the bar and K\u014dji joins them at their table. Matsukichi is a fisherman and Kiyoshi is a member of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force ground crew. They are both Kimi's childhood friends, and have quarrelled with each other over her love ever since. K\u014dji envies Kiyoshi's \"simple lyrical spirit\", but considers Matsukichi \"a dull-witted young animal\". Looking at the three characters, K\u014dji thinks of Y\u016bko, who has not permitted him to kiss her since the incident during the picnic. He realises the depth of his love for Y\u016bko and repeats \"I have repented\" to himself. Together in the bar, K\u014dji, Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi all get drunk and Kimi offers up her ukulele, swearing that whichever of the young men gets it will be the one who gets her love. Interested, they all leave in a small boat and travel to Urayasu where they go nude swimming. They walk into Urayasu forest and start a bonfire, where Kimi refuses to give up her ukulele. Matsukichi steals the instrument from Kimi, then passes it to Kiyoshi. The two men pass it back and forth to each other as Kimi attempts to take it back. Matsukichi and Kiyoshi take the ukulele and jump into the boat together, rowing into the bay by themselves. K\u014dji and Kimi return to the forest bonfire. Kimi says she purposely did not swim after the boat because she wished be alone with K\u014dji. Kimi says she respects K\u014dji's love for Y\u016bko, but is \"prepared to make a sacrifice and act as a stand-in\". K\u014dji and Kimi have sex, but K\u014dji cannot suppress the thought that the experience is \"nothing but a poor imitation\" of the \"perfect flesh\" that he created and refined with his imagination while in prison. They swim across the bay and return home. Several days later, K\u014dji hears rumours that Kiyoshi kept the ukulele, carrying it around wherever he went to the envy of the other young men in the village. That night, after drinking at the bar, Matsukichi confesses to K\u014dji that he and Kiyoshi made a secret pact. Kiyoshi only cared about his reputation, and agreed to never lay a hand on Kimi. The night after they went to Urayasu, Kimi gave herself to Matsukichi. When Matsukichi told Kimi of their pact, she laughed but accepted his proposal nonetheless. K\u014dji is surprised that Matsukichi has no inkling that he and Kimi had sex while alone on the island together.\n\n===Chapter 5===\nWhile working in the greenhouse, Teijir\u014d suddenly confesses to K\u014dji that he raped Kimi. Teijir\u014d then shows K\u014dji a pornographic photograph of a boy in a student's uniform having sex with a girl in a sailor uniform, and remarks that the girl has a similar appearance to that of Kimi. K\u014dji is disturbed by Teijir\u014d's unsolicited confession, and questions what the purpose of his confession was. Kimi stops by the Kusakado house to say goodbye before leaving to return to the factory in Hamamatsu. Looking at her, K\u014dji theorises that Kimi had slept with him and persuaded Matsukichi to love her only in order to infect them with the \"germ-like secret of her father's crime\" without letting them know her truth. He imagines she was quitely picturing \"the origin of her burning, rejuvenating humiliation and self-loathing\" while they had sex. Kimi says goodbye and squeezes K\u014dji's hands, gazing in his eyes. K\u014dji stares only at Y\u016bko, who takes out a hairpin from her hair and pricks the back of Kimi's hand. Kimi leaves, running down the slope laughing maniacally, while Y\u016bko turns away with a frown on her face. In the heat of that night, K\u014dji is lying on his bed while covered by a mosquito net. Y\u016bko enters K\u014dji's room and tells him she stuck her hairpin in the hand of the \"conceited\" Kimi to warn her, not out of jealously. Y\u016bko compares her action to that of K\u014dji with the wrench, and reveals that she is jealous of Koji's crime. She is jealous of \"not having a crime to her name\" that would allow her to at least \"stand beside him\". K\u014dji and Y\u016bko passionately embrace between the mosquito net, but Y\u016bko sees a figure outside and loudly screams that her husband is approaching. K\u014dji realises Y\u016bko wishes to be caught by Ippei, that it would liberate her from her \"long-continued suffering\". He is infuriated by Y\u016bko and refuses to let her through the mosquito net, not wanting to be caught by Ippei in an adulterous position with Y\u016bko. Ippei climbs the stairs and tells Y\u016bko he wants to sleep there because it is cool. Several days later, after a typhoon passes and misses West Izu, K\u014dji speaks with Kakujin the priest at Taisenji temple. He sees Y\u016bko and Ippei coming down the slope, and Y\u016bko asks K\u014dji to accompany Ippei on his daily walk. K\u014dji decides to confront Ippei on their walk, vehemently questioning him and accusing him of elaborately tormenting Y\u016bko and him under the guise of his mental incapacity. He calls him a \"hollow cavern\" and \"empty hole\" which the household revolves around. K\u014dji asks Ippei what he wants, to which Ippei responds he wishes to go home. K\u014dji is angered by this \"childlike supplication\" and further presses Ippei, asking him what he really wants. Ippei responds, \"Death. I want to die.\" They meet back up with Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji tells her that he feels his life is being lived solely for Ippei's sake. There is a tacit understanding between them, and Y\u016bko says, \"There's no going back now after all of this.\" The three of them arrive at the harbor, and Y\u016bko says they should travel to the other side of the bay one day. She suggests Teijir\u014d take them over in the boat in the middle of the day and that they should take \"lots of pictures\".\n\n===Epilogue===\nOn a summer vacation, a folklore researcher travels to Iro and speaks with a priest, Kakujin, who recounts his memories of Ippei, Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji. Kakujin tells of the time Y\u016bko and K\u014dji appeared at Taisenji temple, confessing to strangling Ippei to death. Kakujin shows the researcher the photo described in the novel's prologue. It had been given to him the day before Ippei was murdered. K\u014dji testified that he murdered Ippei at Ippei's request, but K\u014dji's gifting of the photograph to the priest was used as indelible evidence of [[Malice aforethought|premeditated]] murder. K\u014dji was given the death penalty, and Y\u016bko was sentenced to life imprisonment. While in prison, Y\u016bko requested Kakujin to arrange their graves side by side, with Y\u016bko in between. The researcher visits the graves, and takes a photograph. The priest asks the researcher to deliver the photograph on his behalf to Y\u016bko in person. The researcher later travels to Tochigi prison and meets Y\u016bko. Looking at the photograph, she thanks the researcher and says, \"Now I can serve my time in peace.\" Y\u016bko puts the photograph in her pocket and leaves.\n\n==Setting==\n[[File:Westcoast@izu - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|270px|The harbor in Tago, [[Nishiizu]], just south of present-day Arari.]]\n\"Iro Village\" is a fictional place set in the former fishing village of [[:ja:\u5b89\u826f\u91cc\u6751|Arari]], which was merged into the current town of [[Nishiizu]].

However, nearby Arari is a real mountain called \"Ono-san\" or \"Ono-yama.\" The Japanese characters \"Ono\" can also be read \"Taiya.\" Mishima stayed at a [[Ryokan (inn)|ryokan]] in Arari and also visited the Air Self Defense Force base at nearby Hamamatsu while writing ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' (Mishima is known to have been assiduous with his on-site research). A monument to Mishima is located in the area of Cape Kogane, with a passage from ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' engraved on it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.at-s.com/facilities/article/view/place/133395.html |title=\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u7d00\u592b\u6587\u5b66\u7891\uff3b\u8cc0\u8302\u90e1\u897f\u4f0a\u8c46\u753a\uff3d\uff5c\u30a2\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30b9 |date=27 November 2015 |website=\u30a2\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30b9 |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Title and covers==\nBefore its official English translation, the novel's title was variously translated as ''Beastly Entanglements''<ref>{{cite book|author=Naoki Inose|title=Persona: A Biography of Yukio Mishima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKgPyWO87k8C&pg=PT374|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|isbn=978-1-61172-008-2|page=374}}</ref> and ''The Amusement of Beasts''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Damian Flanagan|title=Yukio Mishima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSUmCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA251|date=15 August 2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-419-9|page=251}}</ref>\n\nThe novel's first edition cover illustration was done by [[Kaii Higashiyama]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kosho.or.jp/products/detail.php?product_id=6235391 |title=\u7363\u306e\u622f\u308c(\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u7d00\u592b) |website=\u5ca9\u68ee\u66f8\u5e97 |publisher=\u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u53e4\u66f8\u7c4d\u5546\u696d\u5354\u540c\u7d44\u5408 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n;US Edition (Vintage International)\nThe cover was created by award winning cover designer John Gall.

In 1945, Hugo Boss had a photograph in his apartment of him with Hitler, taken at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], Hitler's [[Obersalzberg]] retreat.<ref name=\"Kober\">{{cite web|last=Kober|first=Henning|title=\u00dcber den Umgang mit Zwangsarbeiterinnen bei Boss|language=German|date=July 29, 2001|work=Metzinger Zwangsarbeit|url=http://www.metzingen-zwangsarbeit.de/Zwangsarbeit_in_Metzingen.doc|accessdate=January 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBecause of his early NS Party membership, his financial support of the SS and the uniforms delivered to the National Socialist German Workers Party, Boss was considered both an \"activist\" and a \"supporter and beneficiary of National Socialism\".

In 1950, after a period supplying work uniforms, the company received its first order for [[men's suit]]s, resulting in an expansion to 150 employees by the end of the year. By 1960, the company was producing ready made suits. In 1969, Eugen retired, leaving the company to his sons Jochen and Uwe, who began international development. In 1970, the first Boss branded suits were produced, with the brand becoming a registered trademark in 1977. This was followed by the start of the company's long association with motorsport, sponsoring [[Formula One]] driver [[Niki Lauda]], and later the [[McLaren|McLaren Racing]] team.\n\nIn 1984, the first Boss branded fragrance appeared. This helped the company gain the required growth for listing on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] the following year. The brand began sponsorship of golf with [[Bernhard Langer]] in 1986 and tennis with the [[Davis Cup]] in 1987. In 1989, Boss launched its first licensed [[sunglasses]].

Founded in 1888 as the '''Football League''', the league is the oldest such competition in [[Association football around the world|world football]]. It was the top-level football league in England from its foundation until 1992, when the top 22 clubs split away to form the [[Premier League]].\n\nThe three leagues below the Premier League are known as the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], [[EFL League One|League One]] and [[EFL League Two|League Two]], normally with 24 clubs in each division (72 in total; in the 2019\u201320 season, League One was reduced to 23 following the expulsion of [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]). Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest-placed clubs in the Premier League, and the bottom clubs of League Two to switch with the top clubs of the [[National League (division)|National League]], thus integrating the League into the [[English football league system]]. Although primarily a competition for English clubs, clubs from Wales&nbsp;\u2013 currently [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] &nbsp;\u2013 also take part, while in the past [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]], [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] and [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] have been members.\n\nThe Football League was associated with a title sponsor between 1983 and 2016.

The Football League was founded in 1888 by then-[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] director [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], originally with 12 member clubs. Steady growth and the addition of more divisions meant that by 1950 the League had 92 clubs. Financial considerations led to a major shake-up in 1992, when in a step to maximise their revenue the leading members of the Football League broke away to form their own competition, the FA Premier League, which was renamed the [[Premier League]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/22/65/0,,12306~91426,00.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304205428/http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/22/65/0%2C%2C12306~91426%2C00.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2009 |title=Premier League and Barclays Announce Competition Name Change |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 November 2006 |format=PDF |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Football League therefore no longer includes the top 20 clubs who belong to this group, although [[promotion and relegation]] between the Football League and the Premier League continues.

Each division has 24 clubs, and in any given season a club plays each of the others in the same division twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents. This makes for a total of 46 games played each season.\n\nClubs gain three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat. At the end of the season, clubs at the top of their division may win promotion to the next higher division, while those at the bottom may be relegated to the next lower one. At the top end of the competition, three Championship clubs win promotion from the Football League to the Premier League, with the bottom three Premier League clubs taking their places. At the lower end, two League Two clubs lose their Football League status with relegation to the [[National League (division)|National]] division of the [[National League (English football)|National League]], while two teams from that division join League Two of The Football League in their stead.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Division\n! Promoted directly\n! Promoted via [[Football League play-offs|playoffs]]\n!

It is therefore possible for a team finishing sixth in the Championship or League One, or seventh in League Two, to be promoted rather than the clubs finishing immediately above them in the standings.\n\nSince the 2004\u201305 season, penalties have existed for clubs entering financial administration during the season. If a club enters administration before 31 March of any given season, they will immediately be deducted 12 points; entering administration from 1 April onward will see the points deduction either held over until the end of the season (if the club finishes outside the relegation places), or applied the following season (if the club was relegated anyway). It is also required that a club exiting administration agree a Creditor's Voluntary Agreement, and pay in full any other footballing creditors. Failure to do either of these will result in a second, potentially unlimited (though in practise usually between 15 and 20) points deduction.\n\nThe other main situation in which is a club may lose points is by fielding an improperly registered or otherwise ineligible player. If a club is found to have done this, then any points earned from any match that player participated in will be deducted; the opposing club(s) do not earn any points from this, however.\n\n===Cup===\nThe EFL organises two knock-out cup competitions: the [[EFL Cup]] (officially called the Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons) and the [[EFL Trophy]] (officially called the leasing.com Trophy also for sponsorship reasons). The EFL Cup was established in 1960 and is open to all EFL and Premier League clubs, with the winner eligible to participate in the [[UEFA Europa League]]. The EFL Trophy, established in 1983, is for clubs belonging to EFL League One and EFL League Two. The organisation celebrated its 100th birthday in 1988 with a [[Football League Centenary Tournament|Centenary Tournament]] at Wembley between 16 of its member clubs.\n\n==History==\n[[File:mcgregor.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], founder of The Football League]]\nAfter four years of debate, [[the Football Association]] finally permitted professionalism on 20 July 1885.

Preston won the first league title without losing a game, and completed the first league\u2013cup [[Double (association football)|double]] by also taking the [[FA Cup]].\n\nIn 1890 Stoke were not re-elected to the league, and were replaced for the 1890\u201391 season by [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], who won it in their second, third and fifth year. Stoke were re-elected for the 1891\u201392 season, along with [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]], to take the league to 14 clubs.\n\nPreston North End, Aston Villa and Sunderland dominated the early years of the game; in the first fourteen seasons the only other clubs to win (single) league titles were Everton, Sheffield United and Liverpool.\n\n===Addition of the Second Division===\n[[File:AstonVilla1896-97.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The [[Aston Villa]] team in 1897, after winning both the [[FA Cup]] and the Football League.]]\nA new Second Division was formed in 1892 with the absorption of the rival [[Football Alliance]]. Alliance clubs [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]] (later Sheffield Wednesday) and [[Manchester United F.C.|Newton Heath]] (later Manchester United) were added to the new First Division, and Darwen were reallocated to the new Second, bringing the First Division total to 16 clubs. With the addition of [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] (from [[The Combination]]), [[Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]] (later Port Vale, from the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]]) and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] (from the [[Northern Football League|Northern League]]), the Second Division started with 12 clubs, as Alliance club [[Birmingham St George's F.C.|Birmingham St George's]] disbanded at that point. The bottom clubs of the lower division were subsequently required to apply for re-election to the League at the end of each season.\n\nAccrington F.C. were relegated from Division 1, however chose to resign from the Football League rather than play in the 2nd division. [[Bootle F.C. (1879)|Bootle]] were dissolved because of financial problems. The Second Division increased to 15 clubs for season 1893\u201394. Instead of three clubs expanding the division, five were added to make the number to fifteen. The additional clubs were [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] from the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]], [[Middlesbrough Ironopolis F.C.|Middlesbrough Ironopolis]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] from the Northern League, [[Rotherham Town F.C.

At this point both Divisions of the League expanded to eighteen, with the addition of [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] from the Midland and [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire]] Leagues, Burslem Port Vale, [[Glossop North End A.F.C.|Glossop]] from the Midland League, and [[New Brighton Tower F.C.|New Brighton Tower]] from the Lancashire League to the Second Division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/lghist/fl1898.htm|title=Football Club History Database \u2013 Football League 1897\u201398|work=fchd.info}}</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAfter a few years other northern clubs began to catch up, with the likes of Newcastle United and Manchester United joining the League and having success. From 1900, Aston Villa (1899\u20131900, 1909\u201310), Liverpool (1900\u201301, 1905\u201306), Sunderland (1901\u201302, 1912\u201313), The Wednesday (1902\u201303, 1903\u201304), Newcastle United (1904\u201305, 1908\u201309), Manchester United (1907\u201308, 1910\u201311) and Blackburn Rovers (1911\u201312, 1913\u201314) all won two titles prior to the outbreak of the [[First World War]], while Everton added a second title to their much earlier success in the last season, 1914\u201315.\n\nIt was not until the early years of the 20th century, and the expansion of both Leagues to 20 clubs (in 1905), that further southern clubs such as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] (1905), [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (1907) and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (1908) established themselves in the League. There would be a further wait until 1931 before a southern club, Arsenal, would win the League for the first time.\n\nUnlike in most other Leagues in Europe, no single English club managed to remain an ever-present in the division during the one hundred and four years of its existence as the top division in the country. Everton come closest, missing just four seasons through relegation, and remain one of only three clubs in England to have played over 100 top-flight seasons, along with Aston Villa and Arsenal.\n\n===Post-First World War===\nThe League was suspended for four seasons during the [[World War I|First World War]] and resumed in 1919 with the First and Second Divisions expanded to 22 clubs. On resumption [[West Bromwich Albion]] (1919\u201320) and [[Burnley]] (1920\u201321), both original 12 clubs, won their first-ever titles (in [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|Albion's]] case their only title to date).\n\nIn 1920, leading clubs from the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] joined the League to form a new Third Division, which in 1921 was renamed the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] upon the further addition of more clubs in a new [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]]. One club from each of these divisions would gain promotion to the Second Division, with the two relegated clubs being assigned to the more appropriate Third Division. To accommodate potential difficulties in this arrangement, clubs in the Midlands such as [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] or Walsall would sometimes be moved from one Third Division to the other.\n\nFollowing this burst of post-war growth, the League entered a prolonged period of relative stability with few changes in the membership, although there were changes on the pitch. In 1925, a new [[Offside (association football)|offside]] law reduced the number of defending opponents between the attacking player and the goal from three to two, leading to a large increase in goals, and numbers on shirts were introduced in 1939.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1926, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] were the first team to win three consecutive league titles (and never won another one, though they finished as runners-up for the following two years). This was equalled by [[Arsenal]] between 1932 and 1935, during a period from 1930 to 1938 in which they won five titles out of eight.\n\n[[Manchester City]] (1936\u201337) became the only other club to be added to the list of Football League winners prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the fourteenth club to achieve the feat since 1888\u201389.\n\nIn the [[1938\u201339 Football League|1938-39]] season [[Everton F.C|Everton]] won the title for the fifth time, but suffered the same fate as in [[1914\u201315 Football League|1915]], being champions when football was suspended due to the World War.\n\n===Post-Second World War===\nThe League was suspended once more in 1939 with the outbreak of the Second World War, this time for seven seasons. The Third Divisions were expanded to 24 clubs each in 1950, bringing the total number of League clubs to 92, and in 1958 the decision was made to end the regionalisation of the Third Divisions and reorganise the clubs into a new nationwide Third Division and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. To accomplish this, the clubs in the top half of both the Third Division North and South joined together to form the new Third Division, and those in the bottom half made up the Fourth Division. An earlier suggestion that the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] should become the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] become the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] on the basis of better attendances and that they tended to fare better when promoted was rejected.<ref name=\"D3 / D4 \u2013 original suggestion\">{{Cite book | last = Bowser | first = Paul | title = Bootham Crescent: A Second Home \u2013 Part  1 | year = 2019 | publisher =Minsterman Books | isbn = 978-1-9996907-0-0 | page = 219}}</ref> Four clubs were promoted and relegated between these two lower divisions, while two clubs exchanged places in the upper divisions until 1974, when the number increased to three.\n\nClubs to win their first League titles in the quarter-century following the Second World War were [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350), [[Tottenham Hotspur]] (1950\u201351 and 1960\u201361), founder members of the League Wolverhampton Wanderers (1953\u201354, 1957\u201358 and 1958\u201359), [[Chelsea F.C|Chelsea]] (1954\u201355), [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] (1961\u201362) and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] (1968\u201369).\n\n[[Tottenham Hotspur]] became the first club in the 20th century to win the League and [[F.A. Cup]] 'Double' in 1960\u201361, a season after [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] had come within a whisker of achieving the feat themselves ([[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] won the 1959\u201360 [[F.A. Cup]] and were runners-up to [[Burnley]] in the League by a single point).\n\nPost-Second World War changes in league football included the use of white balls in 1951 and the first [[Floodlight#Association football|floodlit game]] (played between Portsmouth and [[Newcastle United]]) in 1956, opening up the possibility of midweek evening matches.\n\nBy far the biggest change for league clubs during this era was a new cup competition open to all the members of the League, the [[Football League Cup]], which was held for the first time in 1960\u201361 to provide clubs with a new source of income. Aston Villa won the inaugural League Cup and, despite an initial lack of enthusiasm on the part of some other big clubs, the competition became firmly established in the footballing calendar, although it was not until the dawn of the 1970s that all 92 Football League clubs regularly participated in the competition season after season.\n\nSubstitutes (1 per team per match) were first allowed for injured players in 1965, and for any reason the next year.\n\n===1970s===\n\nThe first ever Sunday EFL game was held on 20 January 1974 (11:30 kick off) and was played between 2nd Division rivals Millwall and Fulham at The Den. Millwall won 1-0. The first ever Sunday top flight game was between Chelsea and Stoke a week later.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/23/first-sunday-football-1974-millwall-fulham | title=20 January 1974: The first Sunday football | date=23 January 2010 | newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=29 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBeginning with the 1976\u201377 season, the clubs finishing level on points began to be separated according to goal difference (the difference between goals scored and goals conceded) rather than goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded). This was an effort to prevent unduly defensive play encouraged by the greater advantage in limiting goals allowed. In the event that clubs had equal points and equal goal differences, priority was given to the club that had scored the most goals. There has been only one season, 1988\u201389, when this level of differentiation was necessary to determine the League champion, and this was the occasion of one of the most dramatic nights in League history, when Arsenal beat Liverpool 2\u20130 at [[Anfield]] in [[Liverpool F.C. 0\u20132 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|the last game of the season]] to win the League on this tiebreaker \u2013 by a single [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] goal in the final minute of the final game of the season. Both teams would finish with the same amount of goal difference, but Arsenal scored more goals during the season.\n\nTwo clubs won their first League titles during the 1970s: founder members of the League Derby County (1971\u201372 and 1974\u201375) and Nottingham Forest (1977\u201378), both clubs managed by [[Brian Clough]] and [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]]. Nottingham Forest's title in 1977\u201378 turned out to be the last occasion that a first-time champion won the First Division title during The Football League era, before the First Division clubs formed the Premier League in 1992. The next first-time League champion club would be Leicester City in the [[2015\u201316 Premier League|2015\u201316]] season, the first such during the Premier League era.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Football League logo (1988\u20132004).svg|frame|The logo of The Football League from 1988 until 2004]] -->\n\n===1980s===\nAnother important change was made in 1981, when it was decided to award [[three points for a win]] instead of two, a further effort to increase attacking football. (This scoring rule was not added by [[FIFA]] to the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s until the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 cup]] after the perceived dominance of defensive play at [[1990 FIFA World Cup|Italia 90]].)\n\nThe early 1980s also saw a significant decline in league attendances as a result of the [[Early 1980s recession|recession]] and the ongoing problem of [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]]. This did no favours for the financial position and league standing of numerous clubs, and several \u2013 including Wolverhampton Wanderers, [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] \u2013 were almost forced out of business as a result. The fortunes of the First Division clubs suffered a fresh blow in 1985 when all English clubs were banned from European competitions as a result of the [[Heysel disaster]], where rioting involving Liverpool fans at the [[1985 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] in Belgium resulted in 39 spectator deaths.\n\nIn a similar vein, playoffs to determine promotion places were introduced for the 1986\u201387 season so that more clubs remained eligible for promotion closer to the end of the season, and at the same time to aid in the reduction over two years of the number of clubs in the First Division from 22 to 20. For the first two seasons, the playoffs were contested between the lowest placed team to avoid automatic relegation and three highest placed teams to miss out on automatic promotion in the division below, before it was altered from the 1988\u201389 season to include just the four clubs who had missed out on automatic promotion in the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions. 1986\u201387 was the first season of the decade where Football League attendances increased, helped by improved economic conditions and falling unemployment nationally.\n\nAt the same time, automatic promotion and relegation between the Fourth Division and the [[Football Conference]] was introduced for one club, replacing the annual application for re-election to the League of the bottom four clubs and linking the League to the developing [[National League System]] pyramid.\n\nEmblematic of the confusion that was beginning to envelop the game, the number of clubs at the top of the league would return to 22 for the 1991\u201392 season, which increased competitiveness in the 1990\u201391 season as four teams would be promoted from the Second and Third Divisions instead of the normal three (with seventh place being the minimum position for the playoffs), while in the Fourth Division an unprecedented five promotion places were up for grabs, with eighth place being high enough for the playoffs. The end of the ban on English clubs in Europe also helped boost interest in English football. However, the economy was now in another [[Early 1990s recession|recession]], and added to that the clubs in the top two English divisions were faced with the requirement of having all-seater stadiums by 1994\u201395 to comply with the [[Taylor Report]] that followed the death of 96 Liverpool fans as a result of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in April 1989.\n\nThe League also expanded to 93 clubs for the 1991\u201392 season and planned to raise the number again to 94 clubs for 1992\u201393, but after [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] and [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]] both went out of business within a few months of each other in mid-1992, this plan was abandoned. The issues creating the uncertainty in the game all centred on money.\n\nThe increasing influence of money in English football was evident with such events as the first \u00a31m transfer in the game, that of [[Trevor Francis]] from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] to Nottingham Forest in February 1979. The first \u00a32million player transferred between English clubs was [[Tony Cottee]], who moved from West Ham United to Everton in July 1988 \u2013 although several players had already been sold by English clubs to foreign clubs for even higher fees.\n\nBefore the formation of the FA Premier League, the highest transfer fee paid was \u00a32.9million for the transfer of [[Dean Saunders]] from Derby County to Liverpool during the 1991 close season. The first \u00a33million player was [[Alan Shearer]], who moved from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] to Blackburn Rovers in July 1992, the summer before the first Premier League season. At the close of the 1991 season, a proposal for the establishment of a new league was tabled that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |title=In the matter of an agreement between the Football Association Premier League Limited and the Football Association Limited and the Football League Limited and their respective member clubs |publisher=HM Courts Service |year=2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222536/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref> The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship agreements.

There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained on the same terms as between the old First and Second Divisions.\n\nThe 1991\u201392 season had ended with 92 clubs in the Football League, with the 93rd club, Aldershot, having been declared bankrupt and forced to resign from the Fourth Division a few weeks before the end of the season. [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], the GM Vauxhall Conference champions, were promoted to the new Division Three as the 71st members of the reorganised Football League. However, this number would soon drop to 70 due to the closure of Maidstone United at the beginning of the 1992\u201393 season, and the Football League abandoned its expansion plan. This meant that there would once again be 92 clubs in the highest four divisions of English football.\n\n===1992\u20132004: Three divisions===\nThere were few major changes to the structure Football League in the 12 seasons which followed the breakaway that created the FA Premier League, perhaps the only notable changes being an expansion to 72 clubs from 70 for the 1995\u201396 season after the Premier League was streamlined to 20 clubs from 22, and the introduction of a second relegation place to the Football Conference from the end of the 2002\u201303 season.\n\nHowever, following the formation of the Premier League, it became increasingly difficult for newly promoted clubs to establish themselves in the top flight. Whereas newly promoted teams had once normally survived for at least a few seasons in the old First Division, it was now the norm for at least one newly promoted club to be relegated straight back from the Premier League to Division One. In the nine seasons that followed the formation of the Premier League, at least one newly promoted club suffered this fate \u2013 and in the 1997\u201398 season it happened to all three newly promoted teams. There were exceptions, however; including Blackburn Rovers, who were promoted to the Premier League on its formation and were champions three years later, and Newcastle United, who were promoted in 1993 and finished in the top six for the next four seasons, finishing Premier League runners-up twice.\n\nThe trend of relegated clubs to win an instant promotion back to the top flight continued, however. In the 12 seasons following the formation of the Premier League, there were just three seasons where none of the newly relegated sides failed to win an instant return to the Premier League.\n\nThe widening gulf between the top two divisions of English football can largely be put down to the increased wealth of the Premier League clubs, and the wealth gained by these clubs \u2013 combined with parachute payments following relegation \u2013 has also made it easier for many of them to quickly win promotion back to the top flight.\n\nIn spite of the economic prosperity between 1992 and 2004, many Football League clubs did run into financial problems during this time, although none of them were forced out of business. These include [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and Leicester City. Some of these clubs were faced with financial problems as a result of the lost revenue resulting from Premier League relegation and a failure to return to this level, as well as the collapse of [[ITV Digital]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1896732.stm |title=ITV Digital goes broke |date=27 March 2002 |accessdate=10 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nJust after the end of the 2001\u201302 season, [[South London]] based [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] were given permission to move to [[Milton Keynes]], some 70 miles from their traditional home. A relocation on this scale was unprecedented in English football, and led to the majority of the club's fans switching their support to a new fan-formed club, [[AFC Wimbledon]], who joined the [[Combined Counties Football League|Combined Counties League]]. The club's move to Milton Keynes was completed in September 2003, when they became tenants of the [[National Hockey Stadium (Milton Keynes)|National Hockey Stadium]] until a new permanent home was completed four years later, and the club's name changed to [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in June 2004.\n[[File:The Football League.png|thumb|right|100px|Football League logo, 2004\u20132016]]\n\n===2004 Football League rebranding===\n[[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] was the first season to feature the rebranded Football League. The First Division, Second Division and Third Division were renamed the Football League Championship, Football League One and Football League Two respectively. [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] replaced the [[Nationwide Building Society]] as title sponsor.\n\nThe Football League's collection of historic materials is held by the [[National Football Museum]].\n\n===2016 rebranding===\nOn 12 November 2015, The Football League announced that it would be officially renamed the English Football League, with the abbreviation ''EFL'' to be emphasised, effective from the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season. The rebranding would include a new logo consisting of a circle composed of three swathes of 24 smaller circles each. The three swathes are to represent the three divisions and the 24 circles in each swathe (making a total of 72 circles) represent the 72 clubs in the league system. Each club is to be presented with its own bespoke version of the logo. Football League Chief Executive Shaun Harvey said:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/news/article/2015/football-league-to-be-re-named-the-english-football-league-2798210.aspx|title=Football League to be re-named the English Football League |date=12 October 2015 |accessdate=10 January 2017 |publisher=The Football League}}</ref>\n{{cquote|The new EFL name rightly emphasises the central role our clubs play at the heart of English professional football.

We believe the EFL name and brand will give our competitions an identity that is new and distinct, while at the same time retaining our unique heritage.

The old Second Division became the new First Division, the Third Division became the Second Division, and the Fourth Division became the Third Division. The financial health of its clubs had become perhaps the highest League priority due to the limited resources available. However, there were some promising signs for the future, as the League planned to announce new initiatives beginning with the 2004\u201305 season, coinciding with the start of a new sponsorship agreement with Coca-Cola. The first of these changes was a rebranding of the League with the renaming of the First Division as The Championship, the Second Division as League One and the Third Division as League Two. The League's cup competitions have had different sponsors. The current sponsor Sky Bet commissioned a suite of trophies for the league from silversmith [[Thomas Lyte]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballbusinessawards.com/2014_shortlist_summaries.html|title=Football Business Awards 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118064251/http://www.footballbusinessawards.com/2014_shortlist_summaries.html|archivedate=18 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Media rights==\n=== United Kingdom and Ireland ===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|+ Matches broadcast in the United Kingdom and Ireland\n|- style=\"font-size:85%\"\n!Seasons\n!Sky\n!BBC\n!{{tooltip|Total|Total number of games broadcast}}\n|- style=\"font-size:75%\"\n|?\u20132009||?||?||?\n|- style=\"font-size:75%\"\n|2009\u20132012||65||10||75\n|- style=\"font-size:75%\"\n|2012\u20132015||75||\u2013||75\n|- style=\"font-size:75%\"\n|2015\u20132018||112||\u2013||112\n|- style=\"font-size:75%\"\n|2019\u20132024||138||\u2013||138\n|}\nThe other major source of revenue is television. The 1980s saw competition between terrestrial broadcasters for the rights to show League matches, but the arrival on the scene of satellite broadcaster [[Sky (United Kingdom)|British Sky Broadcasting]] (Sky TV), eagerly searching for attractive programming to build its customer base and willing to pay huge sums, changed the picture entirely. The League's top tier clubs had been agitating for several years to be able to keep more of the League's revenue for themselves, threatening to break away and form their own league if necessary. In 1992 the threat was realised as the First Division clubs left to establish the FA Premier League and signed a contract for exclusive live coverage of their games with Sky TV. The FA Premier League agreed to maintain the promotion and relegation of three clubs with The Football League, but The League was now in a far weaker position \u2013 without its best clubs and without the clout to negotiate high-revenue TV deals. This problem was exacerbated with the collapse in 2002 of ITV Digital, holder of TV rights for The Football League, which cost League clubs millions of pounds in revenue.\n\nIn 2001 the league signed a \u00a3315&nbsp;million deal with [[ITV Digital]], but in March 2002 the broadcaster was put into administration by its [[Carlton Communications|parent]] [[Granada plc|companies]] when the league refused to accept a \u00a3130&nbsp;million reduction in the deal. As a result, the Football League cuts off the deal and ITV Digital suffered the losses. In November 2007 the league announced a new domestic rights deal worth \u00a3264&nbsp;million with Sky and the BBC for the three seasons from 2009 to 2012. It covers Football League, League Cup and Football League Trophy matches and the full range of media: terrestrial and pay television, broadband internet, video-on-demand and mobile services. The deal represents a 135% increase on the previous deal and works out at an average of over \u00a31.2 million per club per season, though some clubs will receive more than others. Sky will provide the majority of the coverage and the BBC broadcast 10 exclusively live matches from the Championship per season and the semi-finals and finals of the League Cup.<ref>[http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10794~1160914,00.html Football League Agrees Historic Deal with Sky Sports and BBC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215071405/http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10794~1160914%2C00.html |date=15 December 2007 }}, ''www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk'', 6 November 2007.</ref>\nIn 2012, Sky Sports signed a new exclusive deal to broadcast all matches after the BBC pulled out of the deal owing the financial cuts that the BBC Sport department was going through.

(Leeds United v. Watford, [[Millennium Stadium]])]]\nThe Football League Play-offs are used as a means of determining the final promotion place from each of the league's three divisions. This is a way of keeping the possibility of promotion open for more clubs towards the end of the season.\n\nThe format was first introduced in 1987, after the decision was made to reduce the top flight from 22 to 20 clubs over the next two seasons; initially, the play-offs involved the team finishing immediately above the relegation places in a given division and the three teams who finished immediately below the promotion places in the division below \u2013 essentially one team was fighting to keep their place in the higher division while the other three teams were attempting to take it from them. In 1989, this was changed\u2014instead of teams from different divisions playing each other, the four teams below the automatic promotion places contested the play-offs. The first season of this arrangement saw the final being contested in home and away legs. The four teams play-off in two semi-finals and a final, with the team winning the final being promoted. Originally the semi-finals and the final were all two-legged home-and-away affairs, but from 1990 onwards the final is a one-off match. It is in this format that the play-offs continue today. A proposal to have six teams rather than four competing for the final place was defeated at the league's AGM in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2966968.stm |title=Play-off plans shelved |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 June 2003 |accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Play-off winners===\n{| class=wikitable \n|-\n!

'''English Football League''' ('''EFL''') is a league competition featuring professional [[association football]] clubs from [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Founded in 1888 as the '''Football League''', the league is the oldest such competition in [[Association football around the world|world football]]. It was the top-level football league in England from its foundation until 1992, when the top 22 clubs split away to form the [[Premier League]].\n\nThe three leagues below the Premier League are known as the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], [[EFL League One|League One]] and [[EFL League Two|League Two]], normally with 24 clubs in each division (72 in total; in the 2019\u201320 season, League One was reduced to 23 following the expulsion of [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]). Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest-placed clubs in the Premier League, and the bottom clubs of League Two to switch with the top clubs of the [[National League (division)|National League]], thus integrating the League into the [[English football league system]]. Although primarily a competition for English clubs, clubs from Wales&nbsp;\u2013 currently [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] &nbsp;\u2013 also take part, while in the past [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]], [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] and [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] have been members.\n\nThe Football League was associated with a title sponsor between 1983 and 2016. As this sponsor changed over the years the league too has been known by various names.<ref>After its title sponsors, the Football League has formerly been known as the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] League, the [[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]] League, the [[Barclays]] League, the [[Endsleigh Insurance|Endsleigh]] League, the [[Nationwide Building Society|Nationwide]] Football League, the [[Coca-Cola]] Football League and the [[RWE npower|npower]] The Football League</ref> Starting with the 2016\u201317 season, the league has moved away from having a title sponsor, rebranding itself as the English Football League (EFL), in much the same way the Premier League is known as the \"EPL\" internationally.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rebranded Football League changing its name to English Football League as EFL unveils new logo |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/11991553/Rebranded-Football-League-changing-its-name-to-English-Football-League-as-EFL-unveils-new-logo.html |accessdate=7 August 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe English Football League is also the name of the governing body of the league competition, and this body also organises two knock-out cup competitions, the [[EFL Cup]] and the [[EFL Trophy]].

It runs the oldest professional football league competition in the world. It also organises two knockout cup competitions, the [[EFL Cup]] and [[EFL Trophy]]. The Football League was founded in 1888 by then-[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] director [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], originally with 12 member clubs. Steady growth and the addition of more divisions meant that by 1950 the League had 92 clubs. Financial considerations led to a major shake-up in 1992, when in a step to maximise their revenue the leading members of the Football League broke away to form their own competition, the FA Premier League, which was renamed the [[Premier League]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/22/65/0,,12306~91426,00.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304205428/http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/22/65/0%2C%2C12306~91426%2C00.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2009 |title=Premier League and Barclays Announce Competition Name Change |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 November 2006 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Football League therefore no longer includes the top 20 clubs who belong to this group, although [[promotion and relegation]] between the Football League and the Premier League continues.

Each division has 24 clubs, and in any given season a club plays each of the others in the same division twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents. This makes for a total of 46 games played each season.\n\nClubs gain three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat. At the end of the season, clubs at the top of their division may win promotion to the next higher division, while those at the bottom may be relegated to the next lower one. At the top end of the competition, three Championship clubs win promotion from the Football League to the Premier League, with the bottom three Premier League clubs taking their places. At the lower end, two League Two clubs lose their Football League status with relegation to the [[National League (division)|National]] division of the [[National League (English football)|National League]], while two teams from that division join League Two of The Football League in their stead.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Division\n! Promoted directly\n! Promoted via [[Football League play-offs|playoffs]]\n! Relegated\n|-\n| The Championship\n| Top 2 clubs\n| One from 3rd to 6th-place finishers\n| Bottom 3 clubs\n|-\n| League One\n| Top 2 clubs\n| One from 3rd to 6th-place finishers\n| Bottom 4 clubs\n|-\n| League Two\n| Top 3 clubs\n| One from 4th to 7th-place finishers\n| Bottom 2 clubs\n|}\n\nPromotion and relegation are determined by final league positions, but to sustain interest for more clubs over the length of the season one promotion place from each division is decided according to a playoff between four clubs, which takes place at the end of the season. It is therefore possible for a team finishing sixth in the Championship or League One, or seventh in League Two, to be promoted rather than the clubs finishing immediately above them in the standings.\n\nSince the 2004\u201305 season, penalties have existed for clubs entering financial administration during the season. If a club enters administration before 31 March of any given season, they will immediately be deducted 12 points; entering administration from 1 April onward will see the points deduction either held over until the end of the season (if the club finishes outside the relegation places), or applied the following season (if the club was relegated anyway). It is also required that a club exiting administration agree a Creditor's Voluntary Agreement, and pay in full any other footballing creditors. Failure to do either of these will result in a second, potentially unlimited (though in practise usually between 15 and 20) points deduction.\n\nThe other main situation in which is a club may lose points is by fielding an improperly registered or otherwise ineligible player. If a club is found to have done this, then any points earned from any match that player participated in will be deducted; the opposing club(s) do not earn any points from this, however.\n\n===Cup===\nThe EFL organises two knock-out cup competitions: the [[EFL Cup]] (officially called the Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons) and the [[EFL Trophy]] (officially called the leasing.com Trophy also for sponsorship reasons). The EFL Cup was established in 1960 and is open to all EFL and Premier League clubs, with the winner eligible to participate in the [[UEFA Europa League]]. The EFL Trophy, established in 1983, is for clubs belonging to EFL League One and EFL League Two. The organisation celebrated its 100th birthday in 1988 with a [[Football League Centenary Tournament|Centenary Tournament]] at Wembley between 16 of its member clubs.\n\n==History==\n[[File:mcgregor.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], founder of The Football League]]\nAfter four years of debate, [[the Football Association]] finally permitted professionalism on 20 July 1885.

This points system was not agreed upon until after the season had started; the alternative proposal was one point for a win only. Preston won the first league title without losing a game, and completed the first league\u2013cup [[Double (association football)|double]] by also taking the [[FA Cup]].\n\nIn 1890 Stoke were not re-elected to the league, and were replaced for the 1890\u201391 season by [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], who won it in their second, third and fifth year. Stoke were re-elected for the 1891\u201392 season, along with [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]], to take the league to 14 clubs.\n\nPreston North End, Aston Villa and Sunderland dominated the early years of the game; in the first fourteen seasons the only other clubs to win (single) league titles were Everton, Sheffield United and Liverpool.\n\n===Addition of the Second Division===\n[[File:AstonVilla1896-97.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The [[Aston Villa]] team in 1897, after winning both the [[FA Cup]] and the Football League.]]\nA new Second Division was formed in 1892 with the absorption of the rival [[Football Alliance]]. Alliance clubs [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]] (later Sheffield Wednesday) and [[Manchester United F.C.|Newton Heath]] (later Manchester United) were added to the new First Division, and Darwen were reallocated to the new Second, bringing the First Division total to 16 clubs. With the addition of [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] (from [[The Combination]]), [[Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]] (later Port Vale, from the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]]) and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] (from the [[Northern Football League|Northern League]]), the Second Division started with 12 clubs, as Alliance club [[Birmingham St George's F.C.|Birmingham St George's]] disbanded at that point. The bottom clubs of the lower division were subsequently required to apply for re-election to the League at the end of each season.\n\nAccrington F.C. were relegated from Division 1, however chose to resign from the Football League rather than play in the 2nd division. [[Bootle F.C. (1879)|Bootle]] were dissolved because of financial problems. The Second Division increased to 15 clubs for season 1893\u201394. Instead of three clubs expanding the division, five were added to make the number to fifteen. The additional clubs were [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] from the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]], [[Middlesbrough Ironopolis F.C.|Middlesbrough Ironopolis]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] from the Northern League, [[Rotherham Town F.C. (1878)|Rotherham Town]] from the Midland League, and [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] (later Arsenal), who became the first team from the [[Southern England|South of England]] to compete.\n\nFor the following season 1894\u201395, the third season of the division, there was a net increase to 16 with the addition of [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] from the Lancashire League, [[leicester City F.C.|Leicester Fosse]] (later Leicester City) and [[Burton Wanderers F.C.|Burton Wanderers]] (who later joined with existing Second Division club [[Burton Swifts F.C.|Burton Swifts]] to form [[Burton United F.C.|Burton United]]) from the Midland League along with [[Lincoln City FC]], while Northwich resigned and Middlesbrough Ironopolis disbanded.\n\nBoth Liverpool and Bury won the division at the first attempt.\n\nIn 1895 [[Loughborough F.C.|Loughborough]] replaced [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall Town Swifts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/lghist/fl1895.htm|title=Football Club History Database \u2013 Football League 1894\u201395|work=fchd.info}}</ref> In 1896 [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] from the Lancashire League and [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]] from the Midland League replaced Burslem Port Vale and [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/lghist/fl1896.htm|title=Football Club History Database \u2013 Football League 1895\u201396|work=fchd.info}}</ref> In 1897 [[Luton Town]] from the United League replaced Burton Wanderers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/lghist/fl1897.htm|title=Football Club History Database \u2013 Football League 1896\u201397|work=fchd.info}}</ref>\n\nAutomatic promotion and relegation for two clubs was introduced in 1898 when the previous system of [[playoffs#Association football|test match]]es between the bottom two clubs of the First Division and the top two clubs of the Second Division was brought into disrepute when Stoke and Burnley colluded in the final match to ensure they were both in the First Division the next season. At this point both Divisions of the League expanded to eighteen, with the addition of [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] from the Midland and [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire]] Leagues, Burslem Port Vale, [[Glossop North End A.F.C.|Glossop]] from the Midland League, and [[New Brighton Tower F.C.|New Brighton Tower]] from the Lancashire League to the Second Division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/lghist/fl1898.htm|title=Football Club History Database \u2013 Football League 1897\u201398|work=fchd.info}}</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAfter a few years other northern clubs began to catch up, with the likes of Newcastle United and Manchester United joining the League and having success. From 1900, Aston Villa (1899\u20131900, 1909\u201310), Liverpool (1900\u201301, 1905\u201306), Sunderland (1901\u201302, 1912\u201313), The Wednesday (1902\u201303, 1903\u201304), Newcastle United (1904\u201305, 1908\u201309), Manchester United (1907\u201308, 1910\u201311) and Blackburn Rovers (1911\u201312, 1913\u201314) all won two titles prior to the outbreak of the [[First World War]], while Everton added a second title to their much earlier success in the last season, 1914\u201315.\n\nIt was not until the early years of the 20th century, and the expansion of both Leagues to 20 clubs (in 1905), that further southern clubs such as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] (1905), [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (1907) and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (1908) established themselves in the League. There would be a further wait until 1931 before a southern club, Arsenal, would win the League for the first time.\n\nUnlike in most other Leagues in Europe, no single English club managed to remain an ever-present in the division during the one hundred and four years of its existence as the top division in the country. Everton come closest, missing just four seasons through relegation, and remain one of only three clubs in England to have played over 100 top-flight seasons, along with Aston Villa and Arsenal.\n\n===Post-First World War===\nThe League was suspended for four seasons during the [[World War I|First World War]] and resumed in 1919 with the First and Second Divisions expanded to 22 clubs. On resumption [[West Bromwich Albion]] (1919\u201320) and [[Burnley]] (1920\u201321), both original 12 clubs, won their first-ever titles (in [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|Albion's]] case their only title to date).\n\nIn 1920, leading clubs from the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] joined the League to form a new Third Division, which in 1921 was renamed the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] upon the further addition of more clubs in a new [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]]. One club from each of these divisions would gain promotion to the Second Division, with the two relegated clubs being assigned to the more appropriate Third Division. To accommodate potential difficulties in this arrangement, clubs in the Midlands such as [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] or Walsall would sometimes be moved from one Third Division to the other.\n\nFollowing this burst of post-war growth, the League entered a prolonged period of relative stability with few changes in the membership, although there were changes on the pitch. In 1925, a new [[Offside (association football)|offside]] law reduced the number of defending opponents between the attacking player and the goal from three to two, leading to a large increase in goals, and numbers on shirts were introduced in 1939.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1926, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] were the first team to win three consecutive league titles (and never won another one, though they finished as runners-up for the following two years). This was equalled by [[Arsenal]] between 1932 and 1935, during a period from 1930 to 1938 in which they won five titles out of eight.\n\n[[Manchester City]] (1936\u201337) became the only other club to be added to the list of Football League winners prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the fourteenth club to achieve the feat since 1888\u201389.\n\nIn the [[1938\u201339 Football League|1938-39]] season [[Everton F.C|Everton]] won the title for the fifth time, but suffered the same fate as in [[1914\u201315 Football League|1915]], being champions when football was suspended due to the World War.\n\n===Post-Second World War===\nThe League was suspended once more in 1939 with the outbreak of the Second World War, this time for seven seasons. The Third Divisions were expanded to 24 clubs each in 1950, bringing the total number of League clubs to 92, and in 1958 the decision was made to end the regionalisation of the Third Divisions and reorganise the clubs into a new nationwide Third Division and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. To accomplish this, the clubs in the top half of both the Third Division North and South joined together to form the new Third Division, and those in the bottom half made up the Fourth Division. An earlier suggestion that the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] should become the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] become the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] on the basis of better attendances and that they tended to fare better when promoted was rejected.<ref name=\"D3 / D4 \u2013 original suggestion\">{{Cite book | last = Bowser | first = Paul | title = Bootham Crescent: A Second Home \u2013 Part  1 | year = 2019 | publisher =Minsterman Books | isbn = 978-1-9996907-0-0 | page = 219}}</ref> Four clubs were promoted and relegated between these two lower divisions, while two clubs exchanged places in the upper divisions until 1974, when the number increased to three.\n\nClubs to win their first League titles in the quarter-century following the Second World War were [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350), [[Tottenham Hotspur]] (1950\u201351 and 1960\u201361), founder members of the League Wolverhampton Wanderers (1953\u201354, 1957\u201358 and 1958\u201359), [[Chelsea F.C|Chelsea]] (1954\u201355), [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] (1961\u201362) and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] (1968\u201369).\n\n[[Tottenham Hotspur]] became the first club in the 20th century to win the League and [[F.A. Cup]] 'Double' in 1960\u201361, a season after [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] had come within a whisker of achieving the feat themselves ([[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] won the 1959\u201360 [[F.A. Cup]] and were runners-up to [[Burnley]] in the League by a single point).\n\nPost-Second World War changes in league football included the use of white balls in 1951 and the first [[Floodlight#Association football|floodlit game]] (played between Portsmouth and [[Newcastle United]]) in 1956, opening up the possibility of midweek evening matches.\n\nBy far the biggest change for league clubs during this era was a new cup competition open to all the members of the League, the [[Football League Cup]], which was held for the first time in 1960\u201361 to provide clubs with a new source of income. Aston Villa won the inaugural League Cup and, despite an initial lack of enthusiasm on the part of some other big clubs, the competition became firmly established in the footballing calendar, although it was not until the dawn of the 1970s that all 92 Football League clubs regularly participated in the competition season after season.\n\nSubstitutes (1 per team per match) were first allowed for injured players in 1965, and for any reason the next year.\n\n===1970s===\n\nThe first ever Sunday EFL game was held on 20 January 1974 (11:30 kick off) and was played between 2nd Division rivals Millwall and Fulham at The Den. Millwall won 1-0. The first ever Sunday top flight game was between Chelsea and Stoke a week later.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/23/first-sunday-football-1974-millwall-fulham | title=20 January 1974: The first Sunday football | date=23 January 2010 | newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=29 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBeginning with the 1976\u201377 season, the clubs finishing level on points began to be separated according to goal difference (the difference between goals scored and goals conceded) rather than goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded). This was an effort to prevent unduly defensive play encouraged by the greater advantage in limiting goals allowed. In the event that clubs had equal points and equal goal differences, priority was given to the club that had scored the most goals. There has been only one season, 1988\u201389, when this level of differentiation was necessary to determine the League champion, and this was the occasion of one of the most dramatic nights in League history, when Arsenal beat Liverpool 2\u20130 at [[Anfield]] in [[Liverpool F.C. 0\u20132 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|the last game of the season]] to win the League on this tiebreaker \u2013 by a single [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] goal in the final minute of the final game of the season. Both teams would finish with the same amount of goal difference, but Arsenal scored more goals during the season.\n\nTwo clubs won their first League titles during the 1970s: founder members of the League Derby County (1971\u201372 and 1974\u201375) and Nottingham Forest (1977\u201378), both clubs managed by [[Brian Clough]] and [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]]. Nottingham Forest's title in 1977\u201378 turned out to be the last occasion that a first-time champion won the First Division title during The Football League era, before the First Division clubs formed the Premier League in 1992. The next first-time League champion club would be Leicester City in the [[2015\u201316 Premier League|2015\u201316]] season, the first such during the Premier League era.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Football League logo (1988\u20132004).svg|frame|The logo of The Football League from 1988 until 2004]] -->\n\n===1980s===\nAnother important change was made in 1981, when it was decided to award [[three points for a win]] instead of two, a further effort to increase attacking football. (This scoring rule was not added by [[FIFA]] to the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s until the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 cup]] after the perceived dominance of defensive play at [[1990 FIFA World Cup|Italia 90]].)\n\nThe early 1980s also saw a significant decline in league attendances as a result of the [[Early 1980s recession|recession]] and the ongoing problem of [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]]. This did no favours for the financial position and league standing of numerous clubs, and several \u2013 including Wolverhampton Wanderers, [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] \u2013 were almost forced out of business as a result. The fortunes of the First Division clubs suffered a fresh blow in 1985 when all English clubs were banned from European competitions as a result of the [[Heysel disaster]], where rioting involving Liverpool fans at the [[1985 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] in Belgium resulted in 39 spectator deaths.\n\nIn a similar vein, playoffs to determine promotion places were introduced for the 1986\u201387 season so that more clubs remained eligible for promotion closer to the end of the season, and at the same time to aid in the reduction over two years of the number of clubs in the First Division from 22 to 20. For the first two seasons, the playoffs were contested between the lowest placed team to avoid automatic relegation and three highest placed teams to miss out on automatic promotion in the division below, before it was altered from the 1988\u201389 season to include just the four clubs who had missed out on automatic promotion in the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions. 1986\u201387 was the first season of the decade where Football League attendances increased, helped by improved economic conditions and falling unemployment nationally.\n\nAt the same time, automatic promotion and relegation between the Fourth Division and the [[Football Conference]] was introduced for one club, replacing the annual application for re-election to the League of the bottom four clubs and linking the League to the developing [[National League System]] pyramid.\n\nEmblematic of the confusion that was beginning to envelop the game, the number of clubs at the top of the league would return to 22 for the 1991\u201392 season, which increased competitiveness in the 1990\u201391 season as four teams would be promoted from the Second and Third Divisions instead of the normal three (with seventh place being the minimum position for the playoffs), while in the Fourth Division an unprecedented five promotion places were up for grabs, with eighth place being high enough for the playoffs. The end of the ban on English clubs in Europe also helped boost interest in English football. However, the economy was now in another [[Early 1990s recession|recession]], and added to that the clubs in the top two English divisions were faced with the requirement of having all-seater stadiums by 1994\u201395 to comply with the [[Taylor Report]] that followed the death of 96 Liverpool fans as a result of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in April 1989.\n\nThe League also expanded to 93 clubs for the 1991\u201392 season and planned to raise the number again to 94 clubs for 1992\u201393, but after [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] and [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]] both went out of business within a few months of each other in mid-1992, this plan was abandoned. The issues creating the uncertainty in the game all centred on money.\n\nThe increasing influence of money in English football was evident with such events as the first \u00a31m transfer in the game, that of [[Trevor Francis]] from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] to Nottingham Forest in February 1979. The first \u00a32million player transferred between English clubs was [[Tony Cottee]], who moved from West Ham United to Everton in July 1988 \u2013 although several players had already been sold by English clubs to foreign clubs for even higher fees.\n\nBefore the formation of the FA Premier League, the highest transfer fee paid was \u00a32.9million for the transfer of [[Dean Saunders]] from Derby County to Liverpool during the 1991 close season. The first \u00a33million player was [[Alan Shearer]], who moved from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] to Blackburn Rovers in July 1992, the summer before the first Premier League season. At the close of the 1991 season, a proposal for the establishment of a new league was tabled that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |title=In the matter of an agreement between the Football Association Premier League Limited and the Football Association Limited and the Football League Limited and their respective member clubs |publisher=HM Courts Service |year=2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222536/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref> The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship agreements.

There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained on the same terms as between the old First and Second Divisions.\n\nThe 1991\u201392 season had ended with 92 clubs in the Football League, with the 93rd club, Aldershot, having been declared bankrupt and forced to resign from the Fourth Division a few weeks before the end of the season. [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], the GM Vauxhall Conference champions, were promoted to the new Division Three as the 71st members of the reorganised Football League. However, this number would soon drop to 70 due to the closure of Maidstone United at the beginning of the 1992\u201393 season, and the Football League abandoned its expansion plan. This meant that there would once again be 92 clubs in the highest four divisions of English football.\n\n===1992\u20132004: Three divisions===\nThere were few major changes to the structure Football League in the 12 seasons which followed the breakaway that created the FA Premier League, perhaps the only notable changes being an expansion to 72 clubs from 70 for the 1995\u201396 season after the Premier League was streamlined to 20 clubs from 22, and the introduction of a second relegation place to the Football Conference from the end of the 2002\u201303 season.\n\nHowever, following the formation of the Premier League, it became increasingly difficult for newly promoted clubs to establish themselves in the top flight. Whereas newly promoted teams had once normally survived for at least a few seasons in the old First Division, it was now the norm for at least one newly promoted club to be relegated straight back from the Premier League to Division One. In the nine seasons that followed the formation of the Premier League, at least one newly promoted club suffered this fate \u2013 and in the 1997\u201398 season it happened to all three newly promoted teams. There were exceptions, however; including Blackburn Rovers, who were promoted to the Premier League on its formation and were champions three years later, and Newcastle United, who were promoted in 1993 and finished in the top six for the next four seasons, finishing Premier League runners-up twice.\n\nThe trend of relegated clubs to win an instant promotion back to the top flight continued, however. In the 12 seasons following the formation of the Premier League, there were just three seasons where none of the newly relegated sides failed to win an instant return to the Premier League.\n\nThe widening gulf between the top two divisions of English football can largely be put down to the increased wealth of the Premier League clubs, and the wealth gained by these clubs \u2013 combined with parachute payments following relegation \u2013 has also made it easier for many of them to quickly win promotion back to the top flight.\n\nIn spite of the economic prosperity between 1992 and 2004, many Football League clubs did run into financial problems during this time, although none of them were forced out of business. These include [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and Leicester City. Some of these clubs were faced with financial problems as a result of the lost revenue resulting from Premier League relegation and a failure to return to this level, as well as the collapse of [[ITV Digital]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1896732.stm |title=ITV Digital goes broke |date=27 March 2002 |accessdate=10 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nJust after the end of the 2001\u201302 season, [[South London]] based [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] were given permission to move to [[Milton Keynes]], some 70 miles from their traditional home. A relocation on this scale was unprecedented in English football, and led to the majority of the club's fans switching their support to a new fan-formed club, [[AFC Wimbledon]], who joined the [[Combined Counties Football League|Combined Counties League]]. The club's move to Milton Keynes was completed in September 2003, when they became tenants of the [[National Hockey Stadium (Milton Keynes)|National Hockey Stadium]] until a new permanent home was completed four years later, and the club's name changed to [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in June 2004.\n[[File:The Football League.png|thumb|right|100px|Football League logo, 2004\u20132016]]\n\n===2004 Football League rebranding===\n[[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] was the first season to feature the rebranded Football League.

The rebranding would include a new logo consisting of a circle composed of three swathes of 24 smaller circles each. The three swathes are to represent the three divisions and the 24 circles in each swathe (making a total of 72 circles) represent the 72 clubs in the league system. Each club is to be presented with its own bespoke version of the logo.

The financial health of its clubs had become perhaps the highest League priority due to the limited resources available. However, there were some promising signs for the future, as the League planned to announce new initiatives beginning with the 2004\u201305 season, coinciding with the start of a new sponsorship agreement with Coca-Cola. The first of these changes was a rebranding of the League with the renaming of the First Division as The Championship, the Second Division as League One and the Third Division as League Two.

The 1980s saw competition between terrestrial broadcasters for the rights to show League matches, but the arrival on the scene of satellite broadcaster [[Sky (United Kingdom)|British Sky Broadcasting]] (Sky TV), eagerly searching for attractive programming to build its customer base and willing to pay huge sums, changed the picture entirely. The League's top tier clubs had been agitating for several years to be able to keep more of the League's revenue for themselves, threatening to break away and form their own league if necessary. In 1992 the threat was realised as the First Division clubs left to establish the FA Premier League and signed a contract for exclusive live coverage of their games with Sky TV. The FA Premier League agreed to maintain the promotion and relegation of three clubs with The Football League, but The League was now in a far weaker position \u2013 without its best clubs and without the clout to negotiate high-revenue TV deals. This problem was exacerbated with the collapse in 2002 of ITV Digital, holder of TV rights for The Football League, which cost League clubs millions of pounds in revenue.\n\nIn 2001 the league signed a \u00a3315&nbsp;million deal with [[ITV Digital]], but in March 2002 the broadcaster was put into administration by its [[Carlton Communications|parent]] [[Granada plc|companies]] when the league refused to accept a \u00a3130&nbsp;million reduction in the deal. As a result, the Football League cuts off the deal and ITV Digital suffered the losses. In November 2007 the league announced a new domestic rights deal worth \u00a3264&nbsp;million with Sky and the BBC for the three seasons from 2009 to 2012. It covers Football League, League Cup and Football League Trophy matches and the full range of media: terrestrial and pay television, broadband internet, video-on-demand and mobile services. The deal represents a 135% increase on the previous deal and works out at an average of over \u00a31.2 million per club per season, though some clubs will receive more than others. Sky will provide the majority of the coverage and the BBC broadcast 10 exclusively live matches from the Championship per season and the semi-finals and finals of the League Cup.<ref>[http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10794~1160914,00.html Football League Agrees Historic Deal with Sky Sports and BBC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215071405/http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10794~1160914%2C00.html |date=15 December 2007 }}, ''www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk'', 6 November 2007.</ref>\nIn 2012, Sky Sports signed a new exclusive deal to broadcast all matches after the BBC pulled out of the deal owing the financial cuts that the BBC Sport department was going through.

(Leeds United v. Watford, [[Millennium Stadium]])]]\nThe Football League Play-offs are used as a means of determining the final promotion place from each of the league's three divisions. This is a way of keeping the possibility of promotion open for more clubs towards the end of the season.\n\nThe format was first introduced in 1987, after the decision was made to reduce the top flight from 22 to 20 clubs over the next two seasons; initially, the play-offs involved the team finishing immediately above the relegation places in a given division and the three teams who finished immediately below the promotion places in the division below \u2013 essentially one team was fighting to keep their place in the higher division while the other three teams were attempting to take it from them. In 1989, this was changed\u2014instead of teams from different divisions playing each other, the four teams below the automatic promotion places contested the play-offs. The first season of this arrangement saw the final being contested in home and away legs. The four teams play-off in two semi-finals and a final, with the team winning the final being promoted. Originally the semi-finals and the final were all two-legged home-and-away affairs, but from 1990 onwards the final is a one-off match. It is in this format that the play-offs continue today. A proposal to have six teams rather than four competing for the final place was defeated at the league's AGM in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2966968.stm |title=Play-off plans shelved |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 June 2003 |accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Play-off winners===\n{| class=wikitable \n|-\n!
