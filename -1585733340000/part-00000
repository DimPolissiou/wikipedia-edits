In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]]. In England, 162 ancient churches and at least 24 hospitals were dedicated to him; though his only other surviving medieval dedication in Scotland is the parish church of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].<ref>Farmer 1978, p. 189.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 2.</ref> The church was first possessed by the monks of the [[Order of St Lazarus]], who ministered among lepers; if [[David I of Scotland|David I]] or [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] is the church's founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]], who founded [[St Giles in the Fields]].<ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], St Giles' was the only parish church in Edinburgh and some contemporary writers, such as [[Jean Froissart]], refer simply to the \"church of Edinburgh\".<ref>Jean Froissart in Lees 1889, p. 5.</ref><ref name=GMW103>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 103.</ref>  From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church's full title was \"the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh\".<ref>Lees 1889, p. 43.</ref> Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as \"the college kirk of Sanct Geill\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 155\">Lees 1889, p. 155.</ref> The charter of 1633 raising St Giles' to a cathedral records its common name as \"Saint Giles' Kirk\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 204\">Lees 1889, p. 204.</ref>\n\nSt Giles' held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1690 during periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland.<ref name=GMW103/> Since 1690, the Church of Scotland, as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, has had no [[bishop]]s and, therefore, no [[cathedral]]s.

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]].

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of the singing reality show, ''[[Indian Idol]],'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the peppy dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012), which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed peppy, party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]''(2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", where all crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer though she personally favored the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl\". She has appeared two times in ''[[Forbes]]''' Celebrity 100 of India (2017 and 2019).\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar is a homemaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

She began performing at religious events at the age of four and participated in the second season of singing reality show ''[[Indian Idol]]'' in which she was eliminated early in the show. After several struggles in her career, she made her Bollywood debut as a chorus singer in the film ''[[Meerabai Not Out]]'' (2008). She rose to prominence upon the release of the peppy dance track \"Second Hand Jawani\" from ''[[Cocktail (2012 film)|Cocktail]]'' (2012), which was followed by several other popular party songs including \"Sunny Sunny\" from ''[[Yaariyan (2014 film)|Yaariyan]]'' (2014) and \"London Thumakda\" from ''[[Queen (soundtrack)|Queen]]'' (2014).\n\nAfterwards, she mostly performed peppy, party tracks like \"Aao Raja\" from ''[[Gabbar Is Back]]'' (2015), \"Tu Isaq Mera\" from ''[[Hate Story 3]]'' (2015), \"Humne Pee Rakhi Hai\" from ''[[Sanam Re]]'' (2016) and \"Kar Gayi Chull\" from ''[[Kapoor & Sons]]'' (2016). She proved her versatility in musical range with the release of \"Mile Ho Tum\" from ''[[Fever (2016 film)|Fever]]'' (2016) which topped the [[List of most-viewed Indian videos on YouTube|list of most-viewed Bollywood songs on YouTube]]. She then released several chart-busters which made into the same list, including \"[[Aankh Maarey]]\" from ''[[Simmba]]'' (2018), \"[[Dilbar (song)|Dilbar]]\" from ''[[Satyameva Jayate]]'' (2018), \"Badri Ki Dulhania\" from ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017), \"Cheez Badi\" from ''[[Machine (2017 film)|Machine]]'' (2017), \"Kala Chashma\" for the film ''[[Baar Baar Dekho]]''(2016)  and the non-film song \"[[Nikle Currant]]\", where all crossed over six hundred million views. Similarly, \"Dilbar\" marks the first Indian song to reach number three spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' YouTube Music Chart.\n\nFrom 2017 onwards, Kakkar, primarily, in collaboration with [[Tanishk Bagchi]], became more associated with the trend of remaking old to very recent songs, which resulted in several backlashes targeted for the singer though she personally favored the trend of recreations and opined that they have been well appreciated. Apart from playback singing, Kakkar has appeared in several music videos and as a judge on several television reality shows including ''Indian Idol'', the same show she participated during her early days. On these shows she has been trolled in social media several times, for crying on-screen, while she openly admits that she is a \"proud emotional girl\". She has appeared two times in ''[[Forbes]]''' Celebrity 100 of India (2017 and 2019).\n\n==Early life==\nKakkar was born on 6 June 1988 in [[Rishikesh]], [[Uttarakhand]].<ref name=\"birthday\">{{cite news | url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/neha-kakkar-birthday-special-the-queen-of-blockbuster-hits-turns-28-1237772/ | title=Neha Kakkar birthday special: The Queen of blockbuster hits turns 28 | author=India.com Entertainment Desk|date=6 June 2016 | work=India.com | accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | title=Indian Idol profile - Neha Kakkar | work=[[Sify]] | accessdate=11 February 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608031628/http://www.sify.com/indianidol2/contestants/neha/ | archivedate=8 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> She is the younger sister of playback singer [[Sonu Kakkar]] and singer-composer [[Tony Kakkar]].<ref name=Tony>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news/Tony-Kakkar-One-gets-a-lot-more-popularity-as-a-singer-than-a-composer/articleshow/53209745.cms |title=Tony Kakkar: One gets a lot more popularity as a singer than a composer |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=17 March 2017 |access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> During the early days, her father, Rishikesh Kakkar used to sell [[samosa]] outside a college for a living while her mother Niti Kakkar is a homemaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/news/hindi/indian-idols-neha-kakkar-and-aditya-to-get-married-on-valentines-day-she-calls-his-mother-sasu-maa-watch-hilarious-video/articleshow/73232215.cms |title=Indian Idol's Neha Kakkar and Aditya to get married on Valentine's Day?

Any [[Depression (geology)|depression]] in the ground which collects and retains a sufficient amount of [[precipitation]] can be considered a pond, and such depressions can be formed by a variety of [[Geology|geological]] and [[Ecology|ecological]] events. \n\nRivers often leave behind ponds in natural [[Floodplain|floodplains]] after spring [[flooding]], and these can be very important to breeding fish, particularly in large river systems like the [[Amazon River|Amazon]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Ro McConnell |title=Fish Communities in Tropical Freshwaters: Their Distribution, Ecology, and Evolution |year=1975 |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-0582443488 }}</ref> Retreating [[glacier]]s can leave behind landscapes filled with small depressions, each developing its own pond; an example is the [[prairie pothole|Prairie Pothole Region]] of North America.<ref>{{cite book |author=Arnoud van der Valk |title=Northern Prairie Wetlands |year=1989 |publisher=Iowa State University |isbn=978-0813800370 }}</ref> Many areas of landscape contain small depressions which form temporary ponds after spring snow melts, or during rainy seasons; these are called [[Spring (season)|vernal]] ponds, and may be important sites for [[amphibian]] breeding.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Aram J.

Familiar examples might include [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lilies]], [[Frog|frogs]], [[Turtle|turtles]], and [[Heron|herons]]. Often, the entire margin of the pond is fringed by [[wetland]], and these wetlands support the aquatic [[food web]], provide shelter for wildlife, and stabilize the shore of the pond. Some grazing animals like [[Goose|geese]] and [[Muskrat|muskrats]] consume the wetland plants directly as a source of food.  In many other cases, however, the pond plants fall into the water and [[Decomposition|decay]]. Many invertebrates then feed on the decaying plants, and these invertebrates provide food for wetland species including fish, [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]], and herons. The open water may allow [[algae]] to grow, and these algae may support yet another food web that includes aquatic insects and [[Minnow|minnows]]. A pond, therefore, may have combinations of three different food webs, one based on larger plants, one based upon decayed plants, and one based upon algae. Hence, ponds often have many different animal species using the wide array of food sources. They, therefore, provide an important source of [[biological diversity]] in landscapes.\n\n[[Vernal pond]]s are ponds which dry up for part of the year. They are so called because they are typically at their peak depth in the spring (the meaning of \"vernal\" comes form the Latin word for [[Spring (season)|spring]]). Naturally occurring vernal ponds do not usually have fish.  The absence of fish is a very important characteristic since it provides amphibians with breeding locations free from [[predation]] by fish. Hence, introducing fish to a pond can have seriously detrimental consequences. In some parts of the world, such as California, the vernal ponds have rare and endangered plant species. On the coastal plain, they provide habitat for endangered frogs such as the [[Mississippi Gopher Frog]].<ref name=keddy />\n\n==Conservation and management==\n[[File:Niagara Falls Garden 2005.JPG|thumb|left|Formal [[rock garden]] pond with [[waterfall]]]]\nPonds, being small, are easily disrupted by human activity, such as hikers. Drainage of ponds is a frequent problem in agricultural areas, such as in the prairie potholes of North America. Although ponds are a useful source of water for cattle, [[overgrazing]] and wading can turn a pond into a muddy hole.  Nutrient sources such as fertilized pastures, human sewage, and even lawn [[fertilizer]] can cause explosive growth of algae and the loss of rooted plants and many other aquatic species.  Roads near ponds can kill large numbers of amphibians and turtles that may migrate to and from the pond as part of their annual breeding cycle. Many well-intentioned people introduce fish to ponds, being unaware that some species may eat aquatic plants, stir up sediment, and eat the young of amphibians and many other invertebrate species. The gentle slope of land into ponds also provides an expanse of habitat for wetland plants and wet meadows.  The construction of retaining walls, or lawns, can severely degrade the life in a pond.\n\nIn landscapes where ponds are artificially constructed, they are done so to provide wildlife viewing opportunities, to treat wastewater, or for aesthetic purposes, such as part of a golf course. The design of a pond determines how productive it will be for wildlife.  In general, gently sloping shorelines with broad expanses of wetland plants not only provide the best conditions for wildlife, but they help protect water quality from sources in the surrounding landscapes. It is also beneficial to allow water levels to fall each year during drier periods. Roads and houses should be kept as far away as possible.<ref>{{cite book |author=Canadian Wildlife Service |title=How Much Habitat is Enough? A Framework for Guiding Habitat Rehabilitation in Great Lakes Areas of Concern |edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=Canadian Wildlife Service |isbn=978-0662265771 }}</ref>\n\nAnother important way to add ponds back into landscapes is to restore rivers so that they can flood and meander to create large numbers of natural ponds, including vernal pools and wetlands, in river valleys.<ref>{{cite book |author=K. S. Richards |title=The Flooded Forest: Guidance for Policy Makers and River Managers in Europe on the Restoration of Floodplain Forests |year=2003 |publisher=FLOBAR2 Project |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[File:Staw naturalny.JPG|thumb|left|A pond in [[Swarzynice]], [[Poland]]]]\n\nIn origin, a pond is a variant form of the word pound, meaning a confining enclosure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/pond |title=Pond |publisher=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref> As straying cattle are enclosed in a pound so water is enclosed in a pond. In earlier times, ponds were artificial and utilitarian; as [[stew pond]]s, [[mill pond]]s and so on. The significance of this feature seems, in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants. In the United States, natural pools are often called ponds.  Ponds for a specific purpose keep the adjective, such as \"stock pond\", used for watering livestock.\n\n''Pond'' usually implies a quite small body of water, generally smaller than one would require a boat to cross. Another definition is that a pond is a body of water where even its deepest areas are reached by sunlight or where a human can walk across the entire body of water without being submerged. In some dialects of English, pond normally refers to small artificially created bodies of water.\n\nSome regions of the United States define a pond as a body of water with a surface area of less than {{convert|10|acre|ha}}.  [[Minnesota]], known as the 'land of 10,000 lakes' is commonly said to distinguish lakes from ponds, bogs and other water features by this definition,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/faq/mnfacts/water.html |title=Lakes, rivers, and wetlands facts |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref> but also says that a lake is distinguished primarily by wave action reaching the shore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakes/faqs.html#lake_definition |title=Frequently asked questions about lakes |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter December 2007 with Pond.jpg|thumb|Pond in winter]]\n\nThe term is also used for temporary accumulation of water from [[surface runoff]] (''ponded'' water).\n\nThere are various regional names for naturally occurring ponds. In Scotland, one of the terms is [[loch]]an, which may also apply to a large body of water such as a lake. In North American prairies, they may be termed [[Dry lake|playas]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Loren M. Smith |title=Playas of the Great Plains |year=2003 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0292743687 }}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nPonds are used for the provision of fish and other wildlife including [[waterfowl]], which is a source of food for humans.  [[Pollution|Pollutants]] entering ponds are often substantially mitigated by the natural [[sedimentation]] and biological activities within the water body. Ponds are also a major contributor to local [[ecosystem]] richness and diversity for both plants and animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/infd-8agmdg|title=Freshwater ecosystems:publisher=Forest Research|access-date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Hindu]] temples usually have a pond nearby so that pilgrims can take [[Bathing#Purpose|baths]]. These ponds are considered sacred.\n\nIn [[medieval]] times in [[Europe]], it was typical for many [[monastery]] and [[castle]]s (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have [[fish pond]]s. These are still common in Europe and in [[East Asia]] (notably Japan), where [[koi]] may be kept.\n\n[[Stabilization pond|Waste stabilization ponds]] are used as a low-cost method for [[wastewater treatment]].\n\nIn agriculture, [[Treatment pond|treatment ponds]] may reduce nutrients released downstream from the pond. They may also provide [[irrigation]] [[reservoir]]s at times of drought.\n\n[[File:Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de Quito, cool stone bridge.

Familiar examples might include [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lilies]], [[Frog|frogs]], [[Turtle|turtles]], and [[Heron|herons]]. Often, the entire margin of the pond is fringed by [[wetland]], and these wetlands support the aquatic [[food web]], provide shelter for wildlife, and stabilize the shore of the pond. Some grazing animals like [[Goose|geese]] and [[Muskrat|muskrats]] consume the wetland plants directly as a source of food.  In many other cases, however, the pond plants fall into the water and [[Decomposition|decay]]. Many invertebrates then feed on the decaying plants, and these invertebrates provide food for wetland species including fish, [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]], and herons. The open water may allow [[algae]] to grow, and these algae may support yet another food web that includes aquatic insects and [[Minnow|minnows]]. A pond, therefore, may have combinations of three different food webs, one based on larger plants, one based upon decayed plants, and one based upon algae. Hence, ponds often have many different animal species using the wide array of food sources. They, therefore, provide an important source of [[biological diversity]] in landscapes.\n\n[[Vernal pond]]s are ponds which dry up for part of the year. They are so called because they are typically at their peak depth in the spring (the meaning of \"vernal\" comes form the Latin word for [[Spring (season)|spring]]). Naturally occurring vernal ponds do not usually have fish.  The absence of fish is a very important characteristic since it provides amphibians with breeding locations free from [[predation]] by fish. Hence, introducing fish to a pond can have seriously detrimental consequences. In some parts of the world, such as California, the vernal ponds have rare and endangered plant species. On the coastal plain, they provide habitat for endangered frogs such as the [[Mississippi Gopher Frog]].<ref name=keddy />\n\n==Conservation and management==\n[[File:Niagara Falls Garden 2005.JPG|thumb|left|Formal [[rock garden]] pond with [[waterfall]]]]\nPonds, being small, are easily disrupted by human activity, such as hikers. Drainage of ponds is a frequent problem in agricultural areas, such as in the prairie potholes of North America. Although ponds are a useful source of water for cattle, [[overgrazing]] and wading can turn a pond into a muddy hole.  Nutrient sources such as fertilized pastures, human sewage, and even lawn [[fertilizer]] can cause explosive growth of algae and the loss of rooted plants and many other aquatic species.  Roads near ponds can kill large numbers of amphibians and turtles that may migrate to and from the pond as part of their annual breeding cycle. Many well-intentioned people introduce fish to ponds, being unaware that some species may eat aquatic plants, stir up sediment, and eat the young of amphibians and many other invertebrate species. The gentle slope of land into ponds also provides an expanse of habitat for wetland plants and wet meadows.  The construction of retaining walls, or lawns, can severely degrade the life in a pond.\n\nIn landscapes where ponds are artificially constructed, they are done so to provide wildlife viewing opportunities, to treat wastewater, or for aesthetic purposes, such as part of a golf course. The design of a pond determines how productive it will be for wildlife.  In general, gently sloping shorelines with broad expanses of wetland plants not only provide the best conditions for wildlife, but they help protect water quality from sources in the surrounding landscapes. It is also beneficial to allow water levels to fall each year during drier periods. Roads and houses should be kept as far away as possible.<ref>{{cite book |author=Canadian Wildlife Service |title=How Much Habitat is Enough?

In earlier times, ponds were artificial and utilitarian; as [[stew pond]]s, [[mill pond]]s and so on. The significance of this feature seems, in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants. In the United States, natural pools are often called ponds.  Ponds for a specific purpose keep the adjective, such as \"stock pond\", used for watering livestock.\n\n''Pond'' usually implies a quite small body of water, generally smaller than one would require a boat to cross. Another definition is that a pond is a body of water where even its deepest areas are reached by sunlight or where a human can walk across the entire body of water without being submerged. In some dialects of English, pond normally refers to small artificially created bodies of water.\n\nSome regions of the United States define a pond as a body of water with a surface area of less than {{convert|10|acre|ha}}.  [[Minnesota]], known as the 'land of 10,000 lakes' is commonly said to distinguish lakes from ponds, bogs and other water features by this definition,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/faq/mnfacts/water.html |title=Lakes, rivers, and wetlands facts |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref> but also says that a lake is distinguished primarily by wave action reaching the shore.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakes/faqs.html#lake_definition |title=Frequently asked questions about lakes |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Winter December 2007 with Pond.jpg|thumb|Pond in winter]]\n\nThe term is also used for temporary accumulation of water from [[surface runoff]] (''ponded'' water).\n\nThere are various regional names for naturally occurring ponds. In Scotland, one of the terms is [[loch]]an, which may also apply to a large body of water such as a lake. In North American prairies, they may be termed [[Dry lake|playas]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Loren M. Smith |title=Playas of the Great Plains |year=2003 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0292743687 }}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nPonds are used for the provision of fish and other wildlife including [[waterfowl]], which is a source of food for humans.  [[Pollution|Pollutants]] entering ponds are often substantially mitigated by the natural [[sedimentation]] and biological activities within the water body. Ponds are also a major contributor to local [[ecosystem]] richness and diversity for both plants and animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/infd-8agmdg|title=Freshwater ecosystems:publisher=Forest Research|access-date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Hindu]] temples usually have a pond nearby so that pilgrims can take [[Bathing#Purpose|baths]]. These ponds are considered sacred.\n\nIn [[medieval]] times in [[Europe]], it was typical for many [[monastery]] and [[castle]]s (small, partly self-sufficient communities) to have [[fish pond]]s.

Storytelling was used to explain natural phenomena, bards told stories of creation and developed a pantheon of gods and myths. Oral stories passed from one generation to the next and storytellers were regarded as healers, leaders, spiritual guides, teachers, cultural secrets keepers and entertainers. Oral storytelling came in various forms including songs, poetry, chants and dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/oral-tradition-of-storytelling-definition-history-examples.html|title=Oral Tradition of Storytelling: Definition, History & Examples \u2013 Video & Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629085149/http://study.com/academy/lesson/oral-tradition-of-storytelling-definition-history-examples.html|archivedate=2017-06-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Albert Lord|Albert Bates Lord]] examined oral narratives from field transcripts of Yugoslav oral bards collected by [[Milman Parry]] in the 1930s, and the texts of epics such as the [[Odyssey]].<ref>Lord, Albert Bates (2000). The singer of tales, Cambridge: Harvard University Press.</ref> Lord found that a large part of the stories consisted of text which was improvised during the telling process.\n\nLord identified two types of ''story vocabulary.'' The first he called \"formulas\": \"[[Rosy-fingered Dawn|rosy-fingered dawn]]\", \"[[Wine-Dark Sea|the wine-dark sea]]\" and other specific [[set phrase]]s had long been known of in [[Homer]] and other oral epics. Lord, however, discovered that across many story traditions, fully 90% of an oral epic is assembled from lines which are repeated verbatim or which use one-for-one word substitutions. In other words, oral stories are built out of set phrases which have been stockpiled from a lifetime of hearing and telling stories.\n\nThe other type of story vocabulary is theme, a set sequence of story actions that structure a tale. Just as the teller of tales proceeds line-by-line using formulas, so he proceeds from event-to-event using themes. One near-universal theme is repetition, as evidenced in Western [[folklore]] with the \"[[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]]\": Three brothers set out, three attempts are made, three riddles are asked. A theme can be as simple as a specific set sequence describing the arming of a [[hero]], starting with shirt and trousers and ending with headdress and weapons. A theme can be large enough to be a plot component. For example: a hero proposes a journey to a dangerous place / he disguises himself / his disguise fools everybody / except for a common person of little account (a [[crone]], a tavern maid or a woodcutter) / who immediately recognizes him / the commoner becomes the hero's ally, showing unexpected resources of skill or initiative. A theme does not belong to a specific story, but may be found with minor variation in many different stories.\n\nThe story was described by [[Reynolds Price]], when he wrote: <blockquote>\nA need to tell and hear stories is essential to the species Homo sapiens&nbsp;\u2013 second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter. Millions survive without love or home, almost none in silence; the opposite of silence leads quickly to narrative, and the sound of story is the dominant sound of our lives, from the small accounts of our day's events to the vast incommunicable constructs of psychopaths.<ref>Price, Reynolds (1978).

They are clearly not intended to be understood as true. The stories are full of clearly defined incidents, and peopled by rather flat characters with little or no interior life. When the supernatural occurs, it is presented matter-of-factly, without surprise. Indeed, there is very little effect, generally; bloodcurdling events may take place, but with little call for emotional response from the listener.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n''Sagen'', best translated as \"[[legend]]s\", are supposed to have actually happened, very often at a particular time and place, and they draw much of their power from this fact. When the supernatural intrudes (as it often does), it does so in an emotionally fraught manner. Ghost and [[Lovers' Leap|lovers' leap]] stories belong in this category, as do many UFO stories and stories of supernatural beings and events.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nAnother important examination of orality in human life is [[Walter J. Ong]]'s ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word'' (1982). Ong studies the distinguishing characteristics of oral traditions, how oral and written cultures interact and condition one another, and how they ultimately influence human epistemology.\n\n==Storytelling and learning==\n[[File:Orunamamu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orunamamu]] storyteller, griot with cane]]Storytelling is a means for sharing and interpreting experiences.

Facts can be understood as smaller versions of a larger story, thus storytelling can supplement analytical thinking.

Often a person needs to attempt to tell the story of that experience before realizing its value. In this case, it is not only the listener who learns, but the teller who also becomes aware of his or her own unique experiences and background.<ref>{{cite web|last=Doty|first=Elizabeth|title=Transforming Capabilities: Using Story for Knowledge Discovery & Community Development|url=http://www.worklore.com/WorkLore_TransformingCapabilities_EDoty.pdf|publisher=Storytelling In Organizations|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813195910/http://www.worklore.com/WorkLore_TransformingCapabilities_EDoty.pdf|archivedate=2013-08-13}}</ref> This process of storytelling is empowering as the teller effectively conveys ideas and, with practice, is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment. Storytelling taps into existing knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution.\n\nStories are effective educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember.

Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of listening.<ref>Archibald, Jo-Ann. (2008).

To teach this a [[Kinesthetic learning]]style would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.<ref>Fisher-Yoshida, Beth, Kathy Dee. Geller and Steven A. Schapiro.

This is because everyone in the community can add their own touch and perspective to the narrative collaboratively \u2013 both individual and culturally shared perspectives have a place in the co-creation of the story. [[Oral storytelling]] in indigenous communities differs from other forms of stories because they are told not only for entertainment, but for teaching values.<ref name=\"Archibald 2008\">Archibald, Jo-Ann, (2008). Indigenous Storywork: Educating The Heart, Mind, Body and Spirit. Vancouver, British Columbia: The University of British Columbia Press.</ref> For example, the [[Sto:lo]] community in Canada focuses on reinforcing children's identity by telling stories about the land to explain their roles.<ref name=\"Archibald 2008\"/>\n\nFurthermore, Storytelling is a way to teach younger members of indigenous communities about their culture and their identities. In Donna Eder's study, [[Navajos]] were interviewed about storytelling practices that they have had in the past and what changes they want to see in the future. They notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the Navajos. According to some of the Navajos that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life.<ref name=\":0\" /> In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.\n\nFor some indigenous people, experience has no separation between the physical world and the spiritual world. Thus, some indigenous people communicate to their children through ritual, storytelling, or dialogue. Community values, learned through storytelling, help to guide future generations and aid in identity formation.<ref>Vannini, Phillip, and J. Patrick Williams. Authenticity in Culture, Self and Society. Farnham, England: Ashgate Pub., 2009.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Quechua people|Quechua community]] of Highland Peru, there is no separation between adults and children. This allows for children to learn storytelling through their own interpretations of the given story. Therefore, children in the [[Quechua people|Quechua community]] are encouraged to listen to the story that is being told in order to learn about their identity and culture. Sometimes, children are expected to sit quietly and listen actively. This enables them to engage in activities as independent learners.<ref>Bolin, Inge. (2006). Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru. Austin, Texas: The University of Texas Press.</ref>\n\nThis teaching practice of storytelling allowed children to formulate ideas based on their own experiences and perspectives. In [[Navajo]] communities, for children and adults, storytelling is one of the many effective ways to educate both the young and old about their cultures, identities and history. Storytelling help the Navajos know who they are, where they come from and where they belong.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|jstor = 25166626|title = Bringing Navajos Storytelling Practices into Schools.

Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities.</ref> During the telling of the story, [[Child Integration|children]] may act as participants by asking questions, acting out the story, or telling smaller parts of the story.<ref>Hodge, F.S., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C.A., & Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing traditional storytelling to promote wellness in American Indian communities.</ref> Furthermore, stories are not often told in the same manner twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.<ref name=\"Silko, L. Storyteller 1981\">Silko, L. Storyteller. New York, New York: Seaver Books Pub., 1981.</ref>\n\nIndigenous cultures also use [[teasing#Teasing in Indigenous American Communities|instructional ribbing]]\u2014 a playful form of correcting children's undesirable behavior\u2014 in their stories. For example, the [[Ojibwe]] (or Chippewa) tribe uses the tale of an owl snatching away misbehaving children. The caregiver will often say, \"The owl will come and stick you in his ears if you don't stop crying!\" Thus, this form of teasing serves as a tool to correct inappropriate behavior and promote cooperation.<ref>Hilger, 1951. Chippewa Childlife and its Cultural Background.</ref>\n\n====Types of storytelling in indigenous peoples====\nThere are various types of stories among many indigenous communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve as a means to exchange information.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Learning From the Grandmothers: Incorporating Indigenous Principles Into Qualitative Research|last = Loppie|first = Charlotte|date = February 2007|journal = Qualitative Health Research|volume = 17|issue = 2|pages = 276\u201384|doi = 10.1177/1049732306297905|pmid = 17220397}}</ref> These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about [[Moral development|cultural values and lessons]].<ref name=\"Silko, L. Storyteller 1981\"/> The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the [[Lakota People|Lakota Tribe]] of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the [[White Buffalo Calf Woman]], who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the [[Odawa|Odawa Tribe]], young boys are often told the story of a young man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies.<ref>Pelletier, W. Childhood in an Indian Village. 1970.</ref>\n\nNarratives can be shared to express the values or morals among family, relatives, or people who are considered part of the close-knit community. Many stories in indigenous American communities all have a \"surface\" story, that entails knowing certain information and clues to unlocking the metaphors in the story. The underlying message of the story being told, can be understood and interpreted with clues that hint to a certain interpretation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Indigenous Storywork: Educating the Heart, Mind, and Spirit|last = Archibald|first = Jo-Ann|publisher = University of British Columbia Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9780774814010|location = Canada|pages = 76}}</ref> In order to make meaning from these stories, elders in the [[Sto:lo|Sto:Lo]] community for example, emphasize the importance in learning how to listen, since it requires the senses to bring one's heart and mind together.<ref name=\":1\" /> For instance, a way in which children learn about the metaphors significant for the society they live in, is by listening to their elders and participating in rituals where they respect one another.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru|last = Bolin|first = Inge|publisher = University of Texas Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0292712980|location = Austin|pages = 136}}</ref>\n\nSome people also make a case for different narrative forms being classified as storytelling in the contemporary world. For example, digital storytelling, online and dice-and-paper-based role-playing games. In traditional [[role-playing games]], storytelling is done by the person who controls the environment and the non playing fictional characters, and moves the story elements along for the players as they interact with the storyteller. The game is advanced by mainly verbal interactions, with dice roll determining random events in the fictional universe, where the players interact with each other and the storyteller. This type of game has many genres, such as [[sci-fi]] and fantasy, as well as alternate-reality worlds based on the current reality, but with different setting and beings such as werewolves, aliens, daemons, or hidden societies. These oral-based role-playing games were very popular in the 1990s among circles of youth in many countries before computer and console-based online MMORPG's took their place. Despite the prevalence of computer-based MMORPGs, the dice-and-paper RPG still has a dedicated following.\n\n====Passing on of Values in indigenous cultures====\nStories in indigenous cultures encompass a variety of [[Moral development|values]]. These values include an emphasis on individual responsibility, concern for the environment and communal welfare.<ref>Hodge, et al. 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities.</ref>\n\nStories are based on values passed down by older generations to shape the foundation of the community.<ref>Jeff Corntassel, Chaw-win-is, and T'lakwadzi. \"Indigenous Storytelling, Truth-telling and Community Approaches to Reconciliation.\" ESC: English Studies in Canada 35.1 (2009): 137\u201359)</ref> Storytelling is used as a bridge for knowledge and understanding allowing the values of \"self\" and \"community\" to connect and be learned as a whole. Storytelling in the [[Navajo]] community for example allows for community values to be learned at different times and places for different learners. Stories are told from the perspective of other people, animals, or the natural elements of the earth.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Life Lessons through Storytelling: Children's Exploration of Ethics|last = Eder|first = Donna|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0253222442|location = |pages = 7\u201323}}</ref> In this way, children learn to value their place in the world as a person in relation to others. Typically, stories are used as an [[informal learning]] tool in Indigenous American communities, and can act as an alternative method for reprimanding children's bad behavior. In this way, stories are non-confrontational, which allows the child to discover for themselves what they did wrong and what they can do to adjust the behavior.<ref>Battiste, Marie. Indigenous Knowledge and Pedagogy in First Nations Education: A Literature Review with Recommendations. Ottawa, Ont.: Indian and Northern Affairs, 2002.</ref>\n\nParents in the [[Arizona Tewa]] community, for example, teach morals to their children through traditional narratives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kroskrity|first=P. V.|title=Narrative reproductions: Ideologies of storytelling, authoritative words and generic regimentation in the village of Tewa.|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=2009|volume=19|pages=40\u201356|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1395.2009.01018.x}}</ref> Lessons focus on several topics including historical or \"sacred\" stories or more domestic disputes. Through storytelling, the Tewa community emphasizes the traditional wisdom of the ancestors and the importance of collective as well as individual identities. Indigenous communities teach children valuable skills and morals through the actions of good or mischievous stock characters while also allowing room for children to make meaning for themselves. By not being given every element of the story, children rely on their own experiences and not formal teaching from adults to fill in the gaps.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pelletier|first=Wilfred|title=Childhood in an Indian Village|journal=Two Articles|date=1969}}</ref>\n\nWhen children listen to stories, they periodically vocalize their ongoing [[attention]] and accept the extended turn of the storyteller. The emphasis on attentiveness to surrounding events and the importance of oral tradition in indigenous communities teaches children the skill of keen attention. For example, Children of the [[Tohono O'odham]] American Indian community who engaged in more cultural practices were able to recall the events in a verbally presented story better than those who did not engage in cultural practices.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tsethlikai|first=M.|author2=Rogoff |title=Involvement in traditional cultural practices and American Indian children's incidental recall of a folktale.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|issue=3|pages=568\u2013578|doi=10.1037/a0031308|pmid=23316771}}</ref> Body movements and gestures help to communicate values and keep stories alive for future generations.<ref>Fisher, Mary Pat.

Indigenous Literacies in the Americas: Language Planning from the Bottom up. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 1997</ref>\n\nChildren in indigenous communities can also learn from the underlying message of a story. For example, in a [[Nahua peoples|nahuatl]] community near [[Mexico City]], stories about ahuaques or hostile water dwelling spirits that guard over the bodies of water, contain morals about respecting the environment. If the protagonist of a story, who has accidentally broken something that belongs to the ahuaque, does not replace it or give back in some way to the ahuaque, the [[protagonist]] dies.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=55703708|title = Infancia nahua y transmisi\u00f3n de la cosmovisi\u00f3n: los ahuaques o esp\u00edritus pluviales en la Sierra de Texcoco (M\u00e9xico)|last = Lorente Fern\u00e1ndez|first = David|date = 2006|journal = Bolet\u00edn de Antropolog\u00eda Universidad de Antioquia|volume = {{articulo.volRevNum}}|issue = {{articulo.numRevNum}}|pages = &#123;&#123;paginasArticulo&#91;0&#93;&#125;&#125;\u2013&#123;&#123;paginasArticulo&#91;1&#93;&#125;&#125;|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208163320/http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=55703708|archivedate = 2015-12-08}}</ref> In this way, storytelling serves as a way to teach what the community values, such as valuing the environment.\n\nStorytelling also serves to deliver a particular message during spiritual and ceremonial functions. In the ceremonial use of storytelling, the unity building theme of the message becomes more important than the time, place and characters of the message. Once the message is delivered, the story is finished. As cycles of the tale are told and retold, story units can recombine, showing various outcomes for a person's actions.<ref>VanDeusen, Kira.

Iseke focused on the idea of witnessing a storyteller as a vital way to share and partake in the Metis community, as members of the community would stop everything else they were doing in order to listen or \"witness\" the storyteller and allow the story to become a \"ceremonial landscape,\" or shared reference, for everyone present.  This was a powerful tool for the community to engage and teach new learner shared references for the values and ideologies of the Metis.  Through storytelling, the Metis cemented the shared reference of personal or popular stories and [[folklore]], which members of the community can use to share ideologies.  In the future, Iseke noted that Metis elders wished for the stories being told to be used for further research into their culture, as stories were a traditional way to pass down vital knowledge to younger generations.\n\nFor the stories we read, the \"neuro-semantic encoding of narratives happens at levels higher than individual semantic units and that this encoding is systematic across both individuals and languages.\" This encoding seems to appear most prominently in the default mode network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dehghani|first=Morteza|last2=Boghrati|first2=Reihane|last3=Man|first3=Kingson|last4=Hoover|first4=Joe|last5=Gimbel|first5=Sarah I.|last6=Vaswani|first6=Ashish|last7=Zevin|first7=Jason D.|last8=Immordino-Yang|first8=Mary Helen|last9=Gordon|first9=Andrew S.|date=2017-12-01|title=Decoding the neural representation of story meanings across languages|journal=Human Brain Mapping|language=en|volume=38|issue=12|pages=6096\u20136106|doi=10.1002/hbm.23814|pmid=28940969|issn=1097-0193|url=http://psyarxiv.com/qrpp3/}}</ref>\n\n==Serious Storytelling==\nStorytelling in serious application contexts, as e.g. therapeutics, business, serious games, medicine, education, or faith can be referred to as serious storytelling.

Regardless, these silences are not as empty as they appear, and it is only this act of storytelling that can enable the teller to fill them back in.\n\nPsychodrama uses re-enactment of a personal, traumatic event in the life of a psychodrama group participant as a therapeutic methodology, first developed by psychiatrist, [[J.L. Moreno]], M.D.  This therapeutic use of storytelling was incorporated into [[Drama Therapy]], known in the field as \"Self Revalatory Theater.\" in 1975] Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas developed a therapeutic, improvisational storytelling form they called [[Playback Theatre]].

Such elements include the essential idea of narrative structure with identifiable beginnings, middles, and endings, or exposition-development-climax-resolution-denouement, normally constructed into coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality, which includes retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on characters and characterization which is \"arguably the most important single component of the novel\";<ref>[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''[[The Art of Fiction (book)|The Art of Fiction]]'' 67</ref> a given [[Isogloss|heterogloss]] of different voices dialogically at play&nbsp;\u2013 \"the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers\";<ref>Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97</ref> possesses a narrator or narrator-like voice, which by definition \"addresses\" and \"interacts with\" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, conditioning a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, \"arguing\" for and against various positions; relies substantially on now-standard aesthetic figuration, particularly including the use of [[metaphor]], metonymy, [[synecdoche]] and [[irony]] (see [[Hayden White]], ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-century Europe|Metahistory]]'' for expansion of this idea); is often enmeshed in intertextuality, with copious connections, references, allusions, similarities, parallels, etc. to other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community.\n\nFestivals\n[[Storytelling festival]]s typically feature the work of several storytellers and may include workshops for tellers and others who are interested in the art form or other targeted applications of storytelling. Elements of the [[oral storytelling]] art form often include the tellers encouragement to have participants co-create an experience by connecting to relatable elements of the story and using techniques of  [[Mental image|visualization]] (the seeing of images in the mind's eye), and use vocal and bodily [[gestures]] to support understanding. In many ways, the art of storytelling draws upon other art forms such as [[acting]], [[oral interpretation]] and [[Performance Studies|performance studies]].\n\nIn 1903, Richard Wyche, a professor of literature at the University of Tennessee created the first organized storytellers league of its kind.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}  It was called The National Story League. Wyche served as its president for 16 years, facilitated storytelling classes, and spurred an interest in the art.\n\nSeveral other storytelling organizations started in the U.S. during the 1970s. One such organization was the National Association for the Perpetuation and Preservation of Storytelling (NAPPS), now the National Storytelling Network (NSN) and the International Storytelling Center (ISC). NSN is a professional organization that helps to organize resources for tellers and festival planners. The ISC runs the [[National Storytelling Festival]] in [[Jonesborough, TN]].<ref>Wolf, Eric James.

The material of any given story naturally undergoes several changes and [[wikt:adjustment|adaptation]]s during this process. When and where [[oral tradition]] was pushed back in favor of [[print media]], the [[literature|literary]] [[idea]] of the [[author]] as originator of a story's [[authority|authoritative]] version changed people's [[perception]] of stories themselves. In centuries following, stories tended to be seen as the work of individuals rather than a collective effort. Only recently when a significant number of influential authors began questioning their own roles, the value of stories as such&nbsp;\u2013 independent of authorship&nbsp;\u2013 was again recognized. Literary critics such as [[Roland Barthes]] even proclaimed the [[Death of the Author]].\n\n==In business==\nPeople have been telling stories at work since ancient times, when stories might inspire \u201ccourage and empowerment during the hunt for a potentially dangerous animal,\u201d or simply instill the value of listening.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Randee Lipson|last2=Paige|first2=Dennis Swiftdeer|date=March 2016|title=What Our Ancestors Knew: Teaching and Learning Through Storytelling|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|volume=2016|issue=149|pages=63\u201372|doi=10.1002/ace.20177|issn=1052-2891}}</ref> Storytelling in business has become a field in its own right as industries have grown, as storytelling becomes a more popular art form in general through live storytelling events like [[The Moth]].\n\n====== Recruiting ======\nStorytelling has come to have a prominent role in recruiting.

Storytelling was used to explain natural phenomena, bards told stories of creation and developed a pantheon of gods and myths. Oral stories passed from one generation to the next and storytellers were regarded as healers, leaders, spiritual guides, teachers, cultural secrets keepers and entertainers. Oral storytelling came in various forms including songs, poetry, chants and dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/oral-tradition-of-storytelling-definition-history-examples.html|title=Oral Tradition of Storytelling: Definition, History & Examples \u2013 Video & Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629085149/http://study.com/academy/lesson/oral-tradition-of-storytelling-definition-history-examples.html|archivedate=2017-06-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Albert Lord|Albert Bates Lord]] examined oral narratives from field transcripts of Yugoslav oral bards collected by [[Milman Parry]] in the 1930s, and the texts of epics such as the [[Odyssey]].<ref>Lord, Albert Bates (2000). The singer of tales, Cambridge: Harvard University Press.</ref> Lord found that a large part of the stories consisted of text which was improvised during the telling process.\n\nLord identified two types of ''story vocabulary.'' The first he called \"formulas\": \"[[Rosy-fingered Dawn|rosy-fingered dawn]]\", \"[[Wine-Dark Sea|the wine-dark sea]]\" and other specific [[set phrase]]s had long been known of in [[Homer]] and other oral epics. Lord, however, discovered that across many story traditions, fully 90% of an oral epic is assembled from lines which are repeated verbatim or which use one-for-one word substitutions. In other words, oral stories are built out of set phrases which have been stockpiled from a lifetime of hearing and telling stories.\n\nThe other type of story vocabulary is theme, a set sequence of story actions that structure a tale. Just as the teller of tales proceeds line-by-line using formulas, so he proceeds from event-to-event using themes. One near-universal theme is repetition, as evidenced in Western [[folklore]] with the \"[[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]]\": Three brothers set out, three attempts are made, three riddles are asked. A theme can be as simple as a specific set sequence describing the arming of a [[hero]], starting with shirt and trousers and ending with headdress and weapons. A theme can be large enough to be a plot component. For example: a hero proposes a journey to a dangerous place / he disguises himself / his disguise fools everybody / except for a common person of little account (a [[crone]], a tavern maid or a woodcutter) / who immediately recognizes him / the commoner becomes the hero's ally, showing unexpected resources of skill or initiative. A theme does not belong to a specific story, but may be found with minor variation in many different stories.\n\nThe story was described by [[Reynolds Price]], when he wrote: <blockquote>\nA need to tell and hear stories is essential to the species Homo sapiens&nbsp;\u2013 second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter. Millions survive without love or home, almost none in silence; the opposite of silence leads quickly to narrative, and the sound of story is the dominant sound of our lives, from the small accounts of our day's events to the vast incommunicable constructs of psychopaths.<ref>Price, Reynolds (1978).

They are clearly not intended to be understood as true. The stories are full of clearly defined incidents, and peopled by rather flat characters with little or no interior life. When the supernatural occurs, it is presented matter-of-factly, without surprise. Indeed, there is very little effect, generally; bloodcurdling events may take place, but with little call for emotional response from the listener.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n''Sagen'', best translated as \"[[legend]]s\", are supposed to have actually happened, very often at a particular time and place, and they draw much of their power from this fact. When the supernatural intrudes (as it often does), it does so in an emotionally fraught manner. Ghost and [[Lovers' Leap|lovers' leap]] stories belong in this category, as do many UFO stories and stories of supernatural beings and events.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nAnother important examination of orality in human life is [[Walter J.

This is because everyone in the community can add their own touch and perspective to the narrative collaboratively \u2013 both individual and culturally shared perspectives have a place in the co-creation of the story. [[Oral storytelling]] in indigenous communities differs from other forms of stories because they are told not only for entertainment, but for teaching values.<ref name=\"Archibald 2008\">Archibald, Jo-Ann, (2008). Indigenous Storywork: Educating The Heart, Mind, Body and Spirit. Vancouver, British Columbia: The University of British Columbia Press.</ref> For example, the [[Sto:lo]] community in Canada focuses on reinforcing children's identity by telling stories about the land to explain their roles.<ref name=\"Archibald 2008\"/>\n\nFurthermore, Storytelling is a way to teach younger members of indigenous communities about their culture and their identities. In Donna Eder's study, [[Navajos]] were interviewed about storytelling practices that they have had in the past and what changes they want to see in the future. They notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the Navajos. According to some of the Navajos that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life.<ref name=\":0\" /> In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.\n\nFor some indigenous people, experience has no separation between the physical world and the spiritual world. Thus, some indigenous people communicate to their children through ritual, storytelling, or dialogue. Community values, learned through storytelling, help to guide future generations and aid in identity formation.<ref>Vannini, Phillip, and J. Patrick Williams. Authenticity in Culture, Self and Society. Farnham, England: Ashgate Pub., 2009.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Quechua people|Quechua community]] of Highland Peru, there is no separation between adults and children. This allows for children to learn storytelling through their own interpretations of the given story. Therefore, children in the [[Quechua people|Quechua community]] are encouraged to listen to the story that is being told in order to learn about their identity and culture. Sometimes, children are expected to sit quietly and listen actively. This enables them to engage in activities as independent learners.<ref>Bolin, Inge. (2006). Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru. Austin, Texas: The University of Texas Press.</ref>\n\nThis teaching practice of storytelling allowed children to formulate ideas based on their own experiences and perspectives. In [[Navajo]] communities, for children and adults, storytelling is one of the many effective ways to educate both the young and old about their cultures, identities and history. Storytelling help the Navajos know who they are, where they come from and where they belong.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|jstor = 25166626|title = Bringing Navajos Storytelling Practices into Schools.

Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities.</ref> During the telling of the story, [[Child Integration|children]] may act as participants by asking questions, acting out the story, or telling smaller parts of the story.<ref>Hodge, F.S., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C.A., & Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing traditional storytelling to promote wellness in American Indian communities.</ref> Furthermore, stories are not often told in the same manner twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.<ref name=\"Silko, L. Storyteller 1981\">Silko, L. Storyteller. New York, New York: Seaver Books Pub., 1981.</ref>\n\nIndigenous cultures also use [[teasing#Teasing in Indigenous American Communities|instructional ribbing]]\u2014 a playful form of correcting children's undesirable behavior\u2014 in their stories. For example, the [[Ojibwe]] (or Chippewa) tribe uses the tale of an owl snatching away misbehaving children. The caregiver will often say, \"The owl will come and stick you in his ears if you don't stop crying!\" Thus, this form of teasing serves as a tool to correct inappropriate behavior and promote cooperation.<ref>Hilger, 1951. Chippewa Childlife and its Cultural Background.</ref>\n\n====Types of storytelling in indigenous peoples====\nThere are various types of stories among many indigenous communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve as a means to exchange information.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Learning From the Grandmothers: Incorporating Indigenous Principles Into Qualitative Research|last = Loppie|first = Charlotte|date = February 2007|journal = Qualitative Health Research|volume = 17|issue = 2|pages = 276\u201384|doi = 10.1177/1049732306297905|pmid = 17220397}}</ref> These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about [[Moral development|cultural values and lessons]].<ref name=\"Silko, L. Storyteller 1981\"/> The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the [[Lakota People|Lakota Tribe]] of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the [[White Buffalo Calf Woman]], who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the [[Odawa|Odawa Tribe]], young boys are often told the story of a young man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies.<ref>Pelletier, W. Childhood in an Indian Village. 1970.</ref>\n\nNarratives can be shared to express the values or morals among family, relatives, or people who are considered part of the close-knit community. Many stories in indigenous American communities all have a \"surface\" story, that entails knowing certain information and clues to unlocking the metaphors in the story. The underlying message of the story being told, can be understood and interpreted with clues that hint to a certain interpretation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Indigenous Storywork: Educating the Heart, Mind, and Spirit|last = Archibald|first = Jo-Ann|publisher = University of British Columbia Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9780774814010|location = Canada|pages = 76}}</ref> In order to make meaning from these stories, elders in the [[Sto:lo|Sto:Lo]] community for example, emphasize the importance in learning how to listen, since it requires the senses to bring one's heart and mind together.<ref name=\":1\" /> For instance, a way in which children learn about the metaphors significant for the society they live in, is by listening to their elders and participating in rituals where they respect one another.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru|last = Bolin|first = Inge|publisher = University of Texas Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0292712980|location = Austin|pages = 136}}</ref>\n\nSome people also make a case for different narrative forms being classified as storytelling in the contemporary world. For example, digital storytelling, online and dice-and-paper-based role-playing games. In traditional [[role-playing games]], storytelling is done by the person who controls the environment and the non playing fictional characters, and moves the story elements along for the players as they interact with the storyteller. The game is advanced by mainly verbal interactions, with dice roll determining random events in the fictional universe, where the players interact with each other and the storyteller. This type of game has many genres, such as [[sci-fi]] and fantasy, as well as alternate-reality worlds based on the current reality, but with different setting and beings such as werewolves, aliens, daemons, or hidden societies. These oral-based role-playing games were very popular in the 1990s among circles of youth in many countries before computer and console-based online MMORPG's took their place. Despite the prevalence of computer-based MMORPGs, the dice-and-paper RPG still has a dedicated following.\n\n====Passing on of Values in indigenous cultures====\nStories in indigenous cultures encompass a variety of [[Moral development|values]]. These values include an emphasis on individual responsibility, concern for the environment and communal welfare.<ref>Hodge, et al. 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities.</ref>\n\nStories are based on values passed down by older generations to shape the foundation of the community.<ref>Jeff Corntassel, Chaw-win-is, and T'lakwadzi. \"Indigenous Storytelling, Truth-telling and Community Approaches to Reconciliation.\" ESC: English Studies in Canada 35.1 (2009): 137\u201359)</ref> Storytelling is used as a bridge for knowledge and understanding allowing the values of \"self\" and \"community\" to connect and be learned as a whole. Storytelling in the [[Navajo]] community for example allows for community values to be learned at different times and places for different learners. Stories are told from the perspective of other people, animals, or the natural elements of the earth.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Life Lessons through Storytelling: Children's Exploration of Ethics|last = Eder|first = Donna|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0253222442|location = |pages = 7\u201323}}</ref> In this way, children learn to value their place in the world as a person in relation to others. Typically, stories are used as an [[informal learning]] tool in Indigenous American communities, and can act as an alternative method for reprimanding children's bad behavior. In this way, stories are non-confrontational, which allows the child to discover for themselves what they did wrong and what they can do to adjust the behavior.<ref>Battiste, Marie. Indigenous Knowledge and Pedagogy in First Nations Education: A Literature Review with Recommendations. Ottawa, Ont.: Indian and Northern Affairs, 2002.</ref>\n\nParents in the [[Arizona Tewa]] community, for example, teach morals to their children through traditional narratives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kroskrity|first=P. V.|title=Narrative reproductions: Ideologies of storytelling, authoritative words and generic regimentation in the village of Tewa.|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=2009|volume=19|pages=40\u201356|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1395.2009.01018.x}}</ref> Lessons focus on several topics including historical or \"sacred\" stories or more domestic disputes. Through storytelling, the Tewa community emphasizes the traditional wisdom of the ancestors and the importance of collective as well as individual identities. Indigenous communities teach children valuable skills and morals through the actions of good or mischievous stock characters while also allowing room for children to make meaning for themselves. By not being given every element of the story, children rely on their own experiences and not formal teaching from adults to fill in the gaps.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pelletier|first=Wilfred|title=Childhood in an Indian Village|journal=Two Articles|date=1969}}</ref>\n\nWhen children listen to stories, they periodically vocalize their ongoing [[attention]] and accept the extended turn of the storyteller. The emphasis on attentiveness to surrounding events and the importance of oral tradition in indigenous communities teaches children the skill of keen attention. For example, Children of the [[Tohono O'odham]] American Indian community who engaged in more cultural practices were able to recall the events in a verbally presented story better than those who did not engage in cultural practices.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tsethlikai|first=M.|author2=Rogoff |title=Involvement in traditional cultural practices and American Indian children's incidental recall of a folktale.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|issue=3|pages=568\u2013578|doi=10.1037/a0031308|pmid=23316771}}</ref> Body movements and gestures help to communicate values and keep stories alive for future generations.<ref>Fisher, Mary Pat.

Indigenous Literacies in the Americas: Language Planning from the Bottom up. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 1997</ref>\n\nChildren in indigenous communities can also learn from the underlying message of a story. For example, in a [[Nahua peoples|nahuatl]] community near [[Mexico City]], stories about ahuaques or hostile water dwelling spirits that guard over the bodies of water, contain morals about respecting the environment. If the protagonist of a story, who has accidentally broken something that belongs to the ahuaque, does not replace it or give back in some way to the ahuaque, the [[protagonist]] dies.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=55703708|title = Infancia nahua y transmisi\u00f3n de la cosmovisi\u00f3n: los ahuaques o esp\u00edritus pluviales en la Sierra de Texcoco (M\u00e9xico)|last = Lorente Fern\u00e1ndez|first = David|date = 2006|journal = Bolet\u00edn de Antropolog\u00eda Universidad de Antioquia|volume = {{articulo.volRevNum}}|issue = {{articulo.numRevNum}}|pages = &#123;&#123;paginasArticulo&#91;0&#93;&#125;&#125;\u2013&#123;&#123;paginasArticulo&#91;1&#93;&#125;&#125;|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208163320/http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=55703708|archivedate = 2015-12-08}}</ref> In this way, storytelling serves as a way to teach what the community values, such as valuing the environment.\n\nStorytelling also serves to deliver a particular message during spiritual and ceremonial functions. In the ceremonial use of storytelling, the unity building theme of the message becomes more important than the time, place and characters of the message. Once the message is delivered, the story is finished. As cycles of the tale are told and retold, story units can recombine, showing various outcomes for a person's actions.<ref>VanDeusen, Kira.

Iseke focused on the idea of witnessing a storyteller as a vital way to share and partake in the Metis community, as members of the community would stop everything else they were doing in order to listen or \"witness\" the storyteller and allow the story to become a \"ceremonial landscape,\" or shared reference, for everyone present.  This was a powerful tool for the community to engage and teach new learner shared references for the values and ideologies of the Metis.  Through storytelling, the Metis cemented the shared reference of personal or popular stories and [[folklore]], which members of the community can use to share ideologies.

Regardless, these silences are not as empty as they appear, and it is only this act of storytelling that can enable the teller to fill them back in.\n\nPsychodrama uses re-enactment of a personal, traumatic event in the life of a psychodrama group participant as a therapeutic methodology, first developed by psychiatrist, [[J.L. Moreno]], M.D.  This therapeutic use of storytelling was incorporated into [[Drama Therapy]], known in the field as \"Self Revalatory Theater.\" in 1975] Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas developed a therapeutic, improvisational storytelling form they called [[Playback Theatre]]. Therapeutic storytelling is also used to promote healing through [[transformative arts]], where a facilitator helps a participant write and often present their personal story to an audience.<ref>Harter, L.M. and Bochner, A.P., 2009.

Such elements include the essential idea of narrative structure with identifiable beginnings, middles, and endings, or exposition-development-climax-resolution-denouement, normally constructed into coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality, which includes retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on characters and characterization which is \"arguably the most important single component of the novel\";<ref>[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''[[The Art of Fiction (book)|The Art of Fiction]]'' 67</ref> a given [[Isogloss|heterogloss]] of different voices dialogically at play&nbsp;\u2013 \"the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers\";<ref>Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97</ref> possesses a narrator or narrator-like voice, which by definition \"addresses\" and \"interacts with\" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, conditioning a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, \"arguing\" for and against various positions; relies substantially on now-standard aesthetic figuration, particularly including the use of [[metaphor]], metonymy, [[synecdoche]] and [[irony]] (see [[Hayden White]], ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-century Europe|Metahistory]]'' for expansion of this idea); is often enmeshed in intertextuality, with copious connections, references, allusions, similarities, parallels, etc. to other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community.\n\nFestivals\n[[Storytelling festival]]s typically feature the work of several storytellers and may include workshops for tellers and others who are interested in the art form or other targeted applications of storytelling. Elements of the [[oral storytelling]] art form often include the tellers encouragement to have participants co-create an experience by connecting to relatable elements of the story and using techniques of  [[Mental image|visualization]] (the seeing of images in the mind's eye), and use vocal and bodily [[gestures]] to support understanding. In many ways, the art of storytelling draws upon other art forms such as [[acting]], [[oral interpretation]] and [[Performance Studies|performance studies]].\n\nIn 1903, Richard Wyche, a professor of literature at the University of Tennessee created the first organized storytellers league of its kind.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}  It was called The National Story League. Wyche served as its president for 16 years, facilitated storytelling classes, and spurred an interest in the art.\n\nSeveral other storytelling organizations started in the U.S. during the 1970s. One such organization was the National Association for the Perpetuation and Preservation of Storytelling (NAPPS), now the National Storytelling Network (NSN) and the International Storytelling Center (ISC). NSN is a professional organization that helps to organize resources for tellers and festival planners. The ISC runs the [[National Storytelling Festival]] in [[Jonesborough, TN]].<ref>Wolf, Eric James.

The material of any given story naturally undergoes several changes and [[wikt:adjustment|adaptation]]s during this process. When and where [[oral tradition]] was pushed back in favor of [[print media]], the [[literature|literary]] [[idea]] of the [[author]] as originator of a story's [[authority|authoritative]] version changed people's [[perception]] of stories themselves. In centuries following, stories tended to be seen as the work of individuals rather than a collective effort. Only recently when a significant number of influential authors began questioning their own roles, the value of stories as such&nbsp;\u2013 independent of authorship&nbsp;\u2013 was again recognized. Literary critics such as [[Roland Barthes]] even proclaimed the [[Death of the Author]].\n\n==In business==\nPeople have been telling stories at work since ancient times, when stories might inspire \u201ccourage and empowerment during the hunt for a potentially dangerous animal,\u201d or simply instill the value of listening.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Randee Lipson|last2=Paige|first2=Dennis Swiftdeer|date=March 2016|title=What Our Ancestors Knew: Teaching and Learning Through Storytelling|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|volume=2016|issue=149|pages=63\u201372|doi=10.1002/ace.20177|issn=1052-2891}}</ref> Storytelling in business has become a field in its own right as industries have grown, as storytelling becomes a more popular art form in general through live storytelling events like [[The Moth]].\n\n====== Recruiting ======\nStorytelling has come to have a prominent role in recruiting.

By the end of the 19th century, it had expanded to [[Central America|Central]] and South America, the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[West Indies]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[North Africa]] and other international markets. During the next five decades, the company grew and prospered, surviving the difficulties of [[World War I]] and the large drain on its finances through policy claims arising from the large number of deaths caused by the [[Great Flu Epidemic]] of 1918.\n\nThe company's original [[Dominion Square]] building in Montreal was built in 1918. Capping a Montreal construction boom that began in the 1920s, the company completed construction of the expansion of its headquarters with its new 26-storey headquarters north tower in 1933. Although the [[Tour de la Banque Royale|head office of the Royal Bank of Canada on St. James Street]] was taller by several floors, the [[Sun Life Building]] was at the time the largest building in terms of square footage anywhere in the [[British Empire]].\n\nChartered in 1865, its traditional base business worldwide remains life insurance. However, it now also has significant asset management operations. In 1919, it was the first Canadian company to offer group life insurance. Having begun its first US operations in 1895, the company sold its first group life plan in the U.S. in 1924.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:One York, Toronto, South view 20170417 1.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sun Life Global Headquarters at One York Street in Toronto, Canada]]\nIn [[World War II]], the [[gold reserves]] and [[Security (finance)|securities]] of several European countries were secretly moved to the Sun Life Building for safekeeping. A persistent rumour that the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] were illegally shipped out of the United Kingdom during WWII and stored there was deliberately spread in Montreal to account for increased activity at the building.<ref name=\"Draper1979\">{{cite book|author=Alfred Draper|title=Operation Fish: The Race to Save Europe's Wealth, 1939\u20131945|url=https://archive.org/details/operationfishrac0000drap|url-access=registration|year=1979|publisher=Cassell|isbn=978-0-304-30068-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/operationfishrac0000drap/page/255 255]\u2013257}}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\nDuring the post-war period, the company's successful business strategies made it one of Montreal's largest white-collar employers, one of the top corporations in Canada, as well as a global player in the life insurance field. For the first half of the 20th century, the city of Montreal had been the economic hub of Canada, but it was losing ground to [[Toronto]]. As early as 1950, Toronto's economic activity surpassed Montreal's with regards to stock market trading and capitalization. The advent, in the 1960s, of political and [[terrorism|terrorist]] movements demanding the independence of Quebec from Canada cast a pallor of uncertainty over the business community.\n\n===1977-1980===\nIn 1977, the newly elected [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] Quebec government passed the [[Charter of the French Language]] (known as Bill 101), making the use of [[French language]] mandatory for medium- and large-scale companies when communicating with French-speaking staff. The law was received negatively by the English-speaking business community, many of whom perceived that the historical rights of the English-speaking minority should be respected. The new government also promised a referendum on Quebec sovereignty, injecting instability into the Montreal business community.<ref name=\"Guardian\">https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/06/40-year-hangover-1976-olympic-games-broke-montreal-canada</ref> On January 6, 1978, Sun Life became the first large company to leave Quebec post-election, announcing that it would move its head office to rented space in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2011/03/21/la-financiere-sun-life-veut-repartir-a-zero-avec-le-quebec |title = La Financi\u00e8re Sun Life veut repartir \u00e0 z\u00e9ro avec le Qu\u00e9bec}}</ref><ref name=\"Gazette\">{{Cite web | url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/sun-life-now-remembers-yes-we-left-quebec-in-1978 |title = Sun Life Financial now remembers: Yes, we left Quebec in 1978 &#124; Montreal Gazette|date = 2012-02-09}}</ref> Officially, Sun Life said it was motivated by the political instability and economic uncertainty of Quebec's future, but skeptics said it was the company's unwillingness to comply with the requirements of Bill 101.<ref name=\"Gazette\"/> In a reaction the next day, the province's finance minister [[Jacques Parizeau]] called Sun Life \"one of the worst exporters of Quebec capital\",<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\">{{Cite web | url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2775856?docsearchtext=sun%20life%20levesque | title=BAnQ num\u00e9rique}}</ref> and threatened to freeze some $400 million CAD in assets.<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\"/><ref name=\"Mans1978\">{{cite book|author=Rowland Mans|title=Canada's Constitutional Crisis: Separatism and Subversion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oM2IAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Institute for the Study of Conflict}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the company acquired a property at University Avenue and King Street in downtown Toronto and constructed a new office complex, the [[Sun Life Centre]], which was completed in 1984.<ref name=\"Filey1997\">{{cite book|author=Mike Filey|title=Toronto Sketches 5: The Way We Were|url=https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file|url-access=registration|date=1 October 1997|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-4597-1330-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file/page/137 137]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBill 101 required more than French communications with French-speaking staff. It made French the official language of the workplace. It also provided that present and prospective employees who could not speak English not be discriminated against because of their inability to speak English.\n[[File:Dean A Connor Headshot.jpg|alt=|thumb|Dean A. Connor, President and CEO of Sun Life, since 2011]]\nFor the largest employer of English-speaking people in Montreal, this would make things very difficult. Many, if not most, of Sun Life's Head Office employees in 1979 were not fluent in French. Sun Life was quite clear that this was the reason for its move when it made the announcement. The PQ government was quick to label Sun Life \"bad corporate citizens\" and claimed that if ''\"they had only warned us, we could have worked something out.\"''<ref name=CBC1>{{cite episode |title=CBC reports on Sun Life leaving Montreal in 1978 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/language-culture/fighting-words-bill-101/sun-life-packs-up.html |accessdate=2014-08-18 |date=January 6, 1978 |series=The World At Six |credits=Reporters: Karen Birchard, Richard Inwood |work=[[CBC Radio]]}}</ref>\n\nThe downsizing of Sun Life's Montreal office did not take place overnight. Transfers and moves occurred on a departmental basis and did not commence until several months after the announcement. By 1980, 300 head office employees were located in Toronto.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1076086/sun-life-demenagement-montreal-toronto-pq-archives |title = Il y a 40 ans : Le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement surprise de la Sun Life}}</ref>\n\nThere were several other key activities in the post-war years. This included a decision by Sun Life to leave many markets, including China and India, because of economic and political changes. In 1962, Sun Life became a mutual company and repurchased its shares for $65 million in total. In 1973, Sun Life opened its American subsidiary's new headquarters in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, located outside [[Boston]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===1980s \u2013 1990s===\nSun Life continued to expand its wealth management business with the 1982 acquisition of [[MFS Investment Management|Massachusetts Financial Services]] (MFS), the Boston-based investment management and mutual fund company. It entered the mutual fund business in Canada by forming Spectrum Mutual Fund Services in 1987 (subsequently sold to CI Financial) and a decade later, acquired McLean Budden, a Canadian investment management firm (subsequently folded into MFS).\nInternational expansion continued in the 1990s. In 1995, Sun Life entered the Indonesia market through local company PT Asuransi Modern Sun Life, now called PT Sun Life Financial Indonesia and opened a Representative Office in Beijing in preparation to enter China. A year later, Sun Life opened a services centre in Waterford, Ireland, to provide technology and business processing support for Sun Life business units.\n\nIn 1999, Sun Life officially returned to [[India]] and [[China]] when it established two joint ventures \u2013 Birla Sun Life in India with local partner [[Aditya Birla Group]], and Sun Life Everbright in China with partner [[China Everbright Group]]. Over the next decade, both operations grew rapidly \u2013 by September 2008, there were 132,460 Birla Sun Life advisors working in 600 branches across India while Sun Life Everbright opened its sixth branch in Guangzhou, bringing its presence to 18 cities in [[China]].\n\n[[Image:Sun-Life-Building-June-2007.jpg|thumb|right|The Sun Life building in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]]]\n\n=== 2000's ===\nIn early 1998, Sun Life announced its intention to [[demutualize]]. In March 2000, its Initial Public Offering (IPO) started the trading of Sun Life Financial Inc. shares on the Toronto (TSX), New York (NYSE) and Philippine (PSE) stock exchanges.\n\nIn 2002, Sun Life combined its operations with [[Clarica Life Insurance]] of [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. Founded in 1870 as ''Mutual Life of Canada'', Clarica was known as The Mutual Group before it went public in 1999. The former head office for Mutual Life Assurance Company at 227 King Street South in Waterloo became the home to Sun Life's Canadian operations, while a regional office and Sun Life's corporate headquarters remained in Toronto. The company also maintains regional offices in [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Edmonton]], [[Vancouver]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and [[Calgary]]. After it integrated operations, the company used the Clarica brand name for certain products and activities until 2007.\n\nIn 2005, Sun Life opened a service centre in Gurgaon, [[India]] to provide business processing and technology support for Sun Life Financial business units around the world. That same year, Sun Life purchased CMG Asia and CommServe Financial, the Hong Kong insurance and pension operations of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, tripling its customer base and adding group insurance and pensions to its business lines.\n\nIn 2007, Sun Life purchased the U.S. employee benefits business of Genworth Financial, placing itself in the top 10 in the U.S. group benefits market.\n\nIn 2008, Sun Life sold its 37% interest in CI Financial Income Fund to [[Scotiabank]]. Sun Life had originally acquired a significant [[ownership interest]] in the firm by selling its Canadian mutual fund subsidiaries to CI Financial in 2002.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2002/05/22/cifund020522.html |title= CBC News - CI Fund acquires Sun Life mutual fund business |accessdate=2008-12-28 |date=22 May 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Sun Life began an aggressive nationwide ad campaign in the [[United States]] touting its strength and the fact that it did not accept any [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|bailout]] money.\n\n=== 2010's ===\nIn 2013, Sun Life acquired 49% [[Aviva|Aviva PLC's]] Malaysian insurance joint venture with lender [[CIMB Group]]. Sun Life acquired the business along with Malaysian state investor [[Khazanah Nasional]], which also purchased 49%. They each paid approximately CDN$300 million. CIMB retains 2% interest.\n\nIn 2015, Sun Life acquired the Employee Benefits business of Assurant Inc. The transaction closed in March 2016, creating the sixth-largest group benefits business in the U.S.\n\nIn 2017, the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] announced that Sun Life will become their jersey sponsor beginning with the 2017-18 NBA season.

Although the [[Tour de la Banque Royale|head office of the Royal Bank of Canada on St. James Street]] was taller by several floors, the [[Sun Life Building]] was at the time the largest building in terms of square footage anywhere in the [[British Empire]].\n\nChartered in 1865, its traditional base business worldwide remains life insurance. However, it now also has significant asset management operations. In 1919, it was the first Canadian company to offer group life insurance. Having begun its first US operations in 1895, the company sold its first group life plan in the U.S. in 1924.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:One York, Toronto, South view 20170417 1.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sun Life Global Headquarters at One York Street in Toronto, Canada]]\nIn [[World War II]], the [[gold reserves]] and [[Security (finance)|securities]] of several European countries were secretly moved to the Sun Life Building for safekeeping. A persistent rumour that the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] were illegally shipped out of the United Kingdom during WWII and stored there was deliberately spread in Montreal to account for increased activity at the building.<ref name=\"Draper1979\">{{cite book|author=Alfred Draper|title=Operation Fish: The Race to Save Europe's Wealth, 1939\u20131945|url=https://archive.org/details/operationfishrac0000drap|url-access=registration|year=1979|publisher=Cassell|isbn=978-0-304-30068-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/operationfishrac0000drap/page/255 255]\u2013257}}</ref>\n\n===Post-World War II===\nDuring the post-war period, the company's successful business strategies made it one of Montreal's largest white-collar employers, one of the top corporations in Canada, as well as a global player in the life insurance field. For the first half of the 20th century, the city of Montreal had been the economic hub of Canada, but it was losing ground to [[Toronto]]. As early as 1950, Toronto's economic activity surpassed Montreal's with regards to stock market trading and capitalization. The advent, in the 1960s, of political and [[terrorism|terrorist]] movements demanding the independence of Quebec from Canada cast a pallor of uncertainty over the business community.\n\n===1977-1980===\nIn 1977, the newly elected [[Quebec sovereignty movement|sovereigntist]] Quebec government passed the [[Charter of the French Language]] (known as Bill 101), making the use of [[French language]] mandatory for medium- and large-scale companies when communicating with French-speaking staff. The law was received negatively by the English-speaking business community, many of whom perceived that the historical rights of the English-speaking minority should be respected. The new government also promised a referendum on Quebec sovereignty, injecting instability into the Montreal business community.<ref name=\"Guardian\">https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/06/40-year-hangover-1976-olympic-games-broke-montreal-canada</ref> On January 6, 1978, Sun Life became the first large company to leave Quebec post-election, announcing that it would move its head office to rented space in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]].<ref name=\"Guardian\"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2011/03/21/la-financiere-sun-life-veut-repartir-a-zero-avec-le-quebec |title = La Financi\u00e8re Sun Life veut repartir \u00e0 z\u00e9ro avec le Qu\u00e9bec}}</ref><ref name=\"Gazette\">{{Cite web | url=https://montrealgazette.com/business/sun-life-now-remembers-yes-we-left-quebec-in-1978 |title = Sun Life Financial now remembers: Yes, we left Quebec in 1978 &#124; Montreal Gazette|date = 2012-02-09}}</ref> Officially, Sun Life said it was motivated by the political instability and economic uncertainty of Quebec's future, but skeptics said it was the company's unwillingness to comply with the requirements of Bill 101.<ref name=\"Gazette\"/> In a reaction the next day, the province's finance minister [[Jacques Parizeau]] called Sun Life \"one of the worst exporters of Quebec capital\",<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\">{{Cite web | url=http://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2775856?docsearchtext=sun%20life%20levesque | title=BAnQ num\u00e9rique}}</ref> and threatened to freeze some $400 million CAD in assets.<ref name=\"banq-leDevoir\"/><ref name=\"Mans1978\">{{cite book|author=Rowland Mans|title=Canada's Constitutional Crisis: Separatism and Subversion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oM2IAAAAMAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Institute for the Study of Conflict}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the company acquired a property at University Avenue and King Street in downtown Toronto and constructed a new office complex, the [[Sun Life Centre]], which was completed in 1984.<ref name=\"Filey1997\">{{cite book|author=Mike Filey|title=Toronto Sketches 5: The Way We Were|url=https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file|url-access=registration|date=1 October 1997|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=978-1-4597-1330-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/torontosketches50000file/page/137 137]\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBill 101 required more than French communications with French-speaking staff. It made French the official language of the workplace. It also provided that present and prospective employees who could not speak English not be discriminated against because of their inability to speak English.\n[[File:Dean A Connor Headshot.jpg|alt=|thumb|Dean A. Connor, President and CEO of Sun Life, since 2011]]\nFor the largest employer of English-speaking people in Montreal, this would make things very difficult. Many, if not most, of Sun Life's Head Office employees in 1979 were not fluent in French. Sun Life was quite clear that this was the reason for its move when it made the announcement. The PQ government was quick to label Sun Life \"bad corporate citizens\" and claimed that if ''\"they had only warned us, we could have worked something out.\"''<ref name=CBC1>{{cite episode |title=CBC reports on Sun Life leaving Montreal in 1978 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/language-culture/fighting-words-bill-101/sun-life-packs-up.html |accessdate=2014-08-18 |date=January 6, 1978 |series=The World At Six |credits=Reporters: Karen Birchard, Richard Inwood |work=[[CBC Radio]]}}</ref>\n\nThe downsizing of Sun Life's Montreal office did not take place overnight. Transfers and moves occurred on a departmental basis and did not commence until several months after the announcement. By 1980, 300 head office employees were located in Toronto.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1076086/sun-life-demenagement-montreal-toronto-pq-archives |title = Il y a 40 ans : Le d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement surprise de la Sun Life}}</ref>\n\nThere were several other key activities in the post-war years. This included a decision by Sun Life to leave many markets, including China and India, because of economic and political changes. In 1962, Sun Life became a mutual company and repurchased its shares for $65 million in total. In 1973, Sun Life opened its American subsidiary's new headquarters in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts, located outside [[Boston]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===1980s \u2013 1990s===\nSun Life continued to expand its wealth management business with the 1982 acquisition of [[MFS Investment Management|Massachusetts Financial Services]] (MFS), the Boston-based investment management and mutual fund company. It entered the mutual fund business in Canada by forming Spectrum Mutual Fund Services in 1987 (subsequently sold to CI Financial) and a decade later, acquired McLean Budden, a Canadian investment management firm (subsequently folded into MFS).\nInternational expansion continued in the 1990s. In 1995, Sun Life entered the Indonesia market through local company PT Asuransi Modern Sun Life, now called PT Sun Life Financial Indonesia and opened a Representative Office in Beijing in preparation to enter China. A year later, Sun Life opened a services centre in Waterford, Ireland, to provide technology and business processing support for Sun Life business units.\n\nIn 1999, Sun Life officially returned to [[India]] and [[China]] when it established two joint ventures \u2013 Birla Sun Life in India with local partner [[Aditya Birla Group]], and Sun Life Everbright in China with partner [[China Everbright Group]]. Over the next decade, both operations grew rapidly \u2013 by September 2008, there were 132,460 Birla Sun Life advisors working in 600 branches across India while Sun Life Everbright opened its sixth branch in Guangzhou, bringing its presence to 18 cities in [[China]].\n\n[[Image:Sun-Life-Building-June-2007.jpg|thumb|right|The Sun Life building in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]]]\n\n=== 2000's ===\nIn early 1998, Sun Life announced its intention to [[demutualize]]. In March 2000, its Initial Public Offering (IPO) started the trading of Sun Life Financial Inc. shares on the Toronto (TSX), New York (NYSE) and Philippine (PSE) stock exchanges.\n\nIn 2002, Sun Life combined its operations with [[Clarica Life Insurance]] of [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. Founded in 1870 as ''Mutual Life of Canada'', Clarica was known as The Mutual Group before it went public in 1999. The former head office for Mutual Life Assurance Company at 227 King Street South in Waterloo became the home to Sun Life's Canadian operations, while a regional office and Sun Life's corporate headquarters remained in Toronto. The company also maintains regional offices in [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]], [[Edmonton]], [[Vancouver]], [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] and [[Calgary]]. After it integrated operations, the company used the Clarica brand name for certain products and activities until 2007.\n\nIn 2005, Sun Life opened a service centre in Gurgaon, [[India]] to provide business processing and technology support for Sun Life Financial business units around the world. That same year, Sun Life purchased CMG Asia and CommServe Financial, the Hong Kong insurance and pension operations of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, tripling its customer base and adding group insurance and pensions to its business lines.\n\nIn 2007, Sun Life purchased the U.S. employee benefits business of Genworth Financial, placing itself in the top 10 in the U.S. group benefits market.\n\nIn 2008, Sun Life sold its 37% interest in CI Financial Income Fund to [[Scotiabank]]. Sun Life had originally acquired a significant [[ownership interest]] in the firm by selling its Canadian mutual fund subsidiaries to CI Financial in 2002.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2002/05/22/cifund020522.html |title= CBC News - CI Fund acquires Sun Life mutual fund business |accessdate=2008-12-28 |date=22 May 2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Sun Life began an aggressive nationwide ad campaign in the [[United States]] touting its strength and the fact that it did not accept any [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|bailout]] money.\n\n=== 2010's ===\nIn 2013, Sun Life acquired 49% [[Aviva|Aviva PLC's]] Malaysian insurance joint venture with lender [[CIMB Group]]. Sun Life acquired the business along with Malaysian state investor [[Khazanah Nasional]], which also purchased 49%. They each paid approximately CDN$300 million. CIMB retains 2% interest.\n\nIn 2015, Sun Life acquired the Employee Benefits business of Assurant Inc. The transaction closed in March 2016, creating the sixth-largest group benefits business in the U.S.\n\nIn 2017, the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] announced that Sun Life will become their jersey sponsor beginning with the 2017-18 NBA season.
