As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, [[confabulation]], [[dogma]], [[illusion]], or some other misleading effects of [[perception]].\n\nDelusions have been found to occur in the context of many pathological states (both general physical and mental) and are of particular diagnostic importance in [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders including [[schizophrenia]], [[paraphrenia]], [[Mania|manic]] episodes of [[bipolar disorder]], and [[psychotic depression]].\n\n==Types==\nDelusions are categorized into four different groups:\n\n* '''Bizarre delusion:''' Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not understandable to same-culture peers and do not derive from ordinary life experiences.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|oclc= }}</ref> An example named by the [[DSM-5]] is a belief that someone replaced all of one's internal organs with someone else's without leaving a scar, depending on the organ in question.\n* '''Non-bizarre delusion:''' A delusion that, though false, is at least technically possible, e.g., the affected person mistakenly believes that they are under constant police surveillance, which is unlikely, but nonetheless still a plausible reality.\n* '''Mood-congruent delusion:''' Any delusion with content consistent with either a [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] or [[Mania|manic]] state, e.g., a depressed person believes that news anchors on television highly disapprove of them, or a person in a manic state might believe they are a powerful deity.\n* '''Mood-neutral delusion:''' A delusion that does not relate to the sufferer's emotional state; for example, a belief that an extra limb is growing out of the back of one's head is neutral to either depression or mania.<ref name=\"minddisorders.com\">{{cite web |title=Delusions |url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Delusions.html |work=Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders |publisher=Advameg.com  |accessdate=2018-04-22}}</ref>\n\n===Themes===\nIn addition to these categories, delusions often manifest according to a consistent theme. Although delusions can have any theme, certain themes are more common. Some of the more common delusion themes are:\n* '''Delusion of control''': False belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one's general thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behavior.<ref name=\"minddisorders.com\" />\n* '''[[Cotard delusion]]''': False belief that oneself does not exist or has died.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Berrios G.E. |author2=Luque R. | year = 1995 | title = Cotard Syndrome: clinical analysis of 100 cases | url = | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 185\u2013188 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb09764.x | pmid = 7625193 }}</ref>\n* '''[[Delusional jealousy]]''': False belief that a spouse or lover is having an affair, with no proof to back up their claim.<ref name=\"minddisorders.com\" />\n* '''Delusion of guilt or sin (or delusion of self-accusation)''': Ungrounded feeling of remorse or guilt of delusional intensity.<ref name=\"minddisorders.com\" />\n* '''Delusion of mind being read''': False belief that other people can know one's thoughts.<ref name=\"minddisorders.com\" />\n* '''[[Thought insertion|Delusion of thought insertion]]''': Belief that another thinks through the mind of the person.<ref name=\"minddisorders.com\" />\n* '''[[Ideas of reference|Delusion of reference]]''': False belief that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in one's environment have personal meaning or significance. \"Usually the meaning assigned to these events is negative, but the 'messages' can also have a grandiose quality.\"<ref name=\"minddisorders.com\" />\n* '''[[Erotomania]]''': False belief that another person is in love with them.<ref name=\"minddisorders.com\" />\n* '''[[Religious delusion]]''': Belief that the affected person is a god or chosen to act as a god.<ref name=ReligiousDelusion1>{{cite web|title=Religious delusions are common symptoms of schizophrenia.|url=http://www.sciforums.com/showthread.php?t=51361|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref name=ReligiousDelusion2>{{cite web|last=M |first=Raja |title=Religious delusion |url=http://www.sanp.ch/pdf/2000/2000-01/2000-01-058.PDF |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322210939/http://www.sanp.ch/pdf/2000/2000-01/2000-01-058.PDF |archivedate=22 March 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n* '''Somatic delusion''': Delusion whose content pertains to bodily functioning, bodily sensations or physical appearance.

Although this type of delusion is less common now, it was particularly widespread in the days preceding state support.<ref>Barker, P. 1997. Assessment in Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing in Search of the Whole Person. UK: Nelson Thornes Ltd. P241.</ref><!-- removed cn-tag because both two sentences are fully supported by this source.\n* '''Gender Delusion''': Person strongly believes not being of the same gender as their biological body. Affected individuals sometimes refer to themselves being of demi-gender(s). -->\n\n[[Grandiose delusions]] or delusions of grandeur are principally a subtype of [[delusional disorder]] but could possibly feature as a symptom of [[schizophrenia]] and [[mania|manic]] episodes of [[Current diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder|bipolar disorder]].<ref name=\"DSM-IV-TR\">[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) [[American Psychiatric Association]] (2000)</ref> Grandiose delusions are characterized by fantastical beliefs that one is famous, [[omnipotent]] or otherwise very powerful. The delusions are generally fantastic, often with a [[supernatural]], [[science-fiction]]al, or religious bent. In colloquial usage, one who overestimates one's own abilities, talents, stature or situation is sometimes said to have \"delusions of grandeur\". This is generally due to excessive [[pride]], rather than any actual delusions.

One is the [[Genetics|genetic]] or biological theory, which states that close relatives of people with delusional disorder are at increased risk of delusional traits. Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might suffer the onset of delusional disorder in those moments when coping with life and maintaining high [[self-esteem]] becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view.<ref name=\"H\">{{cite web|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Delusional-disorder.html |title=Delusional Disorder |date=|accessdate=6 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis condition is more common among people who have poor [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] or [[Visual perception|sight]]. Also, ongoing stressors have been associated with a higher possibility of developing delusions.

Dysfunction in evaluations systems localized to the right lateral prefrontal cortex, regardless of delusion content, is supported by neuroimaging studies and is congruent with its role in conflict monitoring in healthy persons.  Abnormal activation and reduced volume is seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as [[frontotemporal dementia]], [[psychosis]] and [[Lewy body dementia]].  Furthermore, lesions to this region are associated with \"jumping to conclusions\", damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism this region associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe [[aberrant salience]] model suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli.  In support of this hypothesis, regions normally associated with the [[salience network]] demonstrate reduced grey matter in people with delusions, and the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]], which is widely implicated in salience processing, is also widely implicated in psychotic disorders.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nSpecific regions have been associated with specific types of delusions.  The volume of the hippocampus and parahippocampus is related to paranoid delusions in [[Alzheimer's disease]], and has been reported to be abnormal post mortem in one person with delusions.  [[Capgras delusion]]s have been associated with occipito-temporal damage and may be related to failure to elicit normal emotions or memories in response to faces.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naasan|first1=George|editor1-last=Lehner|editor1-first=T|editor2-last=Miller|editor2-first=B|editor3-last=State|editor3-first=M|title=Genomics, Circuits, and Pathways in Clinical Neuropsychiatry|publisher=Elsevier Science|pages=366\u2013369|chapter=The Anatomy of Delusions}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Airloom.gif|thumb|[[John Haslam (physician)|John Haslam]] illustrated this picture of a machine described by [[James Tilly Matthews]] called an \"air loom\", which Matthews believed was being used to torture him and others for political purposes.]]\nThe modern definition and Jaspers' original criteria have been criticised, as counter-examples can be shown for every defining feature.\n\nStudies on [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric patients]] show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Myin-Germeys I, Nicolson NA, Delespaul PA |title=The context of delusional experiences in the daily life of patients with schizophrenia |journal=Psychol Med |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=489\u201398 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11305857 |doi=10.1017/s0033291701003646}}</ref>\n\nDelusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-440X(90)90023-L |author=Spitzer M |title=On defining delusions |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=377\u201397 |year=1990 |pmid=2225797 }}<br /></ref> Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.<ref>{{cite book |author=Young, A.W. |chapter=Wondrous strange: The neuropsychology of abnormal beliefs |editor1=Coltheart M. |editor2=Davis M. |title=Pathologies of belief |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2000 |isbn=0-631-22136-0 |pages=47\u201374 }}</ref>\nIn other situations the delusion may turn out to be true belief.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones E |title=The phenomenology of abnormal belief |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry and Psychology |volume=6 |pages=1\u201316 |year=1999 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_psychiatry_and_psychology/toc/ppp6.1.html}}</ref> For example, in [[delusional jealousy]], where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to be seeing their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another person.

At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the [[Watergate scandal]] broke was she proved right (and hence sane).\n\nSimilar factors have led to criticisms of Jaspers' definition of true delusions as being ultimately 'un-understandable'. Critics (such as [[R. D. Laing]]) have argued that this leads to the diagnosis of delusions being based on the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] understanding of a particular psychiatrist, who may not have access to all the information that might make a belief otherwise interpretable. R. D. Laing's hypothesis has been applied to some forms of projective therapy to \"fix\" a delusional system so that it cannot be altered by the patient. Psychiatric researchers at [[Yale University]], [[Ohio State University]] and the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia have used novels and motion picture films as the focus. Texts, plots and cinematography are discussed and the delusions approached tangentially.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56 |year=2001 }}</ref> This use of fiction to decrease the malleability of a delusion was employed in a joint project by science-fiction author [[Philip Jose Farmer]] and Yale psychiatrist A. James Giannini. They wrote the novel ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'', which, recursively, deals with delusional adolescents who are treated with a form of projective therapy. In this novel's fictional setting other novels written by Farmer are discussed and the characters are symbolically integrated into the delusions of fictional patients. This particular novel was then applied to real-life clinical settings.<ref>AJ Giannini. Afterword. (in) PJ Farmer. Red Orc's Rage.NY, Tor Books, 1991, pp.279-282.</ref>\n\nAnother difficulty with the diagnosis of delusions is that almost all of these features can be found in \"normal\" beliefs. Many religious beliefs hold exactly the same features, yet are not universally considered delusional. For instance, if a person was holding a true belief then they will of course persist with it. This can cause the disorder to be misdiagnosed by psychiatrists. These factors have led the psychiatrist [[Anthony David (neuropsychiatrist)|Anthony David]] to note that \"there is no acceptable (rather than accepted) definition of a delusion.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=David AS |title=On the impossibility of defining delusions |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry and Psychology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201320 |year=1999 }}</ref> In practice, psychiatrists tend to diagnose a belief as delusional if it is either patently bizarre, causing significant distress, or excessively pre-occupying the patient, especially if the person is subsequently unswayed in belief by counter-evidence or reasonable arguments.\n\nIt is important to distinguish true delusions from other symptoms such as [[anxiety]], [[fear]], or [[paranoia]]. To diagnose delusions a mental state examination may be used. This test includes [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], affect, [[behavior]], rate and continuity of speech, evidence of hallucinations or abnormal beliefs, thought content, orientation to time, place and person, attention and [[concentration]], insight and judgment, as well as short-term [[memory]].<ref name=\"E\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/symptoms/delusions/tests.htm |title=Diagnostic Test List for Delusions |date=|accessdate=6 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nJohnson-Laird suggests that delusions may be viewed as the natural consequence of failure to distinguish conceptual relevance. That is, the person takes irrelevant information and puts it in the form of disconnected experiences, then it is taken to be relevant in a manner that suggests false causal connections. Furthermore, the person takes the relevant information, in the form of counterexamples, and ignores it.<ref name=\"F\">{{cite web|url=http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/13/3/403-a |title=A New Definition of Delusional Ideation in Terms of Model Restriction |date= |accessdate=6 August 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Definition===\nAlthough non-specific concepts of madness have been around for several thousand years, the psychiatrist and philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] was the first to define the three main criteria for a belief to be considered delusional in his 1913 book ''General Psychopathology''.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = J.

They argue that since cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, books and the internet, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences, the assumption that culture can be boiled down to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically quantifiable factors and that everything that does not fall in those factors must be biological, is not a justified assumption. Other critical psychiatrists argue that just because a person's belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing [[empirical evidence]], only that psychiatry rarely if ever present patients with such situations.<ref>D.

A specific variant of this is when a person is fed lies in an attempt to convince them that they are delusional, a process called [[gaslighting]], after the 1938 play ''[[Gaslight (play)|Gaslight]]'', the plot of which centered around the process.\nSometimes, gaslighting can be unintentional, for example if a person, or a group of people aim to lie or cover up an issue, it can lead to the victim being gaslighted as well.<ref>''The Sociopath Next Door'' by Martha Stout (2006) Harmony. {{ISBN|0767915828}}.</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nPsychotherapies that may be helpful in delusional disorder include [[individual psychotherapy]], [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and [[family therapy]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology|Psychiatry}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Bizarre object]]\n* [[Capgras delusion]]\n* [[Clinical lycanthropy]]\n* [[Delirium]]\n* [[Delusional misidentification syndrome]]\n* [[Folie \u00e0 deux]]\n* [[Intrusive thoughts]]\n* [[Paris syndrome]]\n* [[Jerusalem syndrome]]\n* [[Mass hysteria]]\n* [[Monothematic delusion]]\n* [[Paranoia]]\n* [[Pathological jealousy]]\n* [[Psychosis]]\n* [[Reduplicative paramnesia]]\n* [[Prelest]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Cited text\n* {{Cite book |last=Jaspers |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Jaspers |title=General Psychopathology |volume=1 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-8018-5775-9 |year=1997 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite journal |author1=Arnold, K.  |author2=Vakhrusheva, J. |title=Resist the negation reflex: Minimizing reactance in psychotherapy of delusions |journal=Psychosis|volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=166\u2013175 |year=2015| doi= 10.1080/17522439.2015.1095229|url=https://www.academia.edu/18748834 |format=PDF}}\n* {{Cite journal|vauthors=Bell V, Halligan PW, Ellis H |title=Beliefs about delusions |journal=The Psychologist |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=418\u2013423 |year=2003 |url=http://mindfull.spc.org/vaughan/Bell_et_al_2003_BeliefsAboutDelusions.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728045829/http://mindfull.spc.org/vaughan/Bell_et_al_2003_BeliefsAboutDelusions.pdf |archivedate=28 July 2011 |df=dmy }}\n* {{Cite journal| last = Blackwood| first = Nigel J.| last2 = Howard| first2 = Robert J.| last3 = Bentall| first3 = Richard P.| last4 = Murray| first4 = Robin M.| authorlink4 = Robin Murray|date=April 2001| title = Cognitive Neuropsychiatric Models of Persecutory Delusions| journal = [[American Journal of Psychiatry]]| volume = 158| issue = 4| pages = 527\u2013539| url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/158/4/527| doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.4.527| pmid=11282685}}\n* {{Cite book |editor1=Coltheart M. |editor2=Davies M. |title=Pathologies of belief |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2000 |isbn=0-631-22136-0 }}\n* {{Cite book |author=Persaud, R. |title=From the Edge of the Couch: Bizarre Psychiatric Cases and What They Teach Us About Ourselves |publisher=Bantam |year=2003 |isbn=0-553-81346-3 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Medical resources\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|F22}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|297}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = \n| DiseasesDB      = 33439\n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = D003702\n| GeneReviewsNBK  = \n| GeneReviewsName = \n| NORD            = \n| GARDNum         = \n| GARDName        = \n| Orphanet        = \n| AO              = \n| RP              = \n| WO              = \n| OrthoInfo       = \n| NCI             = \n| Scholia         = \n| SNOMED CT       =\n}}\n{{Bipolar disorder}}\n{{Mental and behavioral disorders|selected = schizophrenia}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Delusional disorders| ]]\n[[Category:Abnormal psychology]]\n[[Category:Psychosis]]\n[[Category:Communication of falsehoods]]\n[[Category:Belief]]\n[[Category:Psychopathology]]\n[[Category:Deception]]\n[[Category:Delusions| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{See also|Delusional disorder}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n |name          = Delusion\n |synonym       = \n |image         = \n |image_size    = \n |alt           = \n |caption       = \n |pronounce     = \n |specialty     = [[Psychiatry]]\n |symptoms      = \n |complications = \n |onset         = \n |duration      = \n |types         = \n |causes        = \n |risks         = \n |diagnosis     = \n |differential  = \n |prevention    = \n |treatment     = \n |medication    = \n |prognosis     = \n |frequency     = \n |deaths        = \n}}\n\nA '''delusion''' is a firm and fixed [[belief]] based on inadequate grounds not amenable to rational argument or evidence to contrary, not in sync with regional, cultural and educational background. As a pathology, it is distinct from a belief based on false or incomplete information, [[confabulation]], [[dogma]], [[illusion]], or some other misleading effects of [[perception]].\n\nDelusions have been found to occur in the context of many pathological states (both general physical and mental) and are of particular diagnostic importance in [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders including [[schizophrenia]], [[paraphrenia]], [[Mania|manic]] episodes of [[bipolar disorder]], and [[psychotic depression]].\n\n==Types==\nDelusions are categorized into four different groups:\n\n* '''Bizarre delusion:''' Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible and not understandable to same-culture peers and do not derive from ordinary life experiences.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|oclc= }}</ref> An example named by the [[DSM-5]] is a belief that someone replaced all of one's internal organs with someone else's without leaving a scar, depending on the organ in question.\n* '''Non-bizarre delusion:''' A delusion that, though false, is at least technically possible, e.g., the affected person mistakenly believes that they are under constant police surveillance, which is unlikely, but nonetheless still a plausible reality.\n* '''Mood-congruent delusion:''' Any delusion with content consistent with either a [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] or [[Mania|manic]] state, e.g., a depressed person believes that news anchors on television highly disapprove of them, or a person in a manic state might believe they are a powerful deity.\n* '''Mood-neutral delusion:''' A delusion that does not relate to the sufferer's emotional state; for example, a belief that an extra limb is growing out of the back of one's head is neutral to either depression or mania.<ref name=\"minddisorders.com\">{{cite web |title=Delusions |url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Delusions.html |work=Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders |publisher=Advameg.com  |accessdate=2018-04-22}}</ref>\n\n===Themes===\nIn addition to these categories, delusions often manifest according to a consistent theme.

The delusions are generally fantastic, often with a [[supernatural]], [[science-fiction]]al, or religious bent. In colloquial usage, one who overestimates one's own abilities, talents, stature or situation is sometimes said to have \"delusions of grandeur\". This is generally due to excessive [[pride]], rather than any actual delusions. Grandiose delusions or delusions of grandeur can also be associated with megalomania.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Persecutory delusions===\n{{main|Persecutory delusion}}\nPersecutory delusions are the most common type of delusions and involve the theme of being followed, harassed, cheated, poisoned or drugged, conspired against, spied on, attacked, or otherwise obstructed in the pursuit of goals.\nPersecutory delusions are a condition in which the affected person wrongly believes that they are being [[Persecution|persecuted]].

Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might suffer the onset of delusional disorder in those moments when coping with life and maintaining high [[self-esteem]] becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view.<ref name=\"H\">{{cite web|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Br-Del/Delusional-disorder.html |title=Delusional Disorder |date=|accessdate=6 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis condition is more common among people who have poor [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] or [[Visual perception|sight]]. Also, ongoing stressors have been associated with a higher possibility of developing delusions. Examples of such stressors are [[immigration]], low socioeconomic status, and even possibly the accumulation of smaller daily hassles.<ref>Kingston, C. & Schuurmans-Stekhoven, J. (2016).

Dysfunction in evaluations systems localized to the right lateral prefrontal cortex, regardless of delusion content, is supported by neuroimaging studies and is congruent with its role in conflict monitoring in healthy persons.  Abnormal activation and reduced volume is seen in people with delusions, as well as in disorders associated with delusions such as [[frontotemporal dementia]], [[psychosis]] and [[Lewy body dementia]].  Furthermore, lesions to this region are associated with \"jumping to conclusions\", damage to this region is associated with post-stroke delusions, and hypometabolism this region associated with caudate strokes presenting with delusions.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe [[aberrant salience]] model suggests that delusions are a result of people assigning excessive importance to irrelevant stimuli.  In support of this hypothesis, regions normally associated with the [[salience network]] demonstrate reduced grey matter in people with delusions, and the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]], which is widely implicated in salience processing, is also widely implicated in psychotic disorders.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nSpecific regions have been associated with specific types of delusions.  The volume of the hippocampus and parahippocampus is related to paranoid delusions in [[Alzheimer's disease]], and has been reported to be abnormal post mortem in one person with delusions.  [[Capgras delusion]]s have been associated with occipito-temporal damage and may be related to failure to elicit normal emotions or memories in response to faces.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naasan|first1=George|editor1-last=Lehner|editor1-first=T|editor2-last=Miller|editor2-first=B|editor3-last=State|editor3-first=M|title=Genomics, Circuits, and Pathways in Clinical Neuropsychiatry|publisher=Elsevier Science|pages=366\u2013369|chapter=The Anatomy of Delusions}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Airloom.gif|thumb|[[John Haslam (physician)|John Haslam]] illustrated this picture of a machine described by [[James Tilly Matthews]] called an \"air loom\", which Matthews believed was being used to torture him and others for political purposes.]]\nThe modern definition and Jaspers' original criteria have been criticised, as counter-examples can be shown for every defining feature.\n\nStudies on [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric patients]] show that delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, which suggests that certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a delusional belief.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Myin-Germeys I, Nicolson NA, Delespaul PA |title=The context of delusional experiences in the daily life of patients with schizophrenia |journal=Psychol Med |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=489\u201398 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11305857 |doi=10.1017/s0033291701003646}}</ref>\n\nDelusions do not necessarily have to be false or 'incorrect inferences about external reality'.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-440X(90)90023-L |author=Spitzer M |title=On defining delusions |journal=Compr Psychiatry |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=377\u201397 |year=1990 |pmid=2225797 }}<br /></ref> Some religious or spiritual beliefs by their nature may not be falsifiable, and hence cannot be described as false or incorrect, no matter whether the person holding these beliefs was diagnosed as delusional or not.<ref>{{cite book |author=Young, A.W. |chapter=Wondrous strange: The neuropsychology of abnormal beliefs |editor1=Coltheart M. |editor2=Davis M. |title=Pathologies of belief |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2000 |isbn=0-631-22136-0 |pages=47\u201374 }}</ref>\nIn other situations the delusion may turn out to be true belief.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones E |title=The phenomenology of abnormal belief |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry and Psychology |volume=6 |pages=1\u201316 |year=1999 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophy_psychiatry_and_psychology/toc/ppp6.1.html}}</ref> For example, in [[delusional jealousy]], where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them to be seeing their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another person.

At the time, her claims were thought to be signs of mental illness, and only after the [[Watergate scandal]] broke was she proved right (and hence sane).\n\nSimilar factors have led to criticisms of Jaspers' definition of true delusions as being ultimately 'un-understandable'. Critics (such as [[R. D. Laing]]) have argued that this leads to the diagnosis of delusions being based on the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] understanding of a particular psychiatrist, who may not have access to all the information that might make a belief otherwise interpretable. R. D. Laing's hypothesis has been applied to some forms of projective therapy to \"fix\" a delusional system so that it cannot be altered by the patient. Psychiatric researchers at [[Yale University]], [[Ohio State University]] and the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia have used novels and motion picture films as the focus. Texts, plots and cinematography are discussed and the delusions approached tangentially.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Giannini AJ |title=Use of fiction in therapy |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=56 |year=2001 }}</ref> This use of fiction to decrease the malleability of a delusion was employed in a joint project by science-fiction author [[Philip Jose Farmer]] and Yale psychiatrist A. James Giannini. They wrote the novel ''[[Red Orc's Rage]]'', which, recursively, deals with delusional adolescents who are treated with a form of projective therapy. In this novel's fictional setting other novels written by Farmer are discussed and the characters are symbolically integrated into the delusions of fictional patients. This particular novel was then applied to real-life clinical settings.<ref>AJ Giannini. Afterword. (in) PJ Farmer. Red Orc's Rage.NY, Tor Books, 1991, pp.279-282.</ref>\n\nAnother difficulty with the diagnosis of delusions is that almost all of these features can be found in \"normal\" beliefs. Many religious beliefs hold exactly the same features, yet are not universally considered delusional. For instance, if a person was holding a true belief then they will of course persist with it. This can cause the disorder to be misdiagnosed by psychiatrists. These factors have led the psychiatrist [[Anthony David (neuropsychiatrist)|Anthony David]] to note that \"there is no acceptable (rather than accepted) definition of a delusion.\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=David AS |title=On the impossibility of defining delusions |journal=Philosophy, Psychiatry and Psychology |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201320 |year=1999 }}</ref> In practice, psychiatrists tend to diagnose a belief as delusional if it is either patently bizarre, causing significant distress, or excessively pre-occupying the patient, especially if the person is subsequently unswayed in belief by counter-evidence or reasonable arguments.\n\nIt is important to distinguish true delusions from other symptoms such as [[anxiety]], [[fear]], or [[paranoia]]. To diagnose delusions a mental state examination may be used. This test includes [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], affect, [[behavior]], rate and continuity of speech, evidence of hallucinations or abnormal beliefs, thought content, orientation to time, place and person, attention and [[concentration]], insight and judgment, as well as short-term [[memory]].<ref name=\"E\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/symptoms/delusions/tests.htm |title=Diagnostic Test List for Delusions |date=|accessdate=6 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nJohnson-Laird suggests that delusions may be viewed as the natural consequence of failure to distinguish conceptual relevance. That is, the person takes irrelevant information and puts it in the form of disconnected experiences, then it is taken to be relevant in a manner that suggests false causal connections. Furthermore, the person takes the relevant information, in the form of counterexamples, and ignores it.<ref name=\"F\">{{cite web|url=http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/13/3/403-a |title=A New Definition of Delusional Ideation in Terms of Model Restriction |date= |accessdate=6 August 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Definition===\nAlthough non-specific concepts of madness have been around for several thousand years, the psychiatrist and philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] was the first to define the three main criteria for a belief to be considered delusional in his 1913 book ''General Psychopathology''.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = J.

They argue that since cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, books and the internet, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences, the assumption that culture can be boiled down to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically quantifiable factors and that everything that does not fall in those factors must be biological, is not a justified assumption. Other critical psychiatrists argue that just because a person's belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing [[empirical evidence]], only that psychiatry rarely if ever present patients with such situations.<ref>D.

A specific variant of this is when a person is fed lies in an attempt to convince them that they are delusional, a process called [[gaslighting]], after the 1938 play ''[[Gaslight (play)|Gaslight]]'', the plot of which centered around the process.\nSometimes, gaslighting can be unintentional, for example if a person, or a group of people aim to lie or cover up an issue, it can lead to the victim being gaslighted as well.<ref>''The Sociopath Next Door'' by Martha Stout (2006) Harmony. {{ISBN|0767915828}}.</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nPsychotherapies that may be helpful in delusional disorder include [[individual psychotherapy]], [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and [[family therapy]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology|Psychiatry}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Bizarre object]]\n* [[Capgras delusion]]\n* [[Clinical lycanthropy]]\n* [[Delirium]]\n* [[Delusional misidentification syndrome]]\n* [[Folie \u00e0 deux]]\n* [[Intrusive thoughts]]\n* [[Paris syndrome]]\n* [[Jerusalem syndrome]]\n* [[Mass hysteria]]\n* [[Monothematic delusion]]\n* [[Paranoia]]\n* [[Pathological jealousy]]\n* [[Psychosis]]\n* [[Reduplicative paramnesia]]\n* [[Prelest]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Cited text\n* {{Cite book |last=Jaspers |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Jaspers |title=General Psychopathology |volume=1 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-8018-5775-9 |year=1997 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite journal |author1=Arnold, K.  |author2=Vakhrusheva, J. |title=Resist the negation reflex: Minimizing reactance in psychotherapy of delusions |journal=Psychosis|volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=166\u2013175 |year=2015| doi= 10.1080/17522439.2015.1095229|url=https://www.academia.edu/18748834 |format=PDF}}\n* {{Cite journal|vauthors=Bell V, Halligan PW, Ellis H |title=Beliefs about delusions |journal=The Psychologist |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=418\u2013423 |year=2003 |url=http://mindfull.spc.org/vaughan/Bell_et_al_2003_BeliefsAboutDelusions.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728045829/http://mindfull.spc.org/vaughan/Bell_et_al_2003_BeliefsAboutDelusions.pdf |archivedate=28 July 2011 |df=dmy }}\n* {{Cite journal| last = Blackwood| first = Nigel J.| last2 = Howard| first2 = Robert J.| last3 = Bentall| first3 = Richard P.| last4 = Murray| first4 = Robin M.| authorlink4 = Robin Murray|date=April 2001| title = Cognitive Neuropsychiatric Models of Persecutory Delusions| journal = [[American Journal of Psychiatry]]| volume = 158| issue = 4| pages = 527\u2013539| url = http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/158/4/527| doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.158.4.527| pmid=11282685}}\n* {{Cite book |editor1=Coltheart M. |editor2=Davies M. |title=Pathologies of belief |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=2000 |isbn=0-631-22136-0 }}\n* {{Cite book |author=Persaud, R. |title=From the Edge of the Couch: Bizarre Psychiatric Cases and What They Teach Us About Ourselves |publisher=Bantam |year=2003 |isbn=0-553-81346-3 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Medical resources\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|F22}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|297}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = \n| DiseasesDB      = 33439\n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = D003702\n| GeneReviewsNBK  = \n| GeneReviewsName = \n| NORD            = \n| GARDNum         = \n| GARDName        = \n| Orphanet        = \n| AO              = \n| RP              = \n| WO              = \n| OrthoInfo       = \n| NCI             = \n| Scholia         = \n| SNOMED CT       =\n}}\n{{Bipolar disorder}}\n{{Mental and behavioral disorders|selected = schizophrenia}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Delusional disorders| ]]\n[[Category:Abnormal psychology]]\n[[Category:Psychosis]]\n[[Category:Communication of falsehoods]]\n[[Category:Belief]]\n[[Category:Psychopathology]]\n[[Category:Deception]]\n[[Category:Delusions| ]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:587:1821:a200:d1c8:f6a6:9cfd:70df", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion"}

The State Government identified the Capital City area between Vijayawada and Guntur cities on the Southern bank of River Krishna upstream of Prakasam Barrage. The Amaravati Capital City has an area of 217.23 km<sup>2</sup> and is spread across 25 villages in 3 mandals (Thulluru, Mangalagiri and Tadepalli) of Guntur district. The 25 villages in the Capital City area have about 1 lakh population in about 27,000 households. The nearest cities are Vijayawada at a distance of 30 km and Guntur at a distance of 18 km. The nearest railway station is KC Canal railway station near Tadepalli and the nearest airport is Gannavaram which is at a distance of 22 km. The city is planned to spread over 217 km<sup>2</sup> area with a total cost of \u20b9 553.43 billions to the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) out of which state government contribution is only \u20b9 126 billion (equity \u20b9 66.29 billion and supporting grant \u20b9 59.71 billion) spread over a period of 8 years from April 2018 to March 2026 (\u20b9 5 billion in 2018\u201319, \u20b9 18 billion per year for later six years and \u20b9 13 billion in 2025\u201326).<ref name=\"amr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eenadu.net/eenadu-exclusive/newsarticle/general/1500/120008374|title=Amaravati city a self financed project |language=Telugu|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA)\n|'''City area details:'''\n|'''Land utilization'''\n|-\n|Roads, public utilities, parks, natural streams, water bodies\n|27,885 acres\n|-\n|Plots for residential area allotted to the Land contributors(Farmers)\n|11,826 acres\n|-\n|For the needs of other developments presently owned by the CRDA\n|14,037 acres\n|-\n|Total area under the jurisdiction of CRDA\n|53,748 acres\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Amaravati City Land Usage\n!Land use\n!Area (Sq.&nbsp;km)\n!'''%'''\n|-\n|Residential\n|60.77\n|27.9\n|-\n|Commercial\n|20.99\n|9.34\n|-\n|Public and Semi Public\n|11.49\n|5.29\n|-\n|Open spaces and Recreation\n|52.78\n|24.29\n|-\n|Industrial\n|12.26\n|5.64\n|-\n|Water Bodies\n|25.78\n|11.87\n|-\n|Traffic and Transportation\n|23.04\n|10.61\n|-\n|Cultural Heritage\n|0.15\n|0.07\n|-\n|Seed Capital\n|10.67\n|4.91\n|-\n|Total\n|217.23\n|100\n|}\nThe contribution from the government is to be repaid by the CRDA after the year 2037.

He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and [[Mathematical notation|notation]], particularly for [[mathematical analysis]], such as the notion of a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]].<ref name=\"function\"/> He is also known for his work in [[mechanics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[optics]], [[astronomy]] and [[music theory]].<ref name=eulerarch/>\n\nEuler was one of the most eminent mathematicians of the 18th century and is held to be one of the greatest in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific, as his collected works fill 92 volumes,<ref>https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/wxg/EulerLect.pdf</ref> more than anyone else in the field. He spent most of his adult life in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and in [[Berlin]], then the capital of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].\n\nA statement attributed to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] expresses Euler's influence on mathematics: \"Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.\"<ref name=\"Laplace\"/><ref name=libri/>\n\n==Early life==\nLeonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707, in [[Basel]], Switzerland, to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the [[Reformed Church]], and Marguerite n\u00e9e Brucker, another pastor's daughter. He had two younger sisters, Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich.<ref name=Calinger>{{Cite book| last = Calinger | first = Ronald S. | title = Leonhard Euler: Mathematical Genius in the Enlightenment | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2015 | page = 11 | isbn = 978-0-691-11927-4}}</ref> Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Eulers moved from Basel to the town of [[Riehen]], Switzerland, where Leonhard spent most of his childhood. Paul was a friend of the [[Bernoulli family]]; [[Johann Bernoulli]], then regarded as Europe's foremost mathematician, would eventually be the most important influence on young Leonhard.\n\nEuler's formal education started in Basel, where he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720, at age thirteen, he enrolled at the [[University of Basel]]. In 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. During that time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics.<ref name=\"childhood\"/> At that time Euler's main studies included theology, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at his father's urging to become a pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician.\n\nIn 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the [[Speed of sound|propagation of sound]] with the title ''De Sono''.<ref name=17cent/> At that time, he was unsuccessfully attempting to obtain a position at the University of Basel. In 1727, he first entered the ''[[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy]] Prize Problem'' competition; the problem that year was to find the best way to place the [[mast (sailing)|masts]] on a ship. [[Pierre Bouguer]], who became known as \"the father of naval architecture\", won and Euler took second place. Euler later won this annual prize twelve times.<ref name=\"prize\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Saint Petersburg===\nAround this time Johann Bernoulli's two sons, [[Daniel Bernoulli|Daniel]] and [[Nicolaus II Bernoulli|Nicolaus]], were working at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of appendicitis after spending less than a year in Russia.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/hmat.1996.0015|title=Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727\u20131741)|journal=Historia Mathematica|volume=23|issue=2|pages=121\u2013166|year=1996|last1=Calinger|first1=Ronald}}</ref><ref name=mactutor>{{cite web | last1 =O'Connor | first1 = John J. | last2 =Robertson | first2 = Edmund F. | title=Nicolaus (II) Bernoulli| website = MacTutor History of Mathematics archive | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]] |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Nicolaus%28II%29.html| accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref> When Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler. In November 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.<ref name=\"stpetersburg\"/>\n\n[[Image:1957 CPA 2000.jpg|thumb|left|1957 [[Soviet Union]] stamp commemorating the 250th birthday of Euler. The text says: 250 years from the birth of the great mathematician, academician Leonhard Euler.]]\nEuler arrived in Saint Petersburg on 17 May 1727. He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he often worked in close collaboration. Euler mastered Russian and settled into life in Saint Petersburg. He also took on an additional job as a medic in the [[Russian Navy]].<ref name=\"medic\"/>\n\nThe Academy at Saint Petersburg, established by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler. The academy possessed ample financial resources and a comprehensive library drawn from the private libraries of Peter himself and of the nobility. Very few students were enrolled in the academy to lessen the faculty's teaching burden. The academy emphasized research and offered to its faculty both the time and the freedom to pursue scientific questions.<ref name=\"prize\"/>\n\nThe Academy's benefactress, [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]], who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband, died on the day of Euler's arrival. The Russian nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. The nobility, suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, cut funding and caused other difficulties for Euler and his colleagues.\n\nConditions improved slightly after the death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department.<ref name=\"promotion\"/>\n\nOn 7 January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707\u20131773), a daughter of [[Georg Gsell]], a painter from the Academy Gymnasium.<ref name=gekker/> The young couple bought a house by the [[Neva River]]. Of their thirteen children, only five survived childhood.<ref name=\"wife\"/>\n\n===Berlin===\n[[Image:Euler GDR stamp.jpg|thumb|left|Stamp of the former [[German Democratic Republic]] honoring Euler on the 200th anniversary of his death. Across the centre it shows his [[Planar graph#Euler's formula|polyhedral formula]], in English written as&nbsp;\"''v''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''e''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2\".]]\n\nConcerned about the continuing turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg on 19 June 1741 to take up a post at the ''[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]]'', which he had been offered by [[Frederick the Great of Prussia]]. He lived for 25 years in [[Berlin]], where he wrote over 380 articles. In Berlin, he published the two works for which he would become most renowned: the ''[[Introductio in analysin infinitorum]]'', a text on functions published in 1748, and the ''[[Institutiones calculi differentialis]]'',<ref name=dartm/> published in 1755 on [[differential calculus]].<ref name=\"Friedrich\"/> In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\nIn addition, Euler was asked to tutor [[Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt]], the Princess of [[Anhalt-Dessau]] and Frederick's niece. Euler wrote over 200 letters to her in the early 1760s, which were later compiled into a best-selling volume entitled ''[[Letters to a German Princess|Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess]]''.<ref name='Digital Copy of \"Letters to a German Princess\"'/> This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics, as well as offering valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. This book became more widely read than any of his mathematical works and was published across Europe and in the United States. The popularity of the \"Letters\" testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.<ref name=\"Friedrich\"/>\n\nDespite Euler's immense contribution to the Academy's prestige, he eventually incurred the ire of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick]] and ended up having to leave Berlin. The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court, and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and ill-informed on matters beyond numbers and figures. Euler was a simple, devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs, in many ways the polar opposite of [[Voltaire]], who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick's court. Euler was not a skilled debater and often made it a point to argue subjects that he knew little about, making him the frequent target of Voltaire's wit.<ref name=\"Friedrich\"/> Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities:\n\n{{quote|I wanted to have a water jet in my garden: Euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir, from where it should fall back through channels, finally spurting out in [[Sanssouci]]. My mill was carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer than fifty paces to the reservoir. Vanity of vanities! Vanity of geometry!<ref name=fredlett/>}}\n\n==Personal life==\n===Eyesight deterioration===\nEuler's [[eyesight]] worsened throughout his mathematical career. In 1738, three years after nearly expiring from fever, he became almost blind in his right eye, but Euler rather blamed the painstaking work on [[cartography]] he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy for his condition. Euler's vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, to the extent that Frederick referred to him as \"[[Cyclopes|Cyclops]]\". Euler remarked on his loss of vision, \"Now I will have fewer distractions.\"<ref name=\"Richeson2012\">{{cite book|author=David S.

Just a few weeks after its discovery, a failed surgical restoration rendered him almost totally blind. He was 59 years old then. However, his condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity, as he compensated for it with his mental calculation skills and exceptional memory. For example, Euler could repeat the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Virgil]] from beginning to end without hesitation, and for every page in the edition he could indicate which line was the first and which the last. With the aid of his scribes, Euler's productivity on many areas of study actually increased. He produced, on average, one mathematical paper every week in the year 1775.<ref name=\"volumes\"/> The Eulers bore a double name, Euler-Sch\u00f6lpi, the latter of which derives from ''schelb'' and ''schief'', signifying squint-eyed, cross-eyed, or crooked.

His conditions were quite exorbitant\u2014a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. All of these requests were granted. He spent the rest of his life in Russia. However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage.\n\nThree years after his wife's death, Euler married her half-sister, Salome Abigail Gsell (1723\u20131794).<ref name=gekker2/> This marriage lasted until his death.

He died a few hours later.<ref name=\"euler\"/> [[:de:Jacob von Staehlin|Jacob von Staehlin-Storcksburg]] wrote a short obituary for the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and Russian mathematician [[Nicolas Fuss]], one of Euler's disciples, wrote a more detailed eulogy,<ref name=novaacta/> which he delivered at a memorial meeting. In his eulogy for the French Academy, French mathematician and philosopher [[Marquis de Condorcet]], wrote:\n\n{{quote|''il cessa de calculer et de vivre''\u2014 ... he ceased to calculate and to live.<ref name=condorcet/>}}\n\n[[Image:Euler Grave at Alexander Nevsky Monastry.jpg|thumb|left|Euler's grave at the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra|Alexander Nevsky Monastery]]]]\nEuler was buried next to Katharina at the [[Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery]] on [[Goloday Island]]. In 1785, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] put a marble bust of Leonhard Euler on a pedestal next to the Director's seat and, in 1837, placed a headstone on Euler's grave. To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Euler's birth, the headstone was moved in 1956, together with his remains, to the [[Lazarevskoe Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|18th-century necropolis]] at the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra|Alexander Nevsky Monastery]].\n\n==Contributions to mathematics and physics==\n{{E (mathematical constant)}}\nEuler worked in almost all areas of mathematics, such as [[geometry]], [[infinitesimal]] [[calculus]], [[trigonometry]], [[algebra]], and [[number theory]], as well as [[continuum physics]], [[lunar theory]] and other areas of [[physics]]. He is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 [[quarto (text)|quarto]] volumes.<ref name=\"volumes\"/> Euler's name is associated with a [[List of topics named after Leonhard Euler|large number of topics]].\n\nEuler is the only mathematician to have ''two'' numbers named after him: the important [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]] in [[calculus]], ''e'', approximately equal to 2.71828, and the [[Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant]] \u03b3 ([[gamma]]) sometimes referred to as just \"Euler's constant\", approximately equal to 0.57721. It is not known whether \u03b3 is [[Rational number|rational]] or [[Irrational number|irrational]].<ref name=derbysh/>\n<!-- The biography could use more correlation with his mathematical activities. When was his most prolific period and discoveries, and how did they fit in with his general life? -->\n\n===Mathematical notation===\nEuler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a [[function (mathematics)|function]]<ref name=\"function\"/> and was the first to write ''f''(''x'') to denote the function ''f'' applied to the argument ''x''. He also introduced the modern notation for the [[trigonometric functions]], the letter {{math|''e''}} for the base of the [[natural logarithm]] (now also known as [[Euler's number]]), the Greek letter [[Sigma|\u03a3]] for summations and the letter {{math|''i''}} to denote the [[imaginary unit]].<ref name=Boyer/> The use of the Greek letter ''[[pi (letter)|\u03c0]]'' to denote the [[pi|ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter]] was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with [[Welsh people|Welsh]] mathematician [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]].<ref name=\"pi\">{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematical-notation-past-future/| title = Mathematical Notation: Past and Future| accessdate=23 September 2014| last = Wolfram| first = Stephen}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nThe development of [[infinitesimal calculus]] was at the forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoullis]]\u2014family friends of Euler\u2014were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of [[mathematical rigor|mathematical rigour]]<ref name = \"Basel\"/> (in particular his reliance on the principle of the [[generality of algebra]]), his ideas led to many great advances.\nEuler is well known in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] for his frequent use and development of [[power series]], the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as\n\n:<math>e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty {x^n \\over n!} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{0!} + \\frac{x}{1!} + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\cdots + \\frac{x^n}{n!}\\right).</math>\n\nNotably, Euler directly proved the power series expansions for {{math|''e''}} and the [[inverse tangent]] function. (Indirect proof via the inverse power series technique was given by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] between 1670 and 1680.) His daring use of power series enabled him to solve the famous [[Basel problem]] in 1735 (he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741):<ref name=\"Basel\"/>\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {1 \\over n^2} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{1^2} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi ^2}{6}.</math>\n\n[[Image:Euler's formula.svg|thumb|A geometric interpretation of [[Euler's formula]]]]\n\nEuler introduced the use of the [[exponential function]] and [[logarithms]] in analytic proofs. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series, and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and [[complex number]]s, thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms.<ref name=Boyer/> He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers, and discovered its relation to the [[trigonometric function]]s. For any [[real number]] [[\u03c6|{{math|\u03c6}}]] (taken to be radians), [[Euler's formula]] states that the [[Exponential function#On the complex plane|complex exponential]] function satisfies\n\n:<math>e^{i\\varphi} = \\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi.</math>\n\nA special case of the above formula is known as [[Euler's identity]],\n:<math>e^{i \\pi} +1 = 0 </math>\ncalled \"the most remarkable formula in mathematics\" by [[Richard P. Feynman]], for its single uses of the notions of addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and equality, and the single uses of the important constants 0, 1, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''i''}} and {{pi}}.<ref name=\"Feynman\"/> In 1988, readers of the ''[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' voted it \"the Most Beautiful Mathematical Formula Ever\".<ref name=MathInt/> In total, Euler was responsible for three of the top five formulae in that poll.<ref name=MathInt/>\n\n[[De Moivre's formula]] is a direct consequence of [[Euler's formula]].\n\nIn addition, Euler elaborated the theory of higher [[transcendental function]]s by introducing the [[gamma function]] and introduced a new method for solving [[quartic equation]]s. He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern [[complex analysis]]. He also invented the [[calculus of variations]] including its best-known result, the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]].\n\nEuler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, [[analytic number theory]]. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of [[Generalized hypergeometric series|hypergeometric series]], [[q-series]], [[hyperbolic functions|hyperbolic trigonometric functions]] and the analytic theory of [[generalized continued fraction|continued fractions]]. For example, he proved the [[infinitude of primes]] using the divergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way [[prime numbers]] are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the [[prime number theorem]].<ref name=\"analysis\"/>\n\n===Number theory===\nEuler's interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of [[Christian Goldbach]], his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy. A lot of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the works of [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas and disproved some of his conjectures.\n\nEuler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that [[Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges|the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges]]. In doing so, he discovered the connection between the [[Riemann zeta function]] and the prime numbers; this is known as the [[Proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function|Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function]].\n\nEuler proved [[Newton's identities]], [[Fermat's little theorem]], [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]], and he made distinct contributions to [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]]. He also invented the [[totient function]] \u03c6(''n''), the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer ''n'' that are [[coprime]] to ''n''. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as [[Euler's theorem]]. He contributed significantly to the theory of [[perfect number]]s, which had fascinated mathematicians since [[Euclid]]. He proved that the relationship shown between even perfect numbers and [[Mersenne prime]]s earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the [[Euclid\u2013Euler theorem]]. Euler also conjectured the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]]. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].<ref name=\"numbertheory\"/>\nBy 1772 Euler had proved that 2<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 = [[2147483647|2,147,483,647]] is a Mersenne prime. It may have remained the [[largest known prime]] until 1867.<ref name=caldwell/>\n\n===Graph theory===\n[[Image:Konigsberg bridges.png|frame|right|Map of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in Euler's time showing the actual layout of the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg|seven bridges]], highlighting the river Pregel and the bridges.]]\nIn 1735, Euler presented a solution to the problem known as the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]].<ref name=\"bridge\"/> The city of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was set on the [[Pregel]] River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no [[Eulerian path|Eulerian circuit]]. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of [[graph theory]], specifically of [[planar graph]] theory.<ref name=\"bridge\"/>\n\nEuler also discovered the [[Planar graph#Euler's formula|formula]] <math>V - E + F = 2</math> relating the number of vertices, edges and faces of a [[Convex polytope|convex polyhedron]],<ref name=cromw/> and hence of a [[planar graph]]. The constant in this formula is now known as the [[Euler characteristic]] for the graph (or other mathematical object), and is related to the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of the object.<ref name=gibbons/> The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]<ref name=\"Cauchy\"/> and [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huilier|L'Huilier]],<ref name=\"Lhuillier\"/> is at the origin of [[topology]].\n\n===Applied mathematics===\nSome of Euler's greatest successes were in solving real-world problems analytically, and in describing numerous applications of the [[Bernoulli numbers]], [[Fourier series]], [[Euler number]]s, the constants [[E (mathematical constant)|{{math|e}}]] and [[pi|{{pi}}]], continued fractions and integrals. He integrated [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[differential calculus]] with Newton's [[Method of Fluxions]], and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. He made great strides in improving the [[numerical approximation]] of integrals, inventing what are now known as the [[Euler approximations]]. The most notable of these approximations are [[Euler's method]] and the [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula]]. He also facilitated the use of [[differential equations]], in particular introducing the [[Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant]]:\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty } \\left( 1+ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n} - \\ln(n) \\right).</math>\n\nOne of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae,'' hoping to eventually incorporate [[musical theory]] as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.<ref name=\"music\"/>\n\nIn 1911, almost 130 years after Euler's death, [[Alfred J. Lotka]] used Euler's work to derive the [[Euler\u2013Lotka equation]] for calculating rates of population growth for age-structured populations, a fundamental method that is commonly used in population biology and ecology. \n\n===Physics and astronomy===\n{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}\nEuler helped develop the [[Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation]], which became a cornerstone of engineering. Aside from successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in [[classical mechanics]], Euler also applied these techniques to celestial problems. His work in astronomy was recognized by a number of Paris Academy Prizes over the course of his career. His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the [[solar parallax|parallax]] of the Sun. His calculations also contributed to the development of accurate [[History of longitude|longitude tables]].<ref name=yousch/>\n\nIn addition, Euler made important contributions in [[optics]]. He disagreed with Newton's [[corpuscular theory of light]] in the ''[[Opticks]]'', which was then the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the [[wave theory of light]] proposed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the [[wave-particle duality|quantum theory of light]].<ref name=\"optics\"/>\n\nIn 1757 he published an important set of equations for [[inviscid flow]], that are now known as the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].<ref name=euler2/> In differential form, the equations are:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n&{\\partial\\rho\\over\\partial t}+\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\rho\\mathbf u)=0\\\\[1.2ex]\n&{\\partial(\\rho{\\mathbf u})\\over\\partial t}+\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf u\\otimes(\\rho \\mathbf u))+\\nabla p=\\mathbf{0}\\\\[1.2ex]\n&{\\partial E\\over\\partial t}+\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf u(E+p))=0,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n* ''\u03c1'' is the fluid [[mass density]],\n* '''''u''''' is the fluid [[velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components ''u'', ''v'', and ''w'',\n* ''E'' = ''\u03c1 e'' + \u00bd ''\u03c1'' (''u''<sup>2</sup> + ''v''<sup>2</sup> + ''w''<sup>2</sup>) is the total energy per unit [[volume]], with ''e'' being the [[internal energy]] per unit mass for the fluid,\n* ''p'' is the [[pressure]],\n* ''\u2297'' denotes the [[tensor product]], and\n* '''0''' being the [[zero vector]].\n\nEuler is also well known in structural engineering for his formula giving the critical [[buckling]] load of an ideal strut, which depends only on its length and flexural stiffness:<ref name=\"SIAM\"/>\n:<math>F=\\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{(KL)^2}</math>\n\nwhere\n* ''F'' = maximum or critical [[force]] (vertical load on column),\n* ''E'' = [[modulus of elasticity]],\n* ''I'' = [[area moment of inertia]],\n* ''L'' = unsupported length of column,\n* ''K'' = column effective length factor, whose value depends on the conditions of end support of the column, as follows.\n::For both ends pinned (hinged, free to rotate), ''K'' = 1.0.\n::For both ends fixed, ''K'' = 0.50.\n::For one end fixed and the other end pinned, ''K'' = 0.699\u2026\n::For one end fixed and the other end free to move laterally, ''K'' = 2.0.\n* ''K L'' is the effective length of the column.\n\n===Logic===\nEuler is also credited with using [[closed curve]]s to illustrate [[syllogism|syllogistic]] reasoning (1768). These diagrams have become known as [[Euler diagram]]s.<ref name=\"logic\"/>\n[[File:Euler Diagram.svg|thumb|169x169px|Euler's diagram]]\n\nAn Euler diagram is a [[diagram]]matic means of representing [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and their relationships. Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) in the plane that depict [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or \"zones\": the interior, which symbolically represents the [[element (mathematics)|elements]] of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set.  The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap. The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to set-theoretic relationships ([[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], [[subset]] and [[Disjoint sets|disjointness]]).   Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent [[disjoint sets]].  Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the sets).  A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a [[subset]] of it. Euler diagrams (and their generalization in [[Venn diagram]]s) were incorporated as part of instruction in [[set theory]] as part of the [[new math]] movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading.<ref name=quest/>\n\n===Music===\nEven when dealing with music, Euler's approach is mainly mathematical. His writings on music are not particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages), but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that did not leave him throughout his life.<ref>Peter Pesic, ''Music and the Making of Modern Science'', p.&nbsp;133.</ref>\n\nA first point of Euler's musical theory is the definition of \"genres\", i.e. of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5. Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2<sup>m</sup>A, where A is the \"exponent\" of the genre (i.e. the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5) and 2<sup>m</sup> (where \"m is an indefinite number, small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible\"<ref>Leonhard Euler, ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae'', St Petersburg, 1739, p.&nbsp;115</ref>), expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned. The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second genre, 2<sup>m</sup>.3, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C\u2013G\u2013C); the third genre is 2<sup>m</sup>.5, major third + minor sixth (C\u2013E\u2013C); the fourth is 2<sup>m</sup>.3<sup>2</sup>, two-fourths and a tone (C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|b}}\u2013C); the fifth is 2<sup>m</sup>.3.5 (C\u2013E\u2013G\u2013B\u2013C); etc. Genres 12 (2<sup>m</sup>.3<sup>3</sup>.5), 13 (2<sup>m</sup>.3<sup>2</sup>.5<sup>2</sup>) and 14 (2<sup>m</sup>.3.5<sup>3</sup>) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients. Genre 18 (2<sup>m</sup>.3<sup>3</sup>.5<sup>2</sup>) is the \"diatonico-chromatic\", \"used generally in all compositions\",<ref>Eric Emery, ''Temps et musique'', Lausanne, L'\u00c2ge d'homme, 2000, pp. 344\u201345.</ref> and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson.<ref>Johannes Mattheson, ''Grosse General-Ba\u00df-Schule'', Hamburg, 1731, Vol. I, pp.&nbsp;104\u201306, mentioned by Euler; and ''Exemplarische Organisten-Probe'', Hamburg, 1719, pp.&nbsp;57\u201359.</ref> Euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7.<ref>Wilfrid Perret, ''Some Questions of Musical Theory'', Cambridge, 1926, pp.&nbsp;60\u201362; \"What is an Euler-Fokker genus?\", http://www.huygens-fokker.org/microtonality/efg.html.

Euler insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide. Euler's religious leanings might also have had a bearing on his dislike of the doctrine; he went so far as to label Wolff's ideas as \"heathen and atheistic\".<ref name=\"wolff\"/>\n\nMuch of what is known of Euler's religious beliefs can be deduced from his ''[[Letters to a German Princess]]'' and an earlier work, ''Rettung der G\u00f6ttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einw\u00fcrfe der Freygeister'' (''Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers''). These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the ''Rettung'' was primarily an argument for the [[Biblical inspiration|divine inspiration of scripture]].<ref name=\"theology\"/>\n\nThere is a famous legend<ref name=\"diderot\"/> inspired by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, which is set during Euler's second stint at the St. Petersburg Academy. The French philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation. However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for [[atheism]] were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman. Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the [[existence of God]]: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court. Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in a tone of perfect conviction announced this [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]]: \"Sir, {{sfrac|''a+b<sup>n</sup>''|''n''}}=''x'', hence God exists\u2014reply!\"\nDiderot, to whom (says the story) all mathematics was gibberish, stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court.  Embarrassed, he asked to leave Russia, a request that was graciously granted by the Empress. However amusing the anecdote may be, it is [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]], given that Diderot himself did research in mathematics.<ref name=persee/>\nThe legend was apparently first told by\nDieudonn\u00e9 Thi\u00e9bault<ref name=\"brown\"/> with significant embellishment by [[Augustus De Morgan]].<ref name=\"Struik\"/><ref name=\"gillings\"/>\n\n==Commemorations==\n[[Image:Euler-10 Swiss Franc banknote (front).jpg|thumb|Euler on the Old Swiss [[Swiss Franc|10 Franc]] banknote]]\nEuler was featured on the sixth series of the Swiss 10-[[Swiss franc|franc]] banknote and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian postage stamps.

He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and [[Mathematical notation|notation]], particularly for [[mathematical analysis]], such as the notion of a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]].<ref name=\"function\"/> He is also known for his work in [[mechanics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[optics]], [[astronomy]] and [[music theory]].<ref name=eulerarch/>\n\nEuler was one of the most eminent mathematicians of the 18th century and is held to be one of the greatest in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific, as his collected works fill 92 volumes,<ref>https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/wxg/EulerLect.pdf</ref> more than anyone else in the field. He spent most of his adult life in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and in [[Berlin]], then the capital of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].\n\nA statement attributed to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] expresses Euler's influence on mathematics: \"Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all.\"<ref name=\"Laplace\"/><ref name=libri/>\n\n==Early life==\nLeonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707, in [[Basel]], Switzerland, to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the [[Reformed Church]], and Marguerite n\u00e9e Brucker, another pastor's daughter. He had two younger sisters, Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother, Johann Heinrich.<ref name=Calinger>{{Cite book| last = Calinger | first = Ronald S. | title = Leonhard Euler: Mathematical Genius in the Enlightenment | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2015 | page = 11 | isbn = 978-0-691-11927-4}}</ref> Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Eulers moved from Basel to the town of [[Riehen]], Switzerland, where Leonhard spent most of his childhood. Paul was a friend of the [[Bernoulli family]]; [[Johann Bernoulli]], then regarded as Europe's foremost mathematician, would eventually be the most important influence on young Leonhard.\n\nEuler's formal education started in Basel, where he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720, at age thirteen, he enrolled at the [[University of Basel]]. In 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. During that time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics.<ref name=\"childhood\"/> At that time Euler's main studies included theology, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at his father's urging to become a pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician.\n\nIn 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the [[Speed of sound|propagation of sound]] with the title ''De Sono''.<ref name=17cent/> At that time, he was unsuccessfully attempting to obtain a position at the University of Basel. In 1727, he first entered the ''[[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy]] Prize Problem'' competition; the problem that year was to find the best way to place the [[mast (sailing)|masts]] on a ship. [[Pierre Bouguer]], who became known as \"the father of naval architecture\", won and Euler took second place. Euler later won this annual prize twelve times.<ref name=\"prize\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Saint Petersburg===\nAround this time Johann Bernoulli's two sons, [[Daniel Bernoulli|Daniel]] and [[Nicolaus II Bernoulli|Nicolaus]], were working at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of appendicitis after spending less than a year in Russia.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/hmat.1996.0015|title=Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727\u20131741)|journal=Historia Mathematica|volume=23|issue=2|pages=121\u2013166|year=1996|last1=Calinger|first1=Ronald}}</ref><ref name=mactutor>{{cite web | last1 =O'Connor | first1 = John J. | last2 =Robertson | first2 = Edmund F. | title=Nicolaus (II) Bernoulli| website = MacTutor History of Mathematics archive | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]] |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Nicolaus%28II%29.html| accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref> When Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler. In November 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.<ref name=\"stpetersburg\"/>\n\n[[Image:1957 CPA 2000.jpg|thumb|left|1957 [[Soviet Union]] stamp commemorating the 250th birthday of Euler. The text says: 250 years from the birth of the great mathematician, academician Leonhard Euler.]]\nEuler arrived in Saint Petersburg on 17 May 1727. He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he often worked in close collaboration. Euler mastered Russian and settled into life in Saint Petersburg. He also took on an additional job as a medic in the [[Russian Navy]].<ref name=\"medic\"/>\n\nThe Academy at Saint Petersburg, established by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler. The academy possessed ample financial resources and a comprehensive library drawn from the private libraries of Peter himself and of the nobility. Very few students were enrolled in the academy to lessen the faculty's teaching burden. The academy emphasized research and offered to its faculty both the time and the freedom to pursue scientific questions.<ref name=\"prize\"/>\n\nThe Academy's benefactress, [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]], who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband, died on the day of Euler's arrival. The Russian nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. The nobility, suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, cut funding and caused other difficulties for Euler and his colleagues.\n\nConditions improved slightly after the death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department.<ref name=\"promotion\"/>\n\nOn 7 January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707\u20131773), a daughter of [[Georg Gsell]], a painter from the Academy Gymnasium.<ref name=gekker/> The young couple bought a house by the [[Neva River]]. Of their thirteen children, only five survived childhood.<ref name=\"wife\"/>\n\n===Berlin===\n[[Image:Euler GDR stamp.jpg|thumb|left|Stamp of the former [[German Democratic Republic]] honoring Euler on the 200th anniversary of his death. Across the centre it shows his [[Planar graph#Euler's formula|polyhedral formula]], in English written as&nbsp;\"''v''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''e''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''f''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2\".]]\n\nConcerned about the continuing turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg on 19 June 1741 to take up a post at the ''[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]]'', which he had been offered by [[Frederick the Great of Prussia]]. He lived for 25 years in [[Berlin]], where he wrote over 380 articles. In Berlin, he published the two works for which he would become most renowned: the ''[[Introductio in analysin infinitorum]]'', a text on functions published in 1748, and the ''[[Institutiones calculi differentialis]]'',<ref name=dartm/> published in 1755 on [[differential calculus]].<ref name=\"Friedrich\"/> In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\nIn addition, Euler was asked to tutor [[Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt]], the Princess of [[Anhalt-Dessau]] and Frederick's niece. Euler wrote over 200 letters to her in the early 1760s, which were later compiled into a best-selling volume entitled ''[[Letters to a German Princess|Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess]]''.<ref name='Digital Copy of \"Letters to a German Princess\"'/> This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics, as well as offering valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. This book became more widely read than any of his mathematical works and was published across Europe and in the United States. The popularity of the \"Letters\" testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.<ref name=\"Friedrich\"/>\n\nDespite Euler's immense contribution to the Academy's prestige, he eventually incurred the ire of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick]] and ended up having to leave Berlin. The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court, and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and ill-informed on matters beyond numbers and figures. Euler was a simple, devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs, in many ways the polar opposite of [[Voltaire]], who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick's court. Euler was not a skilled debater and often made it a point to argue subjects that he knew little about, making him the frequent target of Voltaire's wit.<ref name=\"Friedrich\"/> Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities:\n\n{{quote|I wanted to have a water jet in my garden: Euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir, from where it should fall back through channels, finally spurting out in [[Sanssouci]]. My mill was carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer than fifty paces to the reservoir. Vanity of vanities! Vanity of geometry!<ref name=fredlett/>}}\n\n==Personal life==\n===Eyesight deterioration===\nEuler's [[eyesight]] worsened throughout his mathematical career. In 1738, three years after nearly expiring from fever, he became almost blind in his right eye, but Euler rather blamed the painstaking work on [[cartography]] he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy for his condition. Euler's vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, to the extent that Frederick referred to him as \"[[Cyclopes|Cyclops]]\". Euler remarked on his loss of vision, \"Now I will have fewer distractions.\"<ref name=\"Richeson2012\">{{cite book|author=David S.

Just a few weeks after its discovery, a failed surgical restoration rendered him almost totally blind. He was 59 years old then. However, his condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity, as he compensated for it with his mental calculation skills and exceptional memory. For example, Euler could repeat the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Virgil]] from beginning to end without hesitation, and for every page in the edition he could indicate which line was the first and which the last. With the aid of his scribes, Euler's productivity on many areas of study actually increased. He produced, on average, one mathematical paper every week in the year 1775.<ref name=\"volumes\"/> The Eulers bore a double name, Euler-Sch\u00f6lpi, the latter of which derives from ''schelb'' and ''schief'', signifying squint-eyed, cross-eyed, or crooked. This suggests that the Eulers may have had a susceptibility to eye problems.<ref>{{cite book |last=Calinger |first=Ronald |date=2016 |title=Leonhard Euler mathematical genius in the Enlightenment |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10531.html |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=8 |isbn=978-1-4008-6663-2 }}</ref>\n\n===Return to Russia and death===\nIn 1760, with the [[Seven Years' War]] raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked by advancing Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, [[Ivan Saltykov|General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov]] paid compensation for the damage caused to Euler's estate, with [[Empress Elizabeth]] of Russia later adding a further payment of 4000 roubles\u2014an exorbitant amount at the time.<ref>Gindikin, S.G., \u0413\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043d \u0421. \u0413., \u041c\u0426\u041d\u041c\u041e, \u041d\u041c\u0423, 2001, \u0441. 217.</ref> The political situation in Russia stabilized after [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great's]] accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant\u2014a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. All of these requests were granted. He spent the rest of his life in Russia. However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage.\n\nThree years after his wife's death, Euler married her half-sister, Salome Abigail Gsell (1723\u20131794).<ref name=gekker2/> This marriage lasted until his death. In 1782 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>[https://www.amacad.org/sites/default/files/academy/multimedia/pdfs/publications/bookofmembers/ChapterE.pdf Leonhard Euler], in the Book of members of the AAAS.</ref> \n\nIn St. Petersburg on 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, Euler was discussing the newly discovered planet [[Uranus]] and its [[orbit]] with a fellow [[academician]] [[Anders Johan Lexell]], when he collapsed from a [[brain hemorrhage]]. He died a few hours later.<ref name=\"euler\"/> [[:de:Jacob von Staehlin|Jacob von Staehlin-Storcksburg]] wrote a short obituary for the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and Russian mathematician [[Nicolas Fuss]], one of Euler's disciples, wrote a more detailed eulogy,<ref name=novaacta/> which he delivered at a memorial meeting. In his eulogy for the French Academy, French mathematician and philosopher [[Marquis de Condorcet]], wrote:\n\n{{quote|''il cessa de calculer et de vivre''\u2014 ... he ceased to calculate and to live.<ref name=condorcet/>}}\n\n[[Image:Euler Grave at Alexander Nevsky Monastry.jpg|thumb|left|Euler's grave at the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra|Alexander Nevsky Monastery]]]]\nEuler was buried next to Katharina at the [[Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery]] on [[Goloday Island]]. In 1785, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] put a marble bust of Leonhard Euler on a pedestal next to the Director's seat and, in 1837, placed a headstone on Euler's grave. To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Euler's birth, the headstone was moved in 1956, together with his remains, to the [[Lazarevskoe Cemetery (Saint Petersburg)|18th-century necropolis]] at the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra|Alexander Nevsky Monastery]].\n\n==Contributions to mathematics and physics==\n{{E (mathematical constant)}}\nEuler worked in almost all areas of mathematics, such as [[geometry]], [[infinitesimal]] [[calculus]], [[trigonometry]], [[algebra]], and [[number theory]], as well as [[continuum physics]], [[lunar theory]] and other areas of [[physics]]. He is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 [[quarto (text)|quarto]] volumes.<ref name=\"volumes\"/> Euler's name is associated with a [[List of topics named after Leonhard Euler|large number of topics]].\n\nEuler is the only mathematician to have ''two'' numbers named after him: the important [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]] in [[calculus]], ''e'', approximately equal to 2.71828, and the [[Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant]] \u03b3 ([[gamma]]) sometimes referred to as just \"Euler's constant\", approximately equal to 0.57721. It is not known whether \u03b3 is [[Rational number|rational]] or [[Irrational number|irrational]].<ref name=derbysh/>\n<!-- The biography could use more correlation with his mathematical activities. When was his most prolific period and discoveries, and how did they fit in with his general life? -->\n\n===Mathematical notation===\nEuler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a [[function (mathematics)|function]]<ref name=\"function\"/> and was the first to write ''f''(''x'') to denote the function ''f'' applied to the argument ''x''. He also introduced the modern notation for the [[trigonometric functions]], the letter {{math|''e''}} for the base of the [[natural logarithm]] (now also known as [[Euler's number]]), the Greek letter [[Sigma|\u03a3]] for summations and the letter {{math|''i''}} to denote the [[imaginary unit]].<ref name=Boyer/> The use of the Greek letter ''[[pi (letter)|\u03c0]]'' to denote the [[pi|ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter]] was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with [[Welsh people|Welsh]] mathematician [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]].<ref name=\"pi\">{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematical-notation-past-future/| title = Mathematical Notation: Past and Future| accessdate=23 September 2014| last = Wolfram| first = Stephen}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nThe development of [[infinitesimal calculus]] was at the forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoullis]]\u2014family friends of Euler\u2014were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of [[mathematical rigor|mathematical rigour]]<ref name = \"Basel\"/> (in particular his reliance on the principle of the [[generality of algebra]]), his ideas led to many great advances.\nEuler is well known in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] for his frequent use and development of [[power series]], the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as\n\n:<math>e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty {x^n \\over n!} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{0!} + \\frac{x}{1!} + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\cdots + \\frac{x^n}{n!}\\right).</math>\n\nNotably, Euler directly proved the power series expansions for {{math|''e''}} and the [[inverse tangent]] function. (Indirect proof via the inverse power series technique was given by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] between 1670 and 1680.) His daring use of power series enabled him to solve the famous [[Basel problem]] in 1735 (he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741):<ref name=\"Basel\"/>\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {1 \\over n^2} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{1^2} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi ^2}{6}.</math>\n\n[[Image:Euler's formula.svg|thumb|A geometric interpretation of [[Euler's formula]]]]\n\nEuler introduced the use of the [[exponential function]] and [[logarithms]] in analytic proofs. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series, and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and [[complex number]]s, thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms.<ref name=Boyer/> He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers, and discovered its relation to the [[trigonometric function]]s. For any [[real number]] [[\u03c6|{{math|\u03c6}}]] (taken to be radians), [[Euler's formula]] states that the [[Exponential function#On the complex plane|complex exponential]] function satisfies\n\n:<math>e^{i\\varphi} = \\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi.</math>\n\nA special case of the above formula is known as [[Euler's identity]],\n:<math>e^{i \\pi} +1 = 0 </math>\ncalled \"the most remarkable formula in mathematics\" by [[Richard P. Feynman]], for its single uses of the notions of addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and equality, and the single uses of the important constants 0, 1, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''i''}} and {{pi}}.<ref name=\"Feynman\"/> In 1988, readers of the ''[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' voted it \"the Most Beautiful Mathematical Formula Ever\".<ref name=MathInt/> In total, Euler was responsible for three of the top five formulae in that poll.<ref name=MathInt/>\n\n[[De Moivre's formula]] is a direct consequence of [[Euler's formula]].\n\nIn addition, Euler elaborated the theory of higher [[transcendental function]]s by introducing the [[gamma function]] and introduced a new method for solving [[quartic equation]]s. He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern [[complex analysis]]. He also invented the [[calculus of variations]] including its best-known result, the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]].\n\nEuler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, [[analytic number theory]]. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of [[Generalized hypergeometric series|hypergeometric series]], [[q-series]], [[hyperbolic functions|hyperbolic trigonometric functions]] and the analytic theory of [[generalized continued fraction|continued fractions]]. For example, he proved the [[infinitude of primes]] using the divergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way [[prime numbers]] are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the [[prime number theorem]].<ref name=\"analysis\"/>\n\n===Number theory===\nEuler's interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of [[Christian Goldbach]], his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy. A lot of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the works of [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas and disproved some of his conjectures.\n\nEuler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that [[Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges|the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges]]. In doing so, he discovered the connection between the [[Riemann zeta function]] and the prime numbers; this is known as the [[Proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function|Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function]].\n\nEuler proved [[Newton's identities]], [[Fermat's little theorem]], [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]], and he made distinct contributions to [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]]. He also invented the [[totient function]] \u03c6(''n''), the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer ''n'' that are [[coprime]] to ''n''. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as [[Euler's theorem]]. He contributed significantly to the theory of [[perfect number]]s, which had fascinated mathematicians since [[Euclid]]. He proved that the relationship shown between even perfect numbers and [[Mersenne prime]]s earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the [[Euclid\u2013Euler theorem]]. Euler also conjectured the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]]. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].<ref name=\"numbertheory\"/>\nBy 1772 Euler had proved that 2<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 = [[2147483647|2,147,483,647]] is a Mersenne prime. It may have remained the [[largest known prime]] until 1867.<ref name=caldwell/>\n\n===Graph theory===\n[[Image:Konigsberg bridges.png|frame|right|Map of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in Euler's time showing the actual layout of the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg|seven bridges]], highlighting the river Pregel and the bridges.]]\nIn 1735, Euler presented a solution to the problem known as the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]].<ref name=\"bridge\"/> The city of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was set on the [[Pregel]] River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no [[Eulerian path|Eulerian circuit]]. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of [[graph theory]], specifically of [[planar graph]] theory.<ref name=\"bridge\"/>\n\nEuler also discovered the [[Planar graph#Euler's formula|formula]] <math>V - E + F = 2</math> relating the number of vertices, edges and faces of a [[Convex polytope|convex polyhedron]],<ref name=cromw/> and hence of a [[planar graph]]. The constant in this formula is now known as the [[Euler characteristic]] for the graph (or other mathematical object), and is related to the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of the object.<ref name=gibbons/> The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]<ref name=\"Cauchy\"/> and [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huilier|L'Huilier]],<ref name=\"Lhuillier\"/> is at the origin of [[topology]].\n\n===Applied mathematics===\nSome of Euler's greatest successes were in solving real-world problems analytically, and in describing numerous applications of the [[Bernoulli numbers]], [[Fourier series]], [[Euler number]]s, the constants [[E (mathematical constant)|{{math|e}}]] and [[pi|{{pi}}]], continued fractions and integrals. He integrated [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[differential calculus]] with Newton's [[Method of Fluxions]], and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. He made great strides in improving the [[numerical approximation]] of integrals, inventing what are now known as the [[Euler approximations]]. The most notable of these approximations are [[Euler's method]] and the [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula]]. He also facilitated the use of [[differential equations]], in particular introducing the [[Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant]]:\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty } \\left( 1+ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n} - \\ln(n) \\right).</math>\n\nOne of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae,'' hoping to eventually incorporate [[musical theory]] as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.<ref name=\"music\"/>\n\nIn 1911, almost 130 years after Euler's death, [[Alfred J. Lotka]] used Euler's work to derive the [[Euler\u2013Lotka equation]] for calculating rates of population growth for age-structured populations, a fundamental method that is commonly used in population biology and ecology. \n\n===Physics and astronomy===\n{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}\nEuler helped develop the [[Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam equation]], which became a cornerstone of engineering. Aside from successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in [[classical mechanics]], Euler also applied these techniques to celestial problems. His work in astronomy was recognized by a number of Paris Academy Prizes over the course of his career. His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the [[solar parallax|parallax]] of the Sun. His calculations also contributed to the development of accurate [[History of longitude|longitude tables]].<ref name=yousch/>\n\nIn addition, Euler made important contributions in [[optics]]. He disagreed with Newton's [[corpuscular theory of light]] in the ''[[Opticks]]'', which was then the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the [[wave theory of light]] proposed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the [[wave-particle duality|quantum theory of light]].<ref name=\"optics\"/>\n\nIn 1757 he published an important set of equations for [[inviscid flow]], that are now known as the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].<ref name=euler2/> In differential form, the equations are:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n&{\\partial\\rho\\over\\partial t}+\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\rho\\mathbf u)=0\\\\[1.2ex]\n&{\\partial(\\rho{\\mathbf u})\\over\\partial t}+\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf u\\otimes(\\rho \\mathbf u))+\\nabla p=\\mathbf{0}\\\\[1.2ex]\n&{\\partial E\\over\\partial t}+\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\mathbf u(E+p))=0,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n* ''\u03c1'' is the fluid [[mass density]],\n* '''''u''''' is the fluid [[velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components ''u'', ''v'', and ''w'',\n* ''E'' = ''\u03c1 e'' + \u00bd ''\u03c1'' (''u''<sup>2</sup> + ''v''<sup>2</sup> + ''w''<sup>2</sup>) is the total energy per unit [[volume]], with ''e'' being the [[internal energy]] per unit mass for the fluid,\n* ''p'' is the [[pressure]],\n* ''\u2297'' denotes the [[tensor product]], and\n* '''0''' being the [[zero vector]].\n\nEuler is also well known in structural engineering for his formula giving the critical [[buckling]] load of an ideal strut, which depends only on its length and flexural stiffness:<ref name=\"SIAM\"/>\n:<math>F=\\frac{\\pi^2 EI}{(KL)^2}</math>\n\nwhere\n* ''F'' = maximum or critical [[force]] (vertical load on column),\n* ''E'' = [[modulus of elasticity]],\n* ''I'' = [[area moment of inertia]],\n* ''L'' = unsupported length of column,\n* ''K'' = column effective length factor, whose value depends on the conditions of end support of the column, as follows.\n::For both ends pinned (hinged, free to rotate), ''K'' = 1.0.\n::For both ends fixed, ''K'' = 0.50.\n::For one end fixed and the other end pinned, ''K'' = 0.699\u2026\n::For one end fixed and the other end free to move laterally, ''K'' = 2.0.\n* ''K L'' is the effective length of the column.\n\n===Logic===\nEuler is also credited with using [[closed curve]]s to illustrate [[syllogism|syllogistic]] reasoning (1768). These diagrams have become known as [[Euler diagram]]s.<ref name=\"logic\"/>\n[[File:Euler Diagram.svg|thumb|169x169px|Euler's diagram]]\n\nAn Euler diagram is a [[diagram]]matic means of representing [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and their relationships. Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) in the plane that depict [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or \"zones\": the interior, which symbolically represents the [[element (mathematics)|elements]] of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set.  The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap. The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to set-theoretic relationships ([[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], [[subset]] and [[Disjoint sets|disjointness]]).   Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent [[disjoint sets]].  Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the sets).  A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a [[subset]] of it. Euler diagrams (and their generalization in [[Venn diagram]]s) were incorporated as part of instruction in [[set theory]] as part of the [[new math]] movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading.<ref name=quest/>\n\n===Music===\nEven when dealing with music, Euler's approach is mainly mathematical. His writings on music are not particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages), but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that did not leave him throughout his life.<ref>Peter Pesic, ''Music and the Making of Modern Science'', p.&nbsp;133.</ref>\n\nA first point of Euler's musical theory is the definition of \"genres\", i.e. of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5. Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2<sup>m</sup>A, where A is the \"exponent\" of the genre (i.e. the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5) and 2<sup>m</sup> (where \"m is an indefinite number, small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible\"<ref>Leonhard Euler, ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae'', St Petersburg, 1739, p.&nbsp;115</ref>), expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned. The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second genre, 2<sup>m</sup>.3, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C\u2013G\u2013C); the third genre is 2<sup>m</sup>.5, major third + minor sixth (C\u2013E\u2013C); the fourth is 2<sup>m</sup>.3<sup>2</sup>, two-fourths and a tone (C\u2013F\u2013B{{music|b}}\u2013C); the fifth is 2<sup>m</sup>.3.5 (C\u2013E\u2013G\u2013B\u2013C); etc. Genres 12 (2<sup>m</sup>.3<sup>3</sup>.5), 13 (2<sup>m</sup>.3<sup>2</sup>.5<sup>2</sup>) and 14 (2<sup>m</sup>.3.5<sup>3</sup>) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients. Genre 18 (2<sup>m</sup>.3<sup>3</sup>.5<sup>2</sup>) is the \"diatonico-chromatic\", \"used generally in all compositions\",<ref>Eric Emery, ''Temps et musique'', Lausanne, L'\u00c2ge d'homme, 2000, pp. 344\u201345.</ref> and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson.<ref>Johannes Mattheson, ''Grosse General-Ba\u00df-Schule'', Hamburg, 1731, Vol. I, pp.&nbsp;104\u201306, mentioned by Euler; and ''Exemplarische Organisten-Probe'', Hamburg, 1719, pp.&nbsp;57\u201359.</ref> Euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7.<ref>Wilfrid Perret, ''Some Questions of Musical Theory'', Cambridge, 1926, pp.&nbsp;60\u201362; \"What is an Euler-Fokker genus?\", http://www.huygens-fokker.org/microtonality/efg.html.

Retrieved 12 June 2015.</ref>\n\n==Personal philosophy and religious beliefs==\nEuler and his friend [[Daniel Bernoulli]] were opponents of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz's]] [[monadism]] and the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. Euler insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide. Euler's religious leanings might also have had a bearing on his dislike of the doctrine; he went so far as to label Wolff's ideas as \"heathen and atheistic\".<ref name=\"wolff\"/>\n\nMuch of what is known of Euler's religious beliefs can be deduced from his ''[[Letters to a German Princess]]'' and an earlier work, ''Rettung der G\u00f6ttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einw\u00fcrfe der Freygeister'' (''Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers''). These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the ''Rettung'' was primarily an argument for the [[Biblical inspiration|divine inspiration of scripture]].<ref name=\"theology\"/>\n\nThere is a famous legend<ref name=\"diderot\"/> inspired by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, which is set during Euler's second stint at the St. Petersburg Academy. The French philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation. However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for [[atheism]] were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman. Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the [[existence of God]]: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court. Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in a tone of perfect conviction announced this [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]]: \"Sir, {{sfrac|''a+b<sup>n</sup>''|''n''}}=''x'', hence God exists\u2014reply!\"\nDiderot, to whom (says the story) all mathematics was gibberish, stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court.  Embarrassed, he asked to leave Russia, a request that was graciously granted by the Empress. However amusing the anecdote may be, it is [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]], given that Diderot himself did research in mathematics.<ref name=persee/>\nThe legend was apparently first told by\nDieudonn\u00e9 Thi\u00e9bault<ref name=\"brown\"/> with significant embellishment by [[Augustus De Morgan]].<ref name=\"Struik\"/><ref name=\"gillings\"/>\n\n==Commemorations==\n[[Image:Euler-10 Swiss Franc banknote (front).jpg|thumb|Euler on the Old Swiss [[Swiss Franc|10 Franc]] banknote]]\nEuler was featured on the sixth series of the Swiss 10-[[Swiss franc|franc]] banknote and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian postage stamps. The [[asteroid]] [[2002 Euler]] was named in his honor. He is also commemorated by the [[Lutheran Church]] on their [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] on 24 May\u2014he was a devout Christian (and believer in [[biblical inerrancy]]) who wrote [[apologetics]] and argued forcefully against the prominent atheists of his time.<ref name=\"theology\"/>\n\n==Selected bibliography==\nEuler has an [[Contributions of Leonhard Euler to mathematics#Works|extensive bibliography]].

Under Article 48, this vote by a majority of the ''Reichstag'' members invalidated the presidential decree. Faced with a breakdown of parliamentary rule at a time when the economic situation demanded action, Br\u00fcning asked Hindenburg to dissolve parliament and call for new elections. The ''Reichstag'' was accordingly dissolved on 18 July and new elections were scheduled for 14 September 1930.<ref>Under the constitution, new elections had to be held within 60 days of the dissolution</ref><ref>Historians have not been kind to Br\u00fcning. According to Maehl (p 168), the Chancellor \"foolishly\" dissolved the Reichstag as a result of the financial imbroglio. The decision to dissolve parliament was, in Kershaw's phrase, one of \"breathtaking irresponsibility.\" Br\u00fcning had stunningly misjudged the discontent and anger within the country. It is difficult to avoid the conclusions that (a) the democratic processes{{mdash}}namely, parliamentary negotiation to achieve a working majority, either on a single piece of legislation or on a legislative program{{mdash}}were just too difficult for this cast of characters and (b) the parties were too parochial and self-interested to cooperate in the greater interests of the whole (Kershaw, Vol 1, pp. 324\u2013325; Hubris, pp. 73\u201375;  Collier, p. 167). Collier maintains that this single act{{mdash}}the dissolution in the face of a legitimate exercise by the Parliamentary body of its constitutional authority{{mdash}}was one of them most crucial steps in the Nazi rise to power, as it demonstrated the contempt in which the President and his advisers held the concept of democracy and the function of the Reichstag. \"It ... marks the shift from parliamentary ... to presidential government ... [which] gave the Nazis a 'legal' route to success that Hitler so needed\" (Collier and Pedley, p. 167).</ref>\n\nThe election produced increased representation in the Reichstag for both the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] and, most dramatically, for the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], at the expense of the moderate middle-class parties.<ref>''See'' [[1930 German federal election|Election Results]]. The Nazis increased their seats from a pitiful 12 to a respectable 107, out of a total of 577, becoming the second largest party in the Reichstag as a result; only the Social Democrats were larger at 143 seats.</ref> Forming a parliamentary majority became even more difficult for Br\u00fcning.  In fact, just to conduct the normal business of government, he was forced to invoke Article 48 several times between 1930 and 1932. Subsequent governments under chancellors [[Franz von Papen]] and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] during the tumultuous year 1932 obtained decrees from Hindenburg under Article 48 when they too found it impossible to obtain a parliamentary majority as the extremist parties on the left and right gained power.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe invocation of Article 48 by successive governments helped seal the fate of the Weimar Republic. While Br\u00fcning's first invocation of a ''Notverordnung'' may have been well-intentioned, the power to rule by decree became increasingly used not in response to a specific emergency but as a substitute for parliamentary leadership. The excessive use of the decree power and the fact that successive chancellors were no longer responsible to the ''Reichstag'' probably played a significant part in the loss of public confidence in constitutional democracy, in turn leading to the rise of the extremist parties.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Nazi use===\nOn 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler was named Chancellor. Lacking a majority in the ''Reichstag'', Hitler formed a coalition with the national conservative [[German National People's Party]] (German: Deutschnationale Volkspartei, DNVP). Not long afterwards, he called [[German federal election, March 1933|elections]] for 5 March. Six days before the election, on 27 February, the [[Reichstag fire]] damaged the house of Parliament in Berlin. Claiming that the fire was the first step in a [[Communist]] revolution, the Nazis used the fire as a pretext to get the President, Hindenburg, to sign the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], officially the ''[[:de:Reichstagsbrandverordnung|Verordnung des Reichspr\u00e4sidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat]]'' (Presidential Decree for the Protection of People and State).{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nUnder the decree, issued on the basis of Article 48, the government was given authority to curtail constitutional rights including habeas corpus, free expression of opinion, freedom of the press, rights of assembly, and the privacy of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications. Constitutional restrictions on searches and confiscation of property were likewise suspended.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe Reichstag Fire Decree was one of the first steps the Nazis took toward the establishment of a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[dictatorship]] in Germany. With several key government posts in the hands of Nazis and with the constitutional protections on civil liberties suspended by the decree, the Nazis were able to use their control of the police to intimidate and arrest their opposition, in particular the Communists. Due to the use of Article 48, this repression had the mark of legality.\n\nThe 5 March elections gave the Nazi-DNVP coalition a narrow majority in the ''Reichstag''.  Nonetheless, the Nazis were able to maneuver on 23 March 1933 the passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] by the required two-thirds parliamentary majority, effectively abrogating the authority of the Reichstag and placing its authority in the hands of the Cabinet (in effect, the Chancellor). This had the effect of giving Hitler dictatorial powers.\n\nOver the years, Hitler used Article 48 to give his dictatorship the stamp of legality. Thousands of his decrees were based explicitly on the Reichstag Fire Decree, and hence on Article 48, allowing Hitler to rule under what amounted to martial law. This was a major reason why Hitler never formally repealed the Weimar Constitution, though it had effectively been rendered a dead letter with the passage of the Enabling Act.\n\n===Lessons learned===\nThe misuse of Article 48 was fresh in the minds of the framers of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]].  They decided to significantly curb the powers of the [[President of Germany|president]], to the point that he, unlike his Weimar predecessor, has little de facto executive power. Also, to prevent a government from being forced to rely on decrees to carry on normal business, they stipulated that a chancellor may only be removed from office via a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. That is, a chancellor can only be voted out of office if his prospective successor already commands a majority.\n\n==Text==\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n| width=\"50%\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" valign=\"top\" align=\"center\" | '''Artikel 48'''\n| width=\"50%\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" valign=\"top\" align=\"center\" | '''Article 48'''\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" valign=\"top\" | Wenn ein Land die ihm nach der Reichsverfassung oder den Reichsgesetzen obliegenden Pflichten nicht erf\u00fcllt, kann der Reichspr\u00e4sident es dazu mit Hilfe der bewaffneten Macht anhalten.\n| width=\"50%\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" valign=\"top\" | In the event of a State<ref>The German term ''Land'' translates into English most appropriately as \"state\", as Weimar Germany, like Germany under the monarchy until 1918 and the modern Federal Republic, was a federation consisting of several ''L\u00e4nder'' with some degree of autonomy.</ref> not fulfilling the duties imposed upon it by the Reich<ref>''Reich'' translates literally as \"empire\" or \"realm\".

The decision to dissolve parliament was, in Kershaw's phrase, one of \"breathtaking irresponsibility.\" Br\u00fcning had stunningly misjudged the discontent and anger within the country. It is difficult to avoid the conclusions that (a) the democratic processes{{mdash}}namely, parliamentary negotiation to achieve a working majority, either on a single piece of legislation or on a legislative program{{mdash}}were just too difficult for this cast of characters and (b) the parties were too parochial and self-interested to cooperate in the greater interests of the whole (Kershaw, Vol 1, pp. 324\u2013325; Hubris, pp. 73\u201375;  Collier, p. 167). Collier maintains that this single act{{mdash}}the dissolution in the face of a legitimate exercise by the Parliamentary body of its constitutional authority{{mdash}}was one of them most crucial steps in the Nazi rise to power, as it demonstrated the contempt in which the President and his advisers held the concept of democracy and the function of the Reichstag. \"It ... marks the shift from parliamentary ... to presidential government ... [which] gave the Nazis a 'legal' route to success that Hitler so needed\" (Collier and Pedley, p. 167).</ref>\n\nThe election produced increased representation in the Reichstag for both the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] and, most dramatically, for the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]], at the expense of the moderate middle-class parties.<ref>''See'' [[1930 German federal election|Election Results]]. The Nazis increased their seats from a pitiful 12 to a respectable 107, out of a total of 577, becoming the second largest party in the Reichstag as a result; only the Social Democrats were larger at 143 seats.</ref> Forming a parliamentary majority became even more difficult for Br\u00fcning.  In fact, just to conduct the normal business of government, he was forced to invoke Article 48 several times between 1930 and 1932. Subsequent governments under chancellors [[Franz von Papen]] and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] during the tumultuous year 1932 obtained decrees from Hindenburg under Article 48 when they too found it impossible to obtain a parliamentary majority as the extremist parties on the left and right gained power.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe invocation of Article 48 by successive governments helped seal the fate of the Weimar Republic. While Br\u00fcning's first invocation of a ''Notverordnung'' may have been well-intentioned, the power to rule by decree became increasingly used not in response to a specific emergency but as a substitute for parliamentary leadership. The excessive use of the decree power and the fact that successive chancellors were no longer responsible to the ''Reichstag'' probably played a significant part in the loss of public confidence in constitutional democracy, in turn leading to the rise of the extremist parties.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Nazi use===\nOn 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler was named Chancellor. Lacking a majority in the ''Reichstag'', Hitler formed a coalition with the national conservative [[German National People's Party]] (German: Deutschnationale Volkspartei, DNVP). Not long afterwards, he called [[German federal election, March 1933|elections]] for 5 March. Six days before the election, on 27 February, the [[Reichstag fire]] damaged the house of Parliament in Berlin. Claiming that the fire was the first step in a [[Communist]] revolution, the Nazis used the fire as a pretext to get the President, Hindenburg, to sign the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], officially the ''[[:de:Reichstagsbrandverordnung|Verordnung des Reichspr\u00e4sidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat]]'' (Presidential Decree for the Protection of People and State).{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nUnder the decree, issued on the basis of Article 48, the government was given authority to curtail constitutional rights including habeas corpus, free expression of opinion, freedom of the press, rights of assembly, and the privacy of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications. Constitutional restrictions on searches and confiscation of property were likewise suspended.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe Reichstag Fire Decree was one of the first steps the Nazis took toward the establishment of a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[dictatorship]] in Germany. With several key government posts in the hands of Nazis and with the constitutional protections on civil liberties suspended by the decree, the Nazis were able to use their control of the police to intimidate and arrest their opposition, in particular the Communists. Due to the use of Article 48, this repression had the mark of legality.\n\nThe 5 March elections gave the Nazi-DNVP coalition a narrow majority in the ''Reichstag''.  Nonetheless, the Nazis were able to maneuver on 23 March 1933 the passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] by the required two-thirds parliamentary majority, effectively abrogating the authority of the Reichstag and placing its authority in the hands of the Cabinet (in effect, the Chancellor). This had the effect of giving Hitler dictatorial powers.\n\nOver the years, Hitler used Article 48 to give his dictatorship the stamp of legality. Thousands of his decrees were based explicitly on the Reichstag Fire Decree, and hence on Article 48, allowing Hitler to rule under what amounted to martial law. This was a major reason why Hitler never formally repealed the Weimar Constitution, though it had effectively been rendered a dead letter with the passage of the Enabling Act.\n\n===Lessons learned===\nThe misuse of Article 48 was fresh in the minds of the framers of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]].  They decided to significantly curb the powers of the [[President of Germany|president]], to the point that he, unlike his Weimar predecessor, has little de facto executive power. Also, to prevent a government from being forced to rely on decrees to carry on normal business, they stipulated that a chancellor may only be removed from office via a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. That is, a chancellor can only be voted out of office if his prospective successor already commands a majority.\n\n==Text==\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n| width=\"50%\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" valign=\"top\" align=\"center\" | '''Artikel 48'''\n| width=\"50%\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" valign=\"top\" align=\"center\" | '''Article 48'''\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" style=\"background:#efefef;\" valign=\"top\" | Wenn ein Land die ihm nach der Reichsverfassung oder den Reichsgesetzen obliegenden Pflichten nicht erf\u00fcllt, kann der Reichspr\u00e4sident es dazu mit Hilfe der bewaffneten Macht anhalten.\n| width=\"50%\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" valign=\"top\" | In the event of a State<ref>The German term ''Land'' translates into English most appropriately as \"state\", as Weimar Germany, like Germany under the monarchy until 1918 and the modern Federal Republic, was a federation consisting of several ''L\u00e4nder'' with some degree of autonomy.</ref> not fulfilling the duties imposed upon it by the Reich<ref>''Reich'' translates literally as \"empire\" or \"realm\".

The main character is Andy Larkin, a mischievous youth and the self-proclaimed \"world's greatest prankster\". The show follows him as he tries to perform elaborate [[practical joke]]s, or pranks, on people in the fictional town of East Gackle.\n\nAndy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His antagonists include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. Andy has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney and usually tries to impress her. He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] when the [[freeze frame shot|screen freezes]] in [[black and white]] \u2013 a distinctive feature of the show referred to as \"Doodle Vision\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/new-cinegroupe-series-coming-teletoon-and-fox-family-channel|title=New Cinegroupe Series Coming To Teletoon And Fox Family Channel.|website=Animation World Network}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe first season of ''What's with Andy?'' was set in the United States. In the second and third seasons, the show was relocated to [[Alberta]]. It is shown in the episode \"Rhyme Time\" that the characters lived in the U.S. because of the [[History of the United States|American history]] that Andy recited, and the second language they were taught was Spanish rather than French, which is taught as a second language in Canada. In the episode \"Gnome for the Holidays\", a building can be seen saying, \"US Post Office\". Also, an American flag can be seen in the mayor's office in the \"Wag the Kid\" and \"Little Foot\" episodes, and in the episode \"It Came from East Gackle\", FBI agents came to East Gackle.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Andrew \"Andy\" Larkin===\nAndy loves to prank people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is \"Check, please!\".\n\n===Daniel \"Danny\" Tadeus Pickett===\nThe best friend and Andy's right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks. His last name has always been [[Pickett (disambiguation)|Pickett]]. The name \"Danny Pickett\" is derived from [[Jim Kjelgaard|Jim Kjelgaard's]] ''[[Big Red (film)|Big Red]]''.\n\n===Lori Mackney===\nAndy's crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy's feelings and dislikes Jen because Lori thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a green tank top, blue skirt and sandals. She is known as \"Lisa\" in the books.\n\n===The Larkin family===\n* '''Alfred \"Al\" Larkin''': Andy and Jen's father and Freida's husband and presumably \"The Mystery Prankster\", aka \"The Mystery Prankster of East Gackle\".\n* '''Frieda Larkin''': Andy and Jen's mother and Al's wife.\n* '''Jennifer \"Jen\" Larkin''': Andy's older sister who is always cranky and irritable. She blames her younger brother Andy for almost everything. She claims that his pranks are childish and unfunny.\n* '''Spank Larkin''': Andy's fat and lazy dog. Spank frequently yawns, especially after going for a walk.\n\n===Recurring/minor characters===\n* '''Teri''': Jen's best friend.\n* '''Jervis Coltrane''': A French snob who has a crush on Lori Mackney and dreams of being the Prime Minister of Canada.\n* '''Peter Lik and Andrew Leech''': Peter and Andrew are Andy's and Danny's nemeses. They are usually referred to as Lik and Leech.\n* '''Craig Bennett''': Jen's crush and one of the best athletes of East Gackle.\n* '''Martin Bonwick''': He is a stereotypically nervous nerd who very often gets bullied.\n* '''Victor \"Vic\" Muskowitz (Mush)''': The pizza delivery man of East Gackle who is a good friend of Andy and Danny and he sometimes helps them with pranks.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Jr.''': A dumb police officer who is the incompetent son of Steve Rowgee Sr.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Sr.''': A police officer who is an old man, who always commands Steve Rowgee Jr. (his son) and is nicknamed the Iron Fisted Maniac.\n* '''Principal DeRosa''': He is the bad-tempered principal of the school in East Gackle and the main antagonist who is obsessed with punishing Andy.\n* '''Mr. Hutchins''': One of the many teachers at East Gackle school, Andy likes to prank him more than the other teachers.\n* '''Mayor Henry K. Roth''': The mayor of East Gackle.\n* '''Mayor Simms''': Mayor of West Gackle and Mayor Henry K. Roth's rival.\n* '''Clyde''': The janitor of the school.\n* '''Hazel Strinner''': She has a crush on Andy and Lori's protecting friend.\n* '''Louella Berman''': Frieda's best friend.\n* '''Mrs. Wibbles''': Principal DeRosa's secretary.\n* '''Norman Larkin''': Andy's grandfather and Al's father who is also a prankster, implying that the male side of the Larkin family comes from a long line of pranksters, apparently with the exception of Al, though several hints have been given that he is also a prankster, even greater than his son or father.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Voice actors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\nIt was originally an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for [[Fox Kids]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Shortly after, a TV series was developed with new voice actors, and it aired on [[Teletoon]]. The first season was produced by [[Cin\u00e9Groupe]], with the participation of [[Saban Entertainment]] in production<ref name=cmp /> and distribution ([[Saban International]]).\n\nThe main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio [[SIP Animation]] (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel [[Super RTL]]. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin's voice actor [[Ian James Corlett]], as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista International Television]].\n\nSeason 3 was a collaboration between Cin\u00e9Groupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to Cin\u00e9Groupe distribution partner HG Distribution's catalogue.<ref name=hgdistribution>{{cite web|url=https://hgagnondistribution.com/en/titles/animation/whats-andy|title=What's With Andy?|date=6 August 2015|website=HG Distribution}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n''What's with Andy?'' originally aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cinegroupe-shoots-whats-with-andy/|title=Cinegroupe shoots What's With Andy?|publisher=}}</ref> In Australia, where [[Just!

The main character is Andy Larkin, a mischievous youth and the self-proclaimed \"world's greatest prankster\". The show follows him as he tries to perform elaborate [[practical joke]]s, or pranks, on people in the fictional town of East Gackle.\n\nAndy's best friend, Danny Pickett, helps him out with almost every prank. His antagonists include his older sister, Jen Larkin, and the bullies Peter Lik and Andrew Leech. Andy has a crush on a girl named Lori Mackney and usually tries to impress her. He often breaks the [[fourth wall]] when the [[freeze frame shot|screen freezes]] in [[black and white]] \u2013 a distinctive feature of the show referred to as \"Doodle Vision\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/news/new-cinegroupe-series-coming-teletoon-and-fox-family-channel|title=New Cinegroupe Series Coming To Teletoon And Fox Family Channel.|website=Animation World Network}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe first season of ''What's with Andy?'' was set in the United States. In the second and third seasons, the show was relocated to [[Alberta]]. It is shown in the episode \"Rhyme Time\" that the characters lived in the U.S. because of the [[History of the United States|American history]] that Andy recited, and the second language they were taught was Spanish rather than French, which is taught as a second language in Canada. In the episode \"Gnome for the Holidays\", a building can be seen saying, \"US Post Office\". Also, an American flag can be seen in the mayor's office in the \"Wag the Kid\" and \"Little Foot\" episodes, and in the episode \"It Came from East Gackle\", FBI agents came to East Gackle.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Andrew \"Andy\" Larkin===\nAndy loves to prank people as well as annoy his friends and family (especially his sister), but often gets into trouble. His best friend is Danny and he has a crush on Lori. His catchphrase is \"Check, please!\".\n\n===Daniel \"Danny\" Tadeus Pickett===\nThe best friend and Andy's right-hand man, helping him out with countless pranks. His last name has always been [[Pickett (disambiguation)|Pickett]]. The name \"Danny Pickett\" is derived from [[Jim Kjelgaard|Jim Kjelgaard's]] ''[[Big Red (film)|Big Red]]''.\n\n===Lori Mackney===\nAndy's crush but she is dismayed by his childishness due to his pranking. It is hinted that she returns Andy's feelings and dislikes Jen because Lori thinks that Jen abuses Andy. She wears a green tank top, blue skirt and sandals. She is known as \"Lisa\" in the books.\n\n===The Larkin family===\n* '''Alfred \"Al\" Larkin''': Andy and Jen's father and Freida's husband and presumably \"The Mystery Prankster\", aka \"The Mystery Prankster of East Gackle\".\n* '''Frieda Larkin''': Andy and Jen's mother and Al's wife.\n* '''Jennifer \"Jen\" Larkin''': Andy's older sister who is always cranky and irritable; she blames her younger brother Andy for almost everything.\n* '''Spank Larkin''': Andy's fat and lazy dog. Spank frequently yawns, especially after going for a walk.\n\n===Recurring/minor characters===\n* '''Teri''': Jen's best friend.\n* '''Jervis Coltrane''': A French snob who has a crush on Lori Mackney and dreams of being the Prime Minister of Canada.\n* '''Peter Lik and Andrew Leech''': Peter and Andrew are Andy's and Danny's nemeses. They are usually referred to as Lik and Leech.\n* '''Craig Bennett''': Jen's crush and one of the best athletes of East Gackle.\n* '''Martin Bonwick''': He is a stereotypically nervous nerd who very often gets bullied.\n* '''Victor \"Vic\" Muskowitz (Mush)''': The pizza delivery man of East Gackle who is a good friend of Andy and Danny and he sometimes helps them with pranks.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Jr.''': A dumb police officer who is the incompetent son of Steve Rowgee Sr.\n* '''Steve Rowgee Sr.''': A police officer who is an old man, who always commands Steve Rowgee Jr. (his son) and is nicknamed the Iron Fisted Maniac.\n* '''Principal DeRosa''': He is the bad-tempered principal of the school in East Gackle and the main antagonist who is obsessed with punishing Andy.\n* '''Mr. Hutchins''': One of the many teachers at East Gackle school, Andy likes to prank him more than the other teachers.\n* '''Mayor Henry K. Roth''': The mayor of East Gackle.\n* '''Mayor Simms''': Mayor of West Gackle and Mayor Henry K. Roth's rival.\n* '''Clyde''': The janitor of the school.\n* '''Hazel Strinner''': She has a crush on Andy and Lori's protecting friend.\n* '''Louella Berman''': Frieda's best friend.\n* '''Mrs. Wibbles''': Principal DeRosa's secretary.\n* '''Norman Larkin''': Andy's grandfather and Al's father who is also a prankster, implying that the male side of the Larkin family comes from a long line of pranksters, apparently with the exception of Al, though several hints have been given that he is also a prankster, even greater than his son or father.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Voice actors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Changes from the books to the TV series include Andy's last name, which was originally that of his creator, and other minor name changes, such as Lori's name being Lisa in the books.\n\nIt was originally an interactive [[Macromedia Flash|Flash]] movie with completely different voice actors and a promotion for [[Fox Kids]].{{cn|date=July 2018}} Shortly after, a TV series was developed with new voice actors, and it aired on [[Teletoon]]. The first season was produced by [[Cin\u00e9Groupe]], with the participation of [[Saban Entertainment]] in production<ref name=cmp /> and distribution ([[Saban International]]).\n\nThe main production of the series moved to Canada in season 2, which was co-produced with the French studio [[SIP Animation]] (itself split from Saban Entertainment) and in association with German channel [[Super RTL]]. All the voice cast had to be replaced with this move with the exception of Andy Larkin's voice actor [[Ian James Corlett]], as he was Canadian himself. As Saban Entertainment had by then been acquired by Disney, distribution of this season was handled by Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista International Television]].\n\nSeason 3 was a collaboration between Cin\u00e9Groupe and Super RTL, and distributed by the production company directly. The whole series was later added to Cin\u00e9Groupe distribution partner HG Distribution's catalogue.<ref name=hgdistribution>{{cite web|url=https://hgagnondistribution.com/en/titles/animation/whats-andy|title=What's With Andy?|date=6 August 2015|website=HG Distribution}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n''What's with Andy?'' originally aired on [[Teletoon]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c21media.net/cinegroupe-shoots-whats-with-andy/|title=Cinegroupe shoots What's With Andy?|publisher=}}</ref> In Australia, where [[Just!
