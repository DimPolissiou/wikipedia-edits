First, delegates are elected from among the attendees to represent them at the state convention, to be held Saturday\u2013Sunday, May 5\u20136, 2012. Candidates generally provide slates of delegates to voters who are interested in supporting them, and voters can ask prospective delegates whom they support for president. Then, a [[straw poll]], called a presidential preference ballot, is taken of the individuals in the room. The results of this vote are transmitted to the media, which uses the information to report the opinions of Maine Republicans to the public; and to assign delegates to the candidates, although the aforementioned state convention is what determines who actually goes to the [[2012 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. No delegates from Maine are pledged to any candidate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2pj4f/MRP%20Training/How%20Republicans%20Will%20Express%20Presidential%20Preference%20In%20Maine%20-%20final.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912182007/http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2pj4f/MRP%20Training/How%20Republicans%20Will%20Express%20Presidential%20Preference%20In%20Maine%20-%20final.pdf |archivedate=September 12, 2008 |title=How Republicans Will Express Presidential Preference In Maine |publisher=Maine Republican Party |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n===Results===\n\n====Caucuses held by Saturday, February 11====\nAs of February 11, 98 precincts (16.3%) had yet to report.

First, delegates are elected from among the attendees to represent them at the state convention, to be held Saturday\u2013Sunday, May 5\u20136, 2012. Candidates generally provide slates of delegates to voters who are interested in supporting them, and voters can ask prospective delegates whom they support for president. Then, a [[straw poll]], called a presidential preference ballot, is taken of the individuals in the room. The results of this vote are transmitted to the media, which uses the information to report the opinions of Maine Republicans to the public; and to assign delegates to the candidates, although the aforementioned state convention is what determines who actually goes to the [[2012 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. No delegates from Maine are pledged to any candidate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2pj4f/MRP%20Training/How%20Republicans%20Will%20Express%20Presidential%20Preference%20In%20Maine%20-%20final.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912182007/http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2pj4f/MRP%20Training/How%20Republicans%20Will%20Express%20Presidential%20Preference%20In%20Maine%20-%20final.pdf |archivedate=September 12, 2008 |title=How Republicans Will Express Presidential Preference In Maine |publisher=Maine Republican Party |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n===Results===\n\n====Caucuses held by Saturday, February 11====\nAs of February 11, 98 precincts (16.3%) had yet to report.

Furthermore, Nagoshi said this difference is shown across the series. Nagoshi thanked staff member Yokoyama that the team could further develop Kiryu's appeal across the franchise. The inclusion of Kiryu running an orphanage for ''Yakuza 3'' was enjoyed by Yokoyama despite rewriting this subplot multiple times. Originally, Kiryu was meant to go to prison once again but because it was going to be obvious they changed his story in this game.

Sega described Kiryu as a \"straight man trait \u2013 tough but honorable and keeps to himself a bit\" implying there are not too many difficulties in writing him. Through this game and the remake of the first game, ''Kiwami'', the relationship between Kiryu and Majima becomes more explored in contrast to the initial game of the franchise, most notably because of the changes made to Majima's characterization and the way he sees Kiryu's actions while being both friends and enemies at the same time.

They compared the character with [[James Bond]] whose actor changed multiple times across his movies.

game]] series ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]''. Kiryu is a [[yakuza]] who takes the blame for his boss' death to protect his best friend, resulting in his expulsion from the clan and a ten-year stay in prison. After leaving prison, Kiryu realizes the crime world has changed and fights against the new threats in his life. He is voiced by [[Takaya Kuroda]] in Japanese and by [[Darryl Kurylo]] in the English version of the first game.\n\nKiryu was created to appeal to a broad audience, and was the series' playable character during its first three games.

On the other hand, he has also been viewed as a somewhat typical gaming protagonist.\n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:Toshihiro Nagoshi 20140125.jpg|thumb|left|Writer Toshihiro Nagoshi created Kazuma Kiryu with Hasei Seishu's aid in the making of the series.]]\nIn creating Kazuma Kiryu, there were some issues regarding how realistic his position and age were. Writer Hasei Seishu told the staff the positions were too high for his age and thus Kiryu's age was revised. When describing Kiryu, the staff found his position would be of the noble samurai type who would often protect others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3153161|title=A Heart-To-Heart With Yakuza's Development Team|website=1UP.com|date=October 9, 2008|author=Gifford, Kevin|accessdate=March 28, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701161732/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3153161|archivedate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> According to Sega producer [[Toshihiro Nagoshi]], dragons have a strong image about them, and that when players sample it, they would, as the title suggests, get a feel for the strength and manliness of the main character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/11/ryu-ga-gotoku-update|title=Ryu Ga Gotoku Update|date=September 11, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2014|website=IGN|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512222226/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/11/ryu-ga-gotoku-update|archivedate=May 12, 2014}}</ref> When the spin-off ''Yakuza Kenzan'' was released, he commented that the tale of Kazuma Kiryu had yet to be completed.

Furthermore, Nagoshi said this difference is shown across the series. Nagoshi thanked staff member Yokoyama that the team could further develop Kiryu's appeal across the franchise. The inclusion of Kiryu running an orphanage for ''Yakuza 3'' was enjoyed by Yokoyama despite rewriting this subplot multiple times. Originally, Kiryu was meant to go to prison once again but because it was going to be obvious they changed his story in this game. Due to Kiryu taking care of the orphans, Yokoyama feared the character became too kind.<ref name=\"kuroda\">{{cite book|title=Ryu ga Gotoku 3 Guidebook|pages=522\u2013527}}</ref>\n\nAcross all these games, the development team developed a sturdy understanding of his personality, and there was a lot of effort put into making the character attractive to the audiences as a result of being the only playable character. By ''Yakuza 4'', Kiryu was seen as \"indestructible\" by the staff, and as a result, he was made the last character playable in the game, following three new characters that stood out thanks to their different traits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35429/Interview_Defining_Direction_Writing_Art_And_Music_On_Yakuza_4.php|title=Interview: Defining Direction, Writing, Art And Music On Yakuza 4|website=Gamasutra|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=March 28, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329100644/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35429/Interview_Defining_Direction_Writing_Art_And_Music_On_Yakuza_4.php|archivedate=March 29, 2014}}</ref> In localizing the games, the character was often referred to by his first name, but by ''Yakuza 4'', producer Yasuhiro Noguchi made him most commonly called Kiryu in an attempt to make him fit with the other main characters also called by their last names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/13/yakuza-4-producer-yasuhiro-noguchi-on-re-localizing-the-series/|title=Yakuza 4 producer Yasuhiro Noguchi on re-localizing the series|publisher=Joystiq|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=April 8, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408231529/http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/13/yakuza-4-producer-yasuhiro-noguchi-on-re-localizing-the-series/|archivedate=April 8, 2014}}</ref> For ''Yakuza 5'', while once again there were other protagonists alongside Kiryu, a new one, Haruka, was added as playable for the first time in order to make her character arc connect with the role of Kiryu and the other characters.

Sega described Kiryu as a \"straight man trait \u2013 tough but honorable and keeps to himself a bit\" implying there are not too many difficulties in writing him. Through this game and the remake of the first game, ''Kiwami'', the relationship between Kiryu and Majima becomes more explored in contrast to the initial game of the franchise, most notably because of the changes made to Majima's characterization and the way he sees Kiryu's actions while being both friends and enemies at the same time. ''Yakuza 0'' also served as a story of Kiryu that Sega wanted players to know before reaching ''Yakuza 6''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/21/sega-on-the-challenges-of-bringing-yakuza-0-west.aspx|title=How Sega Brought Yakuza 0 To The West|date=February 21, 2017|magazine=Game Informer|accessdate=October 30, 2017|author=Gwaltney, Javy}}</ref> Kiryu's traits in ''Yakuza 0'' were specifically changed to a \"loose-cannon hot-head\" to the point long time fans would be surprised by his actions.

They compared the character with [[James Bond]] whose actor changed multiple times across his movies. Describing him as \"a super-cool and masculine guy, but since he's a well-established character with a specific personality, there are things that he would and wouldn't do\" the team decided he would need a successor who would bring the staff more creativity to work with.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-creator-talks-007-inspirations-wacky-humor-/1100-6451146/|title=Yakuza Creator Talks 007 Inspirations, Wacky Humor, And What's Next|website=GameSpot|accessdate=October 28, 2017|date=June 24, 2017}}</ref> In late 2016, Nagoshi claimed he had been doing Kazuma's story for nearly a decade, stating \"it had its pros and cons\".

However, he regrets some lines were lost in translation of the original game. Nevertheless, Kurylo enjoyed the experience to the point of playing the game multiple times alongside his son. In order to fit the lipsyncing from the original Japanese game, Kurylo often had to say a line in different styles. Kurylo still found more fun when doing the yells for the fight scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tojohq.github.io/interview-darryl-kurylo/|title=TojoHQ Interviews - Darryl Kurylo|publisher=TojoHQ|accessdate=September 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nNogashi was impressed by Kiryu's Japanese voice actor, [[Takaya Kuroda]], due to how he sang in the music minigame.

Eventually, Kiryu and Ryuji fight atop Kamurocho Hills. Kiryu is victorious, but Yukio Terada appears, revealing that he faked his own death to start a war and is really a Jingweon survivor. Terada is also defeated, but begs Kiryu to trust him. After Jin Goda, Takashima and Terada are dead, Kiryu and Ryuji have a final showdown, which Kiryu wins.
