{"title_page": "1907 Glamorgan County Council election", "text_new": "The '''1907 Glamorgan County Council election''' was the seventh contest for seats on [[Glamorgan County Council|this local authority]] in south [[Wales]]. It was preceded by the [[1904 Glamorgan County Council election|1904 election]] and followed by the [[1910 Glamorgan County Council election|1910 election]]. \n \n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Overview of the result==\nAs in most parts of Wales, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] again won a majority of the seats. The Conservatives made a slight advance, notably in the western part of the county where they also held on in a number of industrial wards where the influence of paternalism remained strong. A more striking factor was the advance of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidates in several areas and there were also Liberal members who were returned under a 'progressive' banner with support from the labour movement.\n\n==Boundary changes==\nThere were no boundary changes at this election.\n\n==Retiring aldermen==\nAll eleven retiring aldermen were Liberals, or [[Lib-Lab (UK)|Lib-Lab]] members as the Conservatives and their allies had been denied any seats on the aldermanic bench since the [[1901 Glamorgan County Council election|1901 election]].\n\n==Contested elections==\nThere were fewer contested elections than three years before.\n\n===Aberdare, Mountain Ash and Merthyr districts===\nThere were only two contested elections in the Aberdare district, and both were more personal than political. It was noted that the labour movement did not show the same interest in county elections than in those for the district council.<ref name=\"AL 23-2-07 CC el\">{{cite news|title=Forthcoming Elections|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3577259/ART107|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=Aberdare Leader|date=23 February 1907}}</ref>\n\n===Bridgend and Maesteg districts===\nThere were only two contested elections in this area and in one of those, a candidate had withdrawn too late in the day and polled very few votes. The contest in Maesteg was a particularly lively one and was influenced by the political struggles in [[Mid Glamorgan (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Glamorgan]] where [[Vernon Hartshorn]] was an increasingly influential figure. Hartshorn instigated the candidacy of the local [[South Wales Miners' Federation|federation]] solicitor who defeated a candidate closely allied to the coalowners.\n\n===Swansea, Pontardawe and Port Talbot districts===\nIn these areas the Conservatives performed well, mainly at the expense of the Liberals and also holding off Labour challenges in Pontardawe and Loughor. Labour took Cwmavon from the Liberals by a substantial majority.\n\n==Results==\n\n===[[Aberaman (electoral ward)|Aberaman]]===\n{{Election box begin | title = Aberaman 1907 }}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n   |party = Liberal Party (UK)\n   |candidate = '''Thomas Luther Davies*'''\n   |votes = unopposed\n   |percentage = \n   |change =  \n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link|\n  |winner     = Liberal Party (UK)\n  |swing      = \n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n===[[Aberavon (electoral ward)|Aberavon]]===\nJ.M.

The Conservatives made a slight advance, notably in the western part of the county where they also held on in a number of industrial wards where the influence of paternalism remained strong. A more striking factor was the advance of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidates in several areas and there were also Liberal members who were returned under a 'progressive' banner with support from the labour movement.\n\n==Boundary changes==\nThere were no boundary changes at this election.\n\n==Retiring aldermen==\nAll eleven retiring aldermen were Liberals, or [[Lib-Lab (UK)|Lib-Lab]] members as the Conservatives and their allies had been denied any seats on the aldermanic bench since the [[1901 Glamorgan County Council election|1901 election]].\n\n==Contested elections==\nThere were fewer contested elections than three years before.\n\n===Aberdare, Mountain Ash and Merthyr districts===\nThere were only two contested elections in the Aberdare district, and both were more personal than political.

The contest in Maesteg was a particularly lively one and was influenced by the political struggles in [[Mid Glamorgan (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Glamorgan]] where [[Vernon Hartshorn]] was an increasingly influential figure. Hartshorn instigated the candidacy of the local [[South Wales Miners' Federation|federation]] solicitor who defeated a candidate closely allied to the coalowners.\n\n===Swansea, Pontardawe and Port Talbot districts===\nIn these areas the Conservatives performed well, mainly at the expense of the Liberals and also holding off Labour challenges in Pontardawe and Loughor.
