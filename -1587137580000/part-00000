Thomas attended [[Roosevelt High School (South Dakota)|Roosevelt High School]] and sang with the school [[concert choir]] and men's choir. He began performing at local venues on his acoustic guitar at 15-years-old and self-released his first [[punk rock]] and [[Acoustic guitar |acoustic]] CD titled ''The Blur of Motions'' in 2000 with Prairie Dog Studios. Thomas envisioned the Spill Canvas in the summer of 2001 as a collage of unique musical sounds and ideas coming together to form a unique palette. Vocalist Becca Flinn approached Thomas following a solo show and the two formed the beginnings of the band, adding bassist Alan Burkhard and violinist Hannah Peskey. The band combined a subtle symphonic sound with aggressive acoustic rock. Flinn, Burkhard and Peskey dropped out of the group less than a year after joining. Thomas retained the band name as a solo project while performing as a guitarist and backup vocalist for [[Nodes of Ranvier (band)|Nodes of Ranvier]] until his departure in early 2003 to pursue his band full time. \n\nThe Spill Canvas self-released its first five-song CD titled ''Concept EP'' in May 2003, produced at Cathouse Studios in Sioux Falls. The band signed with Florida-based, independent label [[One Eleven Records]] shortly after the CD release. Label owner [[Brad Fischetti]] discovered the band on the online streaming website MP3.com. The band's first widespread album, ''Sunsets and Car Crashes'', which was written, produced, and performed by Thomas, was released by One Eleven Records on April 20, 2004. Thomas was joined by members Joe Beck, Ross Wheeler, and Brandon Aegerter to tour the release of ''Sunsets and Car Crashes''. Wheeler and Aegerter later left the group and were replaced by Scott McGuire and Dan Ludeman. The four members collectively wrote what would be The Spill Canvas' second album, ''One Fell Swoop''.  The album was released August 9, 2005 by One Eleven Records once again.\n\nOn their official page in late 2006, the band announced a change of label through a news post by bassist Scott McGuire; \"Also, did I mention that there is a new record label in the picture? That's right, we have signed to [[Sire Records]].\"\n\nIn early 2007, McGuire declared that he was no longer a part of the band, stating, \"The Spill Canvas has decided in order to make music to its fullest potential, they must do so without me.\" The temporary replacement for McGuire was Landon Heil, the guitarist of another band known as The Glass Atlantic. Being a better creative fit than McGuire, Heil quickly became a permanent member of the outfit.\n\nOn May 1, 2007, the band released an [[Extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[Denial Feels So Good]]'', to hold their fans over until their new album arrived.  The EP consisted of three original songs and two covers.  Marc Sheaffer, a keyboardist from Sioux Falls, played keys on \"Gold Dust Woman\". Following the release of the EP, the band played on the entire summer 2007 [[Warped Tour]], promoting the upcoming release of their third album and first major label debut ''[[No Really, I'm Fine]]''. The new album was recorded in March and April 2007, and in Alternative Press Issue 229, it was confirmed that [[Anthony Green (musician)|Anthony Green]] of [[Circa Survive]] and [[Andrew McMahon]] of [[Jack's Mannequin]] would be guests on the new album. Anthony Green sang backup vocals on the song \"Bleed, Everyone's Doing It\", and Andrew McMahon played keyboards in the re-recorded version of the song \"Saved\", a song originally recorded for the soundtrack of the motion picture, ''[[Superman Returns]]''.\n\nOn July 26, 2007, ''No Really, I'm Fine'' was rumored to be the title of the upcoming album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chorus.fm/|title=chorus.fm|website=Chorus.fm}}</ref> This agreement lasted for two years. Soon after, however, websites such as Amazon.com and Best Buy, had listed the new album with the title ''Conduit''. On August 28, 2007, the band posted a Myspace bulletin stating that the album was going to be titled ''No Really, I'm Fine''. The album was released under this title on October 2, 2007.\n\nThe band went on a Fall tour across North America in the Fall of 2007, named \"All Your Favorite Spots\". The tour was supported by [[Meg & Dia]], [[Playradioplay!]], and [[Treaty of Paris (band)|Treaty of Paris]]. On January 23, 2008, it was confirmed on [[Yellowcard]]'s official MySpace that The Spill Canvas would be touring with them in a spring acoustic tour. In February 2008, they headed to Europe with [[Plain White T's]] and [[The Fold]]. In the summer of 2008, The Spill Canvas headlined a national tour, supported by [[Steel Train]] and [[ludo (band)|Ludo]]. Up-and-coming pop-punkers [[Sing It Loud]] joined them for the first half of the tour, with Liam and Me joining for the end. They were joined by [[Motion City Soundtrack]] for the final leg of the tour.\n\nIn late 2008, they toured with OneRepublic, The Hush Sound and Augustana.  On this tour, most vocalists from all of the opening bands, including Nick, came up during Augustana's set to perform Traveling Wilbury's hit \"Handle With Care\", trading off lead vocals.\n\nIn early 2009, The Spill Canvas toured the UK supporting [[You Me at Six]] alongside [[Emarosa]]\n\nAbnormalities, featuring new music from the band, was released on January 12, 2010 through The Spill Canvas store and digital retailers. Their next EP, Realities, was released shortly thereafter on April 13. On July 27, 2010 their newest album, Formalities, saw digital release. The album contains songs previously seen on both Realities and Abnormalities, along with acoustic versions of songs from those EPs and two brand new songs. They spent the summer of 2010 touring with the [[Goo Goo Dolls]] and [[Switchfoot]].\n\nOn January 13, 2011, an article in the Sioux Falls [[Argus Leader]] stated that the band may be on a temporary hiatus and there was no indication when, if ever, the band would return.\n\nOn May 15, 2011, after a long time of being inactive on Twitter, \"Someday soon\" was tweeted from The Spill Canvas.\n\nOn August 11, 2011 the band posted, \"Tell your friends to follow @thespillcanvas we are going to be posting lots of interesting news and announcements in the coming weeks!\" on Twitter.\n\nThe Spill Canvas played a \"reunion show\" in their hometown of Sioux Falls, SD on October 28, 2011, during which they announced they are no longer on a label and plan to record a new album, with a Kickstarter campaign raising funds to record it. They played a new song at the show.\n\nOn January 21, 2012 The Spill Canvas posted a studio update on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DqsiDd2NLY|title=studio update|date=January 21, 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Spill Canvas will release their new album, ''Gestalt'', on May 22, 2012 according to their Facebook account. The song \"Parallels and Money\" will be included on this album. On April 20, 2012, The Spill Canvas released the first track off of their upcoming album ''Gestalt'', called \"To Chicago\" on their [[PureVolume]] account. The song reached number one on PureVolume.<ref>[http://www.purevolume.com/new/thespillcanvas] {{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter a hiatus lead singer Nick Thomas released a solo record funded by Kickstarter called ''Shadowars'' in 2014. The singer has been touring the record nationally with spill canvas bassist Landon Heil and new drummer Bryce Job.\n\nThomas and Job embarked on a brief east coast acoustic run with another South Dakota band Paradise Fears and William Beckett of The Academy Is.\n\nThen the full Nick Thomas band toured in November with co-headliners Deleasa and Cassio Monroe spanning the east coast.\n\nIn December the NT band headlined a tour including Midwest and West coast dates with openers [[My Body Sings Electric]] from Denver, CO.\n\nAfter that, the Nick Thomas band was seen on the Radio Revival Tour with Secondhand Serenade and Ryan Cabrera.\n\nThe Spill Canvas joined Motion City Soundtrack's 10 year anniversary of Commit This To Memory tour in July 2015.\n\nThe band also celebrated a 10-year anniversary tour of One Fell Swoop in August 2015.\n\nThe band started their requestour in April 2016.  They allowed fans to vote for their favorite songs to be played at the show.  The voting was on a per city basis. While not officially a member of The Spill Canvas, Mike Naran played guitar as part of their live show since joining them in Cambridge, MA in August, 2015.\n\nThe band worked on writing a new album, which followed up their album \"Gestalt\". \n\nThe Spill Canvas performed at Webster Hall on May 4, 2017 during Emo Nite LA's NYC concert.<ref>{{cite news |title=EMO NITE LA ANNOUNCES EPIC NYC TAKEOVER, FEATURING MGK, GEOFF RICKLY, CRAIG OWENS, TYLER POSEY, MORE |url=https://www.altpress.com/news/emo_nite_la_announces_epic_nyc_takeover_featuring_mgk_geoff_rickly_craig_ow/ |accessdate=25 June 2018 |website=Altpress.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band is was previously on tour with Punchline and Selfish Things, supporting their new EP Hivemind, released July 20 2018.  <ref>{{cite news |title=SELFISH THINGS Announce US Tour Dates With The Spill Canvas\n |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/SELFISH-THINGS-Announce-US-Tour-Dates-With-The-Spill-Canvas-20180522 |accessdate=23 July 2018 |publisher=Braodway World}}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n===Current members===\n* Nick Thomas \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, keyboard, production\n* Landon Heil \u2013 bass\n*Bryce Job \u2013 drums, percussion, tracking, backing vocals\n*Evan Pharmakis - lead guitar, vocals, programming\n\n===Past members===\n\n* Dan Ludeman \u2013 Guitars, Backing Vocals\n* Joe Beck - Drums\n* Scott McGuire - Bass\n* Mike Naran - Guitar, Backing Vocals\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n*''Go for the Jugular'' (2002)\n*''Sunsets & Car Crashes'' (2003)\n*''One Fell Swoop'' (2005), No.&nbsp;29 [[Top Heatseekers]], No.&nbsp;47 Top Independent Albums<ref name=allmusicalbums>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p650753/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Billboard Albums];

On January 23, 2008, it was confirmed on [[Yellowcard]]'s official MySpace that The Spill Canvas would be touring with them in a spring acoustic tour. In February 2008, they headed to Europe with [[Plain White T's]] and [[The Fold]]. In the summer of 2008, The Spill Canvas headlined a national tour, supported by [[Steel Train]] and [[ludo (band)|Ludo]]. Up-and-coming pop-punkers [[Sing It Loud]] joined them for the first half of the tour, with Liam and Me joining for the end.

They spent the summer of 2010 touring with the [[Goo Goo Dolls]] and [[Switchfoot]].\n\nOn January 13, 2011, an article in the Sioux Falls [[Argus Leader]] stated that the band may be on a temporary hiatus and there was no indication when, if ever, the band would return.\n\nOn May 15, 2011, after a long time of being inactive on Twitter, \"Someday soon\" was tweeted from The Spill Canvas.\n\nOn August 11, 2011 the band posted, \"Tell your friends to follow @thespillcanvas we are going to be posting lots of interesting news and announcements in the coming weeks!\" on Twitter.\n\nThe Spill Canvas played a \"reunion show\" in their hometown of Sioux Falls, SD on October 28, 2011, during which they announced they are no longer on a label and plan to record a new album, with a Kickstarter campaign raising funds to record it. They played a new song at the show.\n\nOn January 21, 2012 The Spill Canvas posted a studio update on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DqsiDd2NLY|title=studio update|date=January 21, 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nThe Spill Canvas will release their new album, ''Gestalt'', on May 22, 2012 according to their Facebook account.

The singer has been touring the record nationally with spill canvas bassist Landon Heil and new drummer Bryce Job.\n\nThomas and Job embarked on a brief east coast acoustic run with another South Dakota band Paradise Fears and William Beckett of The Academy Is.\n\nThen the full Nick Thomas band toured in November with co-headliners Deleasa and Cassio Monroe spanning the east coast.\n\nIn December the NT band headlined a tour including Midwest and West coast dates with openers [[My Body Sings Electric]] from Denver, CO.\n\nAfter that, the Nick Thomas band was seen on the Radio Revival Tour with Secondhand Serenade and Ryan Cabrera.\n\nThe Spill Canvas joined Motion City Soundtrack's 10 year anniversary of Commit This To Memory tour in July 2015.\n\nThe band also celebrated a 10-year anniversary tour of One Fell Swoop in August 2015.\n\nThe band started their requestour in April 2016.  They allowed fans to vote for their favorite songs to be played at the show.  The voting was on a per city basis. While not officially a member of The Spill Canvas, Mike Naran played guitar as part of their live show since joining them in Cambridge, MA in August, 2015.\n\nThe band worked on writing a new album, which followed up their album \"Gestalt\". \n\nThe Spill Canvas performed at Webster Hall on May 4, 2017 during Emo Nite LA's NYC concert.<ref>{{cite news |title=EMO NITE LA ANNOUNCES EPIC NYC TAKEOVER, FEATURING MGK, GEOFF RICKLY, CRAIG OWENS, TYLER POSEY, MORE |url=https://www.altpress.com/news/emo_nite_la_announces_epic_nyc_takeover_featuring_mgk_geoff_rickly_craig_ow/ |accessdate=25 June 2018 |website=Altpress.com}}</ref>\n\nThe band is was previously on tour with Punchline and Selfish Things, supporting their new EP Hivemind, released July 20 2018.  <ref>{{cite news |title=SELFISH THINGS Announce US Tour Dates With The Spill Canvas\n |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/SELFISH-THINGS-Announce-US-Tour-Dates-With-The-Spill-Canvas-20180522 |accessdate=23 July 2018 |publisher=Braodway World}}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n===Current members===\n* Nick Thomas \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, keyboard, production\n* Landon Heil \u2013 bass\n*Bryce Job \u2013 drums, percussion, tracking, backing vocals\n*Evan Pharmakis - lead guitar, vocals, programming\n\n===Past members===\n\n* Dan Ludeman \u2013 Guitars, Backing Vocals\n* Joe Beck - Drums\n* Scott McGuire - Bass\n* Mike Naran - Guitar, Backing Vocals\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n*''Go for the Jugular'' (2002)\n*''Sunsets & Car Crashes'' (2003)\n*''One Fell Swoop'' (2005), No.&nbsp;29 [[Top Heatseekers]], No.&nbsp;47 Top Independent Albums<ref name=allmusicalbums>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p650753/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} Billboard Albums]; [[AllMusic]]; Retrieved February 20, 2008</ref>\n*''No Really, I'm Fine'' (2007), No.&nbsp;2 Top Heatseekers, No.&nbsp;143 [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]<ref name=allmusicalbums />\n*''Scraps/No Really, I'm Fine'' (2008)\n*''Formalities'' (2010)\n*''Gestalt'' (2012)\n\n===EPs===\n*''Denial Feels So Good'' (2007)\n*''Honestly, I'm Doing Okay'' (2008)\n*''Abnormalities'' (2010)\n*''Realities'' (2010)\n*''Hivemind'' (2018)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Additional research==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071221121437/http://www.ksfy.com/news/entertainment/11530071.html KSFY's Drew Sandholm interviews Nick Thomas, 17 November 2007]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080628051756/http://www.ksfy.com/news/local/21772794.html \"Local Band Goes Big\" article from KSFY, Sioux Falls media.]\n* [http://www.argusleader.com/article/20110113/ENT05/101130327/1005/ENT Local Band The Spill Canvas on hiatus.]\n* [http://www.kdlt.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12951&Itemid=57#video The Spill Canvas Reunites in Hometown]\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130713080436/http://official/ Website]\n* [http://www.myspace.com/tsc MySpace Page]\n* [http://www.purevolume.com/thespillcanvas Purevolume Page]\n* [http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/nick_spill_canvas?c=p22594 Warped Tour 07 Interview]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spill Canvas}}\n[[Category:Indie rock musical groups from South Dakota]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from South Dakota]]\n[[Category:2001 establishments in South Dakota]]\n", "name_user": "Jrobb525", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spill_Canvas"}

RMS can also be defined for a continuously varying [[function (mathematics)|function]] in terms of an [[integral]] of the squares of the instantaneous values during a cycle.\n\nFor [[alternating current|alternating electric current]], RMS is equal to the value of the [[direct current]] that would produce the same average power dissipation in a [[Resistor|resistive load]].<ref name=dicphys/>\n\nIn [[estimation theory]], the [[root-mean-square deviation]] of an estimator is a measure of the imperfection of the fit of the estimator to the data.\n\n==Definition==\nThe RMS value of a set of values (or a [[continuous-time]] [[waveform]]) is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the values, or the square of the function that defines the continuous waveform. In physics, the RMS current value can also be defined as the \"value of the direct current that dissipates the same power in a resistor.\"\n\nIn the case of a set of ''n'' values <math>\\{x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n\\}</math>, the RMS is\n:<math>\nx_\\text{RMS} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\left( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\cdots + x_n^2 \\right) }.\n</math>\n\nThe corresponding formula for a continuous function (or waveform) ''f''(''t'') defined over the interval <math>T_1 \\le t \\le T_2</math> is\n:<math>\nf_\\text{RMS} = \\sqrt {{1 \\over {T_2-T_1}} {\\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {[f(t)]}^2\\, dt}},\n</math>\n\nand the RMS for a function over all time is\n:<math>\nf_\\text{RMS} = \\lim_{T\\rightarrow \\infty} \\sqrt {{1 \\over {T}} {\\int_{0}^{T} {[f(t)]}^2\\, dt}}.\n</math>\n\nThe RMS over all time of a [[periodic function]] is equal to the RMS of one period of the function. The RMS value of a continuous function or signal can be approximated by taking the RMS of a sample consisting of equally spaced observations. Additionally, the RMS value of various waveforms can also be determined without [[Calculus#Integral calculus|calculus]], as shown by Cartwright.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cartwright|first=Kenneth V|title=Determining the Effective or RMS Voltage of Various Waveforms without Calculus|journal=Technology Interface|volume=8|issue=1|pages=20 pages|date=Fall 2007|url=http://tiij.org/issues/issues/fall2007/30_Cartwright/Cartwright-Waveforms.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn the case of the RMS statistic of a [[random process]], the [[expected value]] is used instead of the mean.\n\n==In common waveforms==\n[[File:Waveforms.svg|thumb|right|400px|[[Sine wave|Sine]], [[square wave|square]], [[triangle wave|triangle]], and [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] waveforms.]]\n[[File:Dutycycle.svg|thumb|right|400px|A rectangular pulse wave of duty cycle D, the ratio between the pulse duration (<math>\\tau</math>) and the period (T); illustrated here with ''a'' = 1.]]\n[[File:Sine wave voltages.svg|thumb|right|400px|Graph of a sine wave's voltage vs. time (in degrees), showing RMS, peak (PK), and peak-to-peak (PP) voltages.]]\nIf the [[waveform]] is a pure [[sine wave]], the relationships between amplitudes (peak-to-peak, peak) and RMS are fixed and known, as they are for any continuous [[period (physics)|periodic]] wave. However, this is not true for an arbitrary waveform, which may not be periodic or continuous. For a zero-mean sine wave, the relationship between RMS and peak-to-peak amplitude is:\n:''Peak-to-peak'' <math> = 2 \\sqrt{2} \\times \\text{RMS} \\approx 2.8 \\times \\text{RMS}.</math>\n\nFor other waveforms, the relationships are not the same as they are for sine waves.

It is easy to do the calculation when there is a constant [[electric current|current]], ''I'', through the resistance. For a load of ''R'' ohms, power is defined simply as:\n:<math>P = I^2 R.</math>\n\nHowever, if the current is a time-varying function, ''I''(''t''), this formula must be extended to reflect the fact that the current (and thus the instantaneous power) is varying over time. If the function is periodic (such as household AC power), it is still meaningful to discuss the ''average'' power dissipated over time, which is calculated by taking the average power dissipation:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nP_\\text{avg}\n&= \\left\\langle I(t)^2R \\right\\rangle  &&\\text{where } \\langle\\cdots\\rangle \\text{ denotes the mean of a function} \\\\[3pt]\n&= \\left\\langle I(t)^2 \\right\\rangle R &&\\text{(as } R \\text{ does not vary over time, it can be factored out)} \\\\[3pt]\n&= I_\\text{RMS}^2R                     &&\\text{by definition of root-mean-square}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSo, the RMS value, ''I''<sub>RMS</sub>, of the function ''I''(''t'') is the constant current that yields the same power dissipation as the time-averaged power dissipation of the current ''I''(''t'').\n\nAverage power can also be found using the same method that in the case of a time-varying [[voltage]], ''V''(''t''), with RMS value ''V''<sub>RMS</sub>,\n:<math>P_\\text{Avg} = {V_\\text{RMS}^2 \\over R}.</math>\n\nThis equation can be used for any periodic [[waveform]], such as a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] or [[sawtooth wave]]form, allowing us to calculate the mean power delivered into a specified load.\n\nBy taking the square root of both these equations and multiplying them together, the power is found to be:\n:<math>P_\\text{Avg} = V_\\text{RMS} I_\\text{RMS}.</math>\n\nBoth derivations depend on voltage and current being proportional (that is, the load, ''R'', is purely resistive). [[Electrical reactance|Reactive]] loads (that is, loads capable of not just dissipating energy but also storing it) are discussed under the topic of [[AC power]].\n\nIn the common case of [[alternating current]] when ''I''(''t'') is a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] current, as is approximately true for mains power, the RMS value is easy to calculate from the continuous case equation above. If ''I''<sub>p</sub> is defined to be the peak current, then:\n:<math>I_\\text{RMS} = \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \\left[I_\\text{p} \\sin(\\omega t)\\right]^2 dt},</math>\n\nwhere ''t'' is time and ''\u03c9'' is the [[angular frequency]] (''\u03c9''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2{{pi}}/''T'', where ''T'' is the period of the wave).\n\nSince ''I''<sub>p</sub> is a positive constant:\n:<math>I_\\text{RMS} = I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} {\\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {\\sin^2(\\omega t)}\\, dt}}.</math>\n\nUsing a [[list of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identity]] to eliminate squaring of trig function:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nI_\\text{RMS} &= I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} {\\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {{1 - \\cos(2\\omega t) \\over 2}}\\, dt}} \\\\[3pt]\n\t\t   &= I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} \\left[ {t \\over 2} - {\\sin(2\\omega t) \\over 4\\omega} \\right]_{T_1}^{T_2} }\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nbut since the interval is a whole number of complete cycles (per definition of RMS), the sin terms will cancel out, leaving:\n:<math>I_\\text{RMS} = I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} \\left[ {{t \\over 2}} \\right]_{T_1}^{T_2} } = I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} {{{T_2 - T_1} \\over 2}} } = {I_\\text{p} \\over \\sqrt{2}}.</math>\n\nA similar analysis leads to the analogous equation for sinusoidal voltage:\n:<math>V_\\text{RMS} = {V_\\text{p} \\over \\sqrt{2}},</math>\n\nwhere ''I''<sub>P</sub> represents the peak current and ''V''<sub>P</sub> represents the peak voltage.\n\nBecause of their usefulness in carrying out power calculations, listed [[voltage]]s for power outlets (for example, 120{{nbsp}}V in the USA, or 230{{nbsp}}V in Europe) are almost always quoted in RMS values, and not peak values. Peak values can be calculated from RMS values from the above formula, which implies ''V''{{sub|P}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;''V''<sub>RMS</sub>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;{{radic|2}}, assuming the source is a pure sine wave. Thus the peak value of the mains voltage in the USA is about 120&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;{{radic|2}}, or about 170 volts. The peak-to-peak voltage, being double this, is about 340 volts. A similar calculation indicates that the peak mains voltage in Europe is about 325 volts, and the peak-to-peak mains voltage, about 650 volts.\n\nRMS quantities such as electric current are usually calculated over one cycle. However, for some purposes the RMS current over a longer period is required when calculating transmission power losses. The same principle applies, and (for example) a current of 10 amps used for 12 hours each 24-hour day represents an average current of 5 amps, but an RMS current of 7.07 amps, in the long term.\n\nThe term ''RMS power'' is sometimes erroneously used in the audio industry as a synonym for ''mean power'' or ''average power'' (it is proportional to the square of the RMS voltage or RMS current in a resistive load). For a discussion of audio power measurements and their shortcomings, see [[Audio power]].\n\n===Speed===\n{{Main article|Root-mean-square speed}}\n\nIn the [[physics]] of [[gas]] molecules, the '''root-mean-square speed''' is defined as the square root of the average squared-speed. The RMS speed of an ideal gas is [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution#Distribution for the velocity vector|calculated]] using the following equation:\n:<math>v_\\text{RMS} = \\sqrt{3RT \\over M}</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' represents the [[gas constant]], 8.314&nbsp;J/(mol\u00b7K), ''T'' is the temperature of the gas in [[kelvin]]s, and ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] of the gas in kilograms per mole. The generally accepted terminology for speed as compared to velocity is that the former is the scalar magnitude of the latter. Therefore, although the average speed is between zero and the RMS speed, the average velocity for a stationary gas is zero.\n\n===Error===\n{{Main article|Root-mean-square deviation}}\nWhen two data sets\u2014one set from theoretical prediction and the other from actual measurement of some physical variable, for instance\u2014are compared, the RMS of the pairwise differences of the two data sets can serve as a measure how far on average the error is from 0. The [[mean]] of the pairwise differences does not measure the variability of the difference, and the variability as indicated by the [[standard deviation]] is around the mean instead of 0. Therefore, the RMS of the differences is a meaningful measure of the error.\n\n==In frequency domain==\nThe RMS can be computed in the frequency domain, using [[Parseval's theorem]]. For a sampled signal <math>x[n] = x(t=nT)</math>, where <math>T</math> is the sampling period,\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^N{x^2[n]} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{m=1}^N \\left| X[m] \\right|^2,</math>\n\nwhere <math>X[m] = \\operatorname{FFT}\\{x[n]\\}</math> and ''N'' is the sample size, that is, the number of observations in the sample and FFT coefficients.\n\nIn this case, the RMS computed in the time domain is the same as in the frequency domain:\n:<math>\n\\text{RMS}\\{x[n]\\}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_n{x^2[n]}}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_m{\\bigl| X[m] \\bigr|}^2}\n= \\sqrt{\\sum_m{\\left| \\frac{X[m]}{N} \\right|^2}}.\n</math>\n\n==Relationship to other statistics==\nIf <math>\\bar{x}</math> is the [[arithmetic mean]] and <math>\\sigma_x</math> is the [[standard deviation]] of a [[statistical population|population]] or a [[waveform]], then:<ref>\n{{cite book\n| title=Digital signal transmission\n| edition=2nd\n| author1=Chris C.

If ''I''<sub>p</sub> is defined to be the peak current, then:\n:<math>I_\\text{RMS} = \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \\left[I_\\text{p} \\sin(\\omega t)\\right]^2 dt},</math>\n\nwhere ''t'' is time and ''\u03c9'' is the [[angular frequency]] (''\u03c9''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2{{pi}}/''T'', where ''T'' is the period of the wave).\n\nSince ''I''<sub>p</sub> is a positive constant:\n:<math>I_\\text{RMS} = I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} {\\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {\\sin^2(\\omega t)}\\, dt}}.</math>\n\nUsing a [[list of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identity]] to eliminate squaring of trig function:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nI_\\text{RMS} &= I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} {\\int_{T_1}^{T_2} {{1 - \\cos(2\\omega t) \\over 2}}\\, dt}} \\\\[3pt]\n\t\t   &= I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} \\left[ {t \\over 2} - {\\sin(2\\omega t) \\over 4\\omega} \\right]_{T_1}^{T_2} }\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nbut since the interval is a whole number of complete cycles (per definition of RMS), the sin terms will cancel out, leaving:\n:<math>I_\\text{RMS} = I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} \\left[ {{t \\over 2}} \\right]_{T_1}^{T_2} } = I_\\text{p} \\sqrt{{1 \\over {T_2 - T_1}} {{{T_2 - T_1} \\over 2}} } = {I_\\text{p} \\over \\sqrt{2}}.</math>\n\nA similar analysis leads to the analogous equation for sinusoidal voltage:\n:<math>V_\\text{RMS} = {V_\\text{p} \\over \\sqrt{2}},</math>\n\nwhere ''I''<sub>P</sub> represents the peak current and ''V''<sub>P</sub> represents the peak voltage.\n\nBecause of their usefulness in carrying out power calculations, listed [[voltage]]s for power outlets (for example, 120{{nbsp}}V in the USA, or 230{{nbsp}}V in Europe) are almost always quoted in RMS values, and not peak values. Peak values can be calculated from RMS values from the above formula, which implies ''V''{{sub|P}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;''V''<sub>RMS</sub>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;{{radic|2}}, assuming the source is a pure sine wave. Thus the peak value of the mains voltage in the USA is about 120&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;{{radic|2}}, or about 170 volts. The peak-to-peak voltage, being double this, is about 340 volts. A similar calculation indicates that the peak mains voltage in Europe is about 325 volts, and the peak-to-peak mains voltage, about 650 volts.\n\nRMS quantities such as electric current are usually calculated over one cycle. However, for some purposes the RMS current over a longer period is required when calculating transmission power losses. The same principle applies, and (for example) a current of 10 amps used for 12 hours each 24-hour day represents an average current of 5 amps, but an RMS current of 7.07 amps, in the long term.\n\nThe term ''RMS power'' is sometimes erroneously used in the audio industry as a synonym for ''mean power'' or ''average power'' (it is proportional to the square of the RMS voltage or RMS current in a resistive load). For a discussion of audio power measurements and their shortcomings, see [[Audio power]].\n\n===Speed===\n{{Main article|Root-mean-square speed}}\n\nIn the [[physics]] of [[gas]] molecules, the '''root-mean-square speed''' is defined as the square root of the average squared-speed. The RMS speed of an ideal gas is [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution#Distribution for the velocity vector|calculated]] using the following equation:\n:<math>v_\\text{RMS} = \\sqrt{3RT \\over M}</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' represents the [[gas constant]], 8.314&nbsp;J/(mol\u00b7K), ''T'' is the temperature of the gas in [[kelvin]]s, and ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] of the gas in kilograms per mole. The generally accepted terminology for speed as compared to velocity is that the former is the scalar magnitude of the latter. Therefore, although the average speed is between zero and the RMS speed, the average velocity for a stationary gas is zero.\n\n===Error===\n{{Main article|Root-mean-square deviation}}\nWhen two data sets\u2014one set from theoretical prediction and the other from actual measurement of some physical variable, for instance\u2014are compared, the RMS of the pairwise differences of the two data sets can serve as a measure how far on average the error is from 0. The [[mean]] of the pairwise differences does not measure the variability of the difference, and the variability as indicated by the [[standard deviation]] is around the mean instead of 0. Therefore, the RMS of the differences is a meaningful measure of the error.\n\n==In frequency domain==\nThe RMS can be computed in the frequency domain, using [[Parseval's theorem]]. For a sampled signal <math>x[n] = x(t=nT)</math>, where <math>T</math> is the sampling period,\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^N{x^2[n]} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{m=1}^N \\left| X[m] \\right|^2,</math>\n\nwhere <math>X[m] = \\operatorname{FFT}\\{x[n]\\}</math> and ''N'' is the sample size, that is, the number of observations in the sample and FFT coefficients.\n\nIn this case, the RMS computed in the time domain is the same as in the frequency domain:\n:<math>\n\\text{RMS}\\{x[n]\\}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_n{x^2[n]}}\n= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N^2}\\sum_m{\\bigl| X[m] \\bigr|}^2}\n= \\sqrt{\\sum_m{\\left| \\frac{X[m]}{N} \\right|^2}}.\n</math>\n\n==Relationship to other statistics==\nIf <math>\\bar{x}</math> is the [[arithmetic mean]] and <math>\\sigma_x</math> is the [[standard deviation]] of a [[statistical population|population]] or a [[waveform]], then:<ref>\n{{cite book\n| title=Digital signal transmission\n| edition=2nd\n| author1=Chris C.
