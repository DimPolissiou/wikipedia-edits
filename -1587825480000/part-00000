It is an adaptation of [[Candace Bushnell]]'s [[Sex and the City (book)|1997 book of the same name]]. The series premiered in the United States on June 6, 1998, and concluded on February 22, 2004, with 94 episodes broadcast over six seasons. Throughout its development, the series received contributions from various producers, screenwriters, and directors, principally [[Michael Patrick King]].\n\nSet and filmed in [[New York City]], the show follows the lives of a group of four women\u2014three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties\u2014who, despite their different natures and ever-changing sex lives, remain inseparable and confide in each other. Starring [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] (as [[Carrie Bradshaw]]) and co-starring [[Kim Cattrall]] (as [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]), [[Kristin Davis]] (as [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte York]]), and [[Cynthia Nixon]] (as [[Miranda Hobbes]]), the series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[safe sex]], [[promiscuity]], and [[femininity]], while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships. The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers' way of exploring social life\u2014from sex to relationships\u2014through each of their four very different, individual perspectives.\n\n''Sex and the City'' has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters, and is credited with helping to increase HBO's popularity as a network.<ref>Nussbaum, Emily (July 29, 2013). \"[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women Difficult Women: How \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 Lost its Good Name]\".

It spawned two feature films, ''[[Sex and the City (film)|Sex and the City]]'' (2008) and ''[[Sex and the City 2]]'' (2010), and a [[prequel]] television series commissioned by [[The CW]], ''[[The Carrie Diaries (TV series)|The Carrie Diaries]]'' (2013\u20132014).\n\n==Origins==\n\nThe show was based in part on writer [[Candace Bushnell]]'s 1997 [[Sex and the City (book)|book of the same name]], compiled from her column at ''[[The New York Observer]]''. Bushnell has said in several interviews that the [[Carrie Bradshaw]] in her columns is her [[alter ego]]; when she wrote the \"Sex and the City\" essays, she used her own name initially, but for privacy reasons, later created the character played in the series by [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]. Carrie Bradshaw was a writer living in New York City. Carrie Bradshaw and Candace Bushnell have the same initials, a flourish emphasizing their connection. Moreover, just as Carrie Bradshaw has articles for the fictional ''New York Star'' published as a book in later series, the entire ''Sex and the City'' series is based on a compilation of Bushnell's own columns for the ''New York Observer''.\n\n''Sex and the City'' creator [[Darren Star]] wrote the pilot with Parker in mind as Carrie. According to Parker, \"I was flattered but didn't want to do it.

A member of the New York glitterati, she is a [[Nightclub|club]]/bar/restaurant staple known for her unique fashion sense and lives in a studio apartment in an [[Upper East Side]] [[brownstone]]. Stanford Blatch, a gay talent agent from an aristocratic family (played by [[Willie Garson]]), is Carrie's best friend outside of the other three women.\n\nCarrie is entangled with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]] ([[Chris Noth]]), a prominent businessman and an aficionado of jazz and cigars whose real name is revealed in the final episode (Season 6, Episode 8) to be John James Preston, in a tumultuous, on-and-off-again relationship. (In a running joke, whenever Carrie is about to introduce Mr. Big on-camera to another character, she is interrupted before she can say his name.) He is the reason for many of Carrie's breakdowns as he never seems ready to fully commit to her. He is once-divorced by the time the series opens.\n\nCarrie and Big break up when he leaves New York for a work secondment to Paris and does not show willingness for Carrie to accompany him nor to continue a long-distance relationship, citing commitment issues. Carrie is heartbroken and some months later runs into Big at a party in the Hamptons. He is accompanied by his 20-something year-old girlfriend, Natasha, whom he met in Paris. Despite this, Carrie attempts to be friends with Big. However, this goes awry when he tells her that he and Natasha are getting married, something he'd never considered with Carrie.\n\nIn season 3, Carrie meets and is instantly attracted to up-and-coming [[Manhattan]] furniture designer Aidan Shaw ([[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]]) who becomes her boyfriend. Aidan is more traditional and patient about relationships than many of Carrie's other love interests, and for a while they are happy together. At a furniture show, the pair run into Natasha and Big, who confides to Carrie that he made a mistake marrying Natasha and wants out. Soon afterward, Big and Carrie begin an affair, which ends only when Natasha catches Carrie at Big's apartment.\n\nWracked with guilt, Carrie tells Aidan of the affair on the day of Charlotte's wedding to Trey, and Aidan breaks up with her. Aidan and Carrie reunite in Season 4, when Aidan opens a bar with Miranda's ex, Steve. Carrie realizes she is still in love with Aidan and wins him back. He struggles to trust her, particularly as Mr. Big has gotten divorced from Natasha, and he and Carrie maintain a platonic friendship. Carrie stands firm on her friendship with Big, even inviting him up to Aidan's cabin after a girl had broken up with him.\n\nWhen Carrie's building goes co-op, Aidan offers to buy her apartment (and the one next door) so they can move in together. She agrees and later finds an engagement ring in his gym bag. Aidan later proposes, and Carrie accepts.\n\nAidan is initially patient with Carrie's reluctance to set a wedding date but soon begins to push her, suggesting they get married in Hawaii. Carrie has a panic attack whilst trying on wedding dresses with Miranda, and again when Aidan is knocking down the wall between her apartment and the one next door. She confesses to Aidan that she's not ready and needs more time. He agrees to slow things down but, at a Black and White ball not long afterward, he pressures her to commit, making it clear that he still doesn't trust she's over Big. Carrie cannot commit, and they break up soon afterward.\n\nThe famous artist Aleksandr Petrovsky ([[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]) becomes Carrie's lover in the final season. Despite their age difference, he sweeps her off her feet with huge romantic gestures and shows her foreign pockets of New York she has never seen before.\n\nCarrie also makes plans to move to [[Paris]] with Aleksandr for his work. The rest of the women are not keen on Aleksandr, particularly Miranda, who feels that he is controlling and that Carrie is different around him.\n\nOn the night before Carrie leaves, Mr. Big turns up at her home. The two argue in the street with Carrie accusing him of turning up whenever she's happy to ruin things for her. She tells him to leave her alone.\n\nWhen Carrie arrives in Paris, she finds Aleksandr frequently absent with work on his art show. She is left to wander the streets of Paris alone day after day and begins to regret her decision. She confides in Miranda during a phone conversation that she is lonely and that Aleks is neglecting her.\n\nMeanwhile, back in New York, Charlotte hears a message Mr. Big leaves Carrie on her answering machine admitting that he loves her. Charlotte invites Big to the coffee shop where he enlists the help of Carrie's friends, asking if they think he has a chance. Miranda, armed with the information from Carrie, simply says, \"Go get our girl\", and Big goes to Paris to win her back.\n\nCarrie, having once again been abandoned by Aleksandr (having given up the opportunity to go to a party with some new friends to accompany him to a preview of his show), has it out with him in their hotel room. Aleksandr smacks Carrie in the face and breaks her diamond necklace.\n\nAs Carrie is in the lobby, trying to obtain a room for the night, Big walks in. They see each other, he tells her she's \"the one\" (something she's been waiting for their entire relationship), and he takes her home to New York.\n\n===Charlotte York===\n[[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte York]] ([[Kristin Davis]]) has had a conventional, privileged [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] [[Connecticut]] upbringing and works in an art gallery. Charlotte is a classic over-achiever and perfectionist: a \"straight A\" student who attended [[Smith College]], where she was a member of [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] (note that there are no sororities at the real Smith College) majoring in art history with a minor in finance. During the series, it is also revealed that Charlotte was voted [[homecoming]] queen, [[prom]] queen, \"most popular\", student body president, and track team captain, in addition to being an active cheerleader and teen model.\n\nShe is the [[antithesis]] of Samantha: optimistic, hopelessly romantic, and a believer in true love and soul mates. She places the most emphasis on emotional love as opposed to lust. From the beginning, Charlotte is searching for her \"[[knight in shining armor]]\", and nothing shakes her belief of finding \"the one\", getting married, and starting a family. All her dating activity during the show is in pursuit of a long-term, monogamous boyfriend with a view to marriage. As such, she typically dates men of \"pedigree\" and money (bankers, doctors, lawyers, etc.).\n\nCharlotte can be a dark horse, and we learn that she once had a dalliance with an [[Orthodox Jew]]ish artist, she dressed in drag for a portrait, and she allowed an artist to paint a picture of her [[vulva]]. She can be an \"East Side Princess\" sometimes, and she and Samantha occasionally come to blows over their differing opinions about love and sex.\n\nIn season 3, Charlotte decides she will be married that year and sets about canvassing her married friends to set her up on dates. One married friend usurps her blind date to try and start an affair with her. Horrified, she dashes into the street and trips in front of a taxi, carrying Trey MacDougal ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), an attractive, old-money, Scottish-American cardiologist with pedigree, a [[Park Avenue]] apartment and country estate in Connecticut. They fall in love at first sight, and he appears to be everything she has always wanted. Things move quickly and Charlotte, convinced he is the one, suggests they marry. He agrees, and they are married very shortly afterward (with the help of wedding planner Anthony Marentino; a gay Sicilian who is as forceful as Charlotte is timid).\n\nWishing to \"do things the right way\", Charlotte has withheld having sex with Trey, hoping for a romantic and traditional wedding night. On the evening before the big day, she gets drunk with the other women and goes to Trey for sex. Unfortunately, it does not go well; Trey reveals he suffers from [[impotence]].\n\nWhile concerned, Charlotte presses ahead with the wedding, although she confides in Carrie just before walking down the aisle. As the marriage begins things do not get any better in their intimate relationship, and Trey refuses to address matters either physically or psychologically, resisting their marriage counselor's advice. Matters are not helped by Trey's overbearing mother Bunny ([[Frances Sternhagen]]), a manipulative sort who intrudes on Trey and Charlotte's relationship and apartment on a regular basis. Not long into the marriage, on a weekend trip to the MacDougal country estate, Charlotte is caught in a clinch with the hunky gardener and this seals the fate of her marriage to Trey. Trey and Charlotte separate, and she moves back into her old apartment.\n\nWhile separated, Charlotte and Trey mend their sexual relationship and get back together. All seems to be well, and Charlotte resumes living with Trey. To mark a new beginning and letting go of Bunny's control, she redecorates the apartment, and the couple decides to create a baby room and try for a baby. Having no luck, Charlotte seeks fertility treatment and is told she has a very low chance of becoming pregnant. Seeking other options, she begins hormone injections and looks into adopting a Chinese baby girl.\n\nA combination of these factors once again ignites old tensions with Trey and Bunny, culminating in Trey's deciding he no longer wants a family. This blow to her hopes and dreams proves too much for Charlotte, and she finishes the marriage once and for all.\n\nWhen Charlotte's marriage ends, she meets Harry Goldenblatt ([[Evan Handler]]), her Jewish divorce lawyer, at the beginning of season 5. She is not attracted to him initially but, spurred on by Anthony, she starts a purely physical relationship with Harry. Harry is the opposite of Trey: short, bald, hairy, uncouth but funny, passionate, and attentive. Their sexual relationship is fulfilling, and eventually they begin dating properly. However, Harry says he cannot be serious with Charlotte because she isn't a Jew.\n\nBelieving Harry to be her future, Charlotte converts to Judaism and this sees her struggle with losing her Christian faith and ideologies including Christmas and Easter. After her conversion, Charlotte celebrates her first [[Shabbat]] with Harry but loses her temper when he appears to not appreciate all her efforts. The row quickly evolves into Charlotte's badgering Harry to propose and, feeling pressured, he storms out, and they break up.\n\nCharlotte is heartbroken. Some time later, at a singles event at the [[synagogue]], she bumps into Harry. She tells him she loves him and doesn't care if he never marries her as long as they can be together. Having missed her, too, Harry proposes, and they marry in a traditional Jewish ceremony.\n\nCharlotte, against all the odds, becomes pregnant after [[acupuncture]] therapy but loses the baby very early on. They later go on to adopt a baby girl, Lily, from China, and it is revealed during ''[[Sex and the City: The Movie]]'' that Charlotte later naturally conceives and gives birth to the couple's second daughter, Rose.\n\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| align = right\n| image1 = Kim Cattrall Meet Monica Velour 2011.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Kim Cattrall]] plays PR business woman [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]\n| width1 = 200\n| image2 = Cynthia Nixon 2009 portrait.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Cynthia Nixon]] plays the role of lawyer [[Miranda Hobbes]]\n| width2 = 200\n}}\n\n===Samantha Jones===\nThe oldest and most sexually confident of the foursome, [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]] ([[Kim Cattrall]]) is an independent businesswoman with a career in public relations (PR). She is confident, strong, and extremely outspoken, and calls herself a \"try-sexual\" (meaning she'll try anything once). Early on in the show, Samantha declares she has given up on relationships and has decided to just have sex \"like a man\", that is: without emotions or feelings, and purely for physical gratification.\n\nSamantha has numerous, extremely brief sexual relationships throughout the show, including a lesbian relationship with an artist named Maria ([[S\u00f4nia Braga]]). This is her first stab at monogamy, but she soon gets bored and goes back to her old ways. Later, she wins the PR business for hotel magnate Richard Wright ([[James Remar]]), who is the male equivalent of herself: good-looking, sexually carefree, and not interested in long-term relationships. She and Richard soon end up together and Samantha feels herself falling for him and is no longer attracted to other men.\n\nFrightened by this, she attempts to hide her feelings but Richard is also falling for her. He pursues her with expensive gifts and romantic gestures, and despite her reluctance, they begin a monogamous relationship. Not long afterward, Samantha becomes suspicious of Richard and catches him cheating on her, which breaks her heart. They reunite not long afterward when Richard apologises, but Samantha develops jealousy and is unable to trust him around other women. She decides to end the relationship before he breaks her heart again.\n\nIn the final season, Samantha seduces young waiter Jerry/Smith Jerrod ([[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]]), a much younger struggling actor whose career jump starts thanks to Samantha's PR connections. He mentions being a recovering alcoholic who attends [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]].\n\nSmith manages to win Samantha's heart thanks to the strength of their physical connection and his patience with her issues with commitment. In the final season, Samantha is diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoes chemotherapy treatments. She loses her hair, and Smith shaves his head to support her.\n\nThey remain together and, in the first movie, it is revealed that Samantha has moved to Los Angeles with Smith to further his career and become his manager/agent. However, she breaks up with him in the end because she can't adapt to the Californian lifestyle, he becomes too busy at work to spend as much time with her, and she misses being her old self and New York.\n\n===Miranda Hobbes===\n[[Miranda Hobbes]] ([[Cynthia Nixon]]) is a career-minded lawyer with cynical views on relationships and men. A 1990 [[Harvard Law School]] graduate from the Philadelphia area, she is Carrie's confidante and voice of reason. In the early seasons, Miranda is portrayed as distrustful and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] of men, and this is something she struggles with throughout most of the show. Carrie sets up Miranda on a blind date with her geeky friend Skipper, but he is too sweet and passive for Miranda.\n\nMiranda's main relationship is with bartender Steve Brady ([[David Eigenberg]]), whom she meets by chance one night. They have a one-night stand, but Steve pursues Miranda, eventually becoming her boyfriend.\n\nSteve and Miranda have a great relationship, but Steve feels uncomfortable with Miranda's success and money given that he makes a low wage. Things come to a head when Miranda attempts to buy Steve a suit to wear to an event at her law firm. He refuses, maxes out his credit cards to buy it, but then returns it and breaks up with her, saying that she deserves someone who is more on her level.\n\nLater, in season 2, Miranda runs from Steve when she sees him on the street, but he goes to her house to confront her. They start hanging out as friends but eventually end up getting back together, and Steve moves into Miranda's apartment. Steve is keen to move things forward in their relationship by having a baby, but Miranda cites her career as a barrier to this as she is on partner track at her law firm. Instead, they agree to get a puppy, which proves to be a disaster as she feels she is doing all the work, and Steve behaves like an overgrown child. They break up.\n\nSteve takes Miranda's criticisms to heart and later opens his own bar with Carrie's ex Aidan Shaw. Miranda runs into Steve, who tells her about the bar and thanks her for spurring him on. They begin a friendship of sorts.\n\nIn season 4, we discover that Steve has testicular cancer, and Miranda sets out to \"help\" Steve, realizing he doesn't have healthcare. She helps him through his operation and subsequent treatment, and they become close.\n\nSteve confides that he is depressed about losing a testicle. Feeling sorry for him, Miranda has sex with him. Soon afterward, Miranda discovers she is pregnant (something she thought was impossible, as she had been diagnosed with a \"lazy ovary\").\n\nAt the same time, Charlotte is struggling to get pregnant with Trey's baby and is furious when she discovers that Miranda is not only pregnant but is planning to have an abortion. At the clinic with Carrie, Miranda decides she cannot go through with the procedure and decides to keep the baby. She later gives birth to a son whom she names Brady (Steve's last name).\n\nShe and Steve share custody, and raise him with the help of Miranda's hired housekeeper/nanny Magda, an older Ukrainian/Eastern European woman who remains a constant in Miranda's life. The show charts Miranda's struggle as a single, working professional mother and her feelings at losing her old single life.\n\nMiranda later realizes she is still in love with Steve. Unfortunately, before she can confess this to Steve, he announces he has a new girlfriend, Debbie\u2014a much younger girl from his native Queens area of New York. Not wishing to rock the boat, Miranda decides not to tell Steve, and things remain platonic between them.\n\nSoon afterward, a new man moves into Miranda's building: Robert Leeds, an attractive African-American doctor who works for the New York Knicks basketball team. He is divorced, handsome, and makes it clear that he is interested in Miranda. They start a relationship that becomes serious when Robert tells Miranda he loves her (albeit by giving her a giant cookie with the words, \"I Love You\", written on it in chocolate chips).\n\nMiranda feels unable to say it back to him, though,  and in a moment of epiphany at Brady's first birthday party, she blurts out to Steve that she loves him and is sorry for losing him. Steve reassures her that he loves her too, and soon afterward they break up with their respective partners and get back together.\n\nMiranda and Steve decide to marry in a low-key ceremony in a community garden. Living together in Miranda's one-bedroom apartment (in the same building as her now-hostile ex, Robert) proves to be cramped, and they decide to buy a bigger place and eventually move to a house in Brooklyn (much to Miranda's initial dismay).\n\nIn the final episodes of season 6, Miranda and Steve care for Steve's mother Mary, who is suffering from [[dementia]]/[[Alzheimer's]].\n\n===Recurring roles===\n;List of notables recurring roles during series\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin-right:auto\"\n|-\n!Portrayed by\n!Character\n!Notes\n!Recurring seasons\n!Episodes\n!Episode count\n|-\n|[[Chris Noth]]\n|[[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big (John James Preston)]]\n|Carrie's on-again-off-again boyfriend now husband\n|1\u20136\n|1.01\u20136.20\n|41\n|-\n|[[David Eigenberg]]\n|[[Steve Brady|Steven \"Steve\" Brady]]\n|Miranda's boyfriend, now husband\n|2\u20136\n|2.08\u20136.20\n|41\n|-\n|[[Willie Garson]]\n|Stanford Blatch\n|Carrie's friend\n|1\u20136\n|1.01\u20136.18\n|27\n|-\n|[[Kyle MacLachlan]]\n|Trey MacDougal\n|Charlotte's first husband\n|3\u20134\n|3.07\u20134.18\n|23\n|-\n|[[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]]\n|Aidan Shaw\n|Carrie's boyfriend\n|3\u20134, 6\n|3.05\u20134.16, 6.01\n|22\n|-\n|[[Evan Handler]]\n|Harry Goldenblatt\n|Charlotte's lawyer and second husband\n|5\u20136\n|5.06\u20136.20\n|18\n|-\n|[[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]]\n|Jerry \"Smith\" Jerrod\n|Samantha's boyfriend\n|6\n|6.02\u20136.20\n|18\n|-\n|[[Lynn Cohen]]\n|Magda\n|Miranda's housekeeper\n|3\u20136\n|3.03\u20136.20\n|13\n|-\n|[[James Remar]]\n|Richard Wright\n|Samantha's boyfriend\n|4\u20135, 6\n|4.10\u20135.03, 6.13\n|12\n|-\n|[[Mario Cantone]]\n|Anthony Marantino\n|Charlotte's wedding planner and friend\n|3\u20136\n|3.11\u20136.20\n|12\n|-\n|[[Frances Sternhagen]]\n|Bunny MacDougal\n|Trey's mother\n|3\u20135\n|3.09\u20135.06\n|10\n|-\n|[[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]\n|Aleksandr Petrovsky\n|Carrie's boyfriend, 'The Russian'\n|6\n|6.12\u20136.20\n|9\n|-\n|[[Ron Livingston]]\n|Jack Berger\n|Carrie's boyfriend\n|5\u20136\n|5.05\u20136.06\n|8\n|-\n|[[Sean Palmer]]\n|Marcus Adant\n|Stanford's boyfriend\n|5\u20136\n|5.04\u20136.18\n|8\n|-\n|[[Bridget Moynahan]]\n|Natasha Naginsky\n|Mr. Big's second wife\n|2\u20133\n|2.17\u20133.17\n|7\n|-\n|[[Ben Weber (actor)|Ben Weber]]\n|Skipper Johnston\n|Miranda's boyfriend\n|1\u20132\n|1.01\u20132.14\n|7\n|-\n|[[Blair Underwood]]\n|Dr. Robert E.

At a birthday party for Miranda, Carrie and her friends decide to start having sex \"like men\", meaning without emotional attachment. However, she realizes she cannot after getting brushed off by a man she has sex with one time later.\n\nCarrie has many chance encounters with a handsome businessman whom Samantha refers to as \"Mr. Big\". They begin to date, but Carrie is dismayed to find out he is still seeing other people. Although he eventually agrees to exclusivity, he doesn't introduce Carrie to his mother and won't refer to her as \"the one\", so rather than going on a planned vacation with him, Carrie breaks it off.\n\nCarrie sets up Miranda with her friend Skipper. Miranda and he date on and off; he is more laid back while Miranda is more forceful. After they break up, Miranda sees him with another woman and feels compelled to resume their relationship, but they again break up when he wants exclusivity and she does not.\n\nCharlotte dates a marriage-minded man but they clash over china patterns. She declines to have anal sex with another boyfriend and also consents to pose nude for a famous painter.\n\nSamantha sleeps with an artist who likes to videotape his encounters, with Charlotte's doorman, with a married couple, and with others. When she meets James, who seems utterly perfect for her, she's heartbroken to discover that he has an extremely small penis.\n\n===Season 2 (1999)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 2)}}\nCarrie dates a baseball player while on the rebound but breaks it off when she realizes she's not over Big. She then dates a sell-out filmmaker, a shoplifter, and a nice guy she scares away by snooping, and then takes up with Big again. She at first keeps this from her friends. Her and Big's relationship is rocky, and when he announces that he might have to move to Paris for a year but doesn't overtly invite Carrie to come with him, they break up a second time. Carrie then tries without success to convert a friend-with-benefits to something more, dates a writer with a great family but who is always \"early\" in bed, and then a recovering alcoholic who uses Carrie to replace his old addiction. She then runs into Big, returned from Paris, and his new 20-something fianc\u00e9e, Natasha (played by [[Bridget Moynahan]]).\n\nMiranda dates a dirty talker, fakes it with an ophthalmologist, and tries to adjust to a guy who likes to watch porn during sex. By the time she meets Steve, the bartender, she's unwilling to believe he is as nice as he seems. They start dating but the differences in their schedules and their finances lead to a breakup. She winds up back in bed with Steve, but not before dating a guy who wants to get caught, a Peeping Tom in the next building, and a divorced dad.\n\nCharlotte encounters a legendary purveyor of cunnilingus, a handy actor next door, a widower on the make, a man who undergoes adult circumcision, a famous actor, a too-effeminate pastry chef, a shoe salesman with a foot fetish, and a 20-something guy who gives her crabs.\n\nDespite a brief attempt at couples therapy, Samantha breaks up with James. She then sleeps with a litigator, a salsa dancer, her personal trainer, a sports fan who can only rally when his team does well, and Charlotte's brother. She then meets a man whose penis is too big even for her.\n\nThe end of Season two also marks the end of characters' [[Fourth wall|talking directly to the camera]].\n\n===Season 3 (2000)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 3)}}\nCarrie starts off dating a politician, followed by a [[bisexual]] person. Big marries Natasha, and Carrie meets Aidan, a furniture maker. They have a virtually flaw-free relationship until Carrie and Big begin an affair. When Natasha catches Carrie in Natasha and Big's apartment, Carrie and Big's affair ends as do eventually both Big's marriage and Carrie's relationship with Aidan.\n\nMiranda and Steve move in together. He tells Miranda he'd like them to have a baby, but a puppy purchase instead alerts Miranda to the fact that they're very different when it comes to maturity. Steve moves out and Miranda makes partner at her law firm. She also goes on to date a phone sex guy, a fake ER doctor, a guy who doesn't swallow his food, and a police detective.\n\nCharlotte, looking for a husband, dates an investment banker with an anger management problem, a photographer who gets her into menswear, a bad kisser, and a climax name caller. She then meets Trey MacDougal; despite an awkward \"proposal\", the discovery of his low libido and inability to perform sexually the night before their marriage, and conflict with his domineering mother, the two marry. They begin their marriage with a sexless honeymoon, and as sex remains an ongoing problem in their relationship, the two eventually separate.\n\nSamantha sleeps with a firefighter, a short man, her assistant, a black guy with a disapproving sister, a recreational [[Viagra]] user, a guy who tastes bad, Trey's Scottish cousin, a [[dildo]] model, and a college-aged virgin. She also has a [[menopause]] scare, gets tested for HIV, and buys a new apartment in the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]], where she has to make peace with the [[transgender women]] on her street.\n\nAfter Carrie's break-ups with Big and Aidan, she dates a guy who still lives at home, teaches a class at the [[Learning Annex]] on how to meet men, gets mugged, and tries to apologize to Natasha. She and Big also make an attempt at being friends.\n\n===Season 4 (2001\u201302)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 4)}}\nAfter a chance meeting with Aidan at the opening of a bar he co-owns, Carrie convinces him to restart their relationship. He moves into her apartment after purchasing it when her building goes [[co-op]] and then proposes. Despite her misgivings, Carrie accepts the proposal and then eventually realizes she's not ready for marriage. Despite discussing her concerns and initially agreeing to give her more time, Aidan soon pressures Carrie for marriage. She realizes this is because he does not trust her, given her past affair with Big. They break up and he moves out, and Carrie purchases her apartment after Charlotte lends her the down payment in the form of the engagement ring she received from Trey. At the end of Season Four, Carrie discovers that Big has sold his apartment and is moving to [[Napa, California]].\n\nCharlotte and Trey are living apart but continuing to have marital relations; they eventually reconcile and Charlotte moves back into their shared apartment. They decide to try for a baby but realize Charlotte is reproductively challenged; after [[fertility]] treatments and discussing adoption, their marriage breaks apart under the strain and they decide to divorce.\n\nMiranda supports Steve through [[testicular cancer]] and surgery. Later, when he feels emasculated by the surgery, they have sex and Miranda gets pregnant. She initially considers an abortion, which is particularly distressing to Charlotte, as she deals with her struggles to get pregnant, but Miranda decides to keep the baby.\n\nSamantha flirts with a priest, has nude photos taken of herself, tries to have a relationship with a lesbian, and sleeps with a baby talker, a wrestling coach, and a farmer. She then lands a big PR account with resolutely single hotel magnate Richard Wright. They begin a relationship that starts out as purely sexual but becomes something more to both of them, and they attempt [[monogamy]]. However, she eventually catches him cheating, and they break up.\n\n===Season 5 (2002)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 5)}}\nCarrie spends time by herself in Season Five; she fears this means she will be fired from writing her sex column, but instead a publisher wants to turn the columns into a book. A book tour lands her in San Francisco, where she reunites briefly with Big. In New York, she meets Jack Berger, a fellow author with whom she feels sparks, but who is attached.\n\nSamantha tries again with Richard but finds herself constantly paranoid. On a trip to Atlantic City with Richard and the girls, she cannot overcome her lack of trust in him and breaks it off for good.\n\nMiranda is now mother to son Brady and finds it difficult to work, date, and carry on her previous lifestyle. Steve is supportive, and she falls into bed with him one afternoon, making her question her feelings for him.\n\nCharlotte has a run-in with her former mother-in-law over the legalities of the apartment she shared with Trey, and she hires Harry Goldenblatt as her divorce attorney. Despite his physical shortcomings she finds herself attracted to him, and they begin a sexual relationship. She soon finds that she is developing real feelings for him. Harry, however, reveals that he must marry within his Jewish faith, causing Charlotte to actually consider conversion.\n\n===Season 6 (2003\u201304)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 6)}}\nCarrie begins dating Jack Berger, who is termed her best 'mental match' of all her relationships. However, his struggles as an author and her success with her upcoming book cause too much conflict between them, and they break up. Big returns to New York for [[angioplasty]], and Carrie realizes she still has feelings for him; she also realizes he still cannot fully commit. After he returns to Napa, she meets Aleksandr, a famous Russian artist. Aleksandr seems to be attentive to her in a way that Big never was, and he asks her to come to Paris with him. She does, briefly, but realizes how inattentive he is when working, and she breaks it off with him just as Big arrives in Paris, looking for her, ready to finally commit to her being \"the one\".\n\nCharlotte decides that life with Harry, who accepts her fertility issues, would be worth converting to Judaism. After this process, she presses Harry to \"set the date\" in an insulting way and he breaks it off with her. However, they run into each other at a mixer and, after her tearful apology, rekindle their relationship and eventually marry. After fertility treatments fail, they decide to adopt, and eventually learn they have been approved to adopt a child from China.\n\nOnce Miranda realizes she's still in love with Steve, he begins a serious relationship with someone else (Debbie), and so she does the same with Robert (played by Blair Underwood). However, at their son Brady's first birthday party, they reveal their feelings for each other and renew their relationship. Miranda proposes to Steve and they marry in a community park. Needing more room for their growing family, she consents to moving to [[Brooklyn]], where they buy a brownstone. After Steve's mother Mary (played by [[Anne Meara]]) is revealed to have suffered a stroke and subsequent memory loss, she moves in with the couple.\n\nSamantha begins a relationship with a much younger waiter, Jerry Jerrod, who turns out to be a struggling actor. She uses her PR skills to help his career, even changing his name to Smith Jerrod. Despite trying to keep their relationship as casual as her others, she develops true feelings for him. Smith supports her after she is diagnosed with breast cancer, shaving his own head in sympathy after catching her shaving her head when [[chemotherapy]] makes her hair fall out. He also insists on waiting for her when her treatment diminishes her sex drive. When he flies home from his movie shoot just to tell her that he loves her, she replies, \"You have meant more to me than any man I've ever known.\"\n\nThe season and the series concludes with the four girlfriends reunited in New York City, and with Carrie receiving a phone call from Big (which finally reveals his first name, John), telling her that his Napa house is up for sale and he is headed back to New York. Carrie's final voiceover states: \"The most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you find someone to love the you ''you'' love, well, that's just fabulous.\"\n\n==Reception==\n''Sex and the City'' premiered on [[HBO]], June 6, 1998, and was one of the highest-rated sitcoms of the season.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCabe|first1=ed. by Kim Akass & Janet|title=Reading Sex and the City|date=2004|publisher=I.B.

The first clue is in the opening credits of the television show. Carrie is standing in a New York street in a ballet skirt, the sort that toddlers wear. She is dressed, unmistakably, as a child. And, because she is sex columnist on a newspaper, a bus wearing a huge photo of her in a tiny dress trundles past. 'Carrie Bradshaw knows good sex,' says the bus.

The show uses voiceovers to reveal Carrie's inner thought life, which is often in conflict with how she is expressing herself externally. As pop culture expert Ashli L. Dykes points out, \"... [the] fear that men will no longer find a woman attractive if she reveals her true self is in contrast to the relationships among the four main female characters...\"<ref>Dykes, Ashli L. \"'And I Started Wondering....\": Voiceover and Conversation in 'Sex and the City.'\" Studies in Popular Culture, vol. 34, no. 1, 2011, pp. 49\u201366.

Some argue whatever label is applied to the show, it offered an important contribution \"to ongoing dialogue\"<ref>Hermes, Joke (2002). \"Television and Its Viewers in Post-Feminist Dialogue Internet-mediated Response to 'Ally McBeal' and 'Sex and the City'\". ''Ethnofoor''. p. 1.</ref> and that because it \"shows women in a world where they can be feminine, attractive, and feminist at the same time ... the series gives a forum to a renewed postfeminist debate.\"<ref>Adriaens, Fien and Sofie Van Bauwel (2011). \"Sex and the City: A Postfeminist Point of View? Or How Popular Culture Functions as a Channel for Feminist Discourse\". The Journal of Popular Culture, p. 18.</ref>\n\nAndrea Press criticised the show for how it handled topics such as unexpected pregnancy, stating that it contrasts with feminist progressive thought. In one episode, Miranda is faced with an unexpected pregnancy, which causes Carrie to reflect on her own experience of pregnancy and abortion. Press argued that Carrie's shame when sharing this story with her boyfriend serves to \"undermine\" the hard-fought freedoms that allowed her choice with \"multiple critical perspectives toward the act\"<ref name=\"jstor.org\">Press, Andrea. \"Gender and Family in Televisions Golden Age and Beyond.\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, vol. 625, 2009, pp. 139\u2013150. JSTOR, JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40375911.</ref> Press also wrote that, while the show is lauded as a champion of progressive feminism, its characters adhere to a strongly traditional view of female gender roles with a focus on appearance, glamour, and consumerism.<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> The outfits the characters wear are as important as the storyline itself (and sometimes are the storyline itself). A central message of the show is that consumption is key, and we are fed constant marketing messages throughout the series.<ref>Carroll, No\u00ebl. \"Consuming Passion: 'Sex and the City.'\" Revue Internationale De Philosophie, vol. 64, no. 254 (4), 2010, pp. 525\u2013546.

In 2013, [[Glamour (magazine)|''Glamour'' magazine]] called Carrie \"the worst\" character on the show, saying that \"her brattiness and self-absorption eclipsed her redeeming qualities and even her awesome shoes.\"<ref>{{Cite news | last=Angelo | first= Megan | title = Confession: I've Never Been Able to Stand Carrie Bradshaw | newspaper = Glamour | date = January 14, 2013 | url= http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2013/01/carrie-bradshaw.html | accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref> In a 2010 retrospective about the previous two decades in pop culture, [[ABC News]] named Carrie one of the ten worst characters of the past twenty years, calling her a \"snippy, self-righteous Manhattan snob\" and citing the character's actions in ''[[Sex and the City 2]]'' as evidence that she was beyond personal growth or redemption.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Marikar, Sheila | first= Heron, Liz | title = Top 10 Worst TV and Film Characters in the Last 20 | newspaper = ABC News | date = June 4, 2010 | url= http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2013/01/carrie-bradshaw.html | accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref> Emily Nussbaum of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', looking back on the show a decade after it went off the air, argued Bradshaw was \"the unacknowledged first female anti-hero on television,\" who began as a \"happy, curious explorer, out companionably smoking with modellizers [''sic''],\" but from the second season on she \"spun out, becoming anxious, obsessive, and, despite her charm, wildly self-centered.\" Nussbaum also asserted that it is only over time that the show's reputation has \"shrunk and faded,\" largely due to disappointment that the show \"gave in\" to the limits of romantic comedy toward the end of the series. Until then, Nussbaum writes, ''Sex and the City'' \"was sharp, iconoclastic television.\" In answer to the question of why the show is now \"so often portrayed as a set of empty, static cartoons, an embarrassment to womankind,\" Nussbaum wrote: \"It's a classic misunderstanding, I think, stemming from an unexamined hierarchy: the assumption that anything stylized (or formulaic, or pleasurable, or funny, or feminine, or explicit about sex rather than about violence, or made collaboratively) must be inferior.\" Nussbaum also pushed against criticism of ''Sex and the City'' as anti-feminist, arguing for a more complex view of the characters as situated within different waves of feminism: \"Miranda and Carrie were [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]], who believed in egalitarianism; Charlotte and Samantha were [[Third-wave feminism|third-wave feminists]], focused on exploiting the power of femininity, from opposing angles.\"<ref>{{Cite news | last=Nussbaum | first= Emily | title= How \"Sex and the City\" Lost its Good Name| newspaper = The New Yorker| date= July 29, 2013| url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/television/2013/07/29/130729crte_television_nussbaum?currentPage=all | accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA 2018 article in [[The Guardian]] entitled \"'That show was as white as it gets!': Sex and the City's problematic legacy\", pointed to the lack of any non-white series regulars and \"racial insensitivities\" in the show like Carrie's \"ghetto gold\" reference or Samantha's wearing an [[afro]] wig to cover her baldness from [[chemotherapy]].<ref name=\"Ellen E.

Television Distribution]]. [[CBS Television Studios]] (successors to [[Rysher Entertainment]] and [[Paramount Domestic Television]]) and their [[CBS Television Distribution|distribution arm]] own international rights. The series was filmed with traditional broadcast syndication in mind during its run, and pre-planned scenes with different dialogue and content were created specifically for syndication, along with appropriate cuts of each episode to fit a 22-minute timeslot which includes advertising.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2003/09/30/tbs-gets-syndicated-sanitized-sex-and-city/|title=TBS gets syndicated, sanitized ''Sex and the City''|last=Susman|first=Gary|date=30 September 2003|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nThe United States cable channel [[HBO]] was the original broadcaster; [[HBO Go]]/[[HBO Now]] continue to carry the original run of the entire series as originally aired. [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and [[WGN America]] were the first US channels to syndicate the show and utilize the secondary syndicated cut of the series; it also aired on broadcast stations for several seasons. As of 2019, [[E!]] continues to broadcast the syndicated version of the series.\n\n====Canada====\nIn Canada cable channel Bravo aired the first run of the show every Saturday at 11:00 PM, a few weeks behind the U.S. HBO broadcast (the series pre-dated the 2008 existence of [[HBO Canada]]).\n\n====Australia====\nIn Australia, the [[Nine Network]] aired the first run of the show every Monday between 9:30&nbsp;pm and 11:00&nbsp;pm. After 2004 the cable channel [[W. Channel|W]] aired it until summer 2008 when [[Arena (TV network)|Arena]] started airing it in a block with ''[[Will & Grace]]'' with promos stating \"all the good guys are gay\". The series was repeated on [[Network Ten]] from 2005 to 2010, and on Eleven (later known today as [[10 Peach]]) from February 2011. It currently airs in syndication on the cable channel Fox Showcase and occasionally plays marathons on the cable channel Binge, which plays back-to-back episodes of several TV shows.\n\n====Ireland====\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] premiered ''Sex and the City'' in February 1999. Since 2006, repeats of the series aired on [[3e]].\n\n====United Kingdom====\n[[Channel 4]] originally aired the series in the UK with the first episode shown on 3 February 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/255160.stm |title=Women behaving badly |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=February 3, 1999 |accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref> As of August 2009 a double bill of the show airs each weeknight at 10:30&nbsp;pm on [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Comedy Central]] and a double bill airs on Wednesdays from 9&nbsp;pm on [[5*]].

They have been released officially in region 1 (Americas), region 2 (Europe & Middle East), region 3 (Korea), and region 4 (Oceania & South Pacific) formats. In addition to their region encoding, releases vary depending on the region in which they were released.\n\nIn addition to standard single-season DVD box sets of the show, limited edition collectors' editions have been released that include all six seasons in one complete set. These also vary among regions (and the regions are defined differently). While Europe got a complete set that came with special \"shoebox\" packaging (a reference to [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'s love for shoes), the USA and Canada version came packaged in a more traditional fold-out suede case and with an additional bonus DVD that includes many special features. Mexico and Oceania's edition come packaged in a beauty case.\n\nAs well as missing out on some special features, many in Europe had trouble with the region 2 edition of the season 1 DVD. The season was not converted into a [[PAL]] video signal; it instead remained in its original American [[NTSC]] format, which caused compatibility problems with some European television sets and DVD players. All subsequent [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD releases of the program were appropriately transferred to [[PAL]] video using the original film prints, and season 1 has since been re-released in PAL format.\n\nOutside the US, ''Sex and the City'' boxed sets were released through [[Paramount Pictures]]. American and Canadian DVDs were released through the program's original broadcasters, [[HBO]]. In Australia, single editions have been released, wherein each disc is sold separately. In [[South Korea]], complete, six-season, special DVD shoebox sets were released. In Brazil, the first and fifth seasons were released on DVD Dual, but all other seasons were released in DVD [[box sets]].\n\nSelected episodes are also available as part of the ''Sex and the City Essentials'' DVD collection. These are four separately-packaged discs containing three selected episodes that fit a common theme.\n* ''The Best of Lust'': Contains the episodes \"The Fuck Buddy\", \"Running with Scissors\", and \"The Turtle and the Hare\".\n* ''The Best of Mr. Big'': Contains the episodes \"Sex and the City\", \"Ex and the City\", and \"I Heart NY\".\n* ''The Best of Romance'': Contains the episodes \"Baby, Talk is Cheap\", \"Hop, Skip and a Week\", and \"An American Girl in Paris (Part Deux)\".\n* ''The Best of Breakups'': Contains the episodes \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", \"I Love a Charade\", and \"The Post-it Always Sticks Twice\".\n* ''The Best of Fashion'': Contains the episodes \"Secret Sex\", \"The Real Me\", and \"Luck Be an Old Lady\". This DVD was only released to Target stores in the US and was the only DVD of the \"Essentials\" collection to have a colored cover instead of a black and white one like the other four.\n\n==Soundtrack releases==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nTwo digital CDs (the albums from [[Irma Records]]) contain tracks used in the show's actual soundtrack.\n* '''''[[Sex and the City: Music from the HBO Series|Sex and the City \u2013 Soundtrack]]''''' [Import]\n:2000/2001/2002\n:[[Sire Records]]\n:Includes the main theme from the show, written by [[Douglas J.

It is an adaptation of [[Candace Bushnell]]'s [[Sex and the City (book)|1997 book of the same name]]. The series premiered in the United States on June 6, 1998, and concluded on February 22, 2004, with 94 episodes broadcast over six seasons. Throughout its development, the series received contributions from various producers, screenwriters, and directors, principally [[Michael Patrick King]].\n\nSet and filmed in [[New York City]], the show follows the lives of a group of four women\u2014three in their mid-thirties and one in her forties\u2014who, despite their different natures and ever-changing sex lives, remain inseparable and confide in each other. Starring [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] (as [[Carrie Bradshaw]]) and co-starring [[Kim Cattrall]] (as [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]), [[Kristin Davis]] (as [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte York]]), and [[Cynthia Nixon]] (as [[Miranda Hobbes]]), the series had multiple continuing storylines that tackled relevant and modern social issues such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[safe sex]], [[promiscuity]], and [[femininity]], while exploring the difference between friendships and romantic relationships. The deliberate omission of the better part of the early lives of the four women was the writers' way of exploring social life\u2014from sex to relationships\u2014through each of their four very different, individual perspectives.\n\n''Sex and the City'' has received both acclaim and criticism for its subjects and characters, and is credited with helping to increase HBO's popularity as a network.<ref>Nussbaum, Emily (July 29, 2013). \"[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women Difficult Women: How \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 Lost its Good Name]\". ''New Yorker''.</ref> The series has won several accolades, including seven of its 54 [[Emmy Award]] nominations, eight of its 24 [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, and three of its 11 [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nominations.

It spawned two feature films, ''[[Sex and the City (film)|Sex and the City]]'' (2008) and ''[[Sex and the City 2]]'' (2010), and a [[prequel]] television series commissioned by [[The CW]], ''[[The Carrie Diaries (TV series)|The Carrie Diaries]]'' (2013\u20132014).\n\n==Origins==\n\nThe show was based in part on writer [[Candace Bushnell]]'s 1997 [[Sex and the City (book)|book of the same name]], compiled from her column at ''[[The New York Observer]]''. Bushnell has said in several interviews that the [[Carrie Bradshaw]] in her columns is her [[alter ego]]; when she wrote the \"Sex and the City\" essays, she used her own name initially, but for privacy reasons, later created the character played in the series by [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]. Carrie Bradshaw was a writer living in New York City. Carrie Bradshaw and Candace Bushnell have the same initials, a flourish emphasizing their connection. Moreover, just as Carrie Bradshaw has articles for the fictional ''New York Star'' published as a book in later series, the entire ''Sex and the City'' series is based on a compilation of Bushnell's own columns for the ''New York Observer''.\n\n''Sex and the City'' creator [[Darren Star]] wrote the pilot with Parker in mind as Carrie. According to Parker, \"I was flattered but didn't want to do it. He convinced me, begged me to do it, and I signed a contract.\"<ref name=\"tv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.365gay.com/entertainment/feature/022706feature.htm|title=365gay.com|work=Sarah Jessica Parker|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060323111952/http://www.365gay.com/entertainment/feature/022706feature.htm|archivedate=March 23, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=March 16, 2006|df=mdy-all}} available at the</ref> The pilot episode was subsequently shot in June 1997, a year before the series premiered.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rodriguez |first=Karla |url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/sex-and-the-city-darren-star-offered-kristin-davis-carrie-role/ |title='Sex and the City\u2019 Boss Darren Star Offered Kristin Davis the Role of Carrie |publisher=Usmagazine.com |date=2018-05-07 |accessdate=2019-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/au/news/939792/hair-changes-nudity-clauses-and-sarah-jessica-parker-s-reluctance-how-sex-and-the-city-painstakingly-came-together |title=Hair Changes, Nudity Clauses and Sarah Jessica Parker's Reluctance: How Sex and the City Painstakingly Came Together &#124; E!

I didn't think it worked\" and feared it would end her career.<ref name=\"tv\" /> She wanted to get out of the contract, offering to work in three HBO movies unpaid. Though Star would not release her, he listened to her concerns and implemented major changes before shooting the first season. Parker said: \"The funny thing, after the first episode of season one, I never looked back and the rest is history. I never thought, though, that the show would become what it has become.\"<ref name=\"tv\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Sex and the City characters}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|align     = left\n|image1    = Sarah Jessica Parker at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival 3.jpg\n|caption1  = Columnist [[Carrie Bradshaw]] is played by [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]\n|width1    = 200\n|image2    = Kristindavis1999.jpg\n|caption2  = Art dealer and housewife [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt]] is played by [[Kristin Davis]]\n|width2    = 200\n}}\n\n===Carrie Bradshaw===\n[[Carrie Bradshaw]] ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]) is the narrator and main protagonist, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, with each episode structured around her train of thought while writing her weekly column \"Sex and the City\" for the fictitious paper, the ''New York Star.'' A member of the New York glitterati, she is a [[Nightclub|club]]/bar/restaurant staple known for her unique fashion sense and lives in a studio apartment in an [[Upper East Side]] [[brownstone]]. Stanford Blatch, a gay talent agent from an aristocratic family (played by [[Willie Garson]]), is Carrie's best friend outside of the other three women.\n\nCarrie is entangled with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]] ([[Chris Noth]]), a prominent businessman and an aficionado of jazz and cigars whose real name is revealed in the final episode (Season 6, Episode 8) to be John James Preston, in a tumultuous, on-and-off-again relationship. (In a running joke, whenever Carrie is about to introduce Mr. Big on-camera to another character, she is interrupted before she can say his name.) He is the reason for many of Carrie's breakdowns as he never seems ready to fully commit to her. He is once-divorced by the time the series opens.\n\nCarrie and Big break up when he leaves New York for a work secondment to Paris and does not show willingness for Carrie to accompany him nor to continue a long-distance relationship, citing commitment issues. Carrie is heartbroken and some months later runs into Big at a party in the Hamptons. He is accompanied by his 20-something year-old girlfriend, Natasha, whom he met in Paris. Despite this, Carrie attempts to be friends with Big. However, this goes awry when he tells her that he and Natasha are getting married, something he'd never considered with Carrie.\n\nIn season 3, Carrie meets and is instantly attracted to up-and-coming [[Manhattan]] furniture designer Aidan Shaw ([[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]]) who becomes her boyfriend. Aidan is more traditional and patient about relationships than many of Carrie's other love interests, and for a while they are happy together. At a furniture show, the pair run into Natasha and Big, who confides to Carrie that he made a mistake marrying Natasha and wants out. Soon afterward, Big and Carrie begin an affair, which ends only when Natasha catches Carrie at Big's apartment.\n\nWracked with guilt, Carrie tells Aidan of the affair on the day of Charlotte's wedding to Trey, and Aidan breaks up with her. Aidan and Carrie reunite in Season 4, when Aidan opens a bar with Miranda's ex, Steve. Carrie realizes she is still in love with Aidan and wins him back. He struggles to trust her, particularly as Mr. Big has gotten divorced from Natasha, and he and Carrie maintain a platonic friendship. Carrie stands firm on her friendship with Big, even inviting him up to Aidan's cabin after a girl had broken up with him.\n\nWhen Carrie's building goes co-op, Aidan offers to buy her apartment (and the one next door) so they can move in together. She agrees and later finds an engagement ring in his gym bag. Aidan later proposes, and Carrie accepts.\n\nAidan is initially patient with Carrie's reluctance to set a wedding date but soon begins to push her, suggesting they get married in Hawaii. Carrie has a panic attack whilst trying on wedding dresses with Miranda, and again when Aidan is knocking down the wall between her apartment and the one next door. She confesses to Aidan that she's not ready and needs more time. He agrees to slow things down but, at a Black and White ball not long afterward, he pressures her to commit, making it clear that he still doesn't trust she's over Big. Carrie cannot commit, and they break up soon afterward.\n\nThe famous artist Aleksandr Petrovsky ([[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]) becomes Carrie's lover in the final season. Despite their age difference, he sweeps her off her feet with huge romantic gestures and shows her foreign pockets of New York she has never seen before.\n\nCarrie also makes plans to move to [[Paris]] with Aleksandr for his work. The rest of the women are not keen on Aleksandr, particularly Miranda, who feels that he is controlling and that Carrie is different around him.\n\nOn the night before Carrie leaves, Mr. Big turns up at her home. The two argue in the street with Carrie accusing him of turning up whenever she's happy to ruin things for her. She tells him to leave her alone.\n\nWhen Carrie arrives in Paris, she finds Aleksandr frequently absent with work on his art show. She is left to wander the streets of Paris alone day after day and begins to regret her decision. She confides in Miranda during a phone conversation that she is lonely and that Aleks is neglecting her.\n\nMeanwhile, back in New York, Charlotte hears a message Mr. Big leaves Carrie on her answering machine admitting that he loves her. Charlotte invites Big to the coffee shop where he enlists the help of Carrie's friends, asking if they think he has a chance. Miranda, armed with the information from Carrie, simply says, \"Go get our girl\", and Big goes to Paris to win her back.\n\nCarrie, having once again been abandoned by Aleksandr (having given up the opportunity to go to a party with some new friends to accompany him to a preview of his show), has it out with him in their hotel room. Aleksandr smacks Carrie in the face and breaks her diamond necklace.\n\nAs Carrie is in the lobby, trying to obtain a room for the night, Big walks in. They see each other, he tells her she's \"the one\" (something she's been waiting for their entire relationship), and he takes her home to New York.\n\n===Charlotte York===\n[[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte York]] ([[Kristin Davis]]) has had a conventional, privileged [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] [[Connecticut]] upbringing and works in an art gallery. Charlotte is a classic over-achiever and perfectionist: a \"straight A\" student who attended [[Smith College]], where she was a member of [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] (note that there are no sororities at the real Smith College) majoring in art history with a minor in finance. During the series, it is also revealed that Charlotte was voted [[homecoming]] queen, [[prom]] queen, \"most popular\", student body president, and track team captain, in addition to being an active cheerleader and teen model.\n\nShe is the [[antithesis]] of Samantha: optimistic, hopelessly romantic, and a believer in true love and soul mates. She places the most emphasis on emotional love as opposed to lust. From the beginning, Charlotte is searching for her \"[[knight in shining armor]]\", and nothing shakes her belief of finding \"the one\", getting married, and starting a family. All her dating activity during the show is in pursuit of a long-term, monogamous boyfriend with a view to marriage. As such, she typically dates men of \"pedigree\" and money (bankers, doctors, lawyers, etc.).\n\nCharlotte can be a dark horse, and we learn that she once had a dalliance with an [[Orthodox Jew]]ish artist, she dressed in drag for a portrait, and she allowed an artist to paint a picture of her [[vulva]]. She can be an \"East Side Princess\" sometimes, and she and Samantha occasionally come to blows over their differing opinions about love and sex.\n\nIn season 3, Charlotte decides she will be married that year and sets about canvassing her married friends to set her up on dates. One married friend usurps her blind date to try and start an affair with her. Horrified, she dashes into the street and trips in front of a taxi, carrying Trey MacDougal ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), an attractive, old-money, Scottish-American cardiologist with pedigree, a [[Park Avenue]] apartment and country estate in Connecticut. They fall in love at first sight, and he appears to be everything she has always wanted. Things move quickly and Charlotte, convinced he is the one, suggests they marry. He agrees, and they are married very shortly afterward (with the help of wedding planner Anthony Marentino; a gay Sicilian who is as forceful as Charlotte is timid).\n\nWishing to \"do things the right way\", Charlotte has withheld having sex with Trey, hoping for a romantic and traditional wedding night. On the evening before the big day, she gets drunk with the other women and goes to Trey for sex. Unfortunately, it does not go well; Trey reveals he suffers from [[impotence]].\n\nWhile concerned, Charlotte presses ahead with the wedding, although she confides in Carrie just before walking down the aisle. As the marriage begins things do not get any better in their intimate relationship, and Trey refuses to address matters either physically or psychologically, resisting their marriage counselor's advice. Matters are not helped by Trey's overbearing mother Bunny ([[Frances Sternhagen]]), a manipulative sort who intrudes on Trey and Charlotte's relationship and apartment on a regular basis. Not long into the marriage, on a weekend trip to the MacDougal country estate, Charlotte is caught in a clinch with the hunky gardener and this seals the fate of her marriage to Trey. Trey and Charlotte separate, and she moves back into her old apartment.\n\nWhile separated, Charlotte and Trey mend their sexual relationship and get back together. All seems to be well, and Charlotte resumes living with Trey. To mark a new beginning and letting go of Bunny's control, she redecorates the apartment, and the couple decides to create a baby room and try for a baby. Having no luck, Charlotte seeks fertility treatment and is told she has a very low chance of becoming pregnant. Seeking other options, she begins hormone injections and looks into adopting a Chinese baby girl.\n\nA combination of these factors once again ignites old tensions with Trey and Bunny, culminating in Trey's deciding he no longer wants a family. This blow to her hopes and dreams proves too much for Charlotte, and she finishes the marriage once and for all.\n\nWhen Charlotte's marriage ends, she meets Harry Goldenblatt ([[Evan Handler]]), her Jewish divorce lawyer, at the beginning of season 5. She is not attracted to him initially but, spurred on by Anthony, she starts a purely physical relationship with Harry. Harry is the opposite of Trey: short, bald, hairy, uncouth but funny, passionate, and attentive. Their sexual relationship is fulfilling, and eventually they begin dating properly. However, Harry says he cannot be serious with Charlotte because she isn't a Jew.\n\nBelieving Harry to be her future, Charlotte converts to Judaism and this sees her struggle with losing her Christian faith and ideologies including Christmas and Easter. After her conversion, Charlotte celebrates her first [[Shabbat]] with Harry but loses her temper when he appears to not appreciate all her efforts. The row quickly evolves into Charlotte's badgering Harry to propose and, feeling pressured, he storms out, and they break up.\n\nCharlotte is heartbroken. Some time later, at a singles event at the [[synagogue]], she bumps into Harry. She tells him she loves him and doesn't care if he never marries her as long as they can be together. Having missed her, too, Harry proposes, and they marry in a traditional Jewish ceremony.\n\nCharlotte, against all the odds, becomes pregnant after [[acupuncture]] therapy but loses the baby very early on. They later go on to adopt a baby girl, Lily, from China, and it is revealed during ''[[Sex and the City: The Movie]]'' that Charlotte later naturally conceives and gives birth to the couple's second daughter, Rose.\n\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = \n| align = right\n| image1 = Kim Cattrall Meet Monica Velour 2011.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Kim Cattrall]] plays PR business woman [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]]\n| width1 = 200\n| image2 = Cynthia Nixon 2009 portrait.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Cynthia Nixon]] plays the role of lawyer [[Miranda Hobbes]]\n| width2 = 200\n}}\n\n===Samantha Jones===\nThe oldest and most sexually confident of the foursome, [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha Jones]] ([[Kim Cattrall]]) is an independent businesswoman with a career in public relations (PR). She is confident, strong, and extremely outspoken, and calls herself a \"try-sexual\" (meaning she'll try anything once). Early on in the show, Samantha declares she has given up on relationships and has decided to just have sex \"like a man\", that is: without emotions or feelings, and purely for physical gratification.\n\nSamantha has numerous, extremely brief sexual relationships throughout the show, including a lesbian relationship with an artist named Maria ([[S\u00f4nia Braga]]). This is her first stab at monogamy, but she soon gets bored and goes back to her old ways. Later, she wins the PR business for hotel magnate Richard Wright ([[James Remar]]), who is the male equivalent of herself: good-looking, sexually carefree, and not interested in long-term relationships. She and Richard soon end up together and Samantha feels herself falling for him and is no longer attracted to other men.\n\nFrightened by this, she attempts to hide her feelings but Richard is also falling for her. He pursues her with expensive gifts and romantic gestures, and despite her reluctance, they begin a monogamous relationship. Not long afterward, Samantha becomes suspicious of Richard and catches him cheating on her, which breaks her heart. They reunite not long afterward when Richard apologises, but Samantha develops jealousy and is unable to trust him around other women. She decides to end the relationship before he breaks her heart again.\n\nIn the final season, Samantha seduces young waiter Jerry/Smith Jerrod ([[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]]), a much younger struggling actor whose career jump starts thanks to Samantha's PR connections. He mentions being a recovering alcoholic who attends [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]].\n\nSmith manages to win Samantha's heart thanks to the strength of their physical connection and his patience with her issues with commitment. In the final season, Samantha is diagnosed with breast cancer and undergoes chemotherapy treatments. She loses her hair, and Smith shaves his head to support her.\n\nThey remain together and, in the first movie, it is revealed that Samantha has moved to Los Angeles with Smith to further his career and become his manager/agent. However, she breaks up with him in the end because she can't adapt to the Californian lifestyle, he becomes too busy at work to spend as much time with her, and she misses being her old self and New York.\n\n===Miranda Hobbes===\n[[Miranda Hobbes]] ([[Cynthia Nixon]]) is a career-minded lawyer with cynical views on relationships and men. A 1990 [[Harvard Law School]] graduate from the Philadelphia area, she is Carrie's confidante and voice of reason. In the early seasons, Miranda is portrayed as distrustful and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] of men, and this is something she struggles with throughout most of the show. Carrie sets up Miranda on a blind date with her geeky friend Skipper, but he is too sweet and passive for Miranda.\n\nMiranda's main relationship is with bartender Steve Brady ([[David Eigenberg]]), whom she meets by chance one night. They have a one-night stand, but Steve pursues Miranda, eventually becoming her boyfriend.\n\nSteve and Miranda have a great relationship, but Steve feels uncomfortable with Miranda's success and money given that he makes a low wage. Things come to a head when Miranda attempts to buy Steve a suit to wear to an event at her law firm. He refuses, maxes out his credit cards to buy it, but then returns it and breaks up with her, saying that she deserves someone who is more on her level.\n\nLater, in season 2, Miranda runs from Steve when she sees him on the street, but he goes to her house to confront her. They start hanging out as friends but eventually end up getting back together, and Steve moves into Miranda's apartment. Steve is keen to move things forward in their relationship by having a baby, but Miranda cites her career as a barrier to this as she is on partner track at her law firm. Instead, they agree to get a puppy, which proves to be a disaster as she feels she is doing all the work, and Steve behaves like an overgrown child. They break up.\n\nSteve takes Miranda's criticisms to heart and later opens his own bar with Carrie's ex Aiden Shaw. Miranda runs into Steve, who tells her about the bar and thanks her for spurring him on. They begin a friendship of sorts.\n\nIn season 4, we discover that Steve has testicular cancer, and Miranda sets out to \"help\" Steve, realizing he doesn't have healthcare. She helps him through his operation and subsequent treatment, and they become close.\n\nSteve confides that he is depressed about losing a testicle. Feeling sorry for him, Miranda has sex with him. Soon afterward, Miranda discovers she is pregnant (something she thought was impossible, as she had been diagnosed with a \"lazy ovary\").\n\nAt the same time, Charlotte is struggling to get pregnant with Trey's baby and is furious when she discovers that Miranda is not only pregnant but is planning to have an abortion. At the clinic with Carrie, Miranda decides she cannot go through with the procedure and decides to keep the baby. She later gives birth to a son whom she names Brady (Steve's last name).\n\nShe and Steve share custody, and raise him with the help of Miranda's hired housekeeper/nanny Magda, an older Ukrainian/Eastern European woman who remains a constant in Miranda's life. The show charts Miranda's struggle as a single, working professional mother and her feelings at losing her old single life.\n\nMiranda later realizes she is still in love with Steve. Unfortunately, before she can confess this to Steve, he announces he has a new girlfriend, Debbie\u2014a much younger girl from his native Queens area of New York. Not wishing to rock the boat, Miranda decides not to tell Steve, and things remain platonic between them.\n\nSoon afterward, a new man moves into Miranda's building: Robert Leeds, an attractive African-American doctor who works for the New York Knicks basketball team. He is divorced, handsome, and makes it clear that he is interested in Miranda. They start a relationship that becomes serious when Robert tells Miranda he loves her (albeit by giving her a giant cookie with the words, \"I Love You\", written on it in chocolate chips).\n\nMiranda feels unable to say it back to him, though,  and in a moment of epiphany at Brady's first birthday party, she blurts out to Steve that she loves him and is sorry for losing him. Steve reassures her that he loves her too, and soon afterward they break up with their respective partners and get back together.\n\nMiranda and Steve decide to marry in a low-key ceremony in a community garden. Living together in Miranda's one-bedroom apartment (in the same building as her now-hostile ex, Robert) proves to be cramped, and they decide to buy a bigger place and eventually move to a house in Brooklyn (much to Miranda's initial dismay).\n\nIn the final episodes of season 6, Miranda and Steve care for Steve's mother Mary, who is suffering from [[dementia]]/[[Alzheimer's]].\n\n===Recurring roles===\n;List of notables recurring roles during series\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin-right:auto\"\n|-\n!Portrayed by\n!Character\n!Notes\n!Recurring seasons\n!Episodes\n!Episode count\n|-\n|[[Chris Noth]]\n|[[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big (John James Preston)]]\n|Carrie's on-again-off-again boyfriend now husband\n|1\u20136\n|1.01\u20136.20\n|41\n|-\n|[[David Eigenberg]]\n|[[Steve Brady|Steven \"Steve\" Brady]]\n|Miranda's boyfriend, now husband\n|2\u20136\n|2.08\u20136.20\n|41\n|-\n|[[Willie Garson]]\n|Stanford Blatch\n|Carrie's friend\n|1\u20136\n|1.01\u20136.18\n|27\n|-\n|[[Kyle MacLachlan]]\n|Trey MacDougal\n|Charlotte's first husband\n|3\u20134\n|3.07\u20134.18\n|23\n|-\n|[[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]]\n|Aidan Shaw\n|Carrie's boyfriend\n|3\u20134, 6\n|3.05\u20134.16, 6.01\n|22\n|-\n|[[Evan Handler]]\n|Harry Goldenblatt\n|Charlotte's lawyer and second husband\n|5\u20136\n|5.06\u20136.20\n|18\n|-\n|[[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]]\n|Jerry \"Smith\" Jerrod\n|Samantha's boyfriend\n|6\n|6.02\u20136.20\n|18\n|-\n|[[Lynn Cohen]]\n|Magda\n|Miranda's housekeeper\n|3\u20136\n|3.03\u20136.20\n|13\n|-\n|[[James Remar]]\n|Richard Wright\n|Samantha's boyfriend\n|4\u20135, 6\n|4.10\u20135.03, 6.13\n|12\n|-\n|[[Mario Cantone]]\n|Anthony Marantino\n|Charlotte's wedding planner and friend\n|3\u20136\n|3.11\u20136.20\n|12\n|-\n|[[Frances Sternhagen]]\n|Bunny MacDougal\n|Trey's mother\n|3\u20135\n|3.09\u20135.06\n|10\n|-\n|[[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]\n|Aleksandr Petrovsky\n|Carrie's boyfriend, 'The Russian'\n|6\n|6.12\u20136.20\n|9\n|-\n|[[Ron Livingston]]\n|Jack Berger\n|Carrie's boyfriend\n|5\u20136\n|5.05\u20136.06\n|8\n|-\n|[[Sean Palmer]]\n|Marcus Adant\n|Stanford's boyfriend\n|5\u20136\n|5.04\u20136.18\n|8\n|-\n|[[Bridget Moynahan]]\n|Natasha Naginsky\n|Mr. Big's second wife\n|2\u20133\n|2.17\u20133.17\n|7\n|-\n|[[Ben Weber (actor)|Ben Weber]]\n|Skipper Johnston\n|Miranda's boyfriend\n|1\u20132\n|1.01\u20132.14\n|7\n|-\n|[[Blair Underwood]]\n|Dr. Robert E.

At a birthday party for Miranda, Carrie and her friends decide to start having sex \"like men\", meaning without emotional attachment. However, she realizes she cannot after getting brushed off by a man she has sex with one time later.\n\nCarrie has many chance encounters with a handsome businessman whom Samantha refers to as \"Mr. Big\". They begin to date, but Carrie is dismayed to find out he is still seeing other people. Although he eventually agrees to exclusivity, he doesn't introduce Carrie to his mother and won't refer to her as \"the one\", so rather than going on a planned vacation with him, Carrie breaks it off.\n\nCarrie sets up Miranda with her friend Skipper. Miranda and he date on and off; he is more laid back while Miranda is more forceful. After they break up, Miranda sees him with another woman and feels compelled to resume their relationship, but they again break up when he wants exclusivity and she does not.\n\nCharlotte dates a marriage-minded man but they clash over china patterns. She declines to have anal sex with another boyfriend and also consents to pose nude for a famous painter.\n\nSamantha sleeps with an artist who likes to videotape his encounters, with Charlotte's doorman, with a married couple, and with others. When she meets James, who seems utterly perfect for her, she's heartbroken to discover that he has an extremely small penis.\n\n===Season 2 (1999)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 2)}}\nCarrie dates a baseball player while on the rebound but breaks it off when she realizes she's not over Big. She then dates a sell-out filmmaker, a shoplifter, and a nice guy she scares away by snooping, and then takes up with Big again. She at first keeps this from her friends. Her and Big's relationship is rocky, and when he announces that he might have to move to Paris for a year but doesn't overtly invite Carrie to come with him, they break up a second time. Carrie then tries without success to convert a friend-with-benefits to something more, dates a writer with a great family but who is always \"early\" in bed, and then a recovering alcoholic who uses Carrie to replace his old addiction. She then runs into Big, returned from Paris, and his new 20-something fianc\u00e9e, Natasha (played by [[Bridget Moynahan]]).\n\nMiranda dates a dirty talker, fakes it with an ophthalmologist, and tries to adjust to a guy who likes to watch porn during sex. By the time she meets Steve, the bartender, she's unwilling to believe he is as nice as he seems. They start dating but the differences in their schedules and their finances lead to a breakup. She winds up back in bed with Steve, but not before dating a guy who wants to get caught, a Peeping Tom in the next building, and a divorced dad.\n\nCharlotte encounters a legendary purveyor of cunnilingus, a handy actor next door, a widower on the make, a man who undergoes adult circumcision, a famous actor, a too-effeminate pastry chef, a shoe salesman with a foot fetish, and a 20-something guy who gives her crabs.\n\nDespite a brief attempt at couples therapy, Samantha breaks up with James. She then sleeps with a litigator, a salsa dancer, her personal trainer, a sports fan who can only rally when his team does well, and Charlotte's brother. She then meets a man whose penis is too big even for her.\n\nThe end of Season two also marks the end of characters' [[Fourth wall|talking directly to the camera]].\n\n===Season 3 (2000)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 3)}}\nCarrie starts off dating a politician, followed by a [[bisexual]] person. Big marries Natasha, and Carrie meets Aidan, a furniture maker. They have a virtually flaw-free relationship until Carrie and Big begin an affair. When Natasha catches Carrie in Natasha and Big's apartment, Carrie and Big's affair ends as do eventually both Big's marriage and Carrie's relationship with Aidan.\n\nMiranda and Steve move in together. He tells Miranda he'd like them to have a baby, but a puppy purchase instead alerts Miranda to the fact that they're very different when it comes to maturity. Steve moves out and Miranda makes partner at her law firm. She also goes on to date a phone sex guy, a fake ER doctor, a guy who doesn't swallow his food, and a police detective.\n\nCharlotte, looking for a husband, dates an investment banker with an anger management problem, a photographer who gets her into menswear, a bad kisser, and a climax name caller. She then meets Trey MacDougal; despite an awkward \"proposal\", the discovery of his low libido and inability to perform sexually the night before their marriage, and conflict with his domineering mother, the two marry. They begin their marriage with a sexless honeymoon, and as sex remains an ongoing problem in their relationship, the two eventually separate.\n\nSamantha sleeps with a firefighter, a short man, her assistant, a black guy with a disapproving sister, a recreational [[Viagra]] user, a guy who tastes bad, Trey's Scottish cousin, a [[dildo]] model, and a college-aged virgin. She also has a [[menopause]] scare, gets tested for HIV, and buys a new apartment in the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]], where she has to make peace with the [[transgender women]] on her street.\n\nAfter Carrie's break-ups with Big and Aidan, she dates a guy who still lives at home, teaches a class at the [[Learning Annex]] on how to meet men, gets mugged, and tries to apologize to Natasha. She and Big also make an attempt at being friends.\n\n===Season 4 (2001\u201302)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 4)}}\nAfter a chance meeting with Aidan at the opening of a bar he co-owns, Carrie convinces him to restart their relationship. He moves into her apartment after purchasing it when her building goes [[co-op]] and then proposes. Despite her misgivings, Carrie accepts the proposal and then eventually realizes she's not ready for marriage. Despite discussing her concerns and initially agreeing to give her more time, Aidan soon pressures Carrie for marriage. She realizes this is because he does not trust her, given her past affair with Big. They break up and he moves out, and Carrie purchases her apartment after Charlotte lends her the down payment in the form of the engagement ring she received from Trey. At the end of Season Four, Carrie discovers that Big has sold his apartment and is moving to [[Napa, California]].\n\nCharlotte and Trey are living apart but continuing to have marital relations; they eventually reconcile and Charlotte moves back into their shared apartment. They decide to try for a baby but realize Charlotte is reproductively challenged; after [[fertility]] treatments and discussing adoption, their marriage breaks apart under the strain and they decide to divorce.\n\nMiranda supports Steve through [[testicular cancer]] and surgery. Later, when he feels emasculated by the surgery, they have sex and Miranda gets pregnant. She initially considers an abortion, which is particularly distressing to Charlotte, as she deals with her struggles to get pregnant, but Miranda decides to keep the baby.\n\nSamantha flirts with a priest, has nude photos taken of herself, tries to have a relationship with a lesbian, and sleeps with a baby talker, a wrestling coach, and a farmer. She then lands a big PR account with resolutely single hotel magnate Richard Wright. They begin a relationship that starts out as purely sexual but becomes something more to both of them, and they attempt [[monogamy]]. However, she eventually catches him cheating, and they break up.\n\n===Season 5 (2002)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 5)}}\nCarrie spends time by herself in Season Five; she fears this means she will be fired from writing her sex column, but instead a publisher wants to turn the columns into a book. A book tour lands her in San Francisco, where she reunites briefly with Big. In New York, she meets Jack Berger, a fellow author with whom she feels sparks, but who is attached.\n\nSamantha tries again with Richard but finds herself constantly paranoid. On a trip to Atlantic City with Richard and the girls, she cannot overcome her lack of trust in him and breaks it off for good.\n\nMiranda is now mother to son Brady and finds it difficult to work, date, and carry on her previous lifestyle. Steve is supportive, and she falls into bed with him one afternoon, making her question her feelings for him.\n\nCharlotte has a run-in with her former mother-in-law over the legalities of the apartment she shared with Trey, and she hires Harry Goldenblatt as her divorce attorney. Despite his physical shortcomings she finds herself attracted to him, and they begin a sexual relationship. She soon finds that she is developing real feelings for him. Harry, however, reveals that he must marry within his Jewish faith, causing Charlotte to actually consider conversion.\n\n===Season 6 (2003\u201304)===\n{{Main|Sex and the City (season 6)}}\nCarrie begins dating Jack Berger, who is termed her best 'mental match' of all her relationships. However, his struggles as an author and her success with her upcoming book cause too much conflict between them, and they break up. Big returns to New York for [[angioplasty]], and Carrie realizes she still has feelings for him; she also realizes he still cannot fully commit. After he returns to Napa, she meets Aleksandr, a famous Russian artist. Aleksandr seems to be attentive to her in a way that Big never was, and he asks her to come to Paris with him. She does, briefly, but realizes how inattentive he is when working, and she breaks it off with him just as Big arrives in Paris, looking for her, ready to finally commit to her being \"the one\".\n\nCharlotte decides that life with Harry, who accepts her fertility issues, would be worth converting to Judaism. After this process, she presses Harry to \"set the date\" in an insulting way and he breaks it off with her. However, they run into each other at a mixer and, after her tearful apology, rekindle their relationship and eventually marry. After fertility treatments fail, they decide to adopt, and eventually learn they have been approved to adopt a child from China.\n\nOnce Miranda realizes she's still in love with Steve, he begins a serious relationship with someone else (Debbie), and so she does the same with Robert (played by Blair Underwood). However, at their son Brady's first birthday party, they reveal their feelings for each other and renew their relationship. Miranda proposes to Steve and they marry in a community park. Needing more room for their growing family, she consents to moving to [[Brooklyn]], where they buy a brownstone. After Steve's mother Mary (played by [[Anne Meara]]) is revealed to have suffered a stroke and subsequent memory loss, she moves in with the couple.\n\nSamantha begins a relationship with a much younger waiter, Jerry Jerrod, who turns out to be a struggling actor. She uses her PR skills to help his career, even changing his name to Smith Jerrod. Despite trying to keep their relationship as casual as her others, she develops true feelings for him. Smith supports her after she is diagnosed with breast cancer, shaving his own head in sympathy after catching her shaving her head when [[chemotherapy]] makes her hair fall out. He also insists on waiting for her when her treatment diminishes her sex drive. When he flies home from his movie shoot just to tell her that he loves her, she replies, \"You have meant more to me than any man I've ever known.\"\n\nThe season and the series concludes with the four girlfriends reunited in New York City, and with Carrie receiving a phone call from Big (which finally reveals his first name, John), telling her that his Napa house is up for sale and he is headed back to New York. Carrie's final voiceover states: \"The most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And if you find someone to love the you ''you'' love, well, that's just fabulous.\"\n\n==Reception==\n''Sex and the City'' premiered on [[HBO]], June 6, 1998, and was one of the highest-rated sitcoms of the season.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCabe|first1=ed. by Kim Akass & Janet|title=Reading Sex and the City|date=2004|publisher=I.B.

The first clue is in the opening credits of the television show. Carrie is standing in a New York street in a ballet skirt, the sort that toddlers wear. She is dressed, unmistakably, as a child. And, because she is sex columnist on a newspaper, a bus wearing a huge photo of her in a tiny dress trundles past. 'Carrie Bradshaw knows good sex,' says the bus. And there, before any dialogue hits your ears, you have the two woeful female archetypes that ''Sex and the City'' loves\u2014woman as sex object and woman as child ...

The show uses voiceovers to reveal Carrie's inner thought life, which is often in conflict with how she is expressing herself externally. As pop culture expert Ashli L. Dykes points out, \"... [the] fear that men will no longer find a woman attractive if she reveals her true self is in contrast to the relationships among the four main female characters...\"<ref>Dykes, Ashli L. \"'And I Started Wondering....\": Voiceover and Conversation in 'Sex and the City.'\" Studies in Popular Culture, vol. 34, no. 1, 2011, pp. 49\u201366.

Some argue whatever label is applied to the show, it offered an important contribution \"to ongoing dialogue\"<ref>Hermes, Joke (2002). \"Television and Its Viewers in Post-Feminist Dialogue Internet-mediated Response to 'Ally McBeal' and 'Sex and the City'\".

Or How Popular Culture Functions as a Channel for Feminist Discourse\". The Journal of Popular Culture, p. 18.</ref>\n\nAndrea Press criticised the show for how it handled topics such as unexpected pregnancy, stating that it contrasts with feminist progressive thought. In one episode, Miranda is faced with an unexpected pregnancy, which causes Carrie to reflect on her own experience of pregnancy and abortion. Press argued that Carrie's shame when sharing this story with her boyfriend serves to \"undermine\" the hard-fought freedoms that allowed her choice with \"multiple critical perspectives toward the act\"<ref name=\"jstor.org\">Press, Andrea. \"Gender and Family in Televisions Golden Age and Beyond.\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, vol. 625, 2009, pp. 139\u2013150.

In 2013, [[Glamour (magazine)|''Glamour'' magazine]] called Carrie \"the worst\" character on the show, saying that \"her brattiness and self-absorption eclipsed her redeeming qualities and even her awesome shoes.\"<ref>{{Cite news | last=Angelo | first= Megan | title = Confession: I've Never Been Able to Stand Carrie Bradshaw | newspaper = Glamour | date = January 14, 2013 | url= http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2013/01/carrie-bradshaw.html | accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref> In a 2010 retrospective about the previous two decades in pop culture, [[ABC News]] named Carrie one of the ten worst characters of the past twenty years, calling her a \"snippy, self-righteous Manhattan snob\" and citing the character's actions in ''[[Sex and the City 2]]'' as evidence that she was beyond personal growth or redemption.<ref>{{Cite news | last=Marikar, Sheila | first= Heron, Liz | title = Top 10 Worst TV and Film Characters in the Last 20 | newspaper = ABC News | date = June 4, 2010 | url= http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2013/01/carrie-bradshaw.html | accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref> Emily Nussbaum of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', looking back on the show a decade after it went off the air, argued Bradshaw was \"the unacknowledged first female anti-hero on television,\" who began as a \"happy, curious explorer, out companionably smoking with modellizers [''sic''],\" but from the second season on she \"spun out, becoming anxious, obsessive, and, despite her charm, wildly self-centered.\" Nussbaum also asserted that it is only over time that the show's reputation has \"shrunk and faded,\" largely due to disappointment that the show \"gave in\" to the limits of romantic comedy toward the end of the series. Until then, Nussbaum writes, ''Sex and the City'' \"was sharp, iconoclastic television.\" In answer to the question of why the show is now \"so often portrayed as a set of empty, static cartoons, an embarrassment to womankind,\" Nussbaum wrote: \"It's a classic misunderstanding, I think, stemming from an unexamined hierarchy: the assumption that anything stylized (or formulaic, or pleasurable, or funny, or feminine, or explicit about sex rather than about violence, or made collaboratively) must be inferior.\" Nussbaum also pushed against criticism of ''Sex and the City'' as anti-feminist, arguing for a more complex view of the characters as situated within different waves of feminism: \"Miranda and Carrie were [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]], who believed in egalitarianism; Charlotte and Samantha were [[Third-wave feminism|third-wave feminists]], focused on exploiting the power of femininity, from opposing angles.\"<ref>{{Cite news | last=Nussbaum | first= Emily | title= How \"Sex and the City\" Lost its Good Name| newspaper = The New Yorker| date= July 29, 2013| url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/television/2013/07/29/130729crte_television_nussbaum?currentPage=all | accessdate = April 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA 2018 article in [[The Guardian]] entitled \"'That show was as white as it gets!': Sex and the City's problematic legacy\", pointed to the lack of any non-white series regulars and \"racial insensitivities\" in the show like Carrie's \"ghetto gold\" reference or Samantha's wearing an [[afro]] wig to cover her baldness from [[chemotherapy]].<ref name=\"Ellen E.

Season two was broadcast from June until October 1999. Season three aired from June until October 2000. Season four was broadcast in two parts: from June until August 2001, and then in January and February 2002. Season five, truncated due to Parker's pregnancy, aired on HBO during the summer of 2002.

Television Distribution]]. [[CBS Television Studios]] (successors to [[Rysher Entertainment]] and [[Paramount Domestic Television]]) and their [[CBS Television Distribution|distribution arm]] own international rights. The series was filmed with traditional broadcast syndication in mind during its run, and pre-planned scenes with different dialogue and content were created specifically for syndication, along with appropriate cuts of each episode to fit a 22-minute timeslot which includes advertising.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2003/09/30/tbs-gets-syndicated-sanitized-sex-and-city/|title=TBS gets syndicated, sanitized ''Sex and the City''|last=Susman|first=Gary|date=30 September 2003|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n====United States====\nThe United States cable channel [[HBO]] was the original broadcaster; [[HBO Go]]/[[HBO Now]] continue to carry the original run of the entire series as originally aired. [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and [[WGN America]] were the first US channels to syndicate the show and utilize the secondary syndicated cut of the series; it also aired on broadcast stations for several seasons. As of 2019, [[E!]] continues to broadcast the syndicated version of the series.\n\n====Canada====\nIn Canada cable channel Bravo aired the first run of the show every Saturday at 11:00 PM, a few weeks behind the U.S. HBO broadcast (the series pre-dated the 2008 existence of [[HBO Canada]]).\n\n====Australia====\nIn Australia, the [[Nine Network]] aired the first run of the show every Monday between 9:30&nbsp;pm and 11:00&nbsp;pm. After 2004 the cable channel [[W. Channel|W]] aired it until summer 2008 when [[Arena (TV network)|Arena]] started airing it in a block with ''[[Will & Grace]]'' with promos stating \"all the good guys are gay\". The series was repeated on [[Network Ten]] from 2005 to 2010, and on Eleven (later known today as [[10 Peach]]) from February 2011. It currently airs in syndication on the cable channel Fox Showcase and occasionally plays marathons on the cable channel Binge, which plays back-to-back episodes of several TV shows.\n\n====Ireland====\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] premiered ''Sex and the City'' in February 1999. Since 2006, repeats of the series aired on [[3e]].\n\n====United Kingdom====\n[[Channel 4]] originally aired the series in the UK with the first episode shown on 3 February 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/255160.stm |title=Women behaving badly |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=February 3, 1999 |accessdate=June 9, 2018}}</ref> As of August 2009 a double bill of the show airs each weeknight at 10:30&nbsp;pm on [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Comedy Central]] and a double bill airs on Wednesdays from 9&nbsp;pm on [[5*]]. From 2015, the show has been repeated on [[CBS Drama]]. Starting on February 26, 2018, the series returned to Channel 4 on its music-oriented channel, [[4Music]].\n\n==Home media==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nThe first five seasons of ''Sex and the City'' were released on [[VHS]] in box sets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041209234213/http://store.hbo.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=1885703&view=all&cp=1885647|title=HBO Store - Sex and the City: Video / DVD: Search for|date=December 9, 2004|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nAll six seasons of ''Sex and the City'' have been released commercially on [[DVD]], with season six being split into two parts. They have been released officially in region 1 (Americas), region 2 (Europe & Middle East), region 3 (Korea), and region 4 (Oceania & South Pacific) formats. In addition to their region encoding, releases vary depending on the region in which they were released.\n\nIn addition to standard single-season DVD box sets of the show, limited edition collectors' editions have been released that include all six seasons in one complete set. These also vary among regions (and the regions are defined differently). While Europe got a complete set that came with special \"shoebox\" packaging (a reference to [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'s love for shoes), the USA and Canada version came packaged in a more traditional fold-out suede case and with an additional bonus DVD that includes many special features. Mexico and Oceania's edition come packaged in a beauty case.\n\nAs well as missing out on some special features, many in Europe had trouble with the region 2 edition of the season 1 DVD. The season was not converted into a [[PAL]] video signal; it instead remained in its original American [[NTSC]] format, which caused compatibility problems with some European television sets and DVD players. All subsequent [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD releases of the program were appropriately transferred to [[PAL]] video using the original film prints, and season 1 has since been re-released in PAL format.\n\nOutside the US, ''Sex and the City'' boxed sets were released through [[Paramount Pictures]]. American and Canadian DVDs were released through the program's original broadcasters, [[HBO]]. In Australia, single editions have been released, wherein each disc is sold separately. In [[South Korea]], complete, six-season, special DVD shoebox sets were released. In Brazil, the first and fifth seasons were released on DVD Dual, but all other seasons were released in DVD [[box sets]].\n\nSelected episodes are also available as part of the ''Sex and the City Essentials'' DVD collection. These are four separately-packaged discs containing three selected episodes that fit a common theme.\n* ''The Best of Lust'': Contains the episodes \"The Fuck Buddy\", \"Running with Scissors\", and \"The Turtle and the Hare\".\n* ''The Best of Mr. Big'': Contains the episodes \"Sex and the City\", \"Ex and the City\", and \"I Heart NY\".\n* ''The Best of Romance'': Contains the episodes \"Baby, Talk is Cheap\", \"Hop, Skip and a Week\", and \"An American Girl in Paris (Part Deux)\".\n* ''The Best of Breakups'': Contains the episodes \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", \"I Love a Charade\", and \"The Post-it Always Sticks Twice\".\n* ''The Best of Fashion'': Contains the episodes \"Secret Sex\", \"The Real Me\", and \"Luck Be an Old Lady\". This DVD was only released to Target stores in the US and was the only DVD of the \"Essentials\" collection to have a colored cover instead of a black and white one like the other four.\n\n==Soundtrack releases==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nTwo digital CDs (the albums from [[Irma Records]]) contain tracks used in the show's actual soundtrack.\n* '''''[[Sex and the City: Music from the HBO Series|Sex and the City \u2013 Soundtrack]]''''' [Import]\n:2000/2001/2002\n:[[Sire Records]]\n:Includes the main theme from the show, written by [[Douglas J.
