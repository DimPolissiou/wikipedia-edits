Primarily a [[tag team]] wrestler, Lane held [[championship (professional wrestling)|championships]] including the [[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship]], [[WCW United States Tag Team Championship|NWA United States Tag Team Championship]], [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team Championship]], and [[SMW Tag Team Championship]] as part of [[The Fabulous Ones]], [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]], and [[The Heavenly Bodies (1990s tag team)|The Heavenly Bodies]].<ref name=\"Cagematch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr=947|title=Stan Lane|work=Cagematch.net|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Pope2005\">{{cite book|author=Kristian Pope|title=Tuff Stuff Professional Wrestling Field Guide: Legend and Lore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcRlZN7dIP0C&pg=PA270|date=14 August 2005|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=1-4402-2810-8|pages=270}}</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Championship Wrestling from Florida (1978\u20131980; 1986\u20131987)===\nLane was trained by [[Ric Flair]], debuting in 1978.<ref name=\"Cagematch\"/> He initially wrestled primarily for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]].\n\n===Continental Wrestling Association / United States Wrestling Association (1981\u20131985; 1990\u20131991)===\n{{Main|The Fabulous Ones}}\nIn 1982, Stan Lane went to Mid-South Wrestling and formed a team called The Fabulous Ones with [[Steve Keirn]].<ref name=\"Rickard2010\">{{cite book|author=Mike Rickard|title=Wrestling's Greatest Moments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDQQg4IBJPMC&pg=PT80|date=15 December 2010|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55490-331-3|pages=80}}</ref> The team feuded with [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]], [[Jerry Lawler]] & [[Bill Dundee]], [[The Bushwhackers|The Sheepherders]] ([[Butch Miller (wrestler)|Butch Miller]] & [[Luke Williams (wrestler)|Luke Williams]]), [[Randy Savage]] & [[Lanny Poffo|Leapin' Lanny Poffo]] and [[The Moondogs (professional wrestling)|The Moondogs]] with whom they had a series of exceptionally bloody matches. They were also pioneers in the \"[[MTV]] style\" of promotion, creating promotional videos and spectacular entrances with their popular theme song \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\" by [[Billy Squier]]. The Fabulous Ones was actually started in Memphis by Jerry Jarrett & Jackie Fargo.\n\nIn December 1990, to fans excitement, he reformed the Fabulous Ones with Keirn briefly in the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA), with Cornette as their manager. On January 7, 1991, they won the USWA Tag Team titles, defeating [[Tony Anthony (wrestler)|Tony Anthony]] and [[Doug Gilbert]]. Three weeks later, on January 28, after a controversial match with [[Jeff Jarrett]] and [[Jerry Lawler]], the titles were held up; a week later, on February 4, the rematch for the held-up titles was held and they lost the match and the titles to Lawler and Jarrett.\n\n===American Wrestling Association (1984\u20131986)===\n\n===Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling (1987\u20131990)===\n{{see also|The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|l1=The Midnight Express}}\n\nIn early 1987, [[Dennis Condrey]] left [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] abruptly, leaving former partner [[Bobby Eaton]] & manager [[Jim Cornette]] as a tag-team with only one member. Enter a man that Eaton was very familiar with and who was no stranger to tag-team wrestling, Stan Lane formerly of ''the Fabulous Ones'''. Lane and Eaton knew each other well from working against each other in the past and this showed as the new version of the Midnight Express jelled from the beginning. Early on, \"Sweet\" Stan added a deep radio \"DJ voice\" for manager Jim Cornette that would enrage the crowd.\n\nIn May 1987 the combination of Eaton and Lane proved to be a golden one as they won the [[WCW United States Tag Team Championship|NWA US Tag-Team titles]] (a title they would win three times during their time together). A year later the team was cheered on to victory as the Midnight Express won the NWA World Tag-Team Titles from [[The Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] members [[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tully Blanchard]] ''(See also: [[The Brain Busters|Brain Busters]])'' on September 10, 1988. This feat meant that they were the first tag-team to ever hold both the NWA World tag-team and NWA United States tag-team titles, a feat only the Steiner Brothers would go on to duplicate in 1991. The Express' run with the belts was a short one; they were defeated by [[The Road Warriors]] in a match that marked Hawk and Animal's first title reign.\n\nFrustrated by their inability to win the tag belts in previous years, the Warriors and manager [[Paul Ellering]] had decided to return to their roots as violent thugs who would do anything to win. This new attitude soon paid off with a title victory over Lane and Eaton. On October 29, 1988, the Midnights' reign came to a quick and violent end in New Orleans. At the beginning of the match, Ellering brutally attacked Express manager Jim Cornette outside the ring. When Lane jumped in, the Warriors battered and bloodied Eaton, leaving Lane to fight both Hawk and Animal essentially on his own. Eaton was eventually able to tag in, but was quickly overwhelmed by Animal and pinned after a vicious clothesline.\n\nNow the fan favorites the Midnight Express soon had to contend with a blast from the past, '''The Original Midnight Express''' as it consisted of Dennis Condrey and [[Randy Rose]], who had teamed up before Condrey and Eaton became a team. During the November 5 episode of ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'', Jim Cornette (kayfabe) received an anonymous phone call, as the caller ridiculed Cornette over Eaton and Lane's loss of the NWA World Tag Team Championship to The Road Warriors on October 29. Cornette recognized the caller and basically asked him to come say it to his face. At that point, Dangerously and the Original Midnight Express hit the ring and proceeded to pummel Cornette and Stan Lane, who was wrestling in a singles match. By the time Bobby Eaton showed up, it was three on one. Cornette showed up the next week on [[WPCH-TV|TBS]] carrying his blood stained suit jacket and the feud was on.\n\nThe teams wrestled at [[Starrcade (1988)|Starrcade '88]], but nothing was solved. The Midnights vs. Midnights would be the hottest feud in WCW for months, building up to a six-man tag match involving the managers on pay-per-view in February 1989. The one who got pinned would have to leave the promotion. However, WCW (the former [[Jim Crockett Promotions]]) was under new ownership and in transition at the time and many wrestlers were coming and going. At the last minute, Condrey decided to leave WCW. [[Jack Victory]] was brought in as his replacement and the match went forward, but at this point no one really cared.\n\nDue to various booking issues, Jim Cornette and the Midnight Express left the promotion for a short while, around the time that [[Ted Turner]] brought out Jim Crockett and began promoting the federation as the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] / [[World Championship Wrestling]]. When the booking issues started to clear up, Cornette and the Midnight Express returned to the federation and a very strong tag-team division. One of those teams was The Dynamic Dudes ([[Shane Douglas]] and [[John Laurinaitis|Johnny Ace]]), who admitted that the Midnight Express was one of their favorite teams and asked if Cornette would be their manager as well. Cornette agreed but the Midnight Express were not happy about it at all. After arguing, Jim Cornette stopped accompanying the Express to the ring, choosing to only manage the Dudes. At the [[Clash of Champions IX]] the two teams met with Jim Cornette in a neutral corner, forced to choose between the teams. The Express started out very aggressively, especially for a team that was supposed to be fan favorites and when the night was over the Midnight Express had once again established themselves as heels with Jim Cornette in their corner; Cornette had never stopped siding with the Express.\n\nAfter their heel turn, the Midnight Express started feuding with [[Brian Pillman|Flyin' Brian]] and [[Tom Zenk|\"Z-Man\" Tom Zenk]] over the recently re-activated US Tag-Team titles, winning the gold from the young team in early 1990. The Midnight Express would lose the titles to [[The Steiner Brothers]] three months later.\n\nAfter appearing at [[Halloween Havoc (1990)|Halloween Havoc 1990]], the Midnight Express split up when Cornette and Lane left the federation, due to conflicts with [[Jim Herd]] and booker [[Ole Anderson]]. For the first time in seven years there was no Midnight Express; it was the end of an era in tag-team wrestling.\n\n===Independent circuit (1990\u20131992)===\nDuring 1991-1992, Lane competed in multiple independent wrestling organizations, including the Tri State Wrestling Alliance, the [[Global Wrestling Federation]] (GWF), the WWA, [[South Atlantic Pro Wrestling]] (SAPW), the AWF, the VWA, and the IWA. During his stay in the GWF he wrestled and lost to [[The Patriot (wrestler)|The Patriot]] in matches for the [[GWF Television Championship|TV]] and [[GWF North American Heavyweight Championship|North American heavyweight titles]]. During his stay in the AWF, Stan Lane competed against [[Paul Orndorff]] in the heavyweight title tournament, but lost in the final match, but Lane later won the title. Lane also held the tag team title with Jeff Collette in the VWA, and was managed by The Big Cheese during his time in the IWA.<ref>Inside Wrestling, The Wrestler, Pro Wrestling Illustrated</ref>\n\n===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1992\u20131993)===\n{{Main|The Heavenly Bodies (1990s tag team)|l1=The Heavenly Bodies}}\nIn 1992, Lane and Cornette went to [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW), to form a new team called \"The Heavenly Bodies\" with [[Tom Prichard]]. They feuded with [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] and won the tag team titles 5 times, until he retired from the ring after losing a loser leaves town match and was replaced in the team by [[Jimmy Del Ray]].\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1993\u20131995)===\nLane retired in 1993 and went to work for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), as a member of the WWF's broadcast team. He began as a color commentator alongside Vince McMahon on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''. He then went on to become the host of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'' in 1994, where he worked with [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Gorilla Monsoon]]. Lane also did voiceover work of matches that were taped exclusively for [[Coliseum Video]]. He worked with DiBiase and Monsoon for those also. He also worked as a commentator in Ted DiBiase's promotion, WXO.\n\n===Independent circuit (1999\u20132005)===\nLane left the WWF in late 1995 and retired. Lane returned in the late-1990s and again reformed \"The Fabulous Ones\" for a few cards in Bert Prentice's NWA Wildside promotion to wild fan reception. In 2004, Lane wrestled on several shows with Condrey and Eaton in the independent promotions in the Mid-Atlantic area. He retired from all wrestling in 2005.\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n*'''American Wrestling Federation'''\n**AWF Heavyweight Championship (1 time)<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=2000|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 }}</ref>\n*'''[[Championship Wrestling from Florida]]'''\n**[[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship]] ([[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship#Title history|3 times]]) - with Bryan St. John<ref>[http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/fl/fl-t.html Florida Tag Team Title history] At wrestling-titles.com</ref>\n**[[NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Florida version)|NWA United States Tag Team Championship ''(Florida version)'']] ([[NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Florida version)#Title history|2 times]]) - with [[Steve Keirn]]<ref>[http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/fl/nwa/fl-us-t.html NWA  United States Tag Team Title (Florida version) history] At wrestling-titles.com</ref>\n*'''[[Continental Wrestling Association]]'''\n**[[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship]] ([[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship#Title history|16 times]]) - with Steve Keirn (14 times), [[Koko B.

Lane also held the tag team title with Jeff Collette in the VWA, and was managed by The Big Cheese during his time in the IWA.<ref>Inside Wrestling, The Wrestler, Pro Wrestling Illustrated</ref>\n\n===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1992\u20131993)===\n{{Main|The Heavenly Bodies (1990s tag team)|l1=The Heavenly Bodies}}\nIn 1992, Lane and Cornette went to [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW), to form a new team called \"The Heavenly Bodies\" with [[Tom Prichard]]. They feuded with [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]] and won the tag team titles 5 times, until he retired from the ring after losing a loser leaves town match and was replaced in the team by [[Jimmy Del Ray]].\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1993\u20131995)===\nLane retired in 1993 and went to work for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF), as a member of the WWF's broadcast team. He began as a color commentator alongside Vince McMahon on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''. He then went on to become the host of ''[[WWF Wrestling Challenge]]'' in 1994, where he worked with [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Gorilla Monsoon]]. Lane also did voiceover work of matches that were taped exclusively for [[Coliseum Video]]. He worked with DiBiase and Monsoon for those also. He also worked as a commentator in Ted DiBiase's promotion, WXO.\n\n===Independent circuit (1999\u20132005)===\nLane left the WWF in late 1995 and retired. Lane returned in the late-1990s and again reformed \"The Fabulous Ones\" for a few cards in Bert Prentice's NWA Wildside promotion to wild fan reception. In 2004, Lane wrestled on several shows with Condrey and Eaton in the independent promotions in the Mid-Atlantic area. He retired from all wrestling in 2005.\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n*'''American Wrestling Federation'''\n**AWF Heavyweight Championship (1 time)<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=2000|edition=4th | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 }}</ref>\n*'''[[Championship Wrestling from Florida]]'''\n**[[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship]] ([[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship#Title history|3 times]]) - with Bryan St. John<ref>[http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/fl/fl-t.html Florida Tag Team Title history] At wrestling-titles.com</ref>\n**[[NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Florida version)|NWA United States Tag Team Championship ''(Florida version)'']] ([[NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Florida version)#Title history|2 times]]) - with [[Steve Keirn]]<ref>[http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/fl/nwa/fl-us-t.html NWA  United States Tag Team Title (Florida version) history] At wrestling-titles.com</ref>\n*'''[[Continental Wrestling Association]]'''\n**[[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship]] ([[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship#Title history|16 times]]) - with Steve Keirn (14 times), [[Koko B.

Complex societies based on [[trans-Saharan trade]] in salt and gold had existed in the region since ancient times,<ref>Burr, J. Millard and Robert O. Collins, ''Darfur: The Long Road to Disaster'', Markus Wiener Publishers: Princeton, 2006, {{ISBN|1-55876-405-4}}, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> but the introduction of the [[camel]] to the western Sahara in the 3rd century CE, opened the way to great changes in the area that became the Ghana Empire. By the time of the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest of North Africa]] in the 7th century the camel had changed the ancient, more irregular trade routes into a trade network running from [[Morocco]] to the [[Niger River]]. The Ghana Empire grew rich from this increased trans-Saharan trade in gold and salt, allowing for larger urban centres to develop. The traffic furthermore encouraged territorial expansion to gain control over the different trade routes.\n\nWhen Ghana's ruling dynasty began remains uncertain. It is mentioned for the first time in written records by [[Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]] in 830.<ref>al-Kuwarizmi in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', p. 7.</ref> In the 11th century the [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoban]] scholar [[Al-Bakri]] travelled to the region and gave a detailed description of the kingdom.\n\nAs the empire declined it finally became a [[vassal]] of the rising [[Mali Empire]] at some point in the 13th century. When, in 1957, the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to gain its independence from colonial rule, it renamed itself [[Ghana]] in honor of the long-gone empire.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Trans-Saharan routes early.svg|thumb|right|305px|Trade routes of the Western Sahara c. 1000\u20131500. Goldfields are indicated by light brown shading: [[Bambuk]], [[Siguiri|Bure]], [[Gaoua|Lobi]], and [[Tarkwa|Akan]].]]\n\n===Theories of foreign state founders===\nThe origins of Ghana have been dominated by disputes between ''ethnohistoric accounts'' and ''archaeological interpretations''. The earliest discussions of its origins are found in the Sudanese chronicles of [[Mahmud Kati]] and Abd al-Rahman as-Sadi. According to Kati's [[Tarikh al-fattash|'' Tarikh al-Fettash'']] in a section probably composed by the author around [[1580]], but citing the authority of the chief judge of Messina, Ida al-Massini who lived somewhat earlier, twenty kings ruled Ghana before the advent of the prophet, and the empire extended until the century after the prophet.<ref name=Houdas76>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5439466q/f103.image Houdas & Delafosse 1913], p. 76.</ref> In addressing the rulers' origin, the ''Tarikh al-Fettash'' provides three different opinions, one that they were [[Soninke people|Soninke]], another that they were [[Soninke Wangara|Wangara]] (which are a Soninke group), and another that they were Sanhaja Berbers.\n\nAl-Kati favored another interpretation in view of the fact that their genealogies linked them to this group, adding \"What is certain is that they were not Soninke\u201d (''min al-Zawadi'').<ref>{{Harvnb|Houdas|Delafosse|1913|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5439466q/f105.image 78]}}, translation from {{Harvnb|Levtzion|1973|p=19}}</ref> While the 16th-century versions of genealogies might have linked Ghana to the Sanhaja, earlier versions, for example as reported by the 11th-century writer [[al-Idrisi]] and the 13th-century writer [[Ibn Said al-Maghribi|ibn Said]], noted that rulers of Ghana in those days traced their descent from the clan of the Prophet Muhammad either through his protector [[Abi Talib]], or through his son-in-law Ali.<ref>al-Idrisi in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', p. 109, and ibn Sa'id, p. 186.</ref> He says that 22 kings ruled before the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] and 22 after.{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|p=13 and note 5}} While these early views lead to many exotic interpretations of a foreign origin of Wagadu, these views are generally disregarded by scholars. Levtzion and Spaulding for example, argue that al-Idrisi's testimony should be looked at very critically due to demonstrably gross miscalculations in geography and historical chronology, while they themselves associate Ghana with the local Soninke.<ref>Levtzion and Spaulding. ''Medieval West Africa: Views From Arab Scholars and Merchants'' (2003), p. 27.</ref> In addition, the archaeologist and historian Raymond Mauny argues that al-Kati's and al-Saadi's view of a foreign origin cannot be regarded as reliable. He argues that the interpretations were based on the later presence (after Ghana's demise) of nomadic interlopers on the assumption that they were the historic ruling caste, and that the writers did not adequately consider contemporary accounts such as those of al-Yakqubi (872&nbsp; CE) al-Masudi (c.&nbsp;944&nbsp; CE), Ibn Hawqal (c.&nbsp;977&nbsp; CE), al-Biruni (c.&nbsp;1036&nbsp; CE), as well as al-Bakri, all of whom describe the population and rulers of Ghana as \"[[negro]]es\".{{sfn|Mauny|1954|p=204}}\n\n===History of Islam in the Ghana Empire===\n{{See also|Islam in Mauritania|Islam in Mali}}\nModern scholars, particularly African Muslim scholars, have argued about the extent of the Ghana Empire and tenure of its reign. Islamic religion was known very well around the Asian-African-European area. The African Arabist [[Abu-Abdullah Adelabu]] has claimed that some non-Muslim historians played down the territorial expansion of the Ghana Empire in what he called an attempt to undermine the influence of [[Islam]] in old Ghana. In his work ''The Ghana World: A Pride For The Continent'', Adelabu maintained that works of such Muslim historians and geographers in Europe as the [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|Cordoban]] scholar [[Al-Bakri|Abu-Ubayd al-Bakri]] had been subjugated to accommodate contrary views of non-Muslim Europeans.<ref>Al-Bakri Siffah Iftiqiyyah Wal-Maghrib (Description Of Africa and The Maghreb), D. Slan, Algeria, 1857, p. 158.</ref> [[Sheikh Adelabu|Adelabu]] claimed constant cold-shouldering of [[Abdallah ibn Yasin|Ibn Yasin]]'s Geography of School Of [[Imam Malik]] in which he gave a comprehensive account of social and religious activities in the Ghana Empire have well-attested compositional bias of Ghana history documentation, especially by the European historians on topics related to Islam and the ancient Muslim societies. Adelabu said: \"...the early Muslim documentaries including Ibn Yasin's revelations on ancient African major centers of Muslim culture crossing [[Maghreb|the Maghreb]] and [[Sahel|the Sahel]] to [[Timbuktu]] and downward to [[Bono state|Bonoman]] had not just presented researchers in the field of [[African History]] with solutions to the scarcity of written sources in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, it consolidated confidence in techniques of oral history, historical linguistics and archaeology for authentic Islamic traditions in Africa\".<ref>Dr. Hussein Mouanes ''Atlas Taarikh Al-Islam'' (Atlas of Islamic History), p. 372.</ref><ref>\u201cAkan of Ghana and their ancient beliefs\u201d by Eva L.R. Meyerowitz, Faber and Faber Limited.1958. 24 Russel Square London</ref>\n\n===Oral traditions===\n{{See also|History of the Soninke people}}\nIn the late 19th century, as French forces occupied the region in which ancient Ghana lay, colonial officials began collecting traditional accounts, including some manuscripts written in [[Arabic]] somewhat earlier in the century. Several such traditions were recorded and published. While there are variants, these traditions called the most ancient polity they knew of Wagadu, or the \"place of the Wago\" the term current in the 19th century for the local nobility. The traditions described the kingdom as having been founded by a man named Dinga, who came \"from the east\" (e.g., [[Aswan]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&pg=PA104&dq=cisse+aswan#v=onepage&q=cisse+aswan&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of African American History [3 volumes]|first1=Leslie M.|last1=Alexander|first2=Walter C.

In order to achieve power in his final location he had to kill a [[goblin]], and then marry his daughters, who became the ancestors of the clans that were dominant in the region at the time of the recording of the religion. Upon Dinga's death, his two sons Khine and Dyabe contested the kingship, and Dyabe was victorious, founding the kingdom.{{sfn|Levtzion|1973|pp=16\u201317}}\n\n===Theories concerning the foundation of Ghana===\nFrench colonial officials, notably [[Maurice Delafosse]], whose works on [[West Africa]]n history has been criticised by scholars such Monteil, Cornevin and others for being \"unacceptable\" and \"too creative to be useful to historians\" in relation to his falsification of West African genealogies,<ref>Monteil, Charles, ''Fin de si\u00e8cle \u00e0 M\u00e9dine (1898-1899)'', Bulletin de l'lFAN, vol. 28, s\u00e9rie B, n\u00b0 1-2, 1966, p. 166.</ref><ref>Monteil, Charles, ''La l\u00e9gende officielle de Soundiata, fondateur de l'empire manding'', Bulletin du Comit\u00e9 d 'Etudes historiques et scientifiques de l 'AOF, VIII, n\u00b0 2, 1924.</ref><ref>African Studies Association, ''History in Africa'', Vol. 11, African Studies Association, 1984, University of Michigan, pp. 42-51.</ref><ref>Cornevin, Robert, ''Histoire de l'Afrique'', Tome I: des origines au XVIe si\u00e8cle (Paris, 1962), 347-48 (reference to Delafosse in ''Haut-S\u00e9n\u00e9gal-Niger'' vol. 1, pp. 256-257)</ref> concluded that Ghana had been founded by the Berbers, a nomadic group originating from the [[Benu River]], from Middle Africa, and linked them to North African and Middle Eastern origins. While Delafosse produced a convoluted theory of an invasion by \"Judeo-Syrians\", which he linked to the [[Fulbe]], others took the tradition at face value and simply accepted that nomads had ruled first.{{sfn|Delafosse|1912|pp=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103554s/f231.image 215\u2013226 Vol. 1]}} Raymond Mauny, synthesizing early archaeology, various traditions, and the Arabic materials in 1961 concluded that foreign trade was vital to the empire's foundation.{{sfn|Mauny|1961|pp=72\u201374, 508\u2013511}} More recent work, for example by [[Nehemiah Levtzion]], in his classic work published in 1973, sought to harmonize archaeology, descriptive geographical sources written between 830 and 1400 CE, the older traditions of the Tarikhs, from the 16th and 17th centuries and at last the traditions collected by French administrators. Levtzion concluded that local developments, stimulated by trade from North Africa were crucial in the development of the state, and tended to favor the more recently collected traditions over the other traditions in compiling his work.{{sfn|Levtzion|1973|pp=8\u201317}} While there has not been much further study of either traditions or documents, archaeologists have added considerable nuance to the ultimate play of forces.\n\n===Contribution of archaeological research===\nArchaeological research was slow to enter the picture. While French archaeologists believed they had located the capital, [[Koumbi Saleh|Koumbi-Saleh]] in the 1920s, when they were located extensive stone ruins in the general area given in most sources for the capital, and others argued that elaborate burials in the Niger Bend area may have been linked to the empire, it was not until 1969, when Patrick Munson excavated at [[Dhar Tichitt]] (the site of a culture associated with the ancient ancestors of the Soninke people) in modern-day [[Mauritania]] that the probability of an entirely local origin was raised.{{sfn|Munson|1980}} The Dar Tichitt site had clearly become a complex culture by 1600 BCE and had architectural and material culture elements that seemed to match the site at Koumbi-Saleh. In more recent work in Dar Tichitt, and then in Dhar Nema and [[Walata|Dhar Walata]], it has become more and more clear that as the desert advanced, the Dhar Tichitt culture (which had abandoned its earliest site around 300 BCE, possibly because of pressure from desert nomads, but also because of increasing aridity) and moved southward into the still well watered areas of northern Mali.<ref>Kevin McDonald, Robert Vernet, Dorian Fuller and James Woodhouse, \"New Light on the Tichitt Tradition\" A Preliminary Report on Survey and Excavation at Dhar Nema,\" pp. 78\u201380.</ref> This now seems the likely history of the complex society that can be documented at Koumbi-Saleh.\n\n==Koumbi Saleh==\nThe empire's capital is believed to have been at [[Koumbi Saleh]] on the rim of the Sahara desert.{{sfn|Levtzion|1973|pp=22\u201326}} According to the description of the town left by [[Al-Bakri]] in 1067/1068, the capital was actually two cities {{convert|6|mi|km|0|order=flip}} apart but \"between these two towns are continuous habitations\", so that they might be said to have merged into one.<ref name=corpus80>al-Bakri (1067) in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', p. 80.</ref>\n\n===El-Ghaba===\nAccording to al-Bakri, the major part of the city was called El-Ghaba and was the residence of the king. It was protected by a stone wall and functioned as the royal and spiritual capital of the Empire. It contained a sacred grove of trees in which priests lived. It also contained the king's palace, the grandest structure in the city, surrounded by other \"domed buildings\". There was also one mosque for visiting Muslim officials.<ref name=corpus80/> (El-Ghaba, coincidentally or not, means \"The Forest\" in Arabic.)\n\n===Muslim district===\nThe name of the other section of the city is not recorded. It was surrounded by wells with fresh water, where vegetables were grown. It was inhabited almost entirely by Muslims along with twelve [[mosques]], one of which was designated for Friday prayers, and had a full group of scholars, scribes and Islamic jurists. Because the majority of these Muslims were merchants, this part of the city was probably its primary business district.<ref>al-Bakri, 1067 in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', pp. 79\u201380.</ref> It is likely that these inhabitants were largely black Muslims known as the Wangara and are today known as Dyula and Jakhanke. The separate and autonomous ran towns outside of the main government is a well known practice used by the Dyula and Jakhanke Muslims throughout history.\n\n===Archaeology===\n[[File:Senegal River according to al-Bakri.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Western Nile according to [[al-Bakri]] (1068)]]\n[[File:Senegal River according to al-Idrisi.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Western Nile according to [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] (1154)]]\nA 17th century chronicle written in [[Timbuktu]], the ''[[Tarikh al-fattash]]'', gives the name of the capital as \"Koumbi\".<ref name=Houdas76/> Beginning in the 1920s, French archaeologists began excavating the site of Koumbi-Saleh, although there have always been controversies about the location of Ghana's capital and whether Koumbi-Saleh is the same town as the one described by al-Bakri. The site was excavated in 1949\u201350 by Thomassey and Mauny{{sfn|Thomassey|Mauny|1951}} and by another French team in 1975\u201381.{{sfn|Berthier|1997}} However, the remains of Koumbi Saleh are impressive, even if the remains of the royal town, with its large palace and burial mounds has not been located. Another problem for archaeology is that al-Idrisi, a twelfth-century writer, described Ghana's royal city as lying on a riverbank, a river he called the \"Nile\" following the geographic custom of his day of confusing the Niger and Senegal, which do not meet, as forming a single river often called the \"Nile of the Blacks\". Whether al-Idrisi was referring to a new and later capital located elsewhere, or whether there was confusion or corruption in his text is unclear, however he does state that the royal palace he knew of was built in 510&nbsp;AH (1116\u20131117&nbsp;AD), suggesting that it was a newer town, rebuilt closer to the Niger than Koumbi Saleh.<ref name=\"autogenerated109\">al-Idrisi in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', pp. 109\u2013110.</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nMost of the information about the economy of Ghana comes from [[al-Bakri]]. Al-Bakri noted that merchants had to pay a one gold dinar tax on imports of salt, and two on exports of salt. Other products paid fixed dues, al-Bakri mentioned both copper and \"other goods.\" Imports probably included products such as textiles, ornaments and other materials. Many of the hand-crafted leather goods found in old [[Morocco]] also had their origins in the empire.<ref>Chu, Daniel and Skinner, Elliot. A Glorious Age in Africa, 1st ed. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1965.</ref> The main centre of trade was [[Koumbi Saleh]]. The king claimed as his own all nuggets of gold, and allowed other people to have only gold dust.<ref>al-Bakri in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus'', p. 81.</ref> In addition to the exerted influence of the king onto local regions, tribute was also received from various tributary states and [[chiefdoms]] to the empire's periphery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml|title=The Story of Africa- BBC World Service|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2018}}</ref> The introduction of the [[Dromedary|camel]] played a key role in Soninke success as well, allowing products and goods to be transported much more efficiently across the Sahara. These contributing factors all helped the empire remain powerful for some time, providing a rich and stable economy that was to last over several centuries.\nThe empire was also known to be a major education hub.{{citation needed|reason=No source.|date=April 2016}}\nOnce originally name Wagadu, The Kingdom of Ghana was located in present-day Mauritania and western Mali. The Kingdom of Ghana was a very wealthy kingdom for numerous reasons, one of the reasons being the Trans-Saharan Trade. The Kingdom of Ghana was very populated and had many people from outside the kingdom travel through in order to trade with those from the Kingdom of Ghana or to trade with other outsiders, making Ghana a focal point trading center. Some of the most important parts of products that were trade within Ghana were salt and gold. With gold and salt being transported and traded through Ghana, the Kingdom of Ghana was able to become very wealthy by taxing the goods that came through the trade center. Other materials that were popular within trading in Ghana were ivory, horses, swords, spices, silks, and even books from Europeans. Because Ghana had a large military force, they would charge people for protection if they so desired it when trading to protect themselves and their goods. The fact that Ghana had many trade routes that were well protected also encouraged other merchants to come to Ghana and trade. With the amount of protection on the trade routes and the large number of trade routes, Ghana was given the nickname The Gold Coast. Because so many people trade through Ghana, Ghana was essentially a melting pot, spreading ideas, culture, technology and other aspects of what makes different societies what they were. Eventually the Kingdom of Ghana came to its downfall; a decline in power. Ghana was attacked by other regions who were in need of the resources that Ghana possessed. The Kingdom of Ghana eventually merged with Mali, which became one of the largest empires in African history and one of the richest as well.\n\n==Government==\nMuch testimony on ancient Ghana depended on how well disposed the king was to foreign travellers, from which the majority of information on the empire comes. Islamic writers often commented on the social-political stability of the empire based on the seemingly just actions and grandeur of the king. A [[Moors|Moorish]] nobleman living in Spain by the name of [[Al-Bakri]] questioned merchants who visited the empire in the 11th century and wrote of the king:\n\n{{Quotation|He sits in audience or to hear grievances against officials in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses covered with gold-embroidered materials. Behind the king stand ten pages holding shields and swords decorated with gold, and on his right are the sons of the kings of his country wearing splendid garments and their hair plaited with gold. The governor of the city sits on the ground before the king and around him are ministers seated likewise. At the door of the pavilion are dogs of excellent pedigree that hardly ever leave the place where the king is, guarding him. Around their necks they wear collars of gold and silver studded with a number of balls of the same metals.<ref name=corpus80/>}}\n\nGhana appears to have had a central core region and was surrounded by [[Vassal state|vassal states]]. One of the earliest sources to describe Ghana, al-Ya'qubi, writing in 889/90 (276&nbsp;AH) says that \"under his authority are a number of kings\" which included Sama and 'Am (?) and so extended at least to the Niger valley.<ref>al-Ya'qubi in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus'', p. 21.</ref> These \"kings\" were presumably the rulers of the territorial units often called ''kafu'' in Mandinka.\n\nThe Arabic sources, the only ones to give us any information, are sufficiently vague as to how the country was governed, that we can say very little.  Al-Bakri, far and away the most detailed one, does mention that the king had officials (''mazalim'') who surrounded his throne when he gave justice, and these included the sons of the \"kings of his country\" which we must assume are the same kings that al-Ya'qubi mentioned in his account of nearly two hundred years earlier.  Al-Bakri's detailed geography of the region shows that in his day, or 1067/1068, Ghana was surrounded by independent kingdoms, and Sila, one of them located on the Senegal River, was \"almost a match for the king of Ghana.\"  Sama is the only such entity mentioned as a province, as it was in al-Ya'qubi's day.<ref>al-Bakri in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans., ''Corpus'', pp. 77\u201383.</ref>\n\nIn al-Bakri's time, the rulers of Ghana had begun to incorporate more Muslims into government, including the treasurer, his interpreter and \"the majority of his officials.\"<ref name=corpus80/>\n\n==Decline==\nGiven the scattered nature of the Arabic sources and the ambiguity of the existing archaeological record, it is difficult to determine when and how Ghana declined and fell. The earliest descriptions of the Empire are vague as to its maximum extent, though according to al-Bakri, Ghana had forced [[Awdaghost]] in the desert to accept its rule sometime between 970 and 1054.<ref>al-Bakri in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus'', p. 73.</ref> By al-Bakri's own time, however, it was surrounded by powerful kingdoms, such as Sila. Ghana was combined in the kingdom of Mali in 1240 marking the end of the Ghana Empire.\n\nA tradition in historiography maintains that Ghana fell when it was sacked by the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in 1076\u201377, although Ghanaians resisted attack for a decade.<ref>For example, Levtzion, ''Ghana and Mali'', pp. 44\u201348.</ref> but this interpretation has been questioned. Conrad and Fisher (1982) argued that the notion of any Almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore, derived from a misinterpretation or naive reliance on Arabic sources.{{sfn|Masonen|Fisher|1996}} Dierke Lange agrees but argues that this does not preclude Almoravid political agitation, claiming that Ghana's demise owed much to the latter.{{sfn|Lange|1996|pp=122\u201359}}Sheryl L. Burkhalter(1992) was sceptical of Conrad and Fisher's arguments and  suggested that there was reasons to believe that there was conflict between the Almoravids and the empire of Ghana.<ref>\"Listening for Silences in Almoravid History: Another Reading of \u201cThe Conquest that Never Was\u201d  Camilo G\u00f3mez-Rivas</ref><ref>\"Law and the Islamization of Morocco under the Almoravids\u201d Camilo G\u00f3mez-Rivas</ref> Furthermore, the archaeology of ancient Ghana simply does not show the signs of rapid change and destruction that would be associated with any Almoravid-era military conquests.{{sfn|Insoll|2003|p=230}}\n\nWhile there is no clear-cut account of a sack of Ghana in the contemporary sources, the country certainly did convert to Islam, for al-Idrisi, whose account was written in 1154, has the country fully Muslim by that date. [[Ibn Khaldun]], a fourteenth-century North African historian who read and cited both al-Bakri and al-Idrisi, does report an ambiguous account of the country's history as related to him report 'Uthman, a [[Faq\u012bh|faqih]] of Ghana who took a [[pilgrimage to Mecca]] in 1394, that the power of Ghana waned as that of the \"veiled people\" grew, through the Almoravid movement.<ref name=\"Hopkins p. 333\">ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus'', p. 333.</ref> Al-Idrisi's report does not give any reason in particular to cause us to believe that the Empire was any smaller or weaker than it had been in the days of al-Bakri, seventy five years earlier, and in fact he describes its capital as \"the greatest of all towns of the Sudan with respect to area, the most populous, and with the most extensive trade.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated109\"/> It is clear, however, that Ghana was incorporated into the [[Mali Empire]], according to a detailed account of al-'Umari, written around 1340, but based on testimony given to him by the \"truthful and trustworthy shaykh Abu Uthman Sa'id al-Dukkali, a long term resident.  In al-'Umari/al-Dukkali's version, Ghana still retained its functions as a sort of kingdom within the empire, its ruler being the only one allowed to bear the title ''malik'' and \"who is like a deputy unto him.\"<ref>al-'Umari in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus'', p. 262.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and Sosso occupation==\n[[File:Ghana successor map 1200.png|right|thumb]]\n\nAccording to Ibn Khaldun, following Ghana's conversion, \"the authority of the rulers of Ghana dwindled away and they were overcome by the Sosso...who subjugated and subdued them.\"<ref name=\"Hopkins p. 333\"/> Some modern traditions identify the Susu as the [[Sosso]], inhabitants of [[Kaniaga]]. According to much later traditions, from the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[Diara Kante]] took control of Koumbi Saleh and established the [[Diarisso]] Dynasty. His son, [[Soumaoro Kante]], succeeded him and forced the people to pay him tribute. The Sosso also managed to annex the neighboring [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] state of [[Kangaba]] to the south, where the important goldfields of [[Siguiri|Bure]] were located.\n\n==Malinke rule==\nIn his brief overview of Sudanese history, ibn Khaldun related that \"the people of Mali outnumbered the peoples of the Sudan in their neighborhood and dominated the whole region.\" He went on to relate that they \"vanquished the Susu and acquired all their possessions, both their ancient kingdom and that of Ghana.\"<ref>ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', p. 333.</ref> According to a modern tradition, this resurgence of Mali was led by [[Sundiata Keita]], the founder of Mali and ruler of its core area of Kangaba. Delafosse assigned an arbitrary but widely accepted date of 1230 to the event.{{sfn|Delafosse|1912|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103554s/f310.image 291 Vol. 1]}} This tradition states that ''Ghana'' Soumaba Cisse, at the time a vassal of the Sosso, rebelled with Kangaba and became part of a loose federation of Mande-speaking states. After Soumaoro's defeat at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in 1235 (a date again assigned arbitrarily by Delafosse), the new rulers of Koumbi Saleh became permanent allies of the [[Mali Empire]]. As Mali became more powerful, Koumbi Saleh's role as an ally declined to that of a submissive state, and it became the client described in al-'Umari/al-Dukkali's account of 1340.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''ghana'' means ''warrior'' or '' war chief'' and was the title given to the rulers of the original kingdom whose Soninke name was ''Ouagadou''. ''Kaya Maghan'' (lord of the gold) was another title for these kings.<ref>{{citation | editor=Willie F. Page | editor2=R.

Complex societies based on [[trans-Saharan trade]] in salt and gold had existed in the region since ancient times,<ref>Burr, J. Millard and Robert O. Collins, ''Darfur: The Long Road to Disaster'', Markus Wiener Publishers: Princeton, 2006, {{ISBN|1-55876-405-4}}, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> but the introduction of the [[camel]] to the western Sahara in the 3rd century CE, opened the way to great changes in the area that became the Ghana Empire. By the time of the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest of North Africa]] in the 7th century the camel had changed the ancient, more irregular trade routes into a trade network running from [[Morocco]] to the [[Niger River]]. The Ghana Empire grew rich from this increased trans-Saharan trade in gold and salt, allowing for larger urban centres to develop. The traffic furthermore encouraged territorial expansion to gain control over the different trade routes.\n\nWhen Ghana's ruling dynasty began remains uncertain. It is mentioned for the first time in written records by [[Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]] in 830.<ref>al-Kuwarizmi in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', p. 7.</ref> In the 11th century the [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoban]] scholar [[Al-Bakri]] travelled to the region and gave a detailed description of the kingdom.\n\nAs the empire declined it finally became a [[vassal]] of the rising [[Mali Empire]] at some point in the 13th century. When, in 1957, the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] became the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to gain its independence from colonial rule, it renamed itself [[Ghana]] in honor of the long-gone empire.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Trans-Saharan routes early.svg|thumb|right|305px|Trade routes of the Western Sahara c. 1000\u20131500. Goldfields are indicated by light brown shading: [[Bambuk]], [[Siguiri|Bure]], [[Gaoua|Lobi]], and [[Tarkwa|Akan]].]]\n\n===Theories of foreign state founders===\nThe origins of Ghana have been dominated by disputes between ''ethnohistoric accounts'' and ''archaeological interpretations''. The earliest discussions of its origins are found in the Sudanese chronicles of [[Mahmud Kati]] and Abd al-Rahman as-Sadi. According to Kati's [[Tarikh al-fattash|'' Tarikh al-Fettash'']] in a section probably composed by the author around [[1580]], but citing the authority of the chief judge of Messina, Ida al-Massini who lived somewhat earlier, twenty kings ruled Ghana before the advent of the prophet, and the empire extended until the century after the prophet.<ref name=Houdas76>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5439466q/f103.image Houdas & Delafosse 1913], p. 76.</ref> In addressing the rulers' origin, the ''Tarikh al-Fettash'' provides three different opinions, one that they were [[Soninke people|Soninke]], another that they were [[Soninke Wangara|Wangara]] (which are a Soninke group), and another that they were Sanhaja Berbers.\n\nAl-Kati favored another interpretation in view of the fact that their genealogies linked them to this group, adding \"What is certain is that they were not Soninke\u201d (''min al-Zawadi'').<ref>{{Harvnb|Houdas|Delafosse|1913|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5439466q/f105.image 78]}}, translation from {{Harvnb|Levtzion|1973|p=19}}</ref> While the 16th-century versions of genealogies might have linked Ghana to the Sanhaja, earlier versions, for example as reported by the 11th-century writer [[al-Idrisi]] and the 13th-century writer [[Ibn Said al-Maghribi|ibn Said]], noted that rulers of Ghana in those days traced their descent from the clan of the Prophet Muhammad either through his protector [[Abi Talib]], or through his son-in-law Ali.<ref>al-Idrisi in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', p. 109, and ibn Sa'id, p. 186.</ref> He says that 22 kings ruled before the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] and 22 after.{{sfn|Hunwick|2003|p=13 and note 5}} While these early views lead to many exotic interpretations of a foreign origin of Wagadu, these views are generally disregarded by scholars. Levtzion and Spaulding for example, argue that al-Idrisi's testimony should be looked at very critically due to demonstrably gross miscalculations in geography and historical chronology, while they themselves associate Ghana with the local Soninke.<ref>Levtzion and Spaulding. ''Medieval West Africa: Views From Arab Scholars and Merchants'' (2003), p. 27.</ref> In addition, the archaeologist and historian Raymond Mauny argues that al-Kati's and al-Saadi's view of a foreign origin cannot be regarded as reliable. He argues that the interpretations were based on the later presence (after Ghana's demise) of nomadic interlopers on the assumption that they were the historic ruling caste, and that the writers did not adequately consider contemporary accounts such as those of al-Yakqubi (872&nbsp; CE) al-Masudi (c.&nbsp;944&nbsp; CE), Ibn Hawqal (c.&nbsp;977&nbsp; CE), al-Biruni (c.&nbsp;1036&nbsp; CE), as well as al-Bakri, all of whom describe the population and rulers of Ghana as \"[[negro]]es\".{{sfn|Mauny|1954|p=204}}\n\n===History of Islam in the Ghana Empire===\n{{See also|Islam in Mauritania|Islam in Mali}}\nModern scholars, particularly African Muslim scholars, have argued about the extent of the Ghana Empire and tenure of its reign. Islamic religion was known very well around the Asian-African-European area. The African Arabist [[Abu-Abdullah Adelabu]] has claimed that some non-Muslim historians played down the territorial expansion of the Ghana Empire in what he called an attempt to undermine the influence of [[Islam]] in old Ghana. In his work ''The Ghana World: A Pride For The Continent'', Adelabu maintained that works of such Muslim historians and geographers in Europe as the [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|Cordoban]] scholar [[Al-Bakri|Abu-Ubayd al-Bakri]] had been subjugated to accommodate contrary views of non-Muslim Europeans.<ref>Al-Bakri Siffah Iftiqiyyah Wal-Maghrib (Description Of Africa and The Maghreb), D. Slan, Algeria, 1857, p. 158.</ref> [[Sheikh Adelabu|Adelabu]] claimed constant cold-shouldering of [[Abdallah ibn Yasin|Ibn Yasin]]'s Geography of School Of [[Imam Malik]] in which he gave a comprehensive account of social and religious activities in the Ghana Empire have well-attested compositional bias of Ghana history documentation, especially by the European historians on topics related to Islam and the ancient Muslim societies. Adelabu said: \"...the early Muslim documentaries including Ibn Yasin's revelations on ancient African major centers of Muslim culture crossing [[Maghreb|the Maghreb]] and [[Sahel|the Sahel]] to [[Timbuktu]] and downward to [[Ashanti Region|Ashanti regions]] had not just presented researchers in the field of [[African History]] with solutions to the scarcity of written sources in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, it consolidated confidence in techniques of oral history, historical linguistics and archaeology for authentic Islamic traditions in Africa\".<ref>Dr. Hussein Mouanes ''Atlas Taarikh Al-Islam'' (Atlas of Islamic History), p. 372.</ref>\n\n===Oral traditions===\n{{See also|History of the Soninke people}}\nIn the late 19th century, as French forces occupied the region in which ancient Ghana lay, colonial officials began collecting traditional accounts, including some manuscripts written in [[Arabic]] somewhat earlier in the century. Several such traditions were recorded and published. While there are variants, these traditions called the most ancient polity they knew of Wagadu, or the \"place of the Wago\" the term current in the 19th century for the local nobility. The traditions described the kingdom as having been founded by a man named Dinga, who came \"from the east\" (e.g., [[Aswan]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uivtCqOlpTsC&pg=PA104&dq=cisse+aswan#v=onepage&q=cisse+aswan&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of African American History [3 volumes]|first1=Leslie M.|last1=Alexander|first2=Walter C.

In order to achieve power in his final location he had to kill a [[goblin]], and then marry his daughters, who became the ancestors of the clans that were dominant in the region at the time of the recording of the religion. Upon Dinga's death, his two sons Khine and Dyabe contested the kingship, and Dyabe was victorious, founding the kingdom.{{sfn|Levtzion|1973|pp=16\u201317}}\n\n===Theories concerning the foundation of Ghana===\nFrench colonial officials, notably [[Maurice Delafosse]], whose works on [[West Africa]]n history has been criticised by scholars such Monteil, Cornevin and others for being \"unacceptable\" and \"too creative to be useful to historians\" in relation to his falsification of West African genealogies,<ref>Monteil, Charles, ''Fin de si\u00e8cle \u00e0 M\u00e9dine (1898-1899)'', Bulletin de l'lFAN, vol. 28, s\u00e9rie B, n\u00b0 1-2, 1966, p. 166.</ref><ref>Monteil, Charles, ''La l\u00e9gende officielle de Soundiata, fondateur de l'empire manding'', Bulletin du Comit\u00e9 d 'Etudes historiques et scientifiques de l 'AOF, VIII, n\u00b0 2, 1924.</ref><ref>African Studies Association, ''History in Africa'', Vol. 11, African Studies Association, 1984, University of Michigan, pp. 42-51.</ref><ref>Cornevin, Robert, ''Histoire de l'Afrique'', Tome I: des origines au XVIe si\u00e8cle (Paris, 1962), 347-48 (reference to Delafosse in ''Haut-S\u00e9n\u00e9gal-Niger'' vol. 1, pp. 256-257)</ref> concluded that Ghana had been founded by the Berbers, a nomadic group originating from the [[Benu River]], from Middle Africa, and linked them to North African and Middle Eastern origins. While Delafosse produced a convoluted theory of an invasion by \"Judeo-Syrians\", which he linked to the [[Fulbe]], others took the tradition at face value and simply accepted that nomads had ruled first.{{sfn|Delafosse|1912|pp=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103554s/f231.image 215\u2013226 Vol. 1]}} Raymond Mauny, synthesizing early archaeology, various traditions, and the Arabic materials in 1961 concluded that foreign trade was vital to the empire's foundation.{{sfn|Mauny|1961|pp=72\u201374, 508\u2013511}} More recent work, for example by [[Nehemiah Levtzion]], in his classic work published in 1973, sought to harmonize archaeology, descriptive geographical sources written between 830 and 1400 CE, the older traditions of the Tarikhs, from the 16th and 17th centuries and at last the traditions collected by French administrators. Levtzion concluded that local developments, stimulated by trade from North Africa were crucial in the development of the state, and tended to favor the more recently collected traditions over the other traditions in compiling his work.{{sfn|Levtzion|1973|pp=8\u201317}} While there has not been much further study of either traditions or documents, archaeologists have added considerable nuance to the ultimate play of forces.\n\n===Contribution of archaeological research===\nArchaeological research was slow to enter the picture. While French archaeologists believed they had located the capital, [[Koumbi Saleh|Koumbi-Saleh]] in the 1920s, when they were located extensive stone ruins in the general area given in most sources for the capital, and others argued that elaborate burials in the Niger Bend area may have been linked to the empire, it was not until 1969, when Patrick Munson excavated at [[Dhar Tichitt]] (the site of a culture associated with the ancient ancestors of the Soninke people) in modern-day [[Mauritania]] that the probability of an entirely local origin was raised.{{sfn|Munson|1980}} The Dar Tichitt site had clearly become a complex culture by 1600 BCE and had architectural and material culture elements that seemed to match the site at Koumbi-Saleh. In more recent work in Dar Tichitt, and then in Dhar Nema and [[Walata|Dhar Walata]], it has become more and more clear that as the desert advanced, the Dhar Tichitt culture (which had abandoned its earliest site around 300 BCE, possibly because of pressure from desert nomads, but also because of increasing aridity) and moved southward into the still well watered areas of northern Mali.<ref>Kevin McDonald, Robert Vernet, Dorian Fuller and James Woodhouse, \"New Light on the Tichitt Tradition\" A Preliminary Report on Survey and Excavation at Dhar Nema,\" pp. 78\u201380.</ref> This now seems the likely history of the complex society that can be documented at Koumbi-Saleh.\n\n==Koumbi Saleh==\nThe empire's capital is believed to have been at [[Koumbi Saleh]] on the rim of the Sahara desert.{{sfn|Levtzion|1973|pp=22\u201326}} According to the description of the town left by [[Al-Bakri]] in 1067/1068, the capital was actually two cities {{convert|6|mi|km|0|order=flip}} apart but \"between these two towns are continuous habitations\", so that they might be said to have merged into one.<ref name=corpus80>al-Bakri (1067) in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', p. 80.</ref>\n\n===El-Ghaba===\nAccording to al-Bakri, the major part of the city was called El-Ghaba and was the residence of the king. It was protected by a stone wall and functioned as the royal and spiritual capital of the Empire. It contained a sacred grove of trees in which priests lived. It also contained the king's palace, the grandest structure in the city, surrounded by other \"domed buildings\". There was also one mosque for visiting Muslim officials.<ref name=corpus80/> (El-Ghaba, coincidentally or not, means \"The Forest\" in Arabic.)\n\n===Muslim district===\nThe name of the other section of the city is not recorded. It was surrounded by wells with fresh water, where vegetables were grown. It was inhabited almost entirely by Muslims along with twelve [[mosques]], one of which was designated for Friday prayers, and had a full group of scholars, scribes and Islamic jurists. Because the majority of these Muslims were merchants, this part of the city was probably its primary business district.<ref>al-Bakri, 1067 in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', pp. 79\u201380.</ref> It is likely that these inhabitants were largely black Muslims known as the Wangara and are today known as Dyula and Jakhanke. The separate and autonomous ran towns outside of the main government is a well known practice used by the Dyula and Jakhanke Muslims throughout history.\n\n===Archaeology===\n[[File:Senegal River according to al-Bakri.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Western Nile according to [[al-Bakri]] (1068)]]\n[[File:Senegal River according to al-Idrisi.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Western Nile according to [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] (1154)]]\nA 17th century chronicle written in [[Timbuktu]], the ''[[Tarikh al-fattash]]'', gives the name of the capital as \"Koumbi\".<ref name=Houdas76/> Beginning in the 1920s, French archaeologists began excavating the site of Koumbi-Saleh, although there have always been controversies about the location of Ghana's capital and whether Koumbi-Saleh is the same town as the one described by al-Bakri. The site was excavated in 1949\u201350 by Thomassey and Mauny{{sfn|Thomassey|Mauny|1951}} and by another French team in 1975\u201381.{{sfn|Berthier|1997}} However, the remains of Koumbi Saleh are impressive, even if the remains of the royal town, with its large palace and burial mounds has not been located. Another problem for archaeology is that al-Idrisi, a twelfth-century writer, described Ghana's royal city as lying on a riverbank, a river he called the \"Nile\" following the geographic custom of his day of confusing the Niger and Senegal, which do not meet, as forming a single river often called the \"Nile of the Blacks\". Whether al-Idrisi was referring to a new and later capital located elsewhere, or whether there was confusion or corruption in his text is unclear, however he does state that the royal palace he knew of was built in 510&nbsp;AH (1116\u20131117&nbsp;AD), suggesting that it was a newer town, rebuilt closer to the Niger than Koumbi Saleh.<ref name=\"autogenerated109\">al-Idrisi in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', pp. 109\u2013110.</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nMost of the information about the economy of Ghana comes from [[al-Bakri]]. Al-Bakri noted that merchants had to pay a one gold dinar tax on imports of salt, and two on exports of salt. Other products paid fixed dues, al-Bakri mentioned both copper and \"other goods.\" Imports probably included products such as textiles, ornaments and other materials. Many of the hand-crafted leather goods found in old [[Morocco]] also had their origins in the empire.<ref>Chu, Daniel and Skinner, Elliot. A Glorious Age in Africa, 1st ed. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1965.</ref> The main centre of trade was [[Koumbi Saleh]]. The king claimed as his own all nuggets of gold, and allowed other people to have only gold dust.<ref>al-Bakri in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus'', p. 81.</ref> In addition to the exerted influence of the king onto local regions, tribute was also received from various tributary states and [[chiefdoms]] to the empire's periphery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml|title=The Story of Africa- BBC World Service|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2018}}</ref> The introduction of the [[Dromedary|camel]] played a key role in Soninke success as well, allowing products and goods to be transported much more efficiently across the Sahara. These contributing factors all helped the empire remain powerful for some time, providing a rich and stable economy that was to last over several centuries.\nThe empire was also known to be a major education hub.{{citation needed|reason=No source.|date=April 2016}}\nOnce originally name Wagadu, The Kingdom of Ghana was located in present-day Mauritania and western Mali. The Kingdom of Ghana was a very wealthy kingdom for numerous reasons, one of the reasons being the Trans-Saharan Trade. The Kingdom of Ghana was very populated and had many people from outside the kingdom travel through in order to trade with those from the Kingdom of Ghana or to trade with other outsiders, making Ghana a focal point trading center. Some of the most important parts of products that were trade within Ghana were salt and gold. With gold and salt being transported and traded through Ghana, the Kingdom of Ghana was able to become very wealthy by taxing the goods that came through the trade center. Other materials that were popular within trading in Ghana were ivory, horses, swords, spices, silks, and even books from Europeans. Because Ghana had a large military force, they would charge people for protection if they so desired it when trading to protect themselves and their goods. The fact that Ghana had many trade routes that were well protected also encouraged other merchants to come to Ghana and trade. With the amount of protection on the trade routes and the large number of trade routes, Ghana was given the nickname The Gold Coast. Because so many people trade through Ghana, Ghana was essentially a melting pot, spreading ideas, culture, technology and other aspects of what makes different societies what they were. Eventually the Kingdom of Ghana came to its downfall; a decline in power. Ghana was attacked by other regions who were in need of the resources that Ghana possessed. The Kingdom of Ghana eventually merged with Mali, which became one of the largest empires in African history and one of the richest as well.\n\n==Government==\nMuch testimony on ancient Ghana depended on how well disposed the king was to foreign travellers, from which the majority of information on the empire comes. Islamic writers often commented on the social-political stability of the empire based on the seemingly just actions and grandeur of the king. A [[Moors|Moorish]] nobleman living in Spain by the name of [[Al-Bakri]] questioned merchants who visited the empire in the 11th century and wrote of the king:\n\n{{Quotation|He sits in audience or to hear grievances against officials in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses covered with gold-embroidered materials. Behind the king stand ten pages holding shields and swords decorated with gold, and on his right are the sons of the kings of his country wearing splendid garments and their hair plaited with gold. The governor of the city sits on the ground before the king and around him are ministers seated likewise. At the door of the pavilion are dogs of excellent pedigree that hardly ever leave the place where the king is, guarding him. Around their necks they wear collars of gold and silver studded with a number of balls of the same metals.<ref name=corpus80/>}}\n\nGhana appears to have had a central core region and was surrounded by [[Vassal state|vassal states]]. One of the earliest sources to describe Ghana, al-Ya'qubi, writing in 889/90 (276&nbsp;AH) says that \"under his authority are a number of kings\" which included Sama and 'Am (?) and so extended at least to the Niger valley.<ref>al-Ya'qubi in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus'', p. 21.</ref> These \"kings\" were presumably the rulers of the territorial units often called ''kafu'' in Mandinka.\n\nThe Arabic sources, the only ones to give us any information, are sufficiently vague as to how the country was governed, that we can say very little.  Al-Bakri, far and away the most detailed one, does mention that the king had officials (''mazalim'') who surrounded his throne when he gave justice, and these included the sons of the \"kings of his country\" which we must assume are the same kings that al-Ya'qubi mentioned in his account of nearly two hundred years earlier.  Al-Bakri's detailed geography of the region shows that in his day, or 1067/1068, Ghana was surrounded by independent kingdoms, and Sila, one of them located on the Senegal River, was \"almost a match for the king of Ghana.\"  Sama is the only such entity mentioned as a province, as it was in al-Ya'qubi's day.<ref>al-Bakri in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans., ''Corpus'', pp. 77\u201383.</ref>\n\nIn al-Bakri's time, the rulers of Ghana had begun to incorporate more Muslims into government, including the treasurer, his interpreter and \"the majority of his officials.\"<ref name=corpus80/>\n\n==Decline==\nGiven the scattered nature of the Arabic sources and the ambiguity of the existing archaeological record, it is difficult to determine when and how Ghana declined and fell. The earliest descriptions of the Empire are vague as to its maximum extent, though according to al-Bakri, Ghana had forced [[Awdaghost]] in the desert to accept its rule sometime between 970 and 1054.<ref>al-Bakri in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus'', p. 73.</ref> By al-Bakri's own time, however, it was surrounded by powerful kingdoms, such as Sila. Ghana was combined in the kingdom of Mali in 1240 marking the end of the Ghana Empire.\n\nA tradition in historiography maintains that Ghana fell when it was sacked by the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in 1076\u201377, although Ghanaians resisted attack for a decade.<ref>For example, Levtzion, ''Ghana and Mali'', pp. 44\u201348.</ref> but this interpretation has been questioned. Conrad and Fisher (1982) argued that the notion of any Almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore, derived from a misinterpretation or naive reliance on Arabic sources.{{sfn|Masonen|Fisher|1996}} Dierke Lange agrees but argues that this does not preclude Almoravid political agitation, claiming that Ghana's demise owed much to the latter.{{sfn|Lange|1996|pp=122\u201359}}Sheryl L. Burkhalter(1992) was sceptical of Conrad and Fisher's arguments and  suggested that there was reasons to believe that there was conflict between the Almoravids and the empire of Ghana.<ref>\"Listening for Silences in Almoravid History: Another Reading of \u201cThe Conquest that Never Was\u201d  Camilo G\u00f3mez-Rivas</ref><ref>\"Law and the Islamization of Morocco under the Almoravids\u201d Camilo G\u00f3mez-Rivas</ref> Furthermore, the archaeology of ancient Ghana simply does not show the signs of rapid change and destruction that would be associated with any Almoravid-era military conquests.{{sfn|Insoll|2003|p=230}}\n\nWhile there is no clear-cut account of a sack of Ghana in the contemporary sources, the country certainly did convert to Islam, for al-Idrisi, whose account was written in 1154, has the country fully Muslim by that date. [[Ibn Khaldun]], a fourteenth-century North African historian who read and cited both al-Bakri and al-Idrisi, does report an ambiguous account of the country's history as related to him report 'Uthman, a [[Faq\u012bh|faqih]] of Ghana who took a [[pilgrimage to Mecca]] in 1394, that the power of Ghana waned as that of the \"veiled people\" grew, through the Almoravid movement.<ref name=\"Hopkins p. 333\">ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus'', p. 333.</ref> Al-Idrisi's report does not give any reason in particular to cause us to believe that the Empire was any smaller or weaker than it had been in the days of al-Bakri, seventy five years earlier, and in fact he describes its capital as \"the greatest of all towns of the Sudan with respect to area, the most populous, and with the most extensive trade.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated109\"/> It is clear, however, that Ghana was incorporated into the [[Mali Empire]], according to a detailed account of al-'Umari, written around 1340, but based on testimony given to him by the \"truthful and trustworthy shaykh Abu Uthman Sa'id al-Dukkali, a long term resident.  In al-'Umari/al-Dukkali's version, Ghana still retained its functions as a sort of kingdom within the empire, its ruler being the only one allowed to bear the title ''malik'' and \"who is like a deputy unto him.\"<ref>al-'Umari in Levtzion and Hopkins, eds. and trans. ''Corpus'', p. 262.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath and Sosso occupation==\n[[File:Ghana successor map 1200.png|right|thumb]]\n\nAccording to Ibn Khaldun, following Ghana's conversion, \"the authority of the rulers of Ghana dwindled away and they were overcome by the Sosso...who subjugated and subdued them.\"<ref name=\"Hopkins p. 333\"/> Some modern traditions identify the Susu as the [[Sosso]], inhabitants of [[Kaniaga]]. According to much later traditions, from the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[Diara Kante]] took control of Koumbi Saleh and established the [[Diarisso]] Dynasty. His son, [[Soumaoro Kante]], succeeded him and forced the people to pay him tribute. The Sosso also managed to annex the neighboring [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] state of [[Kangaba]] to the south, where the important goldfields of [[Siguiri|Bure]] were located.\n\n==Malinke rule==\nIn his brief overview of Sudanese history, ibn Khaldun related that \"the people of Mali outnumbered the peoples of the Sudan in their neighborhood and dominated the whole region.\" He went on to relate that they \"vanquished the Susu and acquired all their possessions, both their ancient kingdom and that of Ghana.\"<ref>ibn Khaldun in Levtzion and Hopkins, ''Corpus'', p. 333.</ref> According to a modern tradition, this resurgence of Mali was led by [[Sundiata Keita]], the founder of Mali and ruler of its core area of Kangaba. Delafosse assigned an arbitrary but widely accepted date of 1230 to the event.{{sfn|Delafosse|1912|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k103554s/f310.image 291 Vol. 1]}} This tradition states that ''Ghana'' Soumaba Cisse, at the time a vassal of the Sosso, rebelled with Kangaba and became part of a loose federation of Mande-speaking states. After Soumaoro's defeat at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in 1235 (a date again assigned arbitrarily by Delafosse), the new rulers of Koumbi Saleh became permanent allies of the [[Mali Empire]]. As Mali became more powerful, Koumbi Saleh's role as an ally declined to that of a submissive state, and it became the client described in al-'Umari/al-Dukkali's account of 1340.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''ghana'' means ''warrior'' or '' war chief'' and was the title given to the rulers of the original kingdom whose Soninke name was ''Ouagadou''. ''Kaya Maghan'' (lord of the gold) was another title for these kings.<ref>{{citation | editor=Willie F. Page | editor2=R.

When the former Soviet republics began issuing their own currencies, Transnistria was flooded with Soviet rubles. In an attempt to protect its financial system, in July 1993 the Transnistrian government bought used Goznak-printed [[Soviet ruble|Soviet]] and [[Russian ruble|Russian]] notes dated 1961\u20131992 which it modified by applying adhesive stamps bearing the image of General [[Alexander Suvorov|Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov]], founder of Tiraspol and its corresponding denomination. These stamped notes replaced unstamped Soviet and Russian notes at par. It is thought that most uncirculated notes bearing these stickers were created after 1994 specifically for collectors.<ref>Transnistrian Republican Bank.

This currency consisted solely of banknotes and suffered from high inflation, necessitating the issue of notes overstamped with higher denominations. Although issued in 1994, some notes (50 to 5000 rubles) were issued dated 1993.\n\n===Banknotes===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n!colspan=\"9\"| 1994 Series\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!rowspan=\"2\"| Dimensions !!rowspan=\"2\"| Main Colour !!colspan=\"2\"| Images !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!colspan=\"2\"| Date of \n|-\n!

Their mintage numbers were very low, ranging between 500 and 5,000. Topics included for example \"Ancient fortresses on the river Dniester\", \"The Outstanding people Transdniestria\" and \"Red book Transdniestria\". A complete listing can be found on the website ([http://www.cbpmr.net/?lang=en|website]) of the Transnistrian Republican Bank.\n\n====Mint====\n\nWhen it was founded, Transnistria did not have its own mint. Thus a foreign mint had to be found to strike Transnistrian coins. The [[Polish Mint|Mint of Poland]] (Mennica Polska) in [[Warsaw]] was selected.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114873,2490728.html |title=Polska Mennica bije monety dla Naddniestrza|date=2005-01-13}}</ref> Coins dated 2000 were struck in Warsaw and transported via Ukraine to Transnistria in trucks belonging to the [[Transnistrian Republican Bank]].\n\nThe Moldovan government was not pleased with this situation, since they viewed it as a ''de facto'' recognition of Transnistria. In October 2001 Moldovan president [[Vladimir Voronin]] addressed the issue with his [[Prime Minister of Poland|Polish counterpart]].<ref>http://www.transnistria.info/independent-transnistria-news/tiraspol-designated-the-arrest-of-a-batch-of-the-transdniestrian-coins-as-a-provocation.html{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nThe Polska Mennica (Mint of Poland) responded to the criticism by stating that because the Transnistrian ruble is not internationally recognized as a currency, they were producing tokens and not coins, which is normal business for mints.<ref>http://www.mennica.com.pl/dla-inwestorow/sprawozdania-rn.html, sprawozdania Rady Nadzorczej Mennicy  (2005).</ref>\n\nThe conflict came to a height when in December 2004 Ukrainian customs confiscated a truck with US$117,000 worth of Transnistrian coins near Lviv. The coins were handed over to Moldovan authorities, who in response again protested with the Polish government.\n\nThe Polish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] en state property wrote another letter to Polska Mennica (Mint of Poland) in April 2005. They warned that continued production of Transnistrian coins would endanger relations with Ukraine and Moldova and damage the image of Poland abroad. The Polska Mennica (Mint of Poland) bowed to the pressure and cancelled its contract with Transnistria that same month.\n\nFor Transnistria there was then no other solution but to strike future coins themselves. Thus, on 18 November 2005 the [[Tiraspol Mint]] (\u0422\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440) was opened in the presence of President [[Igor Smirnov]].\n\n===Banknotes===\n\nNotes are issued by the [[Transnistrian Republican Bank]] (''\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a'') in 2000 as part of a currency reform, with 1 ruble equal to 1 million (1,000,000) of the old rubles.

When the former Soviet republics began issuing their own currencies, Transnistria was flooded with Soviet rubles. In an attempt to protect its financial system, in July 1993 the Transnistrian government bought used Goznak-printed [[Soviet ruble|Soviet]] and [[Russian ruble|Russian]] notes dated 1961\u20131992 which it modified by applying adhesive stamps bearing the image of General [[Alexander Suvorov|Alexander Vasilyevich Suvorov]], founder of Tiraspol and its corresponding denomination. These stamped notes replaced unstamped Soviet and Russian notes at par. It is thought that most uncirculated notes bearing these stickers were created after 1994 specifically for collectors.<ref>Trans-Dniester Republican Bank. Available at:http://www.cbpmr.net/?id=33&lang=en</ref>\n\n==Second ruble (1994\u20132000)==\n\nThe first, provisional issues were replaced in August 1994 by a new Transnistrian ruble, equal to 1000 old rubles. This currency consisted solely of banknotes and suffered from high inflation, necessitating the issue of notes overstamped with higher denominations. Although issued in 1994, some notes (50 to 5000 rubles) were issued dated 1993.\n\n===Banknotes===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n!colspan=\"9\"| 1994 Series\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!rowspan=\"2\"| Dimensions !!rowspan=\"2\"| Main Colour !!colspan=\"2\"| Images !!colspan=\"2\"| Description !!colspan=\"2\"| Date of \n|-\n!

Their mintage numbers were very low, ranging between 500 and 5,000. Topics included for example \"Ancient fortresses on the river Dniester\", \"The Outstanding people Transdniestria\" and \"Red book Transdniestria\". A complete listing can be found on the website ([http://www.cbpmr.net/?lang=en|website]) of the Transnistrian Republican Bank.\n\n====Mint====\n\nWhen it was founded, Transnistria did not have its own mint. Thus a foreign mint had to be found to strike Transnistrian coins. The [[Polish Mint|Mint of Poland]] (Mennica Polska) in [[Warsaw]] was selected.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114873,2490728.html |title=Polska Mennica bije monety dla Naddniestrza|date=2005-01-13}}</ref> Coins dated 2000 were struck in Warsaw and transported via Ukraine to Transnistria in trucks belonging to the [[Transnistrian Republican Bank]].\n\nThe Moldovan government was not pleased with this situation, since they viewed it as a ''de facto'' recognition of Transnistria. In October 2001 Moldovan president [[Vladimir Voronin]] addressed the issue with his [[Prime Minister of Poland|Polish counterpart]].<ref>http://www.transnistria.info/independent-transnistria-news/tiraspol-designated-the-arrest-of-a-batch-of-the-transdniestrian-coins-as-a-provocation.html{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nThe Polska Mennica (Mint of Poland) responded to the criticism by stating that because the Transnistrian ruble is not internationally recognized as a currency, they were producing tokens and not coins, which is normal business for mints.<ref>http://www.mennica.com.pl/dla-inwestorow/sprawozdania-rn.html, sprawozdania Rady Nadzorczej Mennicy  (2005).</ref>\n\nThe conflict came to a height when in December 2004 Ukrainian customs confiscated a truck with US$117,000 worth of Transnistrian coins near Lviv. The coins were handed over to Moldovan authorities, who in response again protested with the Polish government.\n\nThe Polish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] en state property wrote another letter to Polska Mennica (Mint of Poland) in April 2005. They warned that continued production of Transnistrian coins would endanger relations with Ukraine and Moldova and damage the image of Poland abroad. The Polska Mennica (Mint of Poland) bowed to the pressure and cancelled its contract with Transnistria that same month.\n\nFor Transnistria there was then no other solution but to strike future coins themselves. Thus, on 18 November 2005 the [[Tiraspol Mint]] (\u0422\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440) was opened in the presence of President [[Igor Smirnov]].\n\n===Banknotes===\n\nNotes are issued by the [[Transnistrian Republican Bank]] (''\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a'') in 2000 as part of a currency reform, with 1 ruble equal to 1 million (1,000,000) of the old rubles.

Districts 1-3 encompass all of the county outside of Bloomington and Normal. Districts 4-6 are within the town limits of Normal, and districts 7-10 are within Bloomington city limits.\n\n===Politics===\nMcLean County is historically a Republican-leaning county. The only Democrats to gain an absolute majority of the county's vote since the Civil War have been [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1932 and 1936 and [[Lyndon Johnson]] by a mere 420 votes out of over 38,000 total in 1964. Illinois resident [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 and [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1912 both carried the county by narrow pluralities. McLean has trended Democratic, sufficiently so that [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2016 lost the county by just 1.3 percent despite failing to win the Presidency.\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=May 6, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323225526/https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|archivedate=March 23, 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!
