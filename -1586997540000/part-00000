Ryan's father, Polish, used to play trumpet and his mother was a drummer in her high school marching band. Around age five Roxie picked up the guitar but was more interested in drums. It wasn't until he was around eleven or twelve that he started taking guitar seriously.\n\nRoxie learned to play guitar from an old record player and invented his own form of scratching, going through many records in the process, picking out guitar parts.  He was influenced by albums like ''[[Van Halen (album)|Van Halen]]'' and has had many guitar heroes including [[Brian May]] from [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Steve Stevens]], [[Elliot Easton]] from [[The Cars]], Neil Geraldo from [[Pat Benatar]] and [[Rick Nielsen]] of [[Cheap Trick]].\n\n[[Candy (band)|Candy]] were a band featuring original members [[Kyle Vincent]], Jonathan Daniel, John Schubert, and guitarist [[Geoff Siegel]]. [[Gilby Clarke]] replaced Siegel after 6 months. They had an album release in 1985 titled ''Whatever Happened To Fun''. Later that year, Gilby Clarke replaced Kyle Vincent as lead vocalist, and guitarist Roxie joined the lineup. After Gilby parted to form his own band \"Kill for Thrills\" the rest of the guys joined up with new lead vocalist Shane and became the \"[[Electric Angels]]\".\n\nRoxie formed [[Electric Angels]] with Shane, Jonathan Daniel and drummer John Schubert. They moved to New York where they signed to [[Atlantic Records]].  The show they are signed at is opening for Dogs D'amour and [[Mother Love Bone]] (some of whose members went on to form [[Pearl Jam]]) and their self-titled album is released in 1990 produced by [[Tony Visconti]] (best known for his work with T Rex, Bowie and Thin Lizzy to name a few). The band works on a second album to be called ''New York Times'' but is dropped by Atlantic before it is released.\n\nBetween '94 and '96 Roxie worked with various artists.  He provided guitar on Gilby Clarke's albums, ''[[Pawnshop Guitars]]'', ''[[Blooze]]'', ''[[The Hangover (1997 album)|The Hangover]]'' and ''[[Rubber (Gilby Clarke album)|Rubber]]''.  Roxie also lent his guitar styling to the un-credited work with [[Tal Bachman]]. Roxie's guitar work is displayed on the hit single \"She's So High\" produced by [[Bob Rock]]. Roxie played guitar on [[James Michael]]'s (from Sixx AM) ''[[Inhale]]'' release as well. In 2000 Roxie also wrote and recorded on [[Slash's Snakepit]]'s second album ''[[Ain't Life Grand (Slash's Snakepit album)|Ain't Life Grand]]''.\n\nRoxie began working with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1996 after a few good words were put in for him by Gilby and a shady character known as 'Bobby from Mates' while proving himself in an audition. He was offered a 'one year tour' playing with Alice. His first show with the Cooper band was at [[Sammy Hagar]]'s Cabo Wabo club in Cabo San Lucas.\n\nIn 1997 Roxie joined up with long-time friends drummer [[Mike Fasano]] and bassist Will Effertz and created the band Dad's Porno Mag. After Effertz left, guitarist [[Keri Kelli]] and bassist [[Stefan Adika]] joined.  The album was released on Wax-Tone Records. This item is now out of stock but was re-released in 2000 from Robinson Records. Produced by Jim Mitchell of [[Ugly Kid Joe]] fame and Mark Schulman ([[Simple Minds]]) with additional production by Alex Woltman and friend Gilby Clarke.  The album has fourteen tracks and one special hidden track entitled \"My Bad Knee\" on track 77. It is currently available at this site: ([http://www.roxie77.bandcamp.com])\n\nIn 1999, Roxie formed GlamNation under the alias Peter Kensington, a Glam cover band that played covers of early glam bands such as [[The Sweet]], [[David Bowie]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], T.Rex and [[Gary Glitter]] the band played a number of shows in L.A. in 1999 with a regular spot at The Gig (Club American Style) and a show in Scandinavia in 2000. Apparently, a live CD was made but is yet to be released.<ref>http://www.kiss-related-recordings.nl/ericsinger_glamnation.html</ref> The band consisted of the following musicians playing under their GlamNation Aliases, Peter Kensington (Ryan Roxie) \u2013 guitars, Doyle Harris ([[Eric Singer]]) \u2013 drums & vocals, J.C. Jackson ([[Eric Dover]]) - vocals & guitars, Yashiya ([[Stefan Adika]]) \u2013 bass, Ricky Lemons ([[Derek Sherinian]]) \u2013 keyboards. There was a line-up change for 2000 with Dr. Midnight ([[Teddy Andreadis]]) \u2013 keyboards, replacing [[Derek Sherinian]]. With the exception of [[Stefan Adika]] the other members formed part of the band for the Alice Cooper, Brutal Planet Tour and then without [[Teddy Andreadis]] went on to co-write and record the 2003 Alice Cooper release ''[[The Eyes of Alice Cooper]]''.\n\nIn 2000 Roxie recorded his first studio album with Alice Cooper, ''[[Brutal Planet]]''. Through 2000 to 2005 Roxie collaborated with Cooper on several albums including ''[[Dragontown]]'', ''[[The Eyes of Alice Cooper]]'' and ''[[Dirty Diamonds]]'', co-writing a number of songs on the latter two albums.\n\n2002 Roxie formed Roxie 77 and wrote a song whose influences lie somewhere in between [[the Beatles]] and the [[Beastie Boys]]. They played the usual suspect clubs around the L.A. area for the next year, and then recorded their debut CD.\n\n2004 Roxie 77's 11-song debut album, ''Peace, Love & Armageddon'', was released under the small indie Wax-Tone Records label. The spectrum of music and song subject matter span from acting like a punk-ass kid to facing the reality of actually having a kid.\n\nOn July 7, 2005, Roxie aired the first Roxie 77 [[podcast]] \u2013 ''Roxie's Big Rock Show''.  There were seven Podcasts in total which featured interviews with long-time friend [[Stefan Adika]], as well as [[Calico Cooper]], [[Damon Johnson]], [[Eric Singer]], [[Alice Cooper]] and Cheap Tricks [[Rick Nielsen]] and [[Bun E. Carlos]].  The podcast also featured Roxie's favourite songs, some rare tracks and two unreleased Roxie tracks including \"Consequence of the City\" with ex-Alice Cooper band member and friend [[Eric Dover]] on vocals.\n\nOctober 2006 saw Roxie hosting his own radio show on [[Rocket 95.3 FM]] (The Rock Home of Stockholm)  The show ran every Wednesday from 2:00 to 4:00 pm (Stockholm time) and played a variety of music.  The website featured live streaming, an online chat and webcam of Roxie in the studio.\n\n2009 Roxie 77's second album ''Two Sides to Every Story'', was released in July. The band added a downloadable song every week, with 24 songs in all. Each song is a regular and an acoustic version.\n\n2010 through to 2014 Roxie recorded two albums with the Stockholm-based, Casablanca: ''Apocalyptic Youth'' and ''Riding a Black Swan''.\n\nIn March 2012 it was announced <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickthings.co.uk |title=He's Back - Ryan Roxie to join Alice Cooper 2012 Tour |publisher=sickthings.co.uk |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000622071506/http://www.sickthings.co.uk/ |archivedate=June 22, 2000 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> that Ryan Roxie was rejoining the Alice Cooper band for the forthcoming 2012 tour.

This is a unique release out on Bellyache Records and is available in a package that includes vinyl, CD, and digital download. The album's two sides include an \"American side\", mixed by Tommy Henriksen, and a \"Swedish side\", mixed by Jon Bordon with a more garage-indie sound.\n\nMarch 2016 Roxie currently hosts a web-based Blab show called Big Rock Talk. The show features special guest interviews along with music videos.

Ryan's father, Polish, used to play trumpet and his mother was a drummer in her high school marching band. Around age five Roxie picked up the guitar but was more interested in drums. It wasn't until he was around eleven or twelve that he started taking guitar seriously.\n\nRoxie learned to play guitar from an old record player and invented his own form of scratching, going through many records in the process, picking out guitar parts.  He was influenced by albums like ''[[Van Halen (album)|Van Halen]]'' and has had many guitar heroes including [[Brian May]] from [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Steve Stevens]], [[Elliot Easton]] from [[The Cars]], Neil Geraldo from [[Pat Benatar]] and [[Rick Nielsen]] of [[Cheap Trick]].\n\n[[Candy (band)|Candy]] were a band featuring original members [[Kyle Vincent]], Jonathan Daniel, John Schubert, and guitarist [[Geoff Siegel]]. [[Gilby Clarke]] replaced Siegel after 6 months. They had an album release in 1985 titled ''Whatever Happened To Fun''. Later that year, Gilby Clarke replaced Kyle Vincent as lead vocalist, and guitarist Roxie joined the lineup. After Gilby parted to form his own band \"Kill for Thrills\" the rest of the guys joined up with new lead vocalist Shane and became the \"[[Electric Angels]]\".\n\nRoxie formed [[Electric Angels]] with Shane, Jonathan Daniel and drummer John Schubert. They moved to New York where they signed to [[Atlantic Records]].  The show they are signed at is opening for Dogs D'amour and [[Mother Love Bone]] (some of whose members went on to form [[Pearl Jam]]) and their self-titled album is released in 1990 produced by [[Tony Visconti]] (best known for his work with T Rex, Bowie and Thin Lizzy to name a few). The band works on a second album to be called ''New York Times'' but is dropped by Atlantic before it is released.\n\nBetween '94 and '96 Roxie worked with various artists.  He provided guitar on Gilby Clarke's albums, ''[[Pawnshop Guitars]]'', ''[[Blooze]]'', ''[[The Hangover (1997 album)|The Hangover]]'' and ''[[Rubber (Gilby Clarke album)|Rubber]]''.  Roxie also lent his guitar styling to the un-credited work with [[Tal Bachman]]. Roxie's guitar work is displayed on the hit single \"She's So High\" produced by [[Bob Rock]]. Roxie played guitar on [[James Michael]]'s (from Sixx AM) ''[[Inhale]]'' release as well. In 2000 Roxie also wrote and recorded on [[Slash's Snakepit]]'s second album ''[[Ain't Life Grand (Slash's Snakepit album)|Ain't Life Grand]]''.\n\nRoxie began working with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1996 after a few good words were put in for him by Gilby and a shady character known as 'Bobby from Mates' while proving himself in an audition. He was offered a 'one year tour' playing with Alice. His first show with the Cooper band was at [[Sammy Hagar]]'s Cabo Wabo club in Cabo San Lucas.\n\nIn 1997 Roxie joined up with long-time friends drummer [[Mike Fasano]] and bassist Will Effertz and created the band Dad's Porno Mag. After Effertz left, guitarist [[Keri Kelli]] and bassist [[Stefan Adika]] joined.  The album was released on Wax-Tone Records. This item is now out of stock but was re-released in 2000 from Robinson Records. Produced by Jim Mitchell of [[Ugly Kid Joe]] fame and Mark Schulman ([[Simple Minds]]) with additional production by Alex Woltman and friend Gilby Clarke.  The album has fourteen tracks and one special hidden track entitled \"My Bad Knee\" on track 77. It is currently available at this site: ([http://www.roxie77.bandcamp.com])\n\nIn 1999, Roxie formed GlamNation under the alias Peter Kensington, a Glam cover band that played covers of early glam bands such as [[The Sweet]], [[David Bowie]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], T.Rex and [[Gary Glitter]] the band played a number of shows in L.A. in 1999 with a regular spot at The Gig (Club American Style) and a show in Scandinavia in 2000. Apparently, a live CD was made but is yet to be released<ref>http://www.kiss-related-recordings.nl/ericsinger_glamnation.html</ref>. The band consisted of the following musicians playing under their GlamNation Aliases, Peter Kensington (Ryan Roxie) \u2013 guitars, Doyle Harris ([[Eric Singer]]) \u2013 drums & vocals, J.C. Jackson ([[Eric Dover]]) - vocals & guitars, Yashiya ([[Stefan Adika]]) \u2013 bass, Ricky Lemons ([[Derek Sherinian]]) \u2013 keyboards. There was a line-up change for 2000 with Dr. Midnight ([[Teddy Andreadis]]) \u2013 keyboards, replacing [[Derek Sherinian]]. With the exception of [[Stefan Adika]] the other members formed part of the band for the Alice Cooper, Brutal Planet Tour and then without [[Teddy Andreadis]] went on to co-write and record the 2003 Alice Cooper release ''[[The Eyes of Alice Cooper]]''.\n\nIn 2000 Roxie recorded his first studio album with Alice Cooper, ''[[Brutal Planet]]''. Through 2000 to 2005 Roxie collaborated with Cooper on several albums including ''[[Dragontown]]'', ''[[The Eyes of Alice Cooper]]'' and ''[[Dirty Diamonds]]'', co-writing a number of songs on the latter two albums.\n\n2002 Roxie formed Roxie 77 and wrote a song whose influences lie somewhere in between [[the Beatles]] and the [[Beastie Boys]]. They played the usual suspect clubs around the L.A. area for the next year, and then recorded their debut CD.\n\n2004 Roxie 77's 11-song debut album, ''Peace, Love & Armageddon'', was released under the small indie Wax-Tone Records label. The spectrum of music and song subject matter span from acting like a punk-ass kid to facing the reality of actually having a kid.\n\nOn July 7, 2005, Roxie aired the first Roxie 77 [[podcast]] \u2013 ''Roxie's Big Rock Show''.  There were seven Podcasts in total which featured interviews with long-time friend [[Stefan Adika]], as well as [[Calico Cooper]], [[Damon Johnson]], [[Eric Singer]], [[Alice Cooper]] and Cheap Tricks [[Rick Nielsen]] and [[Bun E. Carlos]].  The podcast also featured Roxie's favourite songs, some rare tracks and two unreleased Roxie tracks including \"Consequence of the City\" with ex-Alice Cooper band member and friend [[Eric Dover]] on vocals.\n\nOctober 2006 saw Roxie hosting his own radio show on [[Rocket 95.3 FM]] (The Rock Home of Stockholm)  The show ran every Wednesday from 2:00 to 4:00 pm (Stockholm time) and played a variety of music.  The website featured live streaming, an online chat and webcam of Roxie in the studio.\n\n2009 Roxie 77's second album ''Two Sides to Every Story'', was released in July. The band added a downloadable song every week, with 24 songs in all. Each song is a regular and an acoustic version.\n\n2010 through to 2014 Roxie recorded two albums with the Stockholm-based, Casablanca: ''Apocalyptic Youth'' and ''Riding a Black Swan''.\n\nIn March 2012 it was announced <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sickthings.co.uk |title=He's Back - Ryan Roxie to join Alice Cooper 2012 Tour |publisher=sickthings.co.uk |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000622071506/http://www.sickthings.co.uk/ |archivedate=June 22, 2000 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> that Ryan Roxie was rejoining the Alice Cooper band for the forthcoming 2012 tour.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present. WWE subsequently announced that WrestleMania would also be presented from the facility, and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches  \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" featuring [[The Undertaker]], and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" featuring [[\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] styles.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, The Undertaker, returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]].\n\nIn the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations.

As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[No Disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate and final match from the Performance Center, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed a fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted the Jackhammer, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who managed to still connect the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. During the pin, Bayley did not attempt to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth F-5, McIntyre countered and performed three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title, capturing his first world championship in WWE.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> and becoming the first-ever British-born world champion in WWE history, as well as WWE's thirty-first [[Triple_Crown_(professional_wrestling)#WWE|Triple Crown]] champion. After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013. While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)|blood money PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe coronavirus pandemic had lingering affects following WrestleMania. WWE's next event, [[Money in the Bank (2020)|Money in the Bank]], also had to be relocated due to the virus. Furthermore, WWE released several talent due to budget cuts a result of the pandemic.

It was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020 and broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5, marking the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]]. On PPV, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a [[Product bundling|package deal]].\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]] and was to air live. In mid-March 2020, all WWE programming was relocated to the [[WWE Performance Center]] training facility in [[Orlando]] due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], with [[Behind closed doors (sport)|no audience]] and only essential staff present. WWE subsequently announced that WrestleMania would also be presented from the facility, and air across two nights. The majority of its matches were pre-recorded at the Performance Center between March 25 and 26. Taking advantage of the format, two matches  \u2014 a \"[[Buried Alive match|Boneyard match]]\" featuring [[The Undertaker]], and a \"Firefly Fun House match\" featuring [[\"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt]] \u2014 were filmed off-site in atypical, [[filmmaking|cinematic]] styles.\n\nThe card comprised nineteen matches which were divided between the two nights, including one match on each night's Kickoff pre-show and a [[Glossary_of_professional_wrestling_terms#dark_match|dark match]] on the second night. In the main event for Part 1, The Undertaker, returning to his \"American Bad Ass\" gimmick, defeated [[AJ Styles]] in a Boneyard match. In other prominent matches, [[Braun Strowman]] defeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] to win the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], [[Becky Lynch]] defeated [[Shayna Baszler]] to retain the [[Raw Women's Championship]], and [[Kevin Owens]] defeated [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[No Disqualification match]].\n\nIn the main event for Part 2, [[Drew McIntyre]]  defeated [[Brock Lesnar]] to win the [[WWE Championship]], after which, McIntyre retained the title in an impromptu dark match against [[Big Show]] (which was shown on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''). In other prominent matches, \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt defeated [[John Cena]] in a Firefly Fun House match, [[Charlotte Flair]] defeated [[Rhea Ripley]] to win the [[NXT Women's Championship]] for a second time, which was the first time an NXT championship was defended at the event, [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] in a [[Last Man Standing match]], which was Edge's first singles match since 2011, and [[Otis Dozovic|Otis]] defeated [[Dolph Ziggler]].\n\nWrestleMania 36 received mostly positive reactions from fans and critics. While it was noted that the event suffered from the absence of a live audience and a poor lead-up (partly due to a number of wrestlers being pulled from the event shortly before its filming, mostly in relation to the pandemic, including [[Roman Reigns]], [[The Miz]], [[Andrade (wrestler)|Andrade]], and [[Dana Brooke]], all of whom were slated to defend or challenge for championships), most felt that WWE exceeded expectations. The Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches were singled out as highlights due to their uniqueness and over-the-top tone.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\n[[WrestleMania]] is considered [[WWE]]'s flagship event, having first been held in [[WrestleMania I|1985]].

The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and chokeslammed Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+'''Other on-screen personnel \u2013 Part 2'''\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|Spanish commentator\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]<ref name=\"Spanishannouncers\"/>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"7\"|Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view portion of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. With the referee distracted, Rose also performed a low blow on Ziggler. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a Last Man Standing match. As Edge waited for Orton to make his entrance, Orton \u2013 who had been disguised as a cameraman \u2013 attacked Edge from behind with an RKO. Orton then attacked Edge with a second RKO and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Center's gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. After fighting all throughout the Performance Center, they eventually fought atop a production truck where Edge performed a spear on Orton and Orton performed an RKO on Edge. In the end, Edge applied a sleeper hold on Orton, who passed out on a chair. A conflicted Edge then performed the Conchairto on Orton. Edge won the match after Orton was unable to answer the referee's 10 count.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, The Street Profits (Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford) defended the Raw Tag Team Championship against Angel Garza and Austin Theory (with Zelina Vega). In the closing moments, Ford performed a Springboard Frogsplash on Theory, who was then pinned by Dawkins. After the match, Garza, Theory, and Vega attacked the Street Profits. NXT's [[Bianca Belair]] then ran out and attacked Vega, clearing the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, new 24/7 Champion Mojo Rawley ran away from multiple wrestlers into the Performance Center. They cornered Rawley near the podium host Rob Gronkowski was standing on. Gronkowski witnessed this and performed a dive on top of the wrestlers. Gronkowski then pinned Rawley to win the 24/7 Championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship in a fatal five-way elimination match against Sasha Banks, Lacey Evans, Naomi, and Tamina. Tamina was the first eliminated after all the other wrestlers piled on top of her for the pin. Banks applied the Bank Statement on Naomi to eliminate her. As Bayley attempted a dropkick on Evans in the corner, Evans moved out of the way and Bayley attacked Banks instead. After Bayley tried apologizing, Bayley pushed Banks out of the way of an attack from Evans, who managed to still connect the Woman's Right on Banks to eliminate her. During the pin, Bayley did not attempt to save Banks. In the end, as Evans was about to perform the Woman's Right on Bayley, Banks returned to the ring and performed a Backstabber on Evans. Bayley then performed a DDT on Evans to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe penultimate match was the Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt. Cena came out for his match in the Performance Center, assuming his match was taking place in the ring. Wyatt was then shown in the Firefly Fun House, stating that Cena would actually be facing himself before exiting through the fun house's door. Cena was then teleported to the Firefly Fun House. After also going through the door, Cena was transported through a series of [[dream sequence]]s where Wyatt demonstrated his perceived personality flaws (such as being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did), including his debut appearance on ''SmackDown'' (with Wyatt acting as [[Kurt Angle]], and Cena seemingly unable to say anything but \"[[History of WWE#Ruthless Aggression Era (2002-2008)|ruthless aggression]]\"), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' (where Wyatt introduced Cena as his tag team partner \"Johnny Largemeat\", who was tired out from repeatedly lifting weights). Appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt then reminisced about his loss to Cena at [[WrestleMania XXX]], and pledged to right his previous wrong. Back in a ring, Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|nWo Monday Nitro]]''\u2014with Cena acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] and Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt. After a fury of fists, Wyatt disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind and performed Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw on Cena to win the match, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin. Just before The Fiend performed Sister Abigail, the audio of Cena's promo from ''SmackDown'' was played, where Cena had stated that at WrestleMania, he would end the existence of the \"most over hyped, over valued, over privileged WWE Superstar\".<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-firefly-funhouse-boneyard-matches-lead-best-moments-from-surreal-2020-show/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results: Firefly FunHouse, Boneyard matches lead best moments from surreal 2020 show|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://africa.espn.com/wwe/story/_/id/28997784/wwe-wrestlemania-36-live-results-recaps-analysis|title=WrestleMania 36: McIntyre stops Lesnar, Gronk wins 24/7 title|date=2020-04-05|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. As Lesnar went for a fourth F-5, McIntyre countered and performed three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title, capturing his first world championship in WWE.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/> and becoming the first-ever British-born world champion in WWE history, as well as WWE's thirty-first [[Triple_Crown_(professional_wrestling)#WWE|Triple Crown]] champion. After the show went off the air, McIntyre was confronted by [[Big Show]], who McIntyre then faced in a title defense described by WWE as the \"hidden WrestleMania main event.\"<ref>{{cite tweet |author=WWE WrestleMania|user=WrestleMania|number=1247357532789768194|date=April 6, 2020 |title=Your hidden #WrestleMania main event has been unlocked. #WWERaw @WWETheBigShow @DMcIntyreWWE |access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref> McIntyre performed a Claymore Kick on Big Show to retain the title.

While most agreed that WrestleMania 36 suffered from both a poor lead-up and the absence of a live audience, many felt that the event exceeded expectations, with both critics and fans largely praising the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches as the best of the event for their uniqueness and over-the-top tone (and in the case of the latter, its inventiveness and humor); the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match and Owens vs. Rollins were also singled out by most critics.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\">{{Cite web |last=Szalai |first=Georg |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-wwe-pulled-wrestlemania-36-fans-business-impact-1288659 |title=How WWE Pulled Off WrestleMania 36 Without Fans and What It Means for Its Business and Future |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"SlateReview\">{{Cite web |last=Bixenspan |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/2020/04/wrestlemania-36-no-fans-audience-coronavirus-undertaker-john-cena.html |title=WrestleMania Still Happened Last Weekend.

Club]]'' gave the event a B\u2013. While praising WWE for making the most out of its \"weirdest WrestleMania of all time\", particularly praising the Boneyard match, he did point out that most matches suffered from its poor lead-up and lack of live audience, stating notably that Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler's match was \"a listless and too-short battle that, when you consider the response both performers tend to extract from crowds, might have shifted into another gear in a packed stadium.\" He also cited examples of \"shoddy storytelling\", noting that it \"[was] great that Braun Strowman beat the snot out of Goldberg, but it might have resonated more if the company hadn't just had the 53-year old Goldberg destroy The Fiend, a heretofore untouchable star, during a [[Super ShowDown (2020)|blood money PPV in Saudi Arabia]]\u2014and, you know, done anything with Braun over the past few years.\"<ref name=\"AVCReview\">{{Cite web |last=Colbrun |first=Randall |url=https://tv.avclub.com/the-weirdest-wrestlemania-of-all-time-at-least-figured-1842699373 |title=The Weirdest Wrestlemania of All Time at Least Figured Out How to Use Its Legends |work=[[The A.

Others decided to play to a crowd that wasn't actually there. [...] the WWE style\u2014with its emphasis on overwrought capital\u2013P 'performance,' over-rehearsed matches, and flowery mannerisms\u2014looked more like a parody when staged in front of zero spectators. Still, expectations for this WrestleMania were low, albeit with some minor optimism over the show being divided up into two nights instead of the marathon one-night slogs of recent years.\" However, he stated that after two lackluster opening matches, the card from Lynch vs. Baszler onward was \"very physical matches [which] made the best of the setting, and with most of the matches fitting that bill, [Part 1] was really strong overall\", although he found Part 2 much weaker, stating that Edge vs. Randy Orton was \"glacially slow, and it appeared to somehow be edited out of an even longer match\", and that Lesnar vs. McIntyre felt \"more like a formality than anything cool, because it was so paint-by-numbers.\" ''Slate'' considered the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches to be the best matches.<ref name=\"SlateReview\"/>\n\n''[[Bleacher Report]]'' stated \"It's hard to judge this event. You have to take the good with the bad, maintain honest integrity with criticism, but also be forgiving and acknowledge that this was not how WrestleMania was supposed to be.\" They gave a positive review, although they ranked Elias vs. Corbin, Black vs. Lashley, and the SmackDown Women's title match as the low points of the event.<ref name=\"BleacherReview1\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883707-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-1 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 1 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 5, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"BleacherReview2\">{{Cite web |last=Mango |first=Anthony |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2883709-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-reviewing-top-highlights-and-low-points-of-day-2 |title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Reviewing Top Highlights and Low Points of Day 2 |publisher=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=April 6, 2020 |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, ''Bleacher Report'' gave the Boneyard match a 4.5 star ratings on a scale of 5, their highest rated match from both nights, while giving the Universal Championship match a 0.5 star, their lowest rated match from the event.<ref>{{cit web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885202-wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-star-ratings-for-all-matches-from-full-show|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 Results: Star Ratings for All Matches from Full Show|author=Rill, Jake|date=April 6, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020|work=Bleacher Report}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the Boneyard and Firefly Fun House matches could set a precedent for WWE using more \"cinematic experiences\" in its programming to make up for the closed door tapings.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterReview\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe coronavirus pandemic had lingering affects following WrestleMania.

Stylistically, his work at this time became much more abstract, abandoning figurative representation in favour of symbolic allusions. He regularly treated the canvas as a sculptural plane, with materials such as metals, powders, bones, feathers, beeswax, fabric, wires, animal skins and papers embedded in thick paints and pastes.  Works of this period generally occupy the entirety of the canvas with little or no \"negative space\" left.\n\nNotable album covers include:\n* [[Roger Eno]], ''Between Tides''\n* [[Japan (band)|Japan]], ''[[Exorcising Ghosts]]''\n* [[Harold Budd]] and [[Brian Eno]], ''[[The Pearl (album)|The Pearl]]''\n* [[Roger Eno]], ''Voices''\n* [[David Sylvian]], ''[[Gone to Earth (David Sylvian album)|Gone to Earth]]''\n* [[Michael Brook]], ''[[Hybrid (Michael Brook album)|Hybrid]]''\n* [[Nine Inch Nails]], ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'', ''[[Hesitation Marks]]''\n* ''The Overload'' (illustration for the [[Talking Heads]] song in their book, ''What the Songs Look Like)''\n\nAn analysis of the symbolic meaning of the elements used to create the cover for Roger Eno's ''Between Tides'' appears in the 1999 book ''[[100 Best Album Covers]]'', edited by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell (of the design group [[Hipgnosis]].)\n\n==Work with Nine Inch Nails==\nRussell Mills worked with [[Nine Inch Nails]] in 1994-1997 and again in 2012-15.\n\nIn 1994, he was commissioned to create the entire visual world of ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'', beginning with the artwork for that album's cover and booklet, and extending to all of the associated singles (including ''[[March of the Pigs]]'' and ''[[Closer to God]]''), the remix collection ''[[Further Down the Spiral]]'', the 1997 videocassette compilation ''[[Closure (Nine Inch Nails VHS)|Closure]]'', the 2004 Deluxe Edition and DualDisc re-releases of ''The Downward Spiral'', (which was accompanied by several new Mills compositions downloadable from the Nine Inch Nails website<ref>[http://www.nin.wiki/Russell_Mills Nine Inch Nails: Russell Mills]</ref>), and various promotional materials.\n\nThese interrelated works contain Mills' heaviest use of organic materials to depict a sense of fragility and decay.<ref>[http://www.russellmills.com/mills/installations/committere.html Russell Mills Committere]</ref>  Animal skeletons, sets of teeth, blood, feathers, and dead insects are liberally embedded in the canvases.  In some pieces, materials have been affixed and then exposed to water or chemical elements, so that their decay is literally imprinted on the surface of the artwork.\n\nIn 2012 work began on the cover art for the album ''[[Hesitation Marks]]'', released in 2013, and subsequently an art book called Cargo in the Blood,<ref>[http://media.russellmills.com/wordpress/ ''Cargo in the Blood'']</ref><ref>[http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/nine-inch-nails-and-russell-mills-to-publish-art-book/ Nine Inch Nails and Russell Mills to publish art book]</ref> released in December 2015.\n\n==Advent of digital design==\nFrom the later 1990s to the present, Mills' work has again evolved to a new style, made possible by the advent of computer design applications such as [[Photoshop]].  The \"collage\" aesthetic is still frequently seen, but now in a virtual/digital form, with many abutting and overlapping semi-transparent images, often cropped into crisp, aligned rectangles.\n\nMills still uses hand-drawn or -painted imagery, but as often as not it is scanned into the computer and treated as another malleable collage element.  Images of water and sky are frequently seen, and a cooler color palette often prevails (in contrast to an earlier reliance on earth tones).\n\nNegative space is still a rarity in Mills' compositions.  It is worth noting that many of the musicians who choose Mills as an illustrator compose music that is \"[[Ambient music|ambient]]\" to varying degrees.  Many of the album covers visually reflect this, in that they can be viewed quickly for an overall emotional impression, while intense perusal reveals many painstakingly layered details.\n \nNotable album covers from 1995 to the present include:\n* ''[[Ocean of Sound]]'' and ''Haunted Weather'', both compiled by [[David Toop]]\n* ''[[Panthalassa: The Music of Miles Davis 1969\u20131974]]'', [[Miles Davis]]\n* ''[[BBC Sessions (Cocteau Twins album)|BBC Sessions]]'', [[Cocteau Twins]]\n* ''[[Dead Bees on a Cake]]'' and associated singles, [[David Sylvian]]\n* ''[[The Redesign]]'', [[Bill Laswell]] (under the pseudonym of \"Operazone\")\n* Several albums by [[Michael Nyman]], reissued in 2005\n\n==Music==\nIn addition to soundtracking several multimedia exhibits (see below), Russell Mills has released two albums to date:\n* ''Undark'' (1996) ''(re-released in 2000 as \"Undark One: Strange Familiar\")''\n* ''Pearl + Umbra'' (1999) ''(re-released in 2000 as \"Undark Two: Pearl + Umbra\")''\n\nBoth albums originated from Mills \"collecting sounds\" from musicians, many of whose albums he has illustrated. He then collaged the organic and electronic sounds into ambient pieces (with one or two vocal \"songs\" per album), with varying degrees of collaboration with the originating artists.\n\nFeatured contributors to ''Undark'' ''(aka \"Undark One: Strange Familiar\")'':\n{{Flatlist|\n* [[Michael Brook]]\n* Declan Colgan\n* Hywel Davies\n* [[The Edge]] (of [[U2]])\n* [[Brian Eno]]\n* [[Roger Eno]]\n* [[Robin Guthrie]] (of [[Cocteau Twins]])\n* [[Bill Laswell]]\n* [[Kevin Shields]] (of [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]])\n* Tom Smyth & Will Joss (credited as \"Miasma\" on the original 1996 em:t release)\n}}\n\nFeatured contributors to ''Pearl + Umbra'':\n{{Flatlist|\n* Ildefonso Aguilar\n* Samuel Aguilar\n* John Aitken\n* [[Eraldo Bernocchi]]\n* [[Michael Brook]]\n* [[Harold Budd]]\n* Mark Clifford (of [[Seefeel]])\n* Declan Colgan\n* Huw Costin\n* [[Sussan Deyhim]]\n* [[Brian Eno]]\n* [[Roger Eno]]\n* Mike Fearon\n* Ali Foster\n* [[Peter Gabriel]]\n* [[Robin Guthrie]] (of [[Cocteau Twins]])\n* [[Graham Haynes]]\n* Derek Hook\n* [[Bill Laswell]]\n* Graham Lewis\n* Hamish Mackintosh\n* Ian McCullough\n* Tony McSweeney\n* Ann Mills\n* Sam Mills\n* [[Thurston Moore]] (of [[Sonic Youth]])\n* [[Paul Sch\u00fctze]]\n* [[David Sylvian]]\n* [[Clodagh Simonds]]\n* Tom Smyth\n* Mitsuo Tate\n* Jonny Tomlinson\n* [[Emma Townshend]]\n* Ian Walton\n* [[Hector Zazou]]\n}}\n\n==Multimedia soundtracks==\n\n* ''Measured in Shadows'' (1995, with Ian Walton & Big Block 454)\n* ''Republic of Thorns''  (2001, with Ian Walton & Paul Farley and Mike Fearon)\n* ''Cleave / Soft Bullets''  (2002, with Mike Fearon)\n* ''Still Moves'' is a series of six limited-edition books charting the evolution of the multimedia installations Russell Mills has created since 1994.

He then collaged the organic and electronic sounds into ambient pieces (with one or two vocal \"songs\" per album), with varying degrees of collaboration with the originating artists.\n\nFeatured contributors to ''Undark'' ''(aka \"Undark One: Strange Familiar\")'':\n{{Flatlist|\n* [[Michael Brook]]\n* Declan Colgan\n* Hywel Davies\n* [[The Edge]] (of [[U2]])\n* [[Brian Eno]]\n* [[Roger Eno]]\n* [[Robin Guthrie]] (of [[Cocteau Twins]])\n* [[Bill Laswell]]\n* [[Kevin Shields]] (of [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]])\n* Tom Smyth & Will Joss (credited as \"Miasma\" on the original 1996 em:t release)\n}}\n\nFeatured contributors to ''Pearl + Umbra'':\n{{Flatlist|\n* Ildefonso Aguilar\n* Samuel Aguilar\n* John Aitken\n* [[Eraldo Bernocchi]]\n* [[Michael Brook]]\n* [[Harold Budd]]\n* Mark Clifford (of [[Seefeel]])\n* Declan Colgan\n* Huw Costin\n* [[Sussan Deyhim]]\n* [[Brian Eno]]\n* [[Roger Eno]]\n* Mike Fearon\n* Ali Foster\n* [[Peter Gabriel]]\n* [[Robin Guthrie]] (of [[Cocteau Twins]])\n* [[Graham Haynes]]\n* Derek Hook\n* [[Bill Laswell]]\n* Graham Lewis\n* Hamish Mackintosh\n* Ian McCullough\n* Tony McSweeney\n* Ann Mills\n* Sam Mills\n* [[Thurston Moore]] (of [[Sonic Youth]])\n* [[Paul Sch\u00fctze]]\n* [[David Sylvian]]\n* [[Clodagh Simonds]]\n* Tom Smyth\n* Mitsuo Tate\n* Jonny Tomlinson\n* [[Emma Townshend]]\n* Ian Walton\n* [[Hector Zazou]]\n}}\n\n==Multimedia soundtracks==\n\n* ''Measured in Shadows'' (1995, with Ian Walton & Big Block 454)\n* ''Republic of Thorns''  (2001, with Ian Walton & Paul Farley and Mike Fearon)\n* ''Cleave / Soft Bullets''  (2002, with Mike Fearon)\n* ''Still Moves'' is a series of six limited-edition books charting the evolution of the multimedia installations Russell Mills has created since 1994.
