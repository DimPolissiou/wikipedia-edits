Winner of the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] 1957, ''At Lady Molly's'' is set in England of the mid-1930s and is essentially a comedy of manners, but in the background, the rise of [[Hitler]] and of worldwide Fascism are not ignored. The driving theme of ''At Lady Molly's'' is married life; marriages \u2013 as practised or mooted \u2013 among the narrator's (Nick Jenkins) acquaintances in bohemian society and the landed classes are pondered. Meanwhile, the career moves of various characters are advanced, checked or put on hold.\n\nThe portrait of the aristocratic Tolland family is sourced in part from Powell's own in-laws, the Pakenhams.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{quote|Of course you hardly ever meet intelligent people there...

He gets invited by a colleague, Chips Lovell, to a party at the home of Lady Molly Jeavons. There he learns that Widmerpool is to marry the twice widowed, somewhat notorious (somewhat insane according to Nick) Mrs. Mildred Haycock. Nick subsequently has to endure having to lunch with Widmerpool and fending-off questions from Widmerpool's prospective in-laws becomes, for Nick, a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] throughout the novel. Also re-encountered at Lady Molly's gathering is old Alfred Tolland.\n\nA chance meeting by Nick with Quiggin (at a cinema where ''[[Man of Aran]]'' is showing) leads to a surprising and rather mysterious invitation of a weekend visit to the country. Quiggin and Mona Templer are staying in a cottage loaned to them by Erridge (Lord Warminster, eccentric head of the Tolland family). While there, they all visit the Tolland ancestral home, Thrubworth Park, for a frugal but eventful dinner.\n\nJust as the meal is finishing two Tolland sisters, Susan and Isobel, arrive. Some while later Nick meets [[Lady Molly]]'s husband, Ted Jeavons, in a Soho pub and they visit Umfraville's nightclub. They encounter Widmerpool (suffering another bout with [[jaundice]]), Mrs Haycock and Templer.\n\nIn Autumn 1934 Jenkins becomes engaged to Isobel. Erridge, wanting to study conditions for himself, goes to China at a time when the Japanese army are undertaking offensive operations. Mona goes with him, ditching Quiggin. Widmerpool's engagement to Mildred Haycock is broken off in farcical and, to most men, crushing circumstances. However, Widmerpool remains undaunted.\n*[http://www.anthonypowell.org.uk/home.php?page=M01 Adapted in part from material published by the Anthony Powell Society with consent]\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Tariq Ali]], in what is really a defence of Powell and his work, doesn't comment about\nAt Lady Molly's in particular but writes of [[A Dance to the Music of Time]], \"By the time he came to write the Dance, Powell's style had become almost antique, [[baroque]] \u2013 and that lifted the comedy to a much higher level than one finds in the early novels.\" Powell's early novels are described as ''witty'' whereas the \"Dance\" books are of a higher order because the style \"had become much more reflective.\" Ali also remarked in the same article, \"Coincidence plays an important part in the characters' many encounters.

Bertha herself was one of six daughters of the late and not much lamented [[Lord Vowchurch]], a rather grim practical joker. All six daughters lived their early lives in disgrace for none of them being a boy. Cousin to [[Baby Wentworth]].\n*'''''Mildred Haycock, n\u00e9e Blaides'''''. Nick suspects that she is probably insane. Younger sister of [[Bertha Conyers]]. A [[V.A.D.]] during the [[First World War]], Nick first sees her while visiting the Conyers flat with his mother ''towards Christmas 1916''.<ref name=\"At Lady Molly's Pp 8\" /> Nick was then a schoolboy of ten and was much impressed when Mildred ''a young woman wearing V.A.D uniform, strode in like a [[grenadier]]''.<ref>At Lady Molly's Pp 9</ref> The next time he sees her he is at [[Lady Molly]]'s. Mildred, who is twice widowed by then with two teenage children and ''has slept with every old-timer between Cannes and St. Tropez'',<ref>At Lady Molly's Pp 173</ref> walks into the room with her new fianc\u00e9- [[Widmerpool]]. During the war Mildred nursed at [[Dogdene]] where she met [[Lady Molly]] and also became close to Alice, the successive Lady Sleaford.\n*'''''Lady Molly Jeavons'''''. Who could boast that ''my grandfather had ninety-seven first cousins and he was only three up my grandmother on my mother's side''<ref>At Lady Molly's Pp 23</ref> was an [[Ardglass]], sister to [[Jumbo Ardglass]] and to the present [[Lady Katherine Warminster]]. She married Lord John Sleaford,- [[Chips Lovell]]'s ''first Sleaford Uncle''<ref>Pp 16</ref>- at eighteen straight ''from the Ballroom''.<ref>At Lady Molly's p 17</ref> The marriage was childless. Whilst Lady Sleaford she was mistress of the magnificent Sleaford seat of [[Dogdene]]. The house was used as a military hospital during the [[First World War]]. It was at this time that she got to know [[Mildred Blaides]] and also met Captain [[Jeavons]]. Lord John Sleaford died of the [[Spanish flu]] in 1919 and the title passed to his brother Geoffery- Lovell's ''second Sleaford Uncle''.\nMolly again met [[Cap. Teddy Jeavons]] at the car show at the [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] and they later married. Living on, as Lovell surmised, about \u00a3100 a year of her own money with Jeavons not bringing in ''a cent''<ref>At Lady Molly's Pp 18</ref> the Jevonses' kept open house at their home at South Kensington, ''a social [[no-man's land]]''<ref>Pp 157</ref> where one could meet ''all kinds''<ref>At Lady Molly's Pp 59</ref> (excepting working class types unless they were employees). It was at [[Lady Molly]]'s that [[Widerpool]] first met Mildred, Mrs Haycock. [[Nick Jenkins]] re-encounters [[Alfred Tolland]] and [[Mark Members]] there.\n*'''''Captain Teddy Jeavons'''''. Lady Molly's second husband. Badly wounded during the war and awarded the [[Military Medal]]. Nick finds him intriguing although he finds ''in the last resort his company was exhausting rather than stimulating''<ref>At Lady Molly's Pp 162</ref> and thinks of him as having a mind ''seething with forgotten melodies, forever stirring him to indiscretion by provoking memories of an enchanted past''.<ref>Pp 178</ref> [[Mark Members]], whom Jeavons asked about snooker, offered a [[Gold Flake]] cigarette and tried to sell a [[patent device]], looked upon him ''with absolute horror''.<ref>Pp 180</ref> [[Widmerpool]] dismisses Jeavons as a failure and dull. Later it transpires that Jeavons had a wartime fling with Mildred Blaides and there is a ''strong hint''<ref>Pp 174</ref> that he again has sex with her while she is engaged to [[Widmerpool]]- an act that [[Widmerpool]] signally fails to perform.\n*'''''Lord Alfred Warminster'''''. Erry (short for Erridge, his first title) to his family, Alf to Quiggin. In his early thirties and most probably still a virgin. Lonely, socially inept, unkempt Left wing [[peerage|Peer]]. Frugal and stingy in personal interaction but free with his money to those social causes that he feels passionate about \u2013 the latter a trait which makes him very attractive to [[J.G. Quiggin]] and one that [[Mona Templer]] indicates that she aims to cure him of. Egotistical, worries about his health and used to having his own way. First mention of this character was in [[A Buyer's Market]] when his name was announced at the [[Huntercombes]] party.<ref>A Buyer's Market''Pp 43</ref>\n*'''''Lady Frederica Budd'''''. Widowed. Eldest of the Tolland sisters. A [[lady-in-waiting]] and great friend of [[Mrs Conyers]].\n*'''Priscilla Tolland'''. Youngest of the Tollands and desired by [[Chips Lovell]]\n*'''''Norah Tolland'''''. A lesbian living with [[Eleanor Walpole-Wilson]] in some squalor at a flat in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]\n*'''''Susan Tolland'''''. Turns-up with Isobel at [[Thrubworth]] and announces her engagement to [[Roddy Cutts]] (who ''looks into the Conservative Central Office once in a way''<ref>Pp 113</ref>).\n*'''''Isobel Tolland'''''. ''A bit of a highbrow when she isn't going to night clubs''<ref>Pp 19</ref> according to [[Chips Lovell]], Nick meets her at [[Thrubworth]] and they are engaged by the last chapter. Long legged and witty.\n*'''''Blanche Tolland'''''. Regarded by the Tolland family as being ''dotty''.\n*'''''Katherine Warminster'''''. Sister of [[Lady Molly]]. Widowed stepmother to the ten Tollands. Lives at [[Hyde Park Gardens]] where life could be ''ruthless... but at the same time a curtain of relatively good humour was allowed to cloak an inexorable recognition of life's inevitable severities''.<ref name=\"Pp 167\">Pp 167</ref> To Nick's mind she has an unearthly, witch-like quality. A [[hypochondriac]], she spends most of her time in her bedroom writing lightly researched histories of powerful women \u2013 [[Empress Maria Theresa of Austria]] her current subject. Lord Warminster had spent most of their married life ''fishing in Iceland or pig-sticking in Bengal''.<ref name=\"Pp 167\" />\n*'''''Smith the butler'''''. Sole working-class character, discounting Quiggin, in the book. Lacks what [[Bertie Wooster]] would call the [[Feudal spirit]]. Slovenly, alcoholic butler to Erridge. [[Lady Molly]] borrows him to help out at [[South Kensington]] from time to time. Breaks the [[Dresden coffee pot]] and is suspected of drinking the gin.\n*'''''Chips Lovell'''''. Twenty three or four and filling-in time at the script department of a film company where Nick works. Hopes to land a job on the society pages of a newspaper. Spends most of his time talking about his aristocratic cousins. Amorously interested in [[Priscilla Tolland]]\n*'''''Heather Hopkins'''''. Lesbian Cabaret performer. Plays piano ''with brutal violence''<ref>Pp 148</ref> but ''a great deal of facility''.<ref name=\"Pp 150\">Pp 150</ref> Appears in an act with [[Max Pilgrim]] at [[Dickie Umfraville]]'s night club. Neighbour of [[Norah Tolland]] and [[Eleanor Walpole-Wilson]].\n*'''''Mrs. Betty Taylor or Porter'''''. Peter Templer's new girlfriend whose last name he can't remember although he regards her as ''rather a peach''.<ref name=\"Pp 150\" />\n*'''''Maisky'''''. Lady Molly's pet monkey.\n\n==Established characters==\n\n*'''''Alfred Tolland'''''. Brother-in-law to [[Lady Molly]] who teases him mercilessly about his nieces and nephews. Has unexpected depths.\n*'''''Max Pilgrim'''''. Sings one of his '[[sophisticated]]' comic songs (about a lesbian), accompanied by [[Heather Hopkins]] on piano, at [[Umfraville]]'s.\n*'''''Miss Weedon'''''. Much in evidence at [[Lady Molly]]'s. Has a plan to cure Stringham of his alcoholism.\n*'''''Eleanor Walpole Wilson'''''. Living with Norah Tolland. Dislikes Heather Hopkins. Now in a position to feel sorry for Barbara (Goring) Pardoe due to problems in the latter's marriage.\n*'''Dickie Umfraville'''. Now managing a night club of dubious legality in [[Soho]]. Divorced from Lady Anne Stepney who, he says, ''didn't like grown-up life- and who can blame her?''.<ref>Pp 145</ref>\n*'''''Peter Templer'''''. Meets Nick at [[Umfraville]]'s night club.\n*'''''Mona Templer'''''. Living in a cottage with [[Quiggin]] on Erridge's [[Thrubworth]] estate. Bored, she fancies becoming a film star but runs off to China with Erridge instead.\n*'''''Mark Members'''''. No longer writing Freudian-inspired verse and has thrown over his half-hearted adherence to communism. Now he has a variety of jobs of a ''literary kind''<ref>Pp 177</ref> which keep him in funds. Trying to move up in the social world which is why he regards the people he meets at [[Lady Molly]]'s reception as being great disappointments.\n*'''''Quiggin'''''. Now a well-regarded critic, although his ''Unburnt Boats'' remains a work in progress. He has become a hanger on of Erridge, ''Alf'' Warminster, whom he hopes will finance a new magazine with Quiggin as director. His Left wing bombast and odd regional idioms reach new heights.\n*'''''[[Kenneth Widmerpool|Widmerpool]]'''''. Becomes engaged, contracts [[jaundice]]- again, see [[A Buyer's Market]] -, gets [[cuckold]]ed and then [[wikt:jilt|jilted]]. Has a ''terrible and dramatic''<ref>Pp 187</ref> scene at [[Dogdene]]. Politically he is an [[Appeaser]].\n*'''''Nick Jenkins'''''. His twenty-eight-year-old (or thereabouts) self has become more assertive and outspoken when interacting with his contemporaries (although Widmerpool still renders him speechless).\n\n==Themes==\n\"What, then, is the central theme of the series? Creativity \u2013 the act of production. Of literature, of books, of paintings, of music; that is what most of the central characters are engaged in for the whole of their lives. Moreland composes, Barnby paints, X Trapnel writes, Quiggin, Members and Maclintick criticise and the narrator publishes books and then becomes a writer. What excites the novelist is music and painting, literature and criticism.

It was at [[Lady Molly]]'s that [[Widerpool]] first met Mildred, Mrs Haycock. [[Nick Jenkins]] re-encounters [[Alfred Tolland]] and [[Mark Members]] there.\n*'''''Captain Teddy Jeavons'''''. Lady Molly's second husband. Badly wounded during the war and awarded the [[Military Medal]]. Nick finds him intriguing although he finds ''in the last resort his company was exhausting rather than stimulating''<ref>At Lady Molly's Pp 162</ref> and thinks of him as having a mind ''seething with forgotten melodies, forever stirring him to indiscretion by provoking memories of an enchanted past''.<ref>Pp 178</ref> [[Mark Members]], whom Jeavons asked about snooker, offered a [[Gold Flake]] cigarette and tried to sell a [[patent device]], looked upon him ''with absolute horror''.<ref>Pp 180</ref> [[Widmerpool]] dismisses Jeavons as a failure and dull. Later it transpires that Jeavons had a wartime fling with Mildred Blaides and there is a ''strong hint''<ref>Pp 174</ref> that he again has sex with her while she is engaged to [[Widmerpool]]- an act that [[Widmerpool]] signally fails to perform.\n*'''''Lord Alfred Warminster'''''. Erry (short for Erridge, his first title) to his family, Alf to Quiggin. In his early thirties and most probably still a virgin. Lonely, socially inept, unkempt Left wing [[peerage|Peer]]. Frugal and stingy in personal interaction but free with his money to those social causes that he feels passionate about \u2013 the latter a trait which makes him very attractive to [[J.G. Quiggin]] and one that [[Mona Templer]] indicates that she aims to cure him of. Egotistical, worries about his health and used to having his own way.

Long legged and witty.\n*'''''Blanche Tolland'''''. Regarded by the Tolland family as being ''dotty''.\n*'''''Katherine Warminster'''''. Sister of [[Lady Molly]]. Widowed stepmother to the ten Tollands. Lives at [[Hyde Park Gardens]] where life could be ''ruthless... but at the same time a curtain of relatively good humour was allowed to cloak an inexorable recognition of life's inevitable severities''.<ref name=\"Pp 167\">Pp 167</ref> To Nick's mind she has an unearthly, witch-like quality. A [[hypochondriac]], she spends most of her time in her bedroom writing lightly researched histories of powerful women \u2013 [[Empress Maria Theresa of Austria]] her current subject. Lord Warminster had spent most of their married life ''fishing in Iceland or pig-sticking in Bengal''.<ref name=\"Pp 167\" />\n*'''''Smith the butler'''''. Sole working-class character, discounting Quiggin, in the book. Lacks what [[Bertie Wooster]] would call the [[Feudal spirit]]. Slovenly, alcoholic butler to Erridge. [[Lady Molly]] borrows him to help out at [[South Kensington]] from time to time. Breaks the [[Dresden coffee pot]] and is suspected of drinking the gin.\n*'''''Chips Lovell'''''. Twenty three or four and filling-in time at the script department of a film company where Nick works. Hopes to land a job on the society pages of a newspaper.

Trying to move up in the social world which is why he regards the people he meets at [[Lady Molly]]'s reception as being great disappointments.\n*'''''Quiggin'''''. Now a well-regarded critic, although his ''Unburnt Boats'' remains a work in progress. He has become a hanger on of Erridge, ''Alf'' Warminster, whom he hopes will finance a new magazine with Quiggin as director. His Left wing bombast and odd regional idioms reach new heights.\n*'''''[[Kenneth Widmerpool|Widmerpool]]'''''. Becomes engaged, contracts [[jaundice]]- again, see [[A Buyer's Market]] -, gets [[cuckold]]ed and then [[wikt:jilt|jilted]]. Has a ''terrible and dramatic''<ref>Pp 187</ref> scene at [[Dogdene]]. Politically he is an [[Appeaser]].\n*'''''Nick Jenkins'''''. His twenty-eight-year-old (or thereabouts) self has become more assertive and outspoken when interacting with his contemporaries (although Widmerpool still renders him speechless).\n\n==Themes==\n\"What, then, is the central theme of the series? Creativity \u2013 the act of production. Of literature, of books, of paintings, of music; that is what most of the central characters are engaged in for the whole of their lives. Moreland composes, Barnby paints, X Trapnel writes, Quiggin, Members and Maclintick criticise and the narrator publishes books and then becomes a writer. What excites the novelist is music and painting, literature and criticism.

Clayton attended [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]], where he met schoolmates with whom he co-founded U2 in 1976. A member of the band since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with U2.\n\nClayton's bass guitar playing style is noted for its \"harmonic [[syncopation]]\", giving the music a driving rhythm. He is well known for his bass playing on songs such as \"[[Gloria (U2 song)|Gloria]]\", \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\", \"[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]\", \"[[With or Without You]]\", \"[[Mysterious Ways (song)|Mysterious Ways]]\", \"[[Vertigo (U2 song)|Vertigo]]\", \"[[Get on Your Boots]]\", and \"[[Magnificent (U2 song)|Magnificent]]\".

His father was a pilot with the [[Royal Air Force]], who moved into civil aviation, and his mother was a former airline [[stewardess]]. When he was 4 years old, Clayton's father worked in [[Kenya]] as a pilot with [[East African Airways]], the family being resident in [[Nairobi]] (Clayton regards this as the happiest period of his childhood). In 1965, the family moved to [[Malahide]], northern [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], where Clayton's brother Sebastian was born. The Clayton family became friends with the Evans family (including their son [[The Edge|David Evans (\"The Edge\")]], who would later co-found the band [[U2]] with Clayton).<ref name=\"mccorm-childhood\">McCormick (2006), pp. 11\u201313, 24</ref>\n\nWhen he was eight years old, Clayton was sent to the private junior boarding Castle Park School in [[Dalkey]], southern County Dublin. Not being sports-oriented, Adam did not enjoy the school or respond well to its ethos; he found it difficult to settle socially there.  He was interested in pop music, which students were not allowed to listen to. He joined the School's \"Gramphone Society\", which met to listen to classical music. He also took piano lessons for a short time. His introduction to the world of popular music was around the age of 10, listening to rock operas such as ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', and other material that was midway between classical and [[popular music]].<ref name=\"mccorm-childhood\"/>\n\n{{Quote box|width=20em|quote=\"Adam was Mrs Burns because he did come over like an old woman sometimes.\"|source=\u2014The Edge, on how [[the Virgin Prunes]] nicknamed Clayton<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 68</ref>}}\nAt age 13, Clayton entered the private [[St Columba's College, Dublin|St Columba's College]] secondary school in [[Rathfarnham]], Dublin. Here he made friends with other pupils who were enthusiastic about the pop/rock music acts of the period, including [[the Who]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Grateful Dead]], and [[Carole King]]. In response he bought a \u00a35 acoustic guitar from a junk-shop near the Dublin quays, and began learning elementary chords and songs.<ref name=\"mccorm-childhood\"/> John Leslie, who shared a bunk bed with Clayton at St. Columba's, persuaded him to join in with a school band where Clayton would play the [[bass guitar]] for the first time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chatterton|first=Mark|title=U2: The Complete Encyclopedia|publisher=Firefly Publishing|location=London|year=2001|isbn=0-946719-41-1|page=29}}</ref> His mother purchased a bass for him when he was 14 years old on the basis of a given promise that he would commit himself to learn to play the instrument.<ref name=father>[http://www.independent.ie/life/family/family=feature/in-the-name-of-the-son-and-the-father-31133943.html In the name of the son and the father]</ref>\n\nClayton later changed school to the non-boarding [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] in Dublin, where he met future U2 bandmates [[Bono|Paul Hewson (\"Bono\")]] and [[Larry Mullen Jr.]], who were also pupils there, and was reunited with his childhood friend David Evans.<ref name=\"mcc40\">McCormick (2006), pp. 40\u201346</ref>\n\n== U2 ==\n{{main|U2}}\n[[File:U2 @ Scott Stadium 2 Adam cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Clayton playing in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] on 1 October 2009]]\nIn September 1976, Mullen put an advert onto the school's bulletin board seeking other musicians to form a band; Clayton showed up for the first meeting and practice, so did the Edge with his older brother [[Dik Evans|Richard Evans (\"Dik\")]], Bono, and Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin who were two of Mullen's friends. McCormick and Martin left the band soon after its inception.<ref name=\"mcc40\"/>\n\nWhile the band was a five-piece (consisting of Bono, the Edge, Mullen, Dik Evans, and Clayton) it was known as \"Feedback\".

Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were questioning the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality.<ref name=\"bio1\" /> However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of an outsider.\n\nIn 1995, after the [[Zoo TV Tour]] and ''[[Zooropa]]'' album, Clayton headed to New York with bandmate Mullen to receive formal training in the bass; until then Clayton had been entirely self-taught.<ref name=\"book2\" /> During that period, he worked on U2's experimental album, released under the [[pseudonym]] \"Passengers\", entitled ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]''. That album features one of the few instances where Clayton has appeared as a vocalist; he spoke the last verse of \"[[Your Blue Room]]\", the album's second single. Prior to this Clayton had only provided live backing vocals to tracks such as \"[[Out of Control (U2 song)|Out of Control]]\", \"[[I Will Follow]]\", \"[[Twilight (U2 song)|Twilight]]\" and \"[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]\". Since the 1997 [[PopMart Tour]], Clayton has not sung live in any capacity for the band.<ref name=\"rs\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/u2/biography |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=U2: Biography |accessdate=1 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Adam Clayton 2005 Wien v1.jpg|thumb|left|Clayton performing at a [[Vertigo Tour]] concert in 2005.]]\nClayton's style of bass guitar playing is noted for what instructor Patrick Pfeiffer called \"harmonic [[syncopation]]\". With this technique, Clayton plays a consistent rhythm that stresses the [[eighth note]] of each [[bar (music)|bar]], but he \"anticipates the [[harmony]] by shifting the [[tonality]]\" before the guitar chords do. This gives the music a feeling of \"forward motion\".<ref>Jobling (2014), p. 243</ref> As a bass player, Clayton's most recognizable basslines include \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\", which evolved out of an attempt to play [[Visage (band)|Visage]]'s song \"[[Fade to Grey (Visage song)|Fade to Grey]]\", and \"[[With or Without You]]\".<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 136</ref><ref name=\"interview1\">{{cite journal|url=http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id94.html |title=Reluctant Rock Star: How U2's Adam Clayton Learned to Play &ndash; and Conquer the World Onstage |journal=Bass Player |date=11 November 2000 |accessdate=8 September 2007 |last=Isola |first=Gregory |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630054707/http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id94.html |archivedate=30 June 2007 }}</ref> His style includes [[Motown]] and [[reggae]] influences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bass-soup.com/articles.asp?id=5&title=U2s-Adam-Clayton-Bass-sound-and-technique. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218190648/http://www.bass-soup.com/articles.asp?id=5&title=U2s-Adam-Clayton-Bass-sound-and-technique. |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 February 2007 |title=Adam Clayton's Bass Sound and Technique |accessdate=8 September 2007 |author=Bass Soup }}</ref> and cites artists such as [[Paul Simonon]] of [[the Clash]] as influences on his musical style.<ref name=\"interview1\" /> He credits [[Jean-Jacques Burnel]] of [[the Stranglers]] for his choice of instrument: \"I remember hearing the bass on ''Hanging Around'' and immediately knowing it was going to be the instrument for me\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grundy |first1=Gareth |title=Adam Clayton: Soundtrack of my life |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/22/adam-clayton-u2-soundtrack-of-my-life |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd |accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen Clayton first joined the fledgling U2, he did not have formal training in the bass.<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 30, 34</ref> In the band's early years, he generally played simple parts in [[4/4 time|{{music|time|4|4}} time]], usually strings of steady 8th notes.<ref name=interview1 /> Bono said of Clayton's early bass playing, \"Adam used to pretend he could play bass.

A member of the band since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with U2.\n\nClayton's bass guitar playing style is noted for its \"harmonic [[syncopation]]\", giving the music a driving rhythm.

His father was a pilot with the [[Royal Air Force]], who moved into civil aviation, and his mother was a former airline [[stewardess]]. When he was 4 years old, Clayton's father worked in [[Kenya]] as a pilot with [[East African Airways]], the family being resident in [[Nairobi]] (Clayton regards this as the happiest period of his childhood). In 1965, the family moved to [[Malahide]], northern [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], where Clayton's brother Sebastian was born. The Clayton family became friends with the Evans family (including their son [[The Edge|David Evans (\"The Edge\")]], who would later co-found the band [[U2]] with Clayton).<ref name=\"mccorm-childhood\">McCormick (2006), pp. 11\u201313, 24</ref>\n\nWhen he was eight years old, Clayton was sent to the private junior boarding Castle Park School in [[Dalkey]], southern County Dublin. Not being sports-oriented, Adam did not enjoy the school or respond well to its ethos; he found it difficult to settle socially there.  He was interested in pop music, which students were not allowed to listen to. He joined the School's \"Gramphone Society\", which met to listen to classical music. He also took piano lessons for a short time. His introduction to the world of popular music was around the age of 10, listening to rock operas such as ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' and ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', and other material that was midway between classical and [[popular music]].<ref name=\"mccorm-childhood\"/>\n\n{{Quote box|width=20em|quote=\"Adam was Mrs Burns because he did come over like an old woman sometimes.\"|source=\u2014The Edge, on how [[the Virgin Prunes]] nicknamed Clayton<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 68</ref>}}\nAt age 13, Clayton entered the private [[St Columba's College, Dublin|St Columba's College]] secondary school in [[Rathfarnham]], Dublin. Here he made friends with other pupils who were enthusiastic about the pop/rock music acts of the period, including [[the Who]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Grateful Dead]], and [[Carole King]]. In response he bought a \u00a35 acoustic guitar from a junk-shop near the Dublin quays, and began learning elementary chords and songs.<ref name=\"mccorm-childhood\"/> John Leslie, who shared a bunk bed with Clayton at St. Columba's, persuaded him to join in with a school band where Clayton would play the [[bass guitar]] for the first time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chatterton|first=Mark|title=U2: The Complete Encyclopedia|publisher=Firefly Publishing|location=London|year=2001|isbn=0-946719-41-1|page=29}}</ref> His mother purchased a bass for him when he was 14 years old on the basis of a given promise that he would commit himself to learn to play the instrument.<ref name=father>[http://www.independent.ie/life/family/family=feature/in-the-name-of-the-son-and-the-father-31133943.html In the name of the son and the father]</ref>\n\nClayton later changed school to the non-boarding [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] in Dublin, where he met future U2 bandmates [[Bono|Paul Hewson (\"Bono\")]] and [[Larry Mullen Jr.]], who were also pupils there, and was reunited with his childhood friend David Evans.<ref name=\"mcc40\">McCormick (2006), pp. 40\u201346</ref>\n\n== U2 ==\n{{main|U2}}\n[[File:U2 @ Scott Stadium 2 Adam cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Clayton playing in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] on 1 October 2009]]\nIn September 1976, Mullen put an advert onto the school's bulletin board seeking other musicians to form a band; Clayton showed up for the first meeting and practice, so did the Edge with his older brother [[Dik Evans|Richard Evans (\"Dik\")]], Bono, and Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin who were two of Mullen's friends.

Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were questioning the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality.<ref name=\"bio1\" /> However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of an outsider.\n\nIn 1995, after the [[Zoo TV Tour]] and ''[[Zooropa]]'' album, Clayton headed to New York with bandmate Mullen to receive formal training in the bass; until then Clayton had been entirely self-taught.<ref name=\"book2\" /> During that period, he worked on U2's experimental album, released under the [[pseudonym]] \"Passengers\", entitled ''[[Original Soundtracks 1]]''. That album features one of the few instances where Clayton has appeared as a vocalist; he spoke the last verse of \"[[Your Blue Room]]\", the album's second single.

Many non-human species also hunt - see [[predation]].\n\nRegulations distinguish lawful hunting from [[poaching]], which involves the illegal killing, trapping or capture of the hunted species. The species that are hunted are referred to as [[Game (food)|game]] or [[prey]] and are usually [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s.

The noun has been dated to the early 12th century, \"act of chasing game,\" from the verb ''hunt''. [[Old English]] had ''huntung'', ''hunto\u00fe''. The meaning of \"a body of persons associated for the purpose of hunting with a pack of hounds\" is first recorded in the 1570s. Meaning \"the act of searching for someone or something\" is from about 1600.\n\nThe verb, Old English ''huntian'' \"to chase game\" ([[Transitive verb|transitive]] and [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]), perhaps developed from ''hunta'' \"hunter,\" is related to ''hentan'' \"to seize,\" from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''huntojan'' (the source also of [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''hin\u00fean'' \"to seize, capture,\" [[Old High German]] ''hunda'' \"booty\"), which is of uncertain origin.

The cultural and [[psychological]] importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as [[Horned God|the horned god]] [[Cernunnos]] and [[Lunar deity|lunar goddesses]] of [[classical antiquity]], the Greek [[Artemis]] or Roman [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. [[Taboo]]s are often related to hunting, and mythological association of prey species with a [[divinity]] could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a [[Nature reserve|reserve]] surrounding a temple. [[Euripides]]' tale of Artemis and [[Actaeon]], for example, may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting.\n\nWith the domestication of the dog, [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]], and the [[ferret]], various forms of animal-aided hunting developed, including [[Medieval hunting|venery]] ([[scent hound]] hunting, such as [[fox hunting]]), [[coursing]] ([[sight hound]] hunting), [[falconry]], and [[ferreting]]. While these are all associated with [[medieval hunting]], over time, various [[dog breed]]s were selected for very precise tasks during the hunt, reflected in such names as [[Pointing breed|pointer]] and [[setter]].\n\n{{See also|Lion hunting}}\n\n===Pastoral and agricultural societies===\n[[File:Nobleman in Hunting Costume preceded by his Servant trying to find the Scent of a Stag.png|thumb|right|[[Nobleman]] in hunting costume with his servant following the scent of a [[stag]], 14th century]]\n\nEven as agriculture and [[animal husbandry]] became more prevalent, hunting often remained as a part of human culture where the environment and social conditions allowed. Hunter-gatherer societies persisted, even when increasingly confined to marginal areas. And within agricultural systems, hunting served to kill animals that prey upon [[List of domesticated animals|domestic and wild animals]] or to attempt to [[Local extinction|extirpate]] animals seen by humans as competition for resources such as water or forage.\n\nWhen hunting moved from a subsistence activity to a social one, two trends emerged:\n\n# the development of the role of the specialist hunter, with special training and equipment\n# the co-option of hunting as a \"sport\" for those of an upper social class\n\nThe meaning of the word ''game'' in [[Middle English]] evolved to include an animal which is hunted. As game became more of a luxury than a necessity, the stylised pursuit of it also became a luxury. Dangerous hunting, such as for lions or [[wild boar]]s, often done on [[horseback]] or from a [[chariot]], had a function similar to [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and manly sports. Hunting ranked as an honourable, somewhat competitive pastime to help the [[aristocracy]] practice skills of war in times of peace.<ref>\nMachiavelli provides a rationale, if not the origin, of noble hunting:\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Machiavelli\n| first1                = Niccol\u00f2\n| author1-link          = Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli\n| year              = 1531\n| chapter               = Discourses on the first decade of Titus Livius, Book 3\n| editor1-last          = Gilbert\n| editor1-first         = Allan\n| title                 = Machiavelli: The Chief Works and Others\n| chapter-url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=r6lROQffJ7cC\n| volume                = 1\n| publisher             = Duke University Press\n| publication-date      = 1989\n| page                  = 516\n| isbn                  = 978-0-8223-8157-0\n| accessdate            = 27 December 2013\n| quote                 = [...] hunting expeditions, as Xenophon makes plain, are images of war; therefore to men of rank such activity is honorable and necessary.\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn most parts of [[medieval]] Europe, the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory. Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs, often provided via professional huntsmen, but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy. The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the [[Robin Hood]] legends, in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they \"hunt the King's deer\". In contrast, settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all.<ref>\n{{cite book |last1       = Dunlap\n |first1      = Thomas R.\n |chapter     = Remaking Worlds: European models in New Lands\n |title       = Nature and the English Diaspora: Environment and History in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\n |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UDaEZnZ093EC\n |series      = Studies in Environment and History\n |issue       = 17\n |publisher   = Cambridge University Press\n |date        = 1999\n |page        = [https://archive.org/details/natureenglishdia0000dunl/page/61 61]\n |isbn        = 978-0-521-65700-6\n |accessdate  = 24 December 2013\n |quote       = The settlers adopted sport hunting, as they did other elements of British culture, but they had to adapt it.

Though dogs can survive independently of humans, and in many cases do, as with feral dogs, where hunger is not a primary factor, the species tends to defer to human control in exchange for habitation, food and support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://huntingguide.info/|title=The Hunting Guide >> Read Before Hunt|website=Hunting Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref>\n\nDogs today are used to find, chase, retrieve, and sometimes to kill the game. [[Hunting dog]]s allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs are used for different types of hunting. Waterfowl are commonly hunted using retrieving dogs such as the [[Labrador Retriever]], the [[Golden Retriever]], the [[Chesapeake Bay Retriever]], the [[Brittany Spaniel]], and other similar breeds. [[Upland game bird|Game birds]] are flushed out using flushing [[spaniel]]s such as the [[English Springer Spaniel]], the various [[Cocker Spaniel]]s and similar breeds.\n\nThe hunting of wild mammals in England and Wales with dogs was banned under the [[Hunting Act 2004]]. The wild mammals include fox, hare, deer and mink.  Hunting with dogs is permissible, however, where it has been carried out in accordance with one of the exceptions in the Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/countryside/hunting/ |title=Hunting with dogs \u00ab Defra |publisher=Defra.gov.uk |date=18 February 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|Deer hunting|Fox hunting|Mink hunting}}\n\n==Religion==\n{{Further|Homo Necans}}\nMany prehistoric deities are depicted as predators or prey of humans, often in a [[zoomorphic]] form, perhaps alluding to the importance of hunting for most Palaeolithic cultures.\n\nIn many pagan religions, specific rituals are conducted before or after a hunt; the rituals done may vary according to the species hunted or the season the hunt is taking place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Often a hunting ground, or the hunt for one or more species, was reserved or prohibited in the context of a temple cult.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n[[File:CheetahHunt.jpg|thumb|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[aristocrat]]s hunting a [[blackbuck]] alongside an [[Asiatic cheetah]], 1812]]\n\n===Indian and Eastern religions===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Sikh Hunting.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Sikh]]s hunting (Unknown [[Pahari painting|Pahari artist]], 18th century)]]\n[[File:A tiger hunt at Jhajjar, Rohtak District, Panjab.jpg|thumb|A tiger hunt at Jhajjar, Rohtak District, Punjab, c. 1820]]\n\n[[Hindu scripture]]s describe hunting as an acceptable occupation, as well as a sport of the kingly. Even figures considered divine are described to have engaged in hunting. One of the names of the god [[Shiva]] is Mrigavyadha, which translates as \"the deer hunter\" (''mriga'' means deer; ''vyadha'' means hunter). The word ''Mriga'', in many Indian languages including Malayalam, not only stands for deer, but for all animals and animal instincts (Mriga Thrishna). Shiva, as Mrigavyadha, is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings. In the epic [[Ramayana]], [[Dasharatha]], the father of [[Rama]], is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark. During one of his hunting expeditions, he accidentally killed [[Shravana]], mistaking him for game. During Rama's exile in the forest, [[Ravana]] kidnapped his wife, [[Sita]], from their hut, while [[Rama]] was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer, and his brother [[Lakshman]] went after him. According to the [[Mahabharat]], [[Pandu]], the father of the [[Pandavas]], accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow, mistaking them for a deer. [[Krishna]] is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter.\n\n[[Jainism]] teaches followers to have tremendous respect for all of life. Prohibitions for hunting and meat eating are the fundamental conditions for being a [[Jain]].\n\n[[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] first [[precept]] is the respect for all sentient life. The general approach by all Buddhists is to avoid killing any living animals. [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] explained the issue by saying \"all fear death; comparing others with oneself, one should neither kill nor cause to kill.\"\n\nIn [[Sikhism]], only meat obtained from hunting, or slaughtered with the [[Jhatka]] is permitted. The [[Sikh gurus]], especially [[Guru Hargobind]] and [[Guru Gobind Singh]] were ardent hunters. Many old Sikh [[Sikh Rehat Maryada|Rehatnamas]] like [[Prem Sumarag]], recommend hunting [[wild boar]] and [[deer]]. However, among modern Sikhs, the practise of hunting has died down; some even saying that all meat is forbidden.\n\n===Christianity, Judaism, and Islam===\n[[File:Ladies Hunting.png|thumb|Ladies hunting in the 15th century]]\n[[File:Flanders Tapestry with the hunting scene.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tapestry]] with a hunting scene, late 16th century]]\n\nFrom early Christian times, hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church [[cleric]]s. Thus the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'' (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, \"We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons.\" The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], held under [[Pope Innocent III]], decreed (canon xv): \"We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics.\" The decree of the [[Council of Trent]] is worded more mildly: \"Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking\" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (''clamorosa'') hunting unlawful, but not quiet (''quieta'') hunting.\n\nFerraris (s.v. \"Clericus\", art. 6) gives it as the general sense of canonists that hunting is allowed to clerics if it be indulged in rarely and for sufficient cause, as necessity, utility or \"honest\" recreation, and with that moderation which is becoming to the [[Ecclesiastical government|ecclesiastical state]]. Ziegler, however (De episc., l. IV, c. xix), thinks that the interpretation of the canonists is not in accordance with the letter or spirit of the laws of the church.\n\nNevertheless, although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible, it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese, as was done by [[synod]]s at [[Milan]], [[Avignon]], [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Cologne]], and elsewhere. [[Benedict XIV]] (De synodo di\u0153ces., l. II, c. x) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe, as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the [[Canon law|ecclesiastical law]]. In practice, therefore, the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether.\n\nIt is important to note that most Christians do not observe [[kosher]] [[dietary laws]] hence most Christians have no religious restrictions on eating the animals hunted. This is in accord with what is found in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 15:28\u201329, and 1 Timothy 4:4.\n\nIn Jewish law hunting is not forbidden although there is an aversion to it. The great 18th-century authority [[Rabbi Yechezkel Landau]] after a study concluded although \"hunting would not be considered cruelty to animals insofar as the animal is generally killed quickly and not tortured... There is an unseemly element in it, namely cruelty.\" The other issue is that hunting can be dangerous and Judaism places an extreme emphasis on the value of human life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/be/The_Jewish_Ethicist_Judaism_and_Hunting.html|title=The Jewish Ethicist: Judaism and Hunting|website=aish.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1589324/jewish/The-Jewish-View-on-Hunting-for-Sport.htm|title=The Jewish View on Hunting for Sport|website=chabad.org}}</ref>\n\nIslamic [[Sharia|Sharia Law]] permits hunting of lawful animals and birds if they cannot be easily caught and slaughtered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmuslimguide.com/en/your-food-and-drink/66|title=Hunting according to Islamic Law|author=  New Muslim Guide|website=newmuslimguide.com}}</ref>\n\n==National traditions==\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|Hunting in New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand has a strong hunting culture.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/46606862|title=Hunting : a New Zealand history|last=Hunter|first=Kathryn M|date=2009|publisher=Auckland : Random House New Zealand|isbn=9781869791544|language=English}}</ref> When humans arrived, the only mammals present on the islands making up New Zealand were bats, although seals and other marine mammals were present along the coasts.

They would be headed by a master of the hunt, who might be styled ''mir-shikar''. Often, they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their [[traditional knowledge]] of the environment and hunting techniques. Big game, such as [[Bengal tigers]], might be hunted from the back of an elephant.\n\nRegional [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] are generally antagonistic to hunting, while a few [[sect]]s, such as the [[Bishnoi]], lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species, such as the [[antelope]]. India's [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]] bans the killing of all wild animals. However, the Chief Wildlife Warden may, if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life, or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery, permit any person to hunt such an animal.

What in other countries is called \"hunting\" is called \"shooting\" (birds) or \"stalking\" (deer) in Britain. Originally a form of [[vermin]] control to protect livestock, fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]] and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with [[hound]]s. Pairs of [[Sight hound]]s (or long-dogs), such as [[greyhounds]], may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with [[scent hound]]s such as [[beagle]]s or harriers. Other sorts of [[foxhound]]s may also be used for hunting [[stag|stags (deer)]] or [[American mink|mink]]. [[Deer stalking]] with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.{{clear left}}\n\nThese forms of hunting have been controversial in the UK. [[Animal welfare]] supporters believe that hunting causes unnecessary suffering to foxes, horses, and hounds. Proponents argue that it is culturally and perhaps economically important. Using dogs to chase wild mammals was [[fox hunting legislation|made illegal]] in February 2005 by the [[Hunting Act 2004]]; there were a number of exemptions (under which the activity may not be illegal) in the act for hunting with hounds, but no exemptions at all for hare-coursing.\n\n====Shooting traditions====\nGame birds, especially [[pheasant]]s, are shot with shotguns for sport in the UK; the [[British Association for Shooting and Conservation]] says that over a million people per year participate in shooting, including game shooting, [[clay pigeon shooting]], and [[Shooting sports|target shooting]].<ref>[http://basc.org.uk/media-centre/basc-appeals/basc-youth-appeal BASC site]</ref>\nShooting as practised in Britain, as opposed to traditional hunting, requires little questing for game\u2014around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year, some having been [[factory farming|factory farmed]]. Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns. When in position, \"beaters\" move through the areas of cover, swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out. Such events are often called \"drives\". The open season for [[grouse]] in the UK begins on 12 August, the so-called [[Glorious Twelfth]]. The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the [[Game Act 1831]].\n\nA similar tradition exists in [[:es:Ojeo|Spain]].\n\n===United States===\n{{ref improve section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:Camp on Schoodic Lake, ME.jpg|thumb|right|Hunting camp with [[Field dressing deer|dressed deer]] at Schoodic Lake, [[Maine]], in 1905]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| footer = \n| width1 = 143\n| image1 =\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = An archer with a compound hunting bow\n| width2 = 170\n| image2 = Bear hunting Kodiak FWS.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Carrying a bear trophy head at the [[Kodiak Archipelago]]\n| width3 = 185\n}}\nNorth American hunting pre-dates the United States by thousands of years and was an important part of many [[pre-Columbian]] Native American cultures. Native Americans retain some hunting rights and are exempt from some laws as part of Indian treaties and otherwise under [[federal law]]\u2014examples include [[eagle feather law]]s and exemptions in the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]]. This is considered particularly important in [[Alaska Native|Alaskan native]] communities.\n\nHunting is primarily regulated by [[State law (United States)|state law]]; additional regulations are imposed through [[United States environmental law]] in the case of [[migratory birds]] and [[endangered species]]. Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas, time periods, techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted. Some states make a distinction between [[protected species]] and unprotected species (often [[vermin]] or [[varmint]]s for which there are no hunting regulations). Hunters of protected species require a [[hunting license]] in all states, for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite.\n\nTypically, game animals are divided into several categories for regulatory purposes. Typical categories, along with example species, are as follows:\n* ''Big game'': [[white-tailed deer]], [[mule deer]], [[moose]], [[elk]], [[caribou]], [[bear]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[pronghorn]], [[boar]], [[javelina]], [[bison]]\n* ''Small game'': [[rabbit]], hare, [[squirrel]], [[opossum]], [[raccoon]], [[porcupine]], [[skunk]], [[ring-tailed cat]], [[armadillo]], [[ruffed grouse]]\n* ''Furbearers'': [[beaver]], [[red fox]], [[mink]], [[pine marten]], [[musk rat]], [[otter]], [[bobcat]], [[coyote]]\n* ''Predators'': [[cougar]] (mountain lion and [[Panthera|panther]]), [[Gray wolf|wolf]], [[coyote]]\n* ''[[Upland game bird]]'': [[grouse]], [[woodcock]], [[Chukar partridge|chukar]], [[pheasant]], [[quail]], [[dove]]\n* ''[[Waterfowl]]'': [[duck]], [[common teal|teal]], [[merganser]], [[Goose|geese]], [[swan]]\n\nHunting big game typically requires a \"tag\" for each animal harvested. Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license, and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited. In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species, tags are usually assigned by lottery. Tags may be further restricted to a specific area, or wildlife management unit. [[Waterfowl hunting|Hunting migratory waterfowl]] requires a duck stamp from the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] in addition to the appropriate state hunting license.\n\nHarvest of animals other than big game is typically restricted by a bag limit and a possession limit. A bag limit is the maximum number of a specific animal species that an individual can harvest in a single day. A possession limit is the maximum number of a specific animal species that can be in an individual's possession at any time.\n\n====Shooting====\n[[File:Hectors photos 109.JPG|thumb|A man target practicing for the hunting seasons]]\n\nGun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category, area within the state, and time period. Regulations for [[big-game hunting]] often specify a minimum [[caliber]] or [[muzzle energy]] for [[firearm]]s. The use of [[rifle]]s is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high [[population density|population densities]] or limited [[Terrain|topographic relief]]. Regulations may also limit or ban the use of [[lead]] in [[ammunition]] because of environmental concerns. Specific seasons for [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] hunting or [[Muzzle-loader|muzzle-loading]] [[Black powder|black-powder]] guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective [[weapons]].\n\nHunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting,<ref>[http://www.responsivemanagement.com/download/news/newsrls_09_06.pdf Results] from a 2006 poll (813 people were polled) done by Responsive Management</ref> although relatively few Americans actually hunt. At the beginning of the 21st century, just six percent of Americans hunted. [[Southern United States|Southerners]] in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent, slightly below the national average, and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent, these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states, where twelve percent of [[Midwesterners]] hunted. Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average.<ref>National statistics from [[United States Department of the Interior|US Department of the Interior]], Fish and Wildlife Service and [[United States Department of Commerce|US Department of Commerce]], [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], 2001 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife Associated Recreation, 27.</ref> Overall, in the 1996\u20132006 period, the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent, a drop attributable to a number of factors including [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]] and changes in recreation habits.<ref>Jackson, Patrick. [http://www.trailcamerareviews.net/number-hunters-dwindling/ ''Number of hunters is dwindling\u2014Urbanization and cultural changes discourage newcomers to the sport''].</ref>\n\n====Regulation====\nRegulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century. Some modern hunters see themselves as [[Conservation movement|conservationists]] and sportsmen in the mode of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and the [[Boone and Crockett Club]]. Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use. Some groups represent a specific hunting interest, such as [[Ducks Unlimited]], [[Pheasants Forever]], or the [[Delta Waterfowl Foundation]]. Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government.\n\nEach year, nearly $200&nbsp;million in hunters' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs, the purchase of lands open to hunters, and hunter education and safety classes. Since 1934, the sale of [[Federal Duck Stamp]]s, a required purchase for migratory [[waterfowl]] hunters over sixteen years old, has raised over $700&nbsp;million to help purchase more than {{convert|5200000|acres|sqmi km2}} of habitat for the [[National Wildlife Refuge System]] lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting. States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals, as designated by law. A key task of federal and state [[park ranger]]s and [[game warden]]s is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting, including species protection, [[hunting season]]s, and hunting bans.\n\n====Varmint hunting====\n{{Main |Varmint hunting}}\n[[File:Nutria (Myocastor coypus).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[coypu]] is hunted as a pest in Louisiana.]]\n\nVarmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests. While not always an efficient form of [[pest control]], varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated. Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops, livestock, [[landscaping]], [[infrastructure]], and pets. Some animals, such as wild rabbits or squirrels, may be utilised for fur or meat, but often no use is made of the carcass. Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area. Common varmints may include various [[rodent]]s, [[coyotes]], [[Corvus (genus)|crows]], [[fox]]es, [[feral cats]], and feral [[pig|hogs]]. Some animals once considered varmints are now protected, such as wolves. In the US state of [[Louisiana]], a non-native rodent, the [[coypu]], has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] program to help control the population.\n\n====Fair chase====\n{{Main|Fair chase}}\n\nThe principles of the [[fair chase]]<ref>Interpretations of the Fair Chase can be found on the web sites of various hunter's organizations, such as the [http://www.boone-crockett.org/huntingEthics/ethics_fairchase.asp?area=huntingEthics Boone and Crockett Club] and [http://www.huntfairchase.com/ Hunt Fair Chase].</ref> have been a part of the American hunting tradition for over one hundred years. The role of the hunter-conservationist, popularised by Theodore Roosevelt, and perpetuated by Roosevelt's formation of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], has been central to the development of the modern fair chase tradition. ''Beyond Fair Chase: The Ethic and Tradition of Hunting'', a book by Jim Posewitz, describes fair chase:\n<blockquote>\n\"Fundamental to ethical hunting is the idea of fair chase. This concept addresses the balance between the hunter and the hunted. It is a balance that allows hunters to occasionally succeed while animals generally avoid being taken.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Posewitz |first= Jim |title= Beyond Fair Chase: The Ethic and Tradition of Hunting |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dkkmL8TuiMkC&pg=PA57|date= 1 August 1994 |publisher= [[Globe Pequot Press]] |isbn= 978-1-56044-283-7 |page= 57 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen [[Internet hunting]] was introduced in 2005, allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns, the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase. As a representative of the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) explained, \"The NRA has always maintained that fair chase, being in the field with your firearm or bow, is an important element of hunting tradition. Sitting at your desk in front of your computer, clicking at a mouse, has nothing to do with hunting.\"<ref name=HSUS-FactSheet>Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, [http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/internet_hunting/facts/internet_hunting_fact_sheet.html#.UzjiW61dW9Y Fact Sheet on Internet Hunting]</ref>\n\n[[File:Bear-hunters-kephart-nc1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Hunters with an [[American black bear]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]]]]\n\nOne hunting club declares that a fair chase shall not involve the taking of animals under the following conditions:\n* Helpless in a trap, deep snow or water, or on ice.\n* From any power vehicle or power boat.\n* By \"[[spotlighting|jacklighting]]\" or shining at night.\n* By the use of any tranquilizers or poisons.\n* While inside escape-proof fenced enclosures.\n* By the use of any power vehicle or power boat for herding or driving animals, including use of aircraft to land alongside or to communicate with or direct a hunter on the ground.\n* By the use of electronic devices for attracting, locating or pursuing game or guiding the hunter to such game, or by the use of a bow or arrow to which any electronic device is attached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pope-young.org/bowhunting_fairchase.asp |title=The Rules of Fair Chase |publisher=[[Pope and Young Club]] |location=[[Chatfield, Minnesota]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315072242/http://www.pope-young.org/bowhunting_fairchase.asp |archivedate=15 March 2012 |url-status=live |accessdate=24 May 2012 |quote=While inside escape-proof fenced enclosures}}</ref>\n\n===Ranches===\nIndian [[blackbuck]], [[nilgai]], [[axis deer]], [[fallow deer]], [[Zebra|zebras]], [[barasingha]] and many other exotics can now be found on hunting [[ranches]] in Texas, where they were introduced for sport hunting. These hunters can be found paying in excess of $10,000 dollars to take trophy animals on these controlled ranches. \n\n===Russia===\n{{Main|Hunting in Russia}}\nThe [[Russia]]n imperial hunts evolved from hunting traditions of early Russian rulers\u2014[[Grand Prince]]s and [[Russian Czar|Tsars]]\u2014under the influence of hunting customs of European royal courts. The imperial hunts were organised mainly in [[Petergof|Peterhof]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]], and [[Gatchina]].\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 140043 Riders gather for a dingo drive at Durella Station in Morven, ca. 1936.jpg|thumb|Riders gather for a [[dingo]] drive in [[Morven, Queensland]], 1936]]\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main |Hunting in Australia}}\nHunting in [[Australia]] has evolved around the hunting and eradication of various animals considered to be pests. All native animals are protected by law, and can only be killed under a special permit.  Hunted introduced species include deer, pigs, goats, foxes, and rabbits.\n\n=== Japan ===\nThe numbers of licensed hunters in Japan, including those using [[Snare trap|snares]] and guns, is generally decreasing, while their average age is increasing. {{as of|2010}}, there were approximately 190,000 registered hunters, approximately 65% of whom were sixty years old or older.<ref>http://www.env.go.jp/nature/choju/docs/docs4/menkyo.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Trinidad and Tobago ===\nThere is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting permits in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months \u2013 October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species ([[red-rumped agouti]], [[lowland paca]], [[nine-banded armadillo]], [[collared peccary]], and [[red brocket deer]]) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted {{as of|2013|lc=y}}). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the [[green iguana]], the [[gold tegu]], the [[spectacled caiman]] and the [[common opossum]] are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including [[Guyanan red howler|red howler]] monkeys and [[capuchin monkey]]s, [[southern tamandua]]s, [[Brazilian porcupine]]s, [[yellow-footed tortoise]]s, [[Trinidad piping guan]]s and even one of the national birds, the [[scarlet ibis]]. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management.\n\n==Wildlife management==\n[[File:Weisergatter.png|thumb|Control fence to assess the impact of [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]] by [[ungulate]]s \u2013 note the lack of natural forest regeneration outside the fencing]]\nHunting is claimed to give [[Wildlife management|resource managers]] an important tool<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chardonnet |first1=P |last2=Clers |first2=B |last3=Fischer |first3=J |last4=Gerhold |first4=R |last5=Jori |first5=F |last6=Lamarque |first6=F |year=2002 |title=The Value of Wildlife |url=http://www.uga.edu/scwds/documents/chardonnet2002.pdf |journal=Rev.

These hunts may sometimes be carried out by professional shooters, although others may include amateur hunters. Many US city and local governments hire professional and amateur hunters each year to reduce populations of animals such as deer that are becoming hazardous in a restricted area, such as neighbourhood parks and [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] open spaces.\n\nA large part of managing populations involves managing the number and, sometimes, the size or age of animals harvested so as to ensure the sustainability of the population. Tools that are frequently used to control harvest are bag limits and season closures, although gear restrictions such as archery-only seasons are becoming increasingly popular in an effort to reduce hunter success rates in countries that rely on bag limits per hunter instead of per area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n==Laws==\n{{main|Hunting legislation|Poaching}}\nIllegal hunting and harvesting of wild species contrary to local and international [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and wildlife management laws is called poaching.

There are also [[jurisdiction]]s where bag limits are not applied at all or are not applied under certain circumstances. The phrase ''bag limits'' comes from the custom among hunters of small game to carry successful kills in a small basket, similar to a [[fishing creel]].\n\nWhere bag limits are used, there can be daily or seasonal bag limits; for example, ducks can often be harvested at a rate of six per hunter per day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Debbie Young|url=http://www.fws.gov/southeast/news/2003/n03-015.html |title=US Fish and Wildlife Service 2003 proposed bag limits for waterfowl |publisher=Fws.gov |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> Big game, like [[moose]], most often have a seasonal bag limit of one animal per hunter.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Bag limits may also regulate the size, sex, or age of animal that a hunter can kill.

Techniques may vary depending on government regulations, a hunter's personal ethics, local custom, hunting equipment, and the animal being hunted.

Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies, although it is now undertaken mainly for sport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The [[Hunting#Safari|safari]] method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa, India and other places in pursuit of trophies.

In [[Tanzania]], it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average [[ecotourist]]. While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation, the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps. Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas, uninviting to the typical ecotourist. Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the game hunting of birds as an industry is said to be extremely important to the rural economy.

This self-imposed tax now generates over $700&nbsp;million each year and is used exclusively to establish, restore and protect wildlife habitats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bootsgeek.com/the-pittman-robertson-federal-aid-in-wildlife/|title=The Pittman\u2013Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act|publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]}}</ref> The act is named for Nevada Senator [[Key Pittman]] and Virginia Congressman [[Absalom Willis Robertson]].\n\n====Federal Duck Stamp program====\nOn 16 March 1934, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act, which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen. The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the [[US Postal Service]] and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest. They play an important role in [[habitat conservation]] because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of [[wetland]] habitat for protection in the [[National Wildlife Refuge|National Wildlife Refuge System]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/birds/policies-and-regulations/laws-legislations/migratory-bird-hunting-and-conservation-stamp-act.php|title=Migratory Bird Hunting & Conservation Stamp Act|website=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=15 August 2019}}</ref> In addition to waterfowl, it is estimated that one third of the nation's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nSince 1934, the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $670&nbsp;million, and helped to purchase or lease {{convert|5200000|acres|sqmi km2}} of habitat. The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds, an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas, and are also considered collectors items often purchased for [[aesthetic]] reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities. Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps, eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters, which is logical, as hunters are required to purchase them. Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission (MBCC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/realty/mbcc.html|title=Migratory Bird Conservation Commission|publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=31 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Species===\n====Arabian oryx====\nThe [[Arabian oryx]], a species of large [[antelope]], once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East.<ref name=\"Talbot, Lee Merriam 1960 pp. 84\"/> However, the species' striking appearance made it (along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax) a popular quarry for sport hunters, especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage: speed, and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972. The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit, while the addax became critically endangered.<ref>The Fundamentals of Conservation Biology, Malcolm L Hunter, Jr., James P. Gibbs</ref> However, the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from \"extinct in the wild\" to \"vulnerable\" due to conservation efforts like captive breeding<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/2011/06/17/arabian-oryx-makes-history-as-first-species-to-be-upgraded-from-extinct-in-the-wild-to-vulnerable/|title=Arabian Oryx Makes History as First Species to Be Upgraded from \"Extinct in the Wild\" to \"Vulnerable\"|first=John|last=Platt|website=scientificamerican.com}}</ref>\n\n====Markhor====\nThe [[markhor]] is an endangered species of wild goat which inhabits the mountains of [[Central Asia]] and [[Pakistan]]. The [[colonization]] of these regions by [[British Empire|Britain]] gave British sport hunters access to the species, and they were hunted heavily, almost to the point of extinction. Only their willingness to breed in captivity and the inhospitability of their mountainous habitat prevented this. Despite these factors, the markhor is still endangered.<ref>Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World, 2001</ref>\n\n====American bison====\nThe [[American bison]] is a large [[bovid]] which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s, living on the prairies in large herds. However, the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters, who killed dozens of bison for their hides only, leaving the rest to rot. Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds, bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s. Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase, but the bison remains near-threatened due to lack of habitat.<ref>American Bison: A Natural History, By Dale F. Lott, Harry W.

As a result, the country saw an increase in white rhinos from fewer than one hundred individuals to more than 11,000, even while a limited number were killed as trophies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conservationmagazine.org/2014/01/can-trophy-hunting-reconciled-conservation/|title=Can trophy hunting actually help conservation?|publisher=Conservation|date=15 January 2014|website=conservationmagazine.org}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the illegal hunting of rhinoceros for their horns is highly damaging to the population and is currently growing globally,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8388606.stm 'Global surge' in rhino poaching ] [[BBC]]. 1 December 2009</ref> with 1004 being killed in South Africa alone according to the most recent estimate.<ref>{{cite news| title=946 rhino killed in 2013 |url=http://ewn.co.za/2013/12/19/946-Rhino-poached-in-2013| accessdate=25 December 2013| newspaper=Eyewitness News|date=19 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Other species====\nAccording to [[Richard Conniff]], Namibia is home to 1,750 of the roughly 5,000 black rhinos surviving in the wild because it allows trophy hunting of various species. Namibia's mountain zebra population has increased to 27,000 from 1,000 in 1982. Elephants, which \"are gunned down elsewhere for their ivory\", have gone to 20,000 from 15,000 in 1995.

The noun has been dated to the early 12th century, \"act of chasing game,\" from the verb ''hunt''. [[Old English]] had ''huntung'', ''hunto\u00fe''. The meaning of \"a body of persons associated for the purpose of hunting with a pack of hounds\" is first recorded in the 1570s. Meaning \"the act of searching for someone or something\" is from about 1600.\n\nThe verb, Old English ''huntian'' \"to chase game\" ([[Transitive verb|transitive]] and [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]), perhaps developed from ''hunta'' \"hunter,\" is related to ''hentan'' \"to seize,\" from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''huntojan'' (the source also of [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''hin\u00fean'' \"to seize, capture,\" [[Old High German]] ''hunda'' \"booty\"), which is of uncertain origin.

While these are all associated with [[medieval hunting]], over time, various [[dog breed]]s were selected for very precise tasks during the hunt, reflected in such names as [[Pointing breed|pointer]] and [[setter]].\n\n{{See also|Lion hunting}}\n\n===Pastoral and agricultural societies===\n[[File:Nobleman in Hunting Costume preceded by his Servant trying to find the Scent of a Stag.png|thumb|right|[[Nobleman]] in hunting costume with his servant following the scent of a [[stag]], 14th century]]\n\nEven as agriculture and [[animal husbandry]] became more prevalent, hunting often remained as a part of human culture where the environment and social conditions allowed. Hunter-gatherer societies persisted, even when increasingly confined to marginal areas. And within agricultural systems, hunting served to kill animals that prey upon [[List of domesticated animals|domestic and wild animals]] or to attempt to [[Local extinction|extirpate]] animals seen by humans as competition for resources such as water or forage.\n\nWhen hunting moved from a subsistence activity to a social one, two trends emerged:\n\n# the development of the role of the specialist hunter, with special training and equipment\n# the co-option of hunting as a \"sport\" for those of an upper social class\n\nThe meaning of the word ''game'' in [[Middle English]] evolved to include an animal which is hunted. As game became more of a luxury than a necessity, the stylised pursuit of it also became a luxury. Dangerous hunting, such as for lions or [[wild boar]]s, often done on [[horseback]] or from a [[chariot]], had a function similar to [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and manly sports. Hunting ranked as an honourable, somewhat competitive pastime to help the [[aristocracy]] practice skills of war in times of peace.<ref>\nMachiavelli provides a rationale, if not the origin, of noble hunting:\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Machiavelli\n| first1                = Niccol\u00f2\n| author1-link          = Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli\n| year              = 1531\n| chapter               = Discourses on the first decade of Titus Livius, Book 3\n| editor1-last          = Gilbert\n| editor1-first         = Allan\n| title                 = Machiavelli: The Chief Works and Others\n| chapter-url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=r6lROQffJ7cC\n| volume                = 1\n| publisher             = Duke University Press\n| publication-date      = 1989\n| page                  = 516\n| isbn                  = 978-0-8223-8157-0\n| accessdate            = 27 December 2013\n| quote                 = [...] hunting expeditions, as Xenophon makes plain, are images of war; therefore to men of rank such activity is honorable and necessary.\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn most parts of [[medieval]] Europe, the upper class obtained the sole rights to hunt in certain areas of a feudal territory. Game in these areas was used as a source of food and furs, often provided via professional huntsmen, but it was also expected to provide a form of recreation for the aristocracy. The importance of this proprietary view of game can be seen in the [[Robin Hood]] legends, in which one of the primary charges against the outlaws is that they \"hunt the King's deer\". In contrast, settlers in Anglophone colonies gloried democratically in hunting for all.<ref>\n{{cite book |last1       = Dunlap\n |first1      = Thomas R.\n |chapter     = Remaking Worlds: European models in New Lands\n |title       = Nature and the English Diaspora: Environment and History in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\n |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UDaEZnZ093EC\n |series      = Studies in Environment and History\n |issue       = 17\n |publisher   = Cambridge University Press\n |date        = 1999\n |page        = [https://archive.org/details/natureenglishdia0000dunl/page/61 61]\n |isbn        = 978-0-521-65700-6\n |accessdate  = 24 December 2013\n |quote       = The settlers adopted sport hunting, as they did other elements of British culture, but they had to adapt it.

Though dogs can survive independently of humans, and in many cases do, as with feral dogs, where hunger is not a primary factor, the species tends to defer to human control in exchange for habitation, food and support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://huntingguide.info/|title=The Hunting Guide >> Read Before Hunt|website=Hunting Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-15}}</ref>\n\nDogs today are used to find, chase, retrieve, and sometimes to kill the game. [[Hunting dog]]s allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs are used for different types of hunting. Waterfowl are commonly hunted using retrieving dogs such as the [[Labrador Retriever]], the [[Golden Retriever]], the [[Chesapeake Bay Retriever]], the [[Brittany Spaniel]], and other similar breeds. [[Upland game bird|Game birds]] are flushed out using flushing [[spaniel]]s such as the [[English Springer Spaniel]], the various [[Cocker Spaniel]]s and similar breeds.\n\nThe hunting of wild mammals in England and Wales with dogs was banned under the [[Hunting Act 2004]]. The wild mammals include fox, hare, deer and mink.  Hunting with dogs is permissible, however, where it has been carried out in accordance with one of the exceptions in the Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/countryside/hunting/ |title=Hunting with dogs \u00ab Defra |publisher=Defra.gov.uk |date=18 February 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|Deer hunting|Fox hunting|Mink hunting}}\n\n==Religion==\n{{Further|Homo Necans}}\nMany prehistoric deities are depicted as predators or prey of humans, often in a [[zoomorphic]] form, perhaps alluding to the importance of hunting for most Palaeolithic cultures.\n\nIn many pagan religions, specific rituals are conducted before or after a hunt; the rituals done may vary according to the species hunted or the season the hunt is taking place.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Often a hunting ground, or the hunt for one or more species, was reserved or prohibited in the context of a temple cult.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n[[File:CheetahHunt.jpg|thumb|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[aristocrat]]s hunting a [[blackbuck]] alongside an [[Asiatic cheetah]], 1812]]\n\n===Indian and Eastern religions===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Sikh Hunting.jpg|thumb|A group of [[Sikh]]s hunting (Unknown [[Pahari painting|Pahari artist]], 18th century)]]\n[[File:A tiger hunt at Jhajjar, Rohtak District, Panjab.jpg|thumb|A tiger hunt at Jhajjar, Rohtak District, Punjab, c. 1820]]\n\n[[Hindu scripture]]s describe hunting as an acceptable occupation, as well as a sport of the kingly. Even figures considered divine are described to have engaged in hunting. One of the names of the god [[Shiva]] is Mrigavyadha, which translates as \"the deer hunter\" (''mriga'' means deer; ''vyadha'' means hunter). The word ''Mriga'', in many Indian languages including Malayalam, not only stands for deer, but for all animals and animal instincts (Mriga Thrishna). Shiva, as Mrigavyadha, is the one who destroys the animal instincts in human beings. In the epic [[Ramayana]], [[Dasharatha]], the father of [[Rama]], is said to have the ability to hunt in the dark. During one of his hunting expeditions, he accidentally killed [[Shravana]], mistaking him for game. During Rama's exile in the forest, [[Ravana]] kidnapped his wife, [[Sita]], from their hut, while [[Rama]] was asked by Sita to capture a golden deer, and his brother [[Lakshman]] went after him. According to the [[Mahabharat]], [[Pandu]], the father of the [[Pandavas]], accidentally killed the sage Kindama and his wife with an arrow, mistaking them for a deer. [[Krishna]] is said to have died after being accidentally wounded by an arrow of a hunter.\n\n[[Jainism]] teaches followers to have tremendous respect for all of life. Prohibitions for hunting and meat eating are the fundamental conditions for being a [[Jain]].\n\n[[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] first [[precept]] is the respect for all sentient life. The general approach by all Buddhists is to avoid killing any living animals. [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] explained the issue by saying \"all fear death; comparing others with oneself, one should neither kill nor cause to kill.\"\n\nIn [[Sikhism]], only meat obtained from hunting, or slaughtered with the [[Jhatka]] is permitted. The [[Sikh gurus]], especially [[Guru Hargobind]] and [[Guru Gobind Singh]] were ardent hunters. Many old Sikh [[Sikh Rehat Maryada|Rehatnamas]] like [[Prem Sumarag]], recommend hunting [[wild boar]] and [[deer]]. However, among modern Sikhs, the practise of hunting has died down; some even saying that all meat is forbidden.\n\n===Christianity, Judaism, and Islam===\n[[File:Ladies Hunting.png|thumb|Ladies hunting in the 15th century]]\n[[File:Flanders Tapestry with the hunting scene.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tapestry]] with a hunting scene, late 16th century]]\n\nFrom early Christian times, hunting has been forbidden to Roman Catholic Church [[cleric]]s. Thus the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'' (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, \"We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons.\" The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], held under [[Pope Innocent III]], decreed (canon xv): \"We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics.\" The decree of the [[Council of Trent]] is worded more mildly: \"Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking\" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (''clamorosa'') hunting unlawful, but not quiet (''quieta'') hunting.\n\nFerraris (s.v. \"Clericus\", art. 6) gives it as the general sense of canonists that hunting is allowed to clerics if it be indulged in rarely and for sufficient cause, as necessity, utility or \"honest\" recreation, and with that moderation which is becoming to the [[Ecclesiastical government|ecclesiastical state]]. Ziegler, however (De episc., l. IV, c. xix), thinks that the interpretation of the canonists is not in accordance with the letter or spirit of the laws of the church.\n\nNevertheless, although a distinction between lawful and unlawful hunting is undoubtedly permissible, it is certain that a bishop can absolutely prohibit all hunting to the clerics of his diocese, as was done by [[synod]]s at [[Milan]], [[Avignon]], [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Cologne]], and elsewhere. [[Benedict XIV]] (De synodo di\u0153ces., l. II, c. x) declared that such synodal decrees are not too severe, as an absolute prohibition of hunting is more conformable to the [[Canon law|ecclesiastical law]]. In practice, therefore, the synodal statutes of various localities must be consulted to discover whether they allow quiet hunting or prohibit it altogether.\n\nIt is important to note that most Christians, do not observe [[kosher]] [[dietary laws]] hence most Christ\n\nians have no religious restrictions on eating the animals hunted. This is in accord with what is found in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] 15:28\u201329, and 1 Timothy 4:4.\n\nIn Jewish law hunting is not forbidden although there is an aversion to it. The great 18th-century authority [[Rabbi Yechezkel Landau]] after a study concluded although \"hunting would not be considered cruelty to animals insofar as the animal is generally killed quickly and not tortured... There is an unseemly element in it, namely cruelty.\" The other issue is that hunting can be dangerous and Judaism places an extreme emphasis on the value of human life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/be/The_Jewish_Ethicist_Judaism_and_Hunting.html|title=The Jewish Ethicist: Judaism and Hunting|website=aish.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1589324/jewish/The-Jewish-View-on-Hunting-for-Sport.htm|title=The Jewish View on Hunting for Sport|website=chabad.org}}</ref>\n\nIslamic [[Sharia|Sharia Law]] permits hunting of lawful animals and birds if they cannot be easily caught and slaughtered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmuslimguide.com/en/your-food-and-drink/66|title=Hunting according to Islamic Law|author=  New Muslim Guide|website=newmuslimguide.com}}</ref>\n\n==National traditions==\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|Hunting in New Zealand}}\nNew Zealand has a strong hunting culture.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/46606862|title=Hunting : a New Zealand history|last=Hunter|first=Kathryn M|date=2009|publisher=Auckland : Random House New Zealand|isbn=9781869791544|language=English}}</ref> When humans arrived, the only mammals present on the islands making up New Zealand were bats, although seals and other marine mammals were present along the coasts.

They would be headed by a master of the hunt, who might be styled ''mir-shikar''. Often, they recruited the normally low-ranking local tribes because of their [[traditional knowledge]] of the environment and hunting techniques. Big game, such as [[Bengal tigers]], might be hunted from the back of an elephant.\n\nRegional [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]] are generally antagonistic to hunting, while a few [[sect]]s, such as the [[Bishnoi]], lay special emphasis on the conservation of particular species, such as the [[antelope]]. India's [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]] bans the killing of all wild animals. However, the Chief Wildlife Warden may, if satisfied that any wild animal from a specified list has become dangerous to human life, or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery, permit any person to hunt such an animal.

What in other countries is called \"hunting\" is called \"shooting\" (birds) or \"stalking\" (deer) in Britain. Originally a form of [[vermin]] control to protect livestock, fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]] and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike. Similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with [[hound]]s. Pairs of [[Sight hound]]s (or long-dogs), such as [[greyhounds]], may be used to pursue a hare in coursing, where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare (but are not intended to actually catch it), or the hare may be pursued with [[scent hound]]s such as [[beagle]]s or harriers. Other sorts of [[foxhound]]s may also be used for hunting [[stag|stags (deer)]] or [[American mink|mink]]. [[Deer stalking]] with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds, using stealth.{{clear left}}\n\nThese forms of hunting have been controversial in the UK. [[Animal welfare]] supporters believe that hunting causes unnecessary suffering to foxes, horses, and hounds. Proponents argue that it is culturally and perhaps economically important. Using dogs to chase wild mammals was [[fox hunting legislation|made illegal]] in February 2005 by the [[Hunting Act 2004]]; there were a number of exemptions (under which the activity may not be illegal) in the act for hunting with hounds, but no exemptions at all for hare-coursing.\n\n====Shooting traditions====\nGame birds, especially [[pheasant]]s, are shot with shotguns for sport in the UK; the [[British Association for Shooting and Conservation]] says that over a million people per year participate in shooting, including game shooting, [[clay pigeon shooting]], and [[Shooting sports|target shooting]].<ref>[http://basc.org.uk/media-centre/basc-appeals/basc-youth-appeal BASC site]</ref>\nShooting as practised in Britain, as opposed to traditional hunting, requires little questing for game\u2014around thirty-five million birds are released onto shooting estates every year, some having been [[factory farming|factory farmed]]. Shoots can be elaborate affairs with guns placed in assigned positions and assistants to help load shotguns. When in position, \"beaters\" move through the areas of cover, swinging sticks or flags to drive the game out. Such events are often called \"drives\". The open season for [[grouse]] in the UK begins on 12 August, the so-called [[Glorious Twelfth]]. The definition of game in the United Kingdom is governed by the [[Game Act 1831]].\n\nA similar tradition exists in [[:es:Ojeo|Spain]].\n\n===United States===\n{{ref improve section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:Camp on Schoodic Lake, ME.jpg|thumb|right|Hunting camp with [[Field dressing deer|dressed deer]] at Schoodic Lake, [[Maine]], in 1905]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = \n| footer = \n| width1 = 143\n| image1 =\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = An archer with a compound hunting bow\n| width2 = 170\n| image2 = Bear hunting Kodiak FWS.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Carrying a bear trophy head at the [[Kodiak Archipelago]]\n| width3 = 185\n}}\nNorth American hunting pre-dates the United States by thousands of years and was an important part of many [[pre-Columbian]] Native American cultures. Native Americans retain some hunting rights and are exempt from some laws as part of Indian treaties and otherwise under [[federal law]]\u2014examples include [[eagle feather law]]s and exemptions in the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]]. This is considered particularly important in [[Alaska Native|Alaskan native]] communities.\n\nHunting is primarily regulated by [[State law (United States)|state law]]; additional regulations are imposed through [[United States environmental law]] in the case of [[migratory birds]] and [[endangered species]]. Regulations vary widely from state to state and govern the areas, time periods, techniques and methods by which specific game animals may be hunted. Some states make a distinction between [[protected species]] and unprotected species (often [[vermin]] or [[varmint]]s for which there are no hunting regulations). Hunters of protected species require a [[hunting license]] in all states, for which completion of a hunting safety course is sometimes a prerequisite.\n\nTypically, game animals are divided into several categories for regulatory purposes. Typical categories, along with example species, are as follows:\n* ''Big game'': [[white-tailed deer]], [[mule deer]], [[moose]], [[elk]], [[caribou]], [[bear]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[pronghorn]], [[boar]], [[javelina]], [[bison]]\n* ''Small game'': [[rabbit]], hare, [[squirrel]], [[opossum]], [[raccoon]], [[porcupine]], [[skunk]], [[ring-tailed cat]], [[armadillo]], [[ruffed grouse]]\n* ''Furbearers'': [[beaver]], [[red fox]], [[mink]], [[pine marten]], [[musk rat]], [[otter]], [[bobcat]], [[coyote]]\n* ''Predators'': [[cougar]] (mountain lion and [[Panthera|panther]]), [[Gray wolf|wolf]], [[coyote]]\n* ''[[Upland game bird]]'': [[grouse]], [[woodcock]], [[Chukar partridge|chukar]], [[pheasant]], [[quail]], [[dove]]\n* ''[[Waterfowl]]'': [[duck]], [[common teal|teal]], [[merganser]], [[Goose|geese]], [[swan]]\n\nHunting big game typically requires a \"tag\" for each animal harvested. Tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license, and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited. In cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species, tags are usually assigned by lottery. Tags may be further restricted to a specific area, or wildlife management unit. [[Waterfowl hunting|Hunting migratory waterfowl]] requires a duck stamp from the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] in addition to the appropriate state hunting license.\n\nHarvest of animals other than big game is typically restricted by a bag limit and a possession limit. A bag limit is the maximum number of a specific animal species that an individual can harvest in a single day. A possession limit is the maximum number of a specific animal species that can be in an individual's possession at any time.\n\n====Shooting====\n[[File:Hectors photos 109.JPG|thumb|A man target practicing for the hunting seasons]]\n\nGun usage in hunting is typically regulated by game category, area within the state, and time period. Regulations for [[big-game hunting]] often specify a minimum [[caliber]] or [[muzzle energy]] for [[firearm]]s. The use of [[rifle]]s is often banned for safety reasons in areas with high [[population density|population densities]] or limited [[Terrain|topographic relief]]. Regulations may also limit or ban the use of [[lead]] in [[ammunition]] because of environmental concerns. Specific seasons for [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] hunting or [[Muzzle-loader|muzzle-loading]] [[Black powder|black-powder]] guns are often established to limit competition with hunters using more effective [[weapons]].\n\nHunting in the United States is not associated with any particular class or culture; a 2006 poll showed seventy-eight percent of Americans supported legal hunting,<ref>[http://www.responsivemanagement.com/download/news/newsrls_09_06.pdf Results] from a 2006 poll (813 people were polled) done by Responsive Management</ref> although relatively few Americans actually hunt. At the beginning of the 21st century, just six percent of Americans hunted. [[Southern United States|Southerners]] in states along the eastern seaboard hunted at a rate of five percent, slightly below the national average, and while hunting was more common in other parts of the South at nine percent, these rates did not surpass those of the Plains states, where twelve percent of [[Midwesterners]] hunted. Hunting in other areas of the country fell below the national average.<ref>National statistics from [[United States Department of the Interior|US Department of the Interior]], Fish and Wildlife Service and [[United States Department of Commerce|US Department of Commerce]], [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], 2001 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife Associated Recreation, 27.</ref> Overall, in the 1996\u20132006 period, the number of hunters over the age of sixteen declined by ten percent, a drop attributable to a number of factors including [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]] and changes in recreation habits.<ref>Jackson, Patrick. [http://www.trailcamerareviews.net/number-hunters-dwindling/ ''Number of hunters is dwindling\u2014Urbanization and cultural changes discourage newcomers to the sport''].</ref>\n\n====Regulation====\nRegulation of hunting within the United States dates from the 19th century. Some modern hunters see themselves as [[Conservation movement|conservationists]] and sportsmen in the mode of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and the [[Boone and Crockett Club]]. Local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use. Some groups represent a specific hunting interest, such as [[Ducks Unlimited]], [[Pheasants Forever]], or the [[Delta Waterfowl Foundation]]. Many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government.\n\nEach year, nearly $200&nbsp;million in hunters' federal excise taxes are distributed to state agencies to support wildlife management programs, the purchase of lands open to hunters, and hunter education and safety classes. Since 1934, the sale of [[Federal Duck Stamp]]s, a required purchase for migratory [[waterfowl]] hunters over sixteen years old, has raised over $700&nbsp;million to help purchase more than {{convert|5200000|acres|sqmi km2}} of habitat for the [[National Wildlife Refuge System]] lands that support waterfowl and many other wildlife species and are often open to hunting. States also collect money from hunting licenses to assist with management of game animals, as designated by law. A key task of federal and state [[park ranger]]s and [[game warden]]s is to enforce laws and regulations related to hunting, including species protection, [[hunting season]]s, and hunting bans.\n\n====Varmint hunting====\n{{Main |Varmint hunting}}\n[[File:Nutria (Myocastor coypus).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[coypu]] is hunted as a pest in Louisiana.]]\n\nVarmint hunting is an American phrase for the selective killing of non-game animals seen as pests. While not always an efficient form of [[pest control]], varmint hunting achieves selective control of pests while providing recreation and is much less regulated. Varmint species are often responsible for detrimental effects on crops, livestock, [[landscaping]], [[infrastructure]], and pets. Some animals, such as wild rabbits or squirrels, may be utilised for fur or meat, but often no use is made of the carcass. Which species are varmints depends on the circumstance and area. Common varmints may include various [[rodent]]s, [[coyotes]], [[Corvus (genus)|crows]], [[fox]]es, [[feral cats]], and feral [[pig|hogs]]. Some animals once considered varmints are now protected, such as wolves. In the US state of [[Louisiana]], a non-native rodent, the [[coypu]], has become so destructive to the local ecosystem that the state has initiated a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] program to help control the population.\n\n====Fair chase====\n{{Main|Fair chase}}\n\nThe principles of the [[fair chase]]<ref>Interpretations of the Fair Chase can be found on the web sites of various hunter's organizations, such as the [http://www.boone-crockett.org/huntingEthics/ethics_fairchase.asp?area=huntingEthics Boone and Crockett Club] and [http://www.huntfairchase.com/ Hunt Fair Chase].</ref> have been a part of the American hunting tradition for over one hundred years. The role of the hunter-conservationist, popularised by Theodore Roosevelt, and perpetuated by Roosevelt's formation of the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], has been central to the development of the modern fair chase tradition. ''Beyond Fair Chase: The Ethic and Tradition of Hunting'', a book by Jim Posewitz, describes fair chase:\n<blockquote>\n\"Fundamental to ethical hunting is the idea of fair chase. This concept addresses the balance between the hunter and the hunted. It is a balance that allows hunters to occasionally succeed while animals generally avoid being taken.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Posewitz |first= Jim |title= Beyond Fair Chase: The Ethic and Tradition of Hunting |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dkkmL8TuiMkC&pg=PA57|date= 1 August 1994 |publisher= [[Globe Pequot Press]] |isbn= 978-1-56044-283-7 |page= 57 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhen [[Internet hunting]] was introduced in 2005, allowing people to hunt over the Internet using remotely controlled guns, the practice was widely criticised by hunters as violating the principles of fair chase. As a representative of the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) explained, \"The NRA has always maintained that fair chase, being in the field with your firearm or bow, is an important element of hunting tradition. Sitting at your desk in front of your computer, clicking at a mouse, has nothing to do with hunting.\"<ref name=HSUS-FactSheet>Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, [http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/internet_hunting/facts/internet_hunting_fact_sheet.html#.UzjiW61dW9Y Fact Sheet on Internet Hunting]</ref>\n\n[[File:Bear-hunters-kephart-nc1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Hunters with an [[American black bear]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]]]]\n\nOne hunting club declares that a fair chase shall not involve the taking of animals under the following conditions:\n* Helpless in a trap, deep snow or water, or on ice.\n* From any power vehicle or power boat.\n* By \"[[spotlighting|jacklighting]]\" or shining at night.\n* By the use of any tranquilizers or poisons.\n* While inside escape-proof fenced enclosures.\n* By the use of any power vehicle or power boat for herding or driving animals, including use of aircraft to land alongside or to communicate with or direct a hunter on the ground.\n* By the use of electronic devices for attracting, locating or pursuing game or guiding the hunter to such game, or by the use of a bow or arrow to which any electronic device is attached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pope-young.org/bowhunting_fairchase.asp |title=The Rules of Fair Chase |publisher=[[Pope and Young Club]] |location=[[Chatfield, Minnesota]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315072242/http://www.pope-young.org/bowhunting_fairchase.asp |archivedate=15 March 2012 |url-status=live |accessdate=24 May 2012 |quote=While inside escape-proof fenced enclosures}}</ref>\n\n===Ranches===\nIndian [[blackbuck]], [[nilgai]], [[axis deer]], [[fallow deer]], [[Zebra|zebras]], [[barasingha]] and many other exotics can now be found on hunting [[ranches]] in Texas, where they were introduced for sport hunting. These hunters can be found paying in excess of $10,000 dollars to take trophy animals on these controlled ranches. \n\n===Russia===\n{{Main|Hunting in Russia}}\nThe [[Russia]]n imperial hunts evolved from hunting traditions of early Russian rulers\u2014[[Grand Prince]]s and [[Russian Czar|Tsars]]\u2014under the influence of hunting customs of European royal courts. The imperial hunts were organised mainly in [[Petergof|Peterhof]], [[Tsarskoye Selo]], and [[Gatchina]].\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 140043 Riders gather for a dingo drive at Durella Station in Morven, ca. 1936.jpg|thumb|Riders gather for a [[dingo]] drive in [[Morven, Queensland]], 1936]]\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main |Hunting in Australia}}\nHunting in [[Australia]] has evolved around the hunting and eradication of various animals considered to be pests. All native animals are protected by law, and can only be killed under a special permit.  Hunted introduced species include deer, pigs, goats, foxes, and rabbits.\n\n=== Japan ===\nThe numbers of licensed hunters in Japan, including those using [[Snare trap|snares]] and guns, is generally decreasing, while their average age is increasing. {{as of|2010}}, there were approximately 190,000 registered hunters, approximately 65% of whom were sixty years old or older.<ref>http://www.env.go.jp/nature/choju/docs/docs4/menkyo.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Trinidad and Tobago ===\nThere is a very active tradition of hunting of small to medium-sized wild game in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Hunting is carried out with firearms, and aided by the use of hounds, with the illegal use of trap guns and snare nets. With approximately 12,000 sport hunters applying for hunting permits in recent years (in a very small country of about the size of the state of Delaware at about 5128 square kilometers and 1.3 million inhabitants), there is some concern that the practice might not be sustainable. In addition there are at present no bag limits and the open season is comparatively very long (5 months \u2013 October to February inclusive). As such hunting pressure from legal hunters is very high. Added to that, there is a thriving and very lucrative black market for poached wild game (sold and enthusiastically purchased as expensive luxury delicacies) and the numbers of commercial poachers in operation is unknown but presumed to be fairly high. As a result, the populations of the five major mammalian game species ([[red-rumped agouti]], [[lowland paca]], [[nine-banded armadillo]], [[collared peccary]], and [[red brocket deer]]) are thought to be quite low (although scientifically conducted population studies are only just recently being conducted {{as of|2013|lc=y}}). It appears that the red brocket deer population has been extirpated on Tobago as a result of over-hunting. Various herons, ducks, doves, the [[green iguana]], the [[gold tegu]], the [[spectacled caiman]] and the [[common opossum]] are also commonly hunted and poached. There is also some poaching of 'fully protected species', including [[Guyanan red howler|red howler]] monkeys and [[capuchin monkey]]s, [[southern tamandua]]s, [[Brazilian porcupine]]s, [[yellow-footed tortoise]]s, [[Trinidad piping guan]]s and even one of the national birds, the [[scarlet ibis]]. Legal hunters pay very small fees to obtain hunting licences and undergo no official basic conservation biology or hunting-ethics training. There is presumed to be relatively very little subsistence hunting in the country (with most hunting for either sport or commercial profit). The local wildlife management authority is under-staffed and under-funded, and as such very little in the way of enforcement is done to uphold existing wildlife management laws, with hunting occurring both in and out of season, and even in wildlife sanctuaries. There is some indication that the government is beginning to take the issue of wildlife management more seriously, with well drafted legislation being brought before Parliament in 2015. It remains to be seen if the drafted legislation will be fully adopted and financially supported by the current and future governments, and if the general populace will move towards a greater awareness of the importance of wildlife conservation and change the culture of wanton consumption to one of sustainable management.\n\n==Wildlife management==\n[[File:Weisergatter.png|thumb|Control fence to assess the impact of [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]] by [[ungulate]]s \u2013 note the lack of natural forest regeneration outside the fencing]]\nHunting is claimed to give [[Wildlife management|resource managers]] an important tool<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chardonnet |first1=P |last2=Clers |first2=B |last3=Fischer |first3=J |last4=Gerhold |first4=R |last5=Jori |first5=F |last6=Lamarque |first6=F |year=2002 |title=The Value of Wildlife |url=http://www.uga.edu/scwds/documents/chardonnet2002.pdf |journal=Rev.

These hunts may sometimes be carried out by professional shooters, although others may include amateur hunters. Many US city and local governments hire professional and amateur hunters each year to reduce populations of animals such as deer that are becoming hazardous in a restricted area, such as neighbourhood parks and [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] open spaces.\n\nA large part of managing populations involves managing the number and, sometimes, the size or age of animals harvested so as to ensure the sustainability of the population. Tools that are frequently used to control harvest are bag limits and season closures, although gear restrictions such as archery-only seasons are becoming increasingly popular in an effort to reduce hunter success rates in countries that rely on bag limits per hunter instead of per area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n==Laws==\n{{main|Hunting legislation|Poaching}}\nIllegal hunting and harvesting of wild species contrary to local and international [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and wildlife management laws is called poaching.

There are also [[jurisdiction]]s where bag limits are not applied at all or are not applied under certain circumstances. The phrase ''bag limits'' comes from the custom among hunters of small game to carry successful kills in a small basket, similar to a [[fishing creel]].\n\nWhere bag limits are used, there can be daily or seasonal bag limits; for example, ducks can often be harvested at a rate of six per hunter per day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Debbie Young|url=http://www.fws.gov/southeast/news/2003/n03-015.html |title=US Fish and Wildlife Service 2003 proposed bag limits for waterfowl |publisher=Fws.gov |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> Big game, like [[moose]], most often have a seasonal bag limit of one animal per hunter.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Bag limits may also regulate the size, sex, or age of animal that a hunter can kill.

Techniques may vary depending on government regulations, a hunter's personal ethics, local custom, hunting equipment, and the animal being hunted.

Hunting in North America in the 19th century was done primarily as a way to supplement food supplies, although it is now undertaken mainly for sport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The [[Hunting#Safari|safari]] method of hunting was a development of sport hunting that saw elaborate travel in Africa, India and other places in pursuit of trophies.

In [[Tanzania]], it is estimated that a safari hunter spends fifty to one hundred times that of the average [[ecotourist]]. While the average photo tourist may seek luxury accommodation, the average safari hunter generally stays in tented camps. Safari hunters are also more likely to use remote areas, uninviting to the typical ecotourist. Advocates argue that these hunters allow for anti-poaching activities and revenue for local communities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the game hunting of birds as an industry is said to be extremely important to the rural economy.

This self-imposed tax now generates over $700&nbsp;million each year and is used exclusively to establish, restore and protect wildlife habitats.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bootsgeek.com/the-pittman-robertson-federal-aid-in-wildlife/|title=The Pittman\u2013Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act|publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]}}</ref> The act is named for Nevada Senator [[Key Pittman]] and Virginia Congressman [[Absalom Willis Robertson]].\n\n====Federal Duck Stamp program====\nOn 16 March 1934, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act, which requires an annual stamp purchase by all hunters over the age of sixteen. The stamps are created on behalf of the program by the [[US Postal Service]] and depict wildlife artwork chosen through an annual contest. They play an important role in [[habitat conservation]] because ninety-eight percent of all funds generated by their sale go directly toward the purchase or lease of [[wetland]] habitat for protection in the [[National Wildlife Refuge|National Wildlife Refuge System]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/birds/policies-and-regulations/laws-legislations/migratory-bird-hunting-and-conservation-stamp-act.php|title=Migratory Bird Hunting & Conservation Stamp Act|website=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=15 August 2019}}</ref> In addition to waterfowl, it is estimated that one third of the nation's endangered species seek food and shelter in areas protected using Duck Stamp funds.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nSince 1934, the sale of Federal Duck Stamps has generated $670&nbsp;million, and helped to purchase or lease {{convert|5200000|acres|sqmi km2}} of habitat. The stamps serve as a license to hunt migratory birds, an entrance pass for all National Wildlife Refuge areas, and are also considered collectors items often purchased for [[aesthetic]] reasons outside of the hunting and birding communities. Although non-hunters buy a significant number of Duck Stamps, eighty-seven percent of their sales are contributed by hunters, which is logical, as hunters are required to purchase them. Distribution of funds is managed by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission (MBCC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/realty/mbcc.html|title=Migratory Bird Conservation Commission|publisher=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=31 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Species===\n====Arabian oryx====\nThe [[Arabian oryx]], a species of large [[antelope]], once inhabited much of the desert areas of the Middle East.<ref name=\"Talbot, Lee Merriam 1960 pp. 84\"/> However, the species' striking appearance made it (along with the closely related scimitar-horned oryx and addax) a popular quarry for sport hunters, especially foreign executives of oil companies working in the region.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The use of automobiles and high-powered rifles destroyed their only advantage: speed, and they became extinct in the wild exclusively due to sport hunting in 1972. The scimitar-horned oryx followed suit, while the addax became critically endangered.<ref>The Fundamentals of Conservation Biology, Malcolm L Hunter, Jr., James P. Gibbs</ref> However, the Arabian oryx has now made a comeback and been upgraded from \"extinct in the wild\" to \"vulnerable\" due to conservation efforts like captive breeding<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/2011/06/17/arabian-oryx-makes-history-as-first-species-to-be-upgraded-from-extinct-in-the-wild-to-vulnerable/|title=Arabian Oryx Makes History as First Species to Be Upgraded from \"Extinct in the Wild\" to \"Vulnerable\"|first=John|last=Platt|website=scientificamerican.com}}</ref>\n\n====Markhor====\nThe [[markhor]] is an endangered species of wild goat which inhabits the mountains of [[Central Asia]] and [[Pakistan]]. The [[colonization]] of these regions by [[British Empire|Britain]] gave British sport hunters access to the species, and they were hunted heavily, almost to the point of extinction. Only their willingness to breed in captivity and the inhospitability of their mountainous habitat prevented this. Despite these factors, the markhor is still endangered.<ref>Endangered Wildlife and Plants of the World, 2001</ref>\n\n====American bison====\nThe [[American bison]] is a large [[bovid]] which inhabited much of western North America prior to the 1800s, living on the prairies in large herds. However, the vast herds of bison attracted market hunters, who killed dozens of bison for their hides only, leaving the rest to rot. Thousands of these hunters quickly eliminated the bison herds, bringing the population from several million in the early 1800s to a few hundred by the 1880s. Conservation efforts have allowed the population to increase, but the bison remains near-threatened due to lack of habitat.<ref>American Bison: A Natural History, By Dale F. Lott, Harry W.

As a result, the country saw an increase in white rhinos from fewer than one hundred individuals to more than 11,000, even while a limited number were killed as trophies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://conservationmagazine.org/2014/01/can-trophy-hunting-reconciled-conservation/|title=Can trophy hunting actually help conservation?|publisher=Conservation|date=15 January 2014|website=conservationmagazine.org}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the illegal hunting of rhinoceros for their horns is highly damaging to the population and is currently growing globally,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8388606.stm 'Global surge' in rhino poaching ] [[BBC]]. 1 December 2009</ref> with 1004 being killed in South Africa alone according to the most recent estimate.<ref>{{cite news| title=946 rhino killed in 2013 |url=http://ewn.co.za/2013/12/19/946-Rhino-poached-in-2013| accessdate=25 December 2013| newspaper=Eyewitness News|date=19 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Other species====\nAccording to [[Richard Conniff]], Namibia is home to 1,750 of the roughly 5,000 black rhinos surviving in the wild because it allows trophy hunting of various species. Namibia's mountain zebra population has increased to 27,000 from 1,000 in 1982. Elephants, which \"are gunned down elsewhere for their ivory\", have gone to 20,000 from 15,000 in 1995.

Hughes cites Lyons-Ruth & Jacobvitz (1999) in support of this theory. Caregivers are seen as a source of fear with the result that children endeavour to control their caregivers through manipulation, overcompliance, intimidation or role reversal in order to keep themselves safe. Such children may also suffer intrusive memories secondary to trauma and as a result may be reluctant or unwilling to participate in treatment. It is anticipated that such children will try to actively avoid the exposure involved in developing a therapeutic relationship and will resist being directed into areas of shame and trauma. Hughes proposes that an attachment based treatment may be more effective for such foster and adoptive children than traditional treatment and parenting interventions.<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/>\n\nIt is stated that once an infant's safety needs are met (by attachment) they become more able to focus on learning and responding to the social and emotional needs of caregivers. (Schore, 2003ab). Hughes posits that this 'affective attunement', described by Stern (1985) is crucial in the development of both a secure attachment as well as a positive, integrated sense of self. Attunement is a primarily a non-verbal mode of communication between infant and carer, and synchrony in the degree of arousal being expressed, as well as empathy for the child's internal experience. Hughes states \"Whether it is a motivational system separate from attachment as is suggested by Stern (2004), or a central aspect of a secure attachment dyad, it remains vital in the child's overall development.\"<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/>\n\nThe therapy attempts to replicate this or fill in the gaps in a maltreated child's experience.\n\n==Methods==\n\nFirstly the therapist becomes 'non-verbally attuned' with the child's affective state. The therapist then attempts to explore 'themes' with the child whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, the therapist then 'co-regulates' (helps the child to manage) the child's emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with the child for purposes of integration (the therapist tries to help the child gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and an awareness of the positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes \"The therapist allows the subjective experience of the child to impact the therapist. The therapist can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience.  As the therapist holds both subjective experiences, the child experiences both.  As the child senses both, the child begins to integrate them and re-experience the event in a way that will facilitate its integration and resolution.\"<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/> In the anticipated frequent disruptions, due to the child's traumatic and shaming experiences, the therapist accepts and works with these and then 'repairs' the relationship.\n\nThe aim is for the child to be able to construct a new and coherent autobiography that enables the child to be in touch with their inner feelings. \"As the therapist gives expression to the child's subjective narrative, s/he is continuously integrating the child's nonverbal responsiveness to the dialogue, modifying it spontaneously in a manner congruent with the child's expressions. The dialogue is likely to have more emotional meaning for the child if the therapist, periodically, speaks for the child in the first person with the child's own words.\" (Hughes 2004 p18)<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/> The active presence of one of the child's primary caregivers is considered to greatly enhance psychological treatment. However Hughes considers that attachment based treatment can be undertaken with just the therapist.(Hughes 2004 p25)<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\nDDP has been criticised for the lack of a comprehensive manual or full case studies to provide details of the process. Its theoretical basis has also been questioned.<ref name=\"mercer2014\" /> Although non-verbal communication, communicative mismatch and repair, playful interactions and the relationship between the parents' attachment status and that of a toddler are all well documented and important for early healthy emotional development, Hughes and Becker-Weidman are described as making \"a real logical jump\" in assuming that the same events can be deliberately recapitulated in order to correct the emotional condition of an older child.<ref name=\"Pignotti & Mercer\">{{cite journal | author = Pignotti M., Mercer J. | year = 2007 | title = Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions: A systematic research synthesis revisited | url = | journal = Research on Social Work Practice | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 513\u2013519 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarities to certain [[attachment therapy]] practices have also provoked controversy.<ref name=\"mercer2014\" /> It has been suggested that the therapy appears to use age regression and holding techniques\u2014features of attachment therapy not congruent with [[attachment theory]].<ref name=\"Pignotti & Mercer\"/> Becker-Weidman cites Daniel Hughes's 1997 book \"Facilitating Developmental Attachment\", which contains sections on the use of age regression and holding therapy, as a source document for dyadic developmental psychotherapy.<ref name=\"bw1\"/> The advocacy group [[Advocates for Children in Therapy]] include dyadic developmental psychotherapy in their list of \"attachment therapies by another name\", and continue to list Hughes as a proponent of attachment therapy, citing statements of his that appear to endorse [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]].<ref>[http://www.childrenintherapy.org/proponents/hughes.html Advocates for Children in Therapy - Daniel Hughes].</ref> In particular, they cite material from Hughes's website about the use of physical contact in therapy as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"To be effective, the child must be engaged by the therapist at the level of preverbal attunement rather than in a setting of rational discussions.  The therapy must also involve a great deal of physical contact between the child and the therapist and parent.  During much of the most intense therapeutic work, the child is being touched or held by the therapist or parent.  His intense emotions are received, accepted, and integrated into the self.\"<ref name=\"Hughes 1997\">Daniel A. Hughes (1997).

Along with this, he offered some discussion of how he came to reconsider some of his own past attachment therapy practices.\"</ref>\n\nThe Kansas University/SRS ''Best Practices Report'' (2004) considered that dyadic developmental psychotherapy as described by Becker-Weidman, appeared to be somewhat different from that as described by Hughes. They state that in 2004 Becker-Weidman's claim that dyadic developmental psychotherapy was \"evidence based\" cited studies on [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]] by Myeroff, Randolph and Levy from the Attachment Center at Evergreen.<ref name=\"Becker-Weidman/Kansas\">Becker-Weidmann, A.

Trowell emphasized the value of many of Hughes's ideas for clinical work, but she concluded that \"There is a need for caution. Experienced, well-trained clinicians can, with supervision, take these ideas forward into their clinical practice. But the ideas in [Hughes's 2004 paper] do not provide a sufficient basis for a treatment manual, and are not to be followed uncritically.\"\n\n==Evidence==\nTwo research reports by Becker-Weidman, the second being a four-year follow-up of the first, are the only empirical examination of dyadic developmental psychotherapy.<ref name=\"mercer2014\" /> They reported DDP to be an effective treatment for children with [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] who met the [[DSM IV]] criteria for [[reactive attachment disorder]].<ref name=\"bw1\"/><ref name=\"bw3\"/> The first report concluded that children who received dyadic developmental psychotherapy had clinically and statistically significant improvements in their functioning as measured by the [[Child Behavior Checklist]], while the children in the control group showed no change one year after treatment ended.

This was compared to a \"usual care group\" of thirty subjects, who were treated elsewhere. The published reports on this work do not specify the nature of \"usual care\" or clarify why the \"usual care\" group, who were assessed at Becker-Weidman's clinic, did not have treatment there. Treatment consisted of an average of 23 sessions over eleven months.  The findings continued for an average of 1.1 years after treatment ended for children between the ages of six and fifteen years.  There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 1.3 years after the evaluation was completed.\n\nIn the follow-up study the results from the original study were maintained an average of 3.9 years after treatment ended. There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 3.3 years after the evaluation was completed.\n\nBecker-Weidman's first study was considered by the APSAC Taskforce in their November 2006 Reply to Letters following their main report on attachment therapy.<ref name=\"Chaffin Reply2\"/> The Taskforce had in their original report criticised Becker-Weidman for claiming an evidence base to his therapy, and indeed for claiming to be the only evidence based therapy, where the Taskforce considered no evidence base existed.<ref name=\"Chaffin et al.\"/> Becker-Weidman responded to this with an open letter citing his study.<ref name=\"Letter to the Editor\">Arthur Becker-Weidman | Letter to the Editor | Child Maltreat 2006 No 11 | p379 | \n</ref> The Taskforce examined the (2006) study, criticized the methodology and stated that although the study was an important first step towards learning the facts about DDP outcomes, it fell far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based.<ref name=\"Reply p3\">\"In our estimation, DDP still does not meet criteria as an evidence-based treatment, although the published findings do raise hopes that DDP may be promising. Examining the study, it shares many of the same limitations noted in the Task Force's evaluation of the Myeroff study (p. 85). For example, the study used a small convenience sample, participants were self-selected into treatment versus comparison conditions, the age range of participants was very broad (5-16), there was no direct statistical analysis of differential group change over time, outcome data were not collected by blind or impartial reporters, and the study utilized completer only rather than intent-to-treat methods. Of course, no study is without limitations; however, the fact remains that a single study with these sorts of major limitations, although a first step, is far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based. In general, we believe that designating a treatment as evidence based is a job for an independent treatment review panel (e.g., American Psychological Association, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], Office for Victims of Crime Task Force, Cochrane Collaborative, etc.) applying accepted and established scientific review criteria. None has listed DDP as meeting accepted criteria. Thus, it is our opinion that practitioners should not characterize or advertise DDP as an evidence-based practice at this time.\" Reply to Letters p3.</ref>\n\nBetween the Taskforce report and Reply to Letters, Craven & Lee (2006) undertook a literature review of 18 studies of interventions used for foster children and classified them under the controversial Saunders, Berliner, & Hanson (2004) system.<ref name= \"Craven\"/><ref name=\"Saunders 2004\">Saunders, B.E., Berliner, L., & Hanson, R.F.

Hughes cites Lyons-Ruth & Jacobvitz (1999) in support of this theory. Caregivers are seen as a source of fear with the result that children endeavour to control their caregivers through manipulation, overcompliance, intimidation or role reversal in order to keep themselves safe. Such children may also suffer intrusive memories secondary to trauma and as a result may be reluctant or unwilling to participate in treatment. It is anticipated that such children will try to actively avoid the exposure involved in developing a therapeutic relationship and will resist being directed into areas of shame and trauma. Hughes proposes that an attachment based treatment may be more effective for such foster and adoptive children than traditional treatment and parenting interventions.<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/>\n\nIt is stated that once an infant's safety needs are met (by attachment) they become more able to focus on learning and responding to the social and emotional needs of caregivers. (Schore, 2003ab). Hughes posits that this 'affective attunement', described by Stern (1985) is crucial in the development of both a secure attachment as well as a positive, integrated sense of self. Attunement is a primarily a non-verbal mode of communication between infant and carer, and synchrony in the degree of arousal being expressed, as well as empathy for the child's internal experience. Hughes states \"Whether it is a motivational system separate from attachment as is suggested by Stern (2004), or a central aspect of a secure attachment dyad, it remains vital in the child's overall development.\"<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/>\n\nThe therapy attempts to replicate this or fill in the gaps in a maltreated child's experience.\n\n==Methods==\n\nFirstly the therapist becomes 'non-verbally attuned' with the child's affective state. The therapist then attempts to explore 'themes' with the child whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, the therapist then 'co-regulates' (helps the child to manage) the child's emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with the child for purposes of integration (the therapist tries to help the child gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and an awareness of the positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes \"The therapist allows the subjective experience of the child to impact the therapist. The therapist can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience.  As the therapist holds both subjective experiences, the child experiences both.  As the child senses both, the child begins to integrate them and re-experience the event in a way that will facilitate its integration and resolution.\"<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/> In the anticipated frequent disruptions, due to the child's traumatic and shaming experiences, the therapist accepts and works with these and then 'repairs' the relationship.\n\nThe aim is for the child to be able to construct a new and coherent autobiography that enables the child to be in touch with their inner feelings. \"As the therapist gives expression to the child's subjective narrative, s/he is continuously integrating the child's nonverbal responsiveness to the dialogue, modifying it spontaneously in a manner congruent with the child's expressions. The dialogue is likely to have more emotional meaning for the child if the therapist, periodically, speaks for the child in the first person with the child's own words.\" (Hughes 2004 p18)<ref name=\"hughes2004\"/> The active presence of one of the child's primary caregivers is considered to greatly enhance psychological treatment.

Its theoretical basis has also been questioned.<ref name=\"mercer2014\" /> Although non-verbal communication, communicative mismatch and repair, playful interactions and the relationship between the parents' attachment status and that of a toddler are all well documented and important for early healthy emotional development, Hughes and Becker-Weidman are described as making \"a real logical jump\" in assuming that the same events can be deliberately recapitulated in order to correct the emotional condition of an older child.<ref name=\"Pignotti & Mercer\">{{cite journal | author = Pignotti M., Mercer J. | year = 2007 | title = Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions: A systematic research synthesis revisited | url = | journal = Research on Social Work Practice | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 513\u2013519 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarities to certain [[attachment therapy]] practices have also provoked controversy.<ref name=\"mercer2014\" /> It has been suggested that the therapy appears to use age regression and holding techniques\u2014features of attachment therapy not congruent with [[attachment theory]].<ref name=\"Pignotti & Mercer\"/> Becker-Weidman cites Daniel Hughes's 1997 book \"Facilitating Developmental Attachment\", which contains sections on the use of age regression and holding therapy, as a source document for dyadic developmental psychotherapy.<ref name=\"bw1\"/> The advocacy group [[Advocates for Children in Therapy]] include dyadic developmental psychotherapy in their list of \"attachment therapies by another name\", and continue to list Hughes as a proponent of attachment therapy, citing statements of his that appear to endorse [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]].<ref>[http://www.childrenintherapy.org/proponents/hughes.html Advocates for Children in Therapy - Daniel Hughes].</ref> In particular, they cite material from Hughes's website about the use of physical contact in therapy as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"To be effective, the child must be engaged by the therapist at the level of preverbal attunement rather than in a setting of rational discussions.  The therapy must also involve a great deal of physical contact between the child and the therapist and parent.  During much of the most intense therapeutic work, the child is being touched or held by the therapist or parent.  His intense emotions are received, accepted, and integrated into the self.\"<ref name=\"Hughes 1997\">Daniel A. Hughes (1997).

Trowell emphasized the value of many of Hughes's ideas for clinical work, but she concluded that \"There is a need for caution. Experienced, well-trained clinicians can, with supervision, take these ideas forward into their clinical practice.

This was compared to a \"usual care group\" of thirty subjects, who were treated elsewhere. The published reports on this work do not specify the nature of \"usual care\" or clarify why the \"usual care\" group, who were assessed at Becker-Weidman's clinic, did not have treatment there. Treatment consisted of an average of 23 sessions over eleven months.  The findings continued for an average of 1.1 years after treatment ended for children between the ages of six and fifteen years.  There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 1.3 years after the evaluation was completed.\n\nIn the follow-up study the results from the original study were maintained an average of 3.9 years after treatment ended. There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 3.3 years after the evaluation was completed.\n\nBecker-Weidman's first study was considered by the APSAC Taskforce in their November 2006 Reply to Letters following their main report on attachment therapy.<ref name=\"Chaffin Reply2\"/> The Taskforce had in their original report criticised Becker-Weidman for claiming an evidence base to his therapy, and indeed for claiming to be the only evidence based therapy, where the Taskforce considered no evidence base existed.<ref name=\"Chaffin et al.\"/> Becker-Weidman responded to this with an open letter citing his study.<ref name=\"Letter to the Editor\">Arthur Becker-Weidman | Letter to the Editor | Child Maltreat 2006 No 11 | p379 | \n</ref> The Taskforce examined the (2006) study, criticized the methodology and stated that although the study was an important first step towards learning the facts about DDP outcomes, it fell far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based.<ref name=\"Reply p3\">\"In our estimation, DDP still does not meet criteria as an evidence-based treatment, although the published findings do raise hopes that DDP may be promising. Examining the study, it shares many of the same limitations noted in the Task Force's evaluation of the Myeroff study (p. 85). For example, the study used a small convenience sample, participants were self-selected into treatment versus comparison conditions, the age range of participants was very broad (5-16), there was no direct statistical analysis of differential group change over time, outcome data were not collected by blind or impartial reporters, and the study utilized completer only rather than intent-to-treat methods. Of course, no study is without limitations; however, the fact remains that a single study with these sorts of major limitations, although a first step, is far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based. In general, we believe that designating a treatment as evidence based is a job for an independent treatment review panel (e.g., American Psychological Association, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], Office for Victims of Crime Task Force, Cochrane Collaborative, etc.) applying accepted and established scientific review criteria. None has listed DDP as meeting accepted criteria. Thus, it is our opinion that practitioners should not characterize or advertise DDP as an evidence-based practice at this time.\" Reply to Letters p3.</ref>\n\nBetween the Taskforce report and Reply to Letters, Craven & Lee (2006) undertook a literature review of 18 studies of interventions used for foster children and classified them under the controversial Saunders, Berliner, & Hanson (2004) system.<ref name= \"Craven\"/><ref name=\"Saunders 2004\">Saunders, B.E., Berliner, L., & Hanson, R.F.
