The update include improvements to the Grid Engine scheduler for larger clusters and Qmaster stability improvements for spooling and qalter commands.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.2.0 was released on Sept 02, 2014. The new Univa Grid Engine version 8.2 includes native Windows support .\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.3.0 was released on June 22, 2015. The new Preemption feature in Univa Grid Engine 8.3.0 allows users to set priorities on different work so that, if a higher priority application must use resources currently allocated to a lower priority application, the lower priority application will effectively be \u201cpaused\u201d\u2014not lost\u2014and work will automatically resume once the higher priority application is completed. Among a handful of other new features added to Grid Engine 8.3.0 to improve the overall reliability and efficiency of the cluster, is the new Run Time Modification of Resources feature. The Run Time Modification of Resources feature means much more efficient use of cluster resources.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.3.1 was released on August 28, 2015. This release contained all of the new features in Univa Grid Engine 8.3.0 and additional fixes and enhancements identified since the release of 8.3.0.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.4.0 was released on May 31, 2016. This release supports [[Docker (software)|Docker]] containers and will automatically dispatch and run jobs with a user specified Docker Image.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.univa.com/about/news/press_2016/05312016.php|title=New Version of Univa Grid Engine|last=univa|website=www.univa.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref>\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.5.0 was released on March 7, 2017. This release of Univa Grid Engine is 2x faster than open source Grid Engine 6.2u5. Grid Engine 8.5.0 also includes significant improvement to Docker support including mobility of GPU apps within the cluster.\n\n8.6.0 was released on July 17, 2018. Univa Grid Engine now supports NVIDIA Docker 2.0. The new Univa Grid Engine Docker integration allows for more flexibility when running Docker containers in a Univa Grid Engine environment.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.1 was released on August 8, 2018, providing improved control over GPU devices, and new affinity features, allowing jobs to gravitate towards, or away from, certain compute nodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.univa.com/2018/08/introducing-univa-grid-engine-8-6-1-next-level-enterprise-grade-workload-management/|title=Introducing Univa Grid Engine 8.6.1: Next-Level Enterprise Grade Workload Management|website=blogs.univa.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-23}}</ref>\n\n8.6.2 was released on August 16, 2018. Univa Grid Engine performance and scalability has been improved in several key areas: network communications, job submission, memory allocation, and scheduler optimizations. This update also improved Univa Grid Engine job dispatch information.\n\n8.6.3 was released on September 27, 2018. The new update provided bulk configuration changes for Univa Grid Engine hosts. The new bulk configuration commands perform operations on many hosts simultaneously, which makes it easier to manage a large Univa Grid Engine cluster.\n\n8.6.4 was released on November 23, 2018, providing new core binding strategies to make it easier to distribute nodes and cores for jobs while also providing more flexibility. A new affinity-based job placement policy was included in this update. Jobs submitted using an affinity will either be packed close together with a \u201cpositive affinity\u201d or \u201cnegative affinity\u201d across the cluster, based on the resources requested. A new Univa Grid Engine Resource Maps can now control access to host devices such as NVIDIA GPUs. This allows jobs to request GPUs and that GPU is exclusively assigned to the job. Univa Grid Engine now also directly communicates with NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager to collect GPU metrics for scheduling and accounting.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.5 was released on May 6, 2019. The new key features are:\n\n* Support for IBM Power 9 on Linux\n* Many improvements to Docker support on Univa Grid Engine including supporting the latest Docker versions\n* Very large cluster hostname management where IP for host is contained in the hostname\n* Integration with Linux Out of Memory (OOM) Notification API ensuring that Univa Grid Engine is automatically notified of jobs that are terminated by the Linux kernel\n* Improved responsiveness in heavily loaded cluster for Grid Engine administrator commands\n* Performance improvements to Univa Grid Engine automatic job rescheduling\n* Thread deadlock detection for Univa Grid Engine qmaster\n* Updated support for NVIDIA DCGM versions up to 1.6.3\n* GPU/CPU affinity can be specified as a hard or soft request\n\n8.6.7 was released on August 5, 2019. Among the numerous enhancements, Univa Grid Engine 8.6.7 offers Red Hat Linux 8 support and NVIDIA GPU DCGM job usage.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.8 was released on December 12, 2019, providing new parameters to fine-tine scheduling wildcard requests, support for Linux mount namespaces and GPU usage reporting.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.9 was released on February 10, 2020. It included enhancements made to qconf and improved information and messaging collection.\n\nUniva Grid Engine 8.6.11 was released on March 17, 2020. Among the many enhancements, this version delivers improved Docker compatibility, job reporting and monitoring and increased support for the latest version of DCGM.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Job scheduler#Batch queuing for HPC clusters|Job Scheduler and Batch Queuing for Clusters]]\n<!-- sort alphabetically: -->\n* [[Beowulf cluster]]\n* [[Maui Cluster Scheduler]]\n* [[Open Source Cluster Application Resources]] (OSCAR)\n* [[Slurm Workload Manager]]\n* [[TORQUE]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.univa.com/products/}}\n* [http://linuxappfinder.com/package/gridengine pointer to repository for old Debian and Ubuntu packages]\n\n[[Category:Grid computing]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Batch-queuing system to schedule resources in a data center}}\n{{Infobox software\n| title                  = \n| name                   = Univa Grid Engine Software\n| logo                   = <!-- [[File: ]] -->\n| logo caption           = \n| screenshot             = <!-- [[File: ]] -->\n| caption                = \n| collapsible            = \n| author                 = \n| developer              = [[Univa]]\n| released               = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = 8.6.11\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2020|03|17|df=yes/no}}\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| programming language   = \n| operating system       = [[Cross-platform]]\n| platform               = \n| size                   = \n| language               = \n| genre                  = [[Grid computing]] [[Supercomputing]]\n| license                = [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] [[commercial software]]<ref>[http://www.univa.com/resources/licenses/univa-support-and-term-software Univa Support and Term Software license]</ref>\n| alexa                  = \n| website                = {{URL|www.univa.com/products}}\n}}\n'''[[Univa]] Grid Engine''' is a [[batch-queuing system]], forked from [[Sun Grid Engine]] (SGE).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.hpcinthecloud.com/features/Grid-Engine-Finds-Safe-Harbor-in-Univa-114125534.html | title=Grid Engine Finds Safe Harbor at Univa | work=HPC in the Cloud | date=2011-01-18 | accessdate=April 17, 2011 | author=Gentzsch, Wolfgang}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/18/univa_forks_oracle_grid_engine/ | title=Univa forks Oracle's Sun Grid Engine | work=The Register | date=2011-01-18 | accessdate=April 17, 2011 | author=Morgan, Timothy Prickett}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.hpcwire.com/features/Univa-Rescues-Grid-Engine-From-Oracle-114140804.html | title=Univa Rescues Grid Engine From Oracle | work=HPCwire | date=2011-01-18 | accessdate=April 17, 2011 | author=Feldman, Michael | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124052006/http://www.hpcwire.com/features/Univa-Rescues-Grid-Engine-From-Oracle-114140804.html | archive-date=January 24, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The software schedules resources in a [[data center]] and applies policy management tools.
