{"title_page": "Amercement", "text_new": "An '''amercement''' is a financial penalty in [[English law]], common during the [[Middle Ages]], imposed either by the court or by peers. The noun \"amercement\" lately derives from the verb '''to amerce''', thus: the King amerces his subject, who offended some law. The term is of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] origin ([[Law French]], from French, from Latin), and literally means \"being at the mercy of\": ''a-merce-ment'' (English ''[[mercy]]'' is cognate).\n\nWhile it is often synonymous with a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]], it differs in that a fine is a fixed sum prescribed by statute and was often voluntary, while an amercement is arbitrary. Amercements were commonly used as a punishment for minor offences (such as trespassing in the King's forest), as an alternative to imprisonment.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924022604734 \"Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John, with an Historical Introduction, by William Sharp McKechnie (Glasgow: Maclehose, 1914): Chapter 20\"]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThis system of amercements is found in working order as early as the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of 1066, but was still regarded as an innovation at the accession in 1100 of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]].  As the number of entities having legal jurisdiction over a given location increased, the sums demanded from a wrong\u2013doer who wished to buy himself back under protection of the law had become increasingly burdensome.  He had to satisfy claims of the victim's family, of the victim's lord, of the lord within whose territory the crime had been committed, perhaps of the church whose sanctuary had been invaded, of other lords who could show an interest of any sort, and finally of the King as lord paramount. It became practically impossible to buy back the peace once it had been broken. The Crown, however, stepped in, and offered protection on certain conditions: the culprit surrendered himself and all that he had to the King, placing himself \u201cin misericordiam regis,\u201d and delivering a tangible pledge (vadium) as evidence and security of the surrender. Strictly speaking, the man's life and limbs and all that he had were at the King's mercy. The Crown, however, found that it might defeat its own interests by excessive greed; and generally contented itself with moderate forfeits. Rules of procedure were formulated: the amounts taken were regulated partly by the wealth of the offender, and partly by the gravity of the offence. Further, it became a recognized rule that the amount should be assessed by what was practically a jury of the culprit's neighbours; and attempts were also made to fix a maximum.\n\nThus a sort of tariff grew up, which the Crown usually respected in practice, without abandoning the right to demand more. Such payments were known as \u201camercements.\u201d For petty offences, men were constantly placed \u201cin mercy\u201d: for failure to attend meetings of a [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]] or county; for false or mistaken verdicts; for infringements of forest rights. The Charter of Henry I. (chapter 8) had promised a remedy, drastic indeed but of a reactionary and impossible nature. His promise, to abolish altogether the system of amercements (then of recent introduction) and to revert to the earlier Anglo\u2013Saxon system of [[Estovers|bots]] and [[wite]]s, was made only to be broken.\n\nNo one could expect to pass through life (perhaps hardly through a single year) without being subjected to amercements. Three chapters of [[Magna Carta]] accordingly are occupied with remedies. Chapter 20 seeks to protect the ordinary layman; chapter 21, the barons; and chapter 22, the clergy. Three subdivisions\u2014the freeman, the villein, and the merchant\u2014are treated here.\n\nAmercements are much mentioned in [[Magna Carta]], particularly article 20:\n<blockquote>\nA free man shall not be amerced for a trivial offence except in accordance with the degree of the offence, and for a grave offence he shall be amerced in accordance with its gravity, yet saving his way of living; and a merchant in the same way, saving his stock-in-trade; and a villein shall be amerced in the same way, saving his means of livelihood--if they have fallen into our mercy: and none of the aforesaid amercements shall be imposed except by the oath of good men of the neighbourhood.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Amercement of freemen===\n\nThe great object of the reforms here promised was to eliminate the arbitrary element; the Crown must conform to its own customary rules. With this object, safeguards were devised for freemen. (a) For a slight offence, only a petty sum could be taken. This was nothing new: the records of [[John, King of England|John]]\u2019s reign show that, both before and after 1215, very small amounts were often taken: threepence was a common sum. (b) For grave offences, a larger sum might be assessed, but not out of proportion to the offence. (c) In no case could the offender be pushed absolutely to the wall: his means of livelihood must be saved to him. Even if all other effects had to be sold off to pay the amount assessed, he was to retain his \u201c[[contenement]],\u201d a word to be afterwards discussed. (d) Another clause provided machinery for giving effect to these rules. The amount must be fixed, not arbitrarily by the Crown, but by impartial assessors, \u201cby the oath of honest men of the neighbourhood.\u201d In the reissue of 1216 \u201chonest men\u201d became \u201chonest and lawworthy (legalium) men,\u201d a purely verbal change.\n\nThere were apparently two steps in the fixing of amercements. (a) In the case of a commoner, the penalty under normal circumstances would be assessed provisionally by the King's justices on circuit, with the assistance of the [[sheriff]]. It was their duty to see that the amount was proportionate to the gravity of the offence. (b) Thereafter, the sheriff or his [[Serjeanty|serjeant]]s, in full county court, with the assistance of twelve neighbours, taxed the amercements, reducing them in accordance with their knowledge of the wrong\u2013doer's ability to pay.\n\nThe [[Pipe Rolls]] afford illustrations of the practice. In the fourteenth year of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] a certain priest (who, in this respect, stood on the same footing as a layman) had been placed ''in misericordiam'' of 100 marks by William fitz John, one of the King's justices, but that sum was afterwards reduced to 40 marks ''per sacramentum vicinorum suorum''. It seems a safe inference that, on the priest pleading poverty, the question of his ability to pay was referred to local recognitors with the result stated. This priest was subsequently pardoned altogether \u201cbecause of his poverty.\u201d\n\nMagna Carta in this chapter, treating of the amercements of freeholders, merchants and villeins, makes no reference to the part played by the King's justices, but only to the functions of the jury of neighbours.  All this is in marked contrast with the provisions of chapter 21, regulating the treatment to be accorded to earls and barons who made default.\n\n===Amercement of villeins===\n\nThe early history of [[villein]]s as a class is enveloped in the mists that still surround the rise of the English manor. Notwithstanding the efforts of Mr. [[Frederic Seebohm (historian)|Frederic Seebohm]] to find the origin of villeinage in the status of the serfs who worked for Roman masters upon British farms long before the [[Teutons|Teutonic]] immigrations began, an older theory still holds the field, namely, that the abject villeins of Norman days were descendants of free\u2013born ''ceorls'' of Anglo\u2013Saxon stock. On this theory, most of England was once cultivated by Anglo\u2013Saxon peasant proprietors grouped in little societies, each of which formed an isolated village. These villagers were slowly sinking from their originally free estate during several centuries prior to 1066: but the process of their degradation was completed rapidly and roughly by the Norman conquerors. The once free peasantry were crushed down into the dependent villeins of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\n\nWhichever theory may be the correct one, the position, economic, legal, and political, of villeins in the thirteenth century has been ascertained with certainty. Economically they were part of the equipment of the manor of their lord, whose fields they had to cultivate as a condition of being left in possession of acres, in a sense, their own. The services exacted, at first vague and undefined, were gradually specified and limited. They varied from century to century, from district to district, and even from manor to manor; but at best the life of the villein was, as a contemporary writer has described it, burdensome and wretched (''graviter et miserabiliter''). After his obligations were discharged, little time was left him for the ploughing and reaping of his own holding. The normal villein possessed his virgate or half virgate (thirty or fifteen scattered acres) under a tenure known as ''villenagium'', sharply distinguished from the freeholder's tenures. He was a dependent dweller on a manor which he dared not quit without his master's leave.\n\nIt is true that he had rights of a proprietary nature in the acres he claimed as his own; yet these were determined, not by the common law of England, but by \u201cthe custom of the manor,\u201d or virtually at the will of the lord. These rights, such as they were, could not be pleaded elsewhere than before the court customary of that manor over which the lord's steward presided with powers wide and undefined. Politically his position was peculiar: allowed none of the privileges, he was yet expected to perform some of the duties, of the freeman. He attended the shire and hundred courts, and acted on juries, thus suffering still further encroachments on the scanty portion of time he might call his own, but preserving for a brighter day a vague tradition of his earlier liberty.\n\nThis chapter extends some measure of protection to villeins. Two questions, however, may be asked:\u2014What measure? and from what motive? One point is clear: the villeins were protected from the abuse of only such amercements as John himself might inflict, not from the amercements of their manorial lords; for the words used are ''si inciderint in misericordiam nostram''. A villein in the King's mercy shall enjoy the same consideration as the freeholder or merchant in similar plight\u2014his means of livelihood being saved to him. The word now used is neither \u201c[[contenement]]\u201d nor merchandise, but ''waynagium'', the meaning of which has been the subject of discussion. [[Edward Coke|Coke]] defined it as \u201cthe contenement of a villein; or the furniture of his cart or wain,\u201d and Coke has been widely followed. The word, however, has apparently no connexion with wains or wagons, but is merely a Latinized form of the French word ''gagnage'', of which [[Godefroy family|Godefroy]] gives five meanings: (a) gain; (b) tillage; (c) crop; (d) land under the plough; (e) grain. Professor Tait is inclined to read the word, in its present context, as equivalent either to \u201ccrops\u201d or to \u201clands under cultivation,\u201d and to translate the clause \u201csaving his tillage.\u201d What was the motive of these restrictions? It is usually supposed to have been clemency, the humane desire not to reduce a poor wretch to absolute beggary. It is possible, however, to imagine a different motive; the villein was the property of his lord, and John must respect the vested interests of others. That the King might do what he pleased with his own property, his demesne villeins, seems clear from a passage usually neglected by commentators, namely, chapter 16 of the reissue of 1217. Four important words were there introduced\u2014''villanus alterius quam noster'': the king was not to inflict crushing amercements on villeins \u201cother than his own,\u201d thus leaving villeins on royal manors unreservedly in his power.\n\n===Amercement of merchants===\n\nThe trader is in the same position as the ''liber homo'', except that it is his \u201cmerchandise,\u201d not his \u201c[[contenement]],\u201d that is protected. The word is capable of two somewhat different shades of meaning. Narrowly interpreted, it may refer to his wares, the stock\u2013in\u2013trade without which the pursuit of his calling would be impossible. More broadly viewed, it might mean his business itself, his position as a merchant. The difference is of little practical import: in either view the Charter saves to him his means of earning a living.\n\nSome boroughs, indeed, had anticipated Magna Carta by obtaining in their own charters a definition of the maximum amercement exigible, or in some cases of the amercing body. Thus, John's [[Charter to Dunwich]] of 29 June 1200 provides that the [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] shall only be amerced by six men from within the [[borough]], and six men from without. The capital had special privileges: in his Charter to London, Henry I promised that no citizen ''in misericordia pecuniae'' should pay a higher sum than 100 shillings (the amount of his [[Were|wer]]). This was confirmed in the Charter of Henry II, who declared \u201cthat none shall be adjudged for amercements of money, but according to the law of the city, which they had in the time of King Henry, my grandfather.\u201d John's Charter to London of 17 June 1199, also referred to this; and the general confirmation of customs, contained in chapter 13 of Magna Carta, would further strengthen it. In all probability, the earlier grant covered trivial offences only (such as placed the offender in the King's hands ''de misericordia pecuniae''). The present chapter is wider in its scope, applying to grave offences also, and embracing merchants everywhere, not merely the burgesses of chartered towns.\n\n==Difference between fines and amercements==\n\nIn the thirteenth century, these terms were sharply contrasted. \u201cAmercement\u201d was applied to sums imposed in punishment of misdeeds; the law\u2013breaker had no option of refusing, and no voice in fixing the amount. \u201cFine,\u201d on the contrary, was used for voluntary offerings made to the King to obtain some favour or to escape punishment. Here the initiative rested with the individual, who suggested the amount to be paid, and was, indeed, under no legal obligation to make any offer at all. This distinction between fines and amercements, absolute in theory, could readily be obliterated in practice. The spirit of the restriction placed by this chapter and by the common law upon the King's prerogative of inflicting amercements could often be evaded. The Crown might imprison its victims for an indefinite period, and then graciously allow them to offer large payments to escape death by fever or starvation in a noisome gaol: enormous fines might thus be taken, while royal officials were forbidden to inflict arbitrary amercements.\n\nWith the gradual elimination of the voluntary element the word \u201cfine\u201d came to bear its modern meaning, while \u201camercement\u201d dropped out of ordinary use.\n\n==Modern usage==\n{{see also|Asset forfeiture}}\n\n===In the United States===\n\nReferred to in ''Frantz v. U.S. Powerlifting Federation'' 836 F.2d 1063 (7th Cir. 1987).  In a discussion about the imposition of FRCP Rule 11 sanctions on a plaintiff's attorney, the decision says, \"The complaint in this case was [[frivolous lawsuit|frivolous]], which calls at a minimum for censure of Victor D. Quilici, the plaintiffs' lawyer.  Whether it calls for amercement - and, if so, whether Cotter or the Treasury is the appropriate beneficiary - is something the district court should consider as an initial matter.\"<ref>''Frantz v. U.S. Powerlifting Federation'' 836 F.2d 1063 (7th Cir. 1987)</ref>\n\nA cause of action in amercement will exist against a sheriff who refused to seize property under a writ of execution. ''Vitale v. Hotel California, Inc.'', 446 A.2d 880 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law, 1982).\n\nSince 2006, US banks have been amerced large amounts under prosecution of the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]], or the [[Trading with the Enemy Act]]. The civil nature of the [[asset forfeiture]] laws allows the banks not to be declared criminally guilty.  The asset forfeiture wiki lists a number of cases of recent note.\n\n\n====21st-century Police traffic stops to raise funds====\n\n*Illinois: ''Huff and Seaton v. Reichert'' (2014)\n[[Terrance Huff]] was driving and [[Jon Seaton]] was the passenger in a car with Ohio license plates that was stopped in Illinois, as recorded by Officer Reichert's dashboard camera. Huff provided his driver's license, insurance, and registration. Reichert explained that Huff crossed the center line without using a signal and then moved back into his own lane. Dispatch related that Huff had been arrested for battery and for marijuana cultivation in 2001, but those charges were dismissed. Seaton had no criminal history. \n\nReichert requested backup, but told Huff that he was letting him go with a warning. Seaton seemed nervous, so Reichert then asked if Huff objected to a search. Huff replied that he would \u201clike to go.\u201d Reichert said that he wanted to walk his drug\u2010sniffing dog around the car. Huff asked Reichert if he was free to go. Reichert responded, \u201cnot in the car.\u201d Huff said that he felt he had no choice but to consent, and that Reichert could use the dog but could not search the car. Reichert repeatedly said, \u201cshow me! Find it!\u201d The dog barked. Reichert replied, repeatedly, \u201cgood boy!\u201d Reichert later admitted that he was trained not to say these things to his dog. Reichert told Huff that he was going to search his car. Huff responded, \u201cdo what you gotta do.\u201d Reichert searched the car, but did not document the presence of drugs nor collect any evidence. About 50 minutes after the stop, Reichert told the two men that they were free to leave. In their suit under '''42 U.S.C. 1983''', the court denied Reichert's motion for summary judgment based on [[qualified immunity]]. The [[Seventh Circuit]] affirmed.<ref>[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/13-1734/13-1734-2014-03-10.html law.justitia.com: \"Huff v Reichert\"]</ref>\n\nThe incident occurred along a stretch of highway know to be a lucrative source of asset forfeiture revenue for state and local police departments. Police are known to create traffic infractions to allow for such stops and then develop probable cause to conduct drug searches.  If police can establish any connection to drug activity, officers can seize drivers' cars and cash, with \"proceeds funding the police department\". Under [[Illinois]] law, it can be very difficult and \"expensive for an innocent person\" to gain return of their property, particularly for motorists who are from out of state, like Huff.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/08/terrance-huff-michael-reichert-lawsuit-traffic-stop_n_1500394.html Radley Balko, \"Terrance Huff Files Lawsuit Against Illinois Police Officer Michael Reichert Over 'Trekkie Traffic Stop'\"], ''Huffington Post'', 5 Aug 2012]</ref>\n\n[[Radley Balko]], a ''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist, in March 2014 wrote that the \n<blockquote>\"biggest barrier to lawsuits against police officers is the doctrine of [[qualified immunity]].

To even get in front of a jury, you must also show that the rights the officer violated were \u201cwell established\u201d at the time of the incident. The tactics Reichert used in Huff\u2019s case are fairly common, so Huff surviving qualified immunity was far from a sure thing. But this week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected Reichert\u2019s qualified immunity claim and will allow Huff's suit to go forward.\"<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/03/12/set-phasers-to-litigate-trekkie-lawsuit-against-illinois-officer-moves-forward/?algtrack=cfrec-0&tid=btm_rex_1 Radley Balko, \"Set Phasers to litigate: \u2018Trekkie\u2019 lawsuit against Illinois officer moves forward\"], ''Washington Post'', 12 Mar 2014</ref></blockquote><!-- Was this case ever settled?

The noun \"amercement\" lately derives from the verb '''to amerce''', thus: the King amerces his subject, who offended some law.

Amercements were commonly used as a punishment for minor offences (such as trespassing in the King's forest), as an alternative to imprisonment.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924022604734 \"Magna Carta: A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John, with an Historical Introduction, by William Sharp McKechnie (Glasgow: Maclehose, 1914): Chapter 20\"]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThis system of amercements is found in working order as early as the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of 1066, but was still regarded as an innovation at the accession in 1100 of [[Henry I of England|Henry I]].  As the number of entities having legal jurisdiction over a given location increased, the sums demanded from a wrong\u2013doer who wished to buy himself back under protection of the law had become increasingly burdensome.  He had to satisfy claims of the victim's family, of the victim's lord, of the lord within whose territory the crime had been committed, perhaps of the church whose sanctuary had been invaded, of other lords who could show an interest of any sort, and finally of the King as lord paramount. It became practically impossible to buy back the peace once it had been broken. The Crown, however, stepped in, and offered protection on certain conditions: the culprit surrendered himself and all that he had to the King, placing himself \u201cin misericordiam regis,\u201d and delivering a tangible pledge (vadium) as evidence and security of the surrender. Strictly speaking, the man's life and limbs and all that he had were at the King's mercy. The Crown, however, found that it might defeat its own interests by excessive greed; and generally contented itself with moderate forfeits. Rules of procedure were formulated: the amounts taken were regulated partly by the wealth of the offender, and partly by the gravity of the offence. Further, it became a recognized rule that the amount should be assessed by what was practically a jury of the culprit's neighbours; and attempts were also made to fix a maximum.\n\nThus a sort of tariff grew up, which the Crown usually respected in practice, without abandoning the right to demand more. Such payments were known as \u201camercements.\u201d For petty offences, men were constantly placed \u201cin mercy\u201d: for failure to attend meetings of a [[Hundred (county division)|hundred]] or county; for false or mistaken verdicts; for infringements of forest rights. The Charter of Henry I. (chapter 8) had promised a remedy, drastic indeed but of a reactionary and impossible nature. His promise, to abolish altogether the system of amercements (then of recent introduction) and to revert to the earlier Anglo\u2013Saxon system of [[Estovers|bots]] and [[wite]]s, was made only to be broken.\n\nNo one could expect to pass through life (perhaps hardly through a single year) without being subjected to amercements. Three chapters of [[Magna Carta]] accordingly are occupied with remedies. Chapter 20 seeks to protect the ordinary layman; chapter 21, the barons; and chapter 22, the clergy. Three subdivisions\u2014the freeman, the villein, and the merchant\u2014are treated here.\n\nAmercements are much mentioned in [[Magna Carta]], particularly article 20:\n<blockquote>\nA free man shall not be amerced for a trivial offence except in accordance with the degree of the offence, and for a grave offence he shall be amerced in accordance with its gravity, yet saving his way of living; and a merchant in the same way, saving his stock-in-trade; and a villein shall be amerced in the same way, saving his means of livelihood--if they have fallen into our mercy: and none of the aforesaid amercements shall be imposed except by the oath of good men of the neighbourhood.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Amercement of freemen===\n\nThe great object of the reforms here promised was to eliminate the arbitrary element; the Crown must conform to its own customary rules. With this object, safeguards were devised for freemen. (a) For a slight offence, only a petty sum could be taken. This was nothing new: the records of [[John, King of England|John]]\u2019s reign show that, both before and after 1215, very small amounts were often taken: threepence was a common sum. (b) For grave offences, a larger sum might be assessed, but not out of proportion to the offence. (c) In no case could the offender be pushed absolutely to the wall: his means of livelihood must be saved to him. Even if all other effects had to be sold off to pay the amount assessed, he was to retain his \u201c[[contenement]],\u201d a word to be afterwards discussed. (d) Another clause provided machinery for giving effect to these rules. The amount must be fixed, not arbitrarily by the Crown, but by impartial assessors, \u201cby the oath of honest men of the neighbourhood.\u201d In the reissue of 1216 \u201chonest men\u201d became \u201chonest and lawworthy (legalium) men,\u201d a purely verbal change.\n\nThere were apparently two steps in the fixing of amercements. (a) In the case of a commoner, the penalty under normal circumstances would be assessed provisionally by the King's justices on circuit, with the assistance of the [[sheriff]]. It was their duty to see that the amount was proportionate to the gravity of the offence. (b) Thereafter, the sheriff or his [[Serjeanty|serjeant]]s, in full county court, with the assistance of twelve neighbours, taxed the amercements, reducing them in accordance with their knowledge of the wrong\u2013doer's ability to pay.\n\nThe [[Pipe Rolls]] afford illustrations of the practice. In the fourteenth year of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] a certain priest (who, in this respect, stood on the same footing as a layman) had been placed ''in misericordiam'' of 100 marks by William fitz John, one of the King's justices, but that sum was afterwards reduced to 40 marks ''per sacramentum vicinorum suorum''. It seems a safe inference that, on the priest pleading poverty, the question of his ability to pay was referred to local recognitors with the result stated. This priest was subsequently pardoned altogether \u201cbecause of his poverty.\u201d\n\nMagna Carta in this chapter, treating of the amercements of freeholders, merchants and villeins, makes no reference to the part played by the King's justices, but only to the functions of the jury of neighbours.  All this is in marked contrast with the provisions of chapter 21, regulating the treatment to be accorded to earls and barons who made default.\n\n===Amercement of villeins===\n\nThe early history of [[villein]]s as a class is enveloped in the mists that still surround the rise of the English manor. Notwithstanding the efforts of Mr. [[Frederic Seebohm (historian)|Frederic Seebohm]] to find the origin of villeinage in the status of the serfs who worked for Roman masters upon British farms long before the [[Teutons|Teutonic]] immigrations began, an older theory still holds the field, namely, that the abject villeins of Norman days were descendants of free\u2013born ''ceorls'' of Anglo\u2013Saxon stock. On this theory, most of England was once cultivated by Anglo\u2013Saxon peasant proprietors grouped in little societies, each of which formed an isolated village. These villagers were slowly sinking from their originally free estate during several centuries prior to 1066: but the process of their degradation was completed rapidly and roughly by the Norman conquerors. The once free peasantry were crushed down into the dependent villeins of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\n\nWhichever theory may be the correct one, the position, economic, legal, and political, of villeins in the thirteenth century has been ascertained with certainty. Economically they were part of the equipment of the manor of their lord, whose fields they had to cultivate as a condition of being left in possession of acres, in a sense, their own. The services exacted, at first vague and undefined, were gradually specified and limited. They varied from century to century, from district to district, and even from manor to manor; but at best the life of the villein was, as a contemporary writer has described it, burdensome and wretched (''graviter et miserabiliter''). After his obligations were discharged, little time was left him for the ploughing and reaping of his own holding. The normal villein possessed his virgate or half virgate (thirty or fifteen scattered acres) under a tenure known as ''villenagium'', sharply distinguished from the freeholder's tenures. He was a dependent dweller on a manor which he dared not quit without his master's leave.\n\nIt is true that he had rights of a proprietary nature in the acres he claimed as his own; yet these were determined, not by the common law of England, but by \u201cthe custom of the manor,\u201d or virtually at the will of the lord. These rights, such as they were, could not be pleaded elsewhere than before the court customary of that manor over which the lord's steward presided with powers wide and undefined. Politically his position was peculiar: allowed none of the privileges, he was yet expected to perform some of the duties, of the freeman. He attended the shire and hundred courts, and acted on juries, thus suffering still further encroachments on the scanty portion of time he might call his own, but preserving for a brighter day a vague tradition of his earlier liberty.\n\nThis chapter extends some measure of protection to villeins. Two questions, however, may be asked:\u2014What measure? and from what motive? One point is clear: the villeins were protected from the abuse of only such amercements as John himself might inflict, not from the amercements of their manorial lords; for the words used are ''si inciderint in misericordiam nostram''. A villein in the King's mercy shall enjoy the same consideration as the freeholder or merchant in similar plight\u2014his means of livelihood being saved to him. The word now used is neither \u201c[[contenement]]\u201d nor merchandise, but ''waynagium'', the meaning of which has been the subject of discussion. [[Edward Coke|Coke]] defined it as \u201cthe contenement of a villein; or the furniture of his cart or wain,\u201d and Coke has been widely followed. The word, however, has apparently no connexion with wains or wagons, but is merely a Latinized form of the French word ''gagnage'', of which [[Godefroy family|Godefroy]] gives five meanings: (a) gain; (b) tillage; (c) crop; (d) land under the plough; (e) grain. Professor Tait is inclined to read the word, in its present context, as equivalent either to \u201ccrops\u201d or to \u201clands under cultivation,\u201d and to translate the clause \u201csaving his tillage.\u201d What was the motive of these restrictions? It is usually supposed to have been clemency, the humane desire not to reduce a poor wretch to absolute beggary. It is possible, however, to imagine a different motive; the villein was the property of his lord, and John must respect the vested interests of others. That the King might do what he pleased with his own property, his demesne villeins, seems clear from a passage usually neglected by commentators, namely, chapter 16 of the reissue of 1217. Four important words were there introduced\u2014''villanus alterius quam noster'': the king was not to inflict crushing amercements on villeins \u201cother than his own,\u201d thus leaving villeins on royal manors unreservedly in his power.\n\n===Amercement of merchants===\n\nThe trader is in the same position as the ''liber homo'', except that it is his \u201cmerchandise,\u201d not his \u201c[[contenement]],\u201d that is protected. The word is capable of two somewhat different shades of meaning. Narrowly interpreted, it may refer to his wares, the stock\u2013in\u2013trade without which the pursuit of his calling would be impossible. More broadly viewed, it might mean his business itself, his position as a merchant. The difference is of little practical import: in either view the Charter saves to him his means of earning a living.\n\nSome boroughs, indeed, had anticipated Magna Carta by obtaining in their own charters a definition of the maximum amercement exigible, or in some cases of the amercing body. Thus, John's [[Charter to Dunwich]] of 29 June 1200 provides that the [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] shall only be amerced by six men from within the [[borough]], and six men from without. The capital had special privileges: in his Charter to London, Henry I promised that no citizen ''in misericordia pecuniae'' should pay a higher sum than 100 shillings (the amount of his [[Were|wer]]). This was confirmed in the Charter of Henry II, who declared \u201cthat none shall be adjudged for amercements of money, but according to the law of the city, which they had in the time of King Henry, my grandfather.\u201d John's Charter to London of 17 June 1199, also referred to this; and the general confirmation of customs, contained in chapter 13 of Magna Carta, would further strengthen it. In all probability, the earlier grant covered trivial offences only (such as placed the offender in the King's hands ''de misericordia pecuniae''). The present chapter is wider in its scope, applying to grave offences also, and embracing merchants everywhere, not merely the burgesses of chartered towns.\n\n==Difference between fines and amercements==\n\nIn the thirteenth century, these terms were sharply contrasted. \u201cAmercement\u201d was applied to sums imposed in punishment of misdeeds; the law\u2013breaker had no option of refusing, and no voice in fixing the amount. \u201cFine,\u201d on the contrary, was used for voluntary offerings made to the King to obtain some favour or to escape punishment. Here the initiative rested with the individual, who suggested the amount to be paid, and was, indeed, under no legal obligation to make any offer at all. This distinction between fines and amercements, absolute in theory, could readily be obliterated in practice. The spirit of the restriction placed by this chapter and by the common law upon the King's prerogative of inflicting amercements could often be evaded. The Crown might imprison its victims for an indefinite period, and then graciously allow them to offer large payments to escape death by fever or starvation in a noisome gaol: enormous fines might thus be taken, while royal officials were forbidden to inflict arbitrary amercements.\n\nWith the gradual elimination of the voluntary element the word \u201cfine\u201d came to bear its modern meaning, while \u201camercement\u201d dropped out of ordinary use.\n\n==Modern usage==\n{{see also|Asset forfeiture}}\n\n===In the United States===\n\nReferred to in ''Frantz v. U.S. Powerlifting Federation'' 836 F.2d 1063 (7th Cir. 1987).  In a discussion about the imposition of FRCP Rule 11 sanctions on a plaintiff's attorney, the decision says, \"The complaint in this case was [[frivolous lawsuit|frivolous]], which calls at a minimum for censure of Victor D. Quilici, the plaintiffs' lawyer.

U.S. Powerlifting Federation'' 836 F.2d 1063 (7th Cir. 1987)</ref>\n\nA cause of action in amercement will exist against a sheriff who refused to seize property under a writ of execution. ''Vitale v. Hotel California, Inc.'', 446 A.2d 880 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law, 1982).\n\nSince 2006, US banks have been amerced large amounts under prosecution of the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]], or the [[Trading with the Enemy Act]]. The civil nature of the [[asset forfeiture]] laws allows the banks not to be declared criminally guilty.  The asset forfeiture wiki lists a number of cases of recent note.\n\n\n====21st-century Police traffic stops to raise funds====\n\n*Illinois: ''Huff and Seaton v. Reichert'' (2014)\n[[Terrance Huff]] was driving and [[Jon Seaton]] was the passenger in a car with Ohio license plates that was stopped in Illinois, as recorded by Officer Reichert's dashboard camera. Huff provided his driver's license, insurance, and registration. Reichert explained that Huff crossed the center line without using a signal and then moved back into his own lane. Dispatch related that Huff had been arrested for battery and for marijuana cultivation in 2001, but those charges were dismissed. Seaton had no criminal history. \n\nReichert requested backup, but told Huff that he was letting him go with a warning. Seaton seemed nervous, so Reichert then asked if Huff objected to a search. Huff replied that he would \u201clike to go.\u201d Reichert said that he wanted to walk his drug\u2010sniffing dog around the car. Huff asked Reichert if he was free to go. Reichert responded, \u201cnot in the car.\u201d Huff said that he felt he had no choice but to consent, and that Reichert could use the dog but could not search the car. Reichert repeatedly said, \u201cshow me! Find it!\u201d The dog barked. Reichert replied, repeatedly, \u201cgood boy!\u201d Reichert later admitted that he was trained not to say these things to his dog. Reichert told Huff that he was going to search his car. Huff responded, \u201cdo what you gotta do.\u201d Reichert searched the car, but did not document the presence of drugs nor collect any evidence. About 50 minutes after the stop, Reichert told the two men that they were free to leave. In their suit under '''42 U.S.C. 1983''', the court denied Reichert's motion for summary judgment based on [[qualified immunity]]. The [[Seventh Circuit]] affirmed.<ref>[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca7/13-1734/13-1734-2014-03-10.html law.justitia.com: \"Huff v Reichert\"]</ref>\n\nThe incident occurred along a stretch of highway know to be a lucrative source of asset forfeiture revenue for state and local police departments.

A recent addition to the state's crime control toolbox, the development of civil forfeiture in Ireland and in Canada, shows remarkable resistance to the idea that standard criminal justice safeguards govern the forfeiture process. The stark parallels in these two jurisdictions demonstrate tacit acceptance of a strategy that proves perilous to long-held procedural and substantive rights. By deftly shifting to formally civil instruments, Ireland and Canada have organized an assault on crime that circumvents the conventional criminal law, arguably seriously abrogating rights and procedural justice.</ref> An earlier article by Gallant was cited in the SCC Chatterjee judgment.<ref>Gallant, Michelle.  \u201cOntario (Attorney General) v. $29,020 in Canadian Currency: A Comment on Proceeds of Crime and Provincial Forfeiture Laws\u201d (2006), 52 Crim.

Thunderstrock is a [[DIY ethic | Do-It-Yourself (DIY)]] concert and its idea is to support and encourage the rock bands and music lovers of Ranchi. Simultaneously, the idea is to donate the income generated from the sale of tickets to groups (or [[Non-governmental organization | NGOs]]) working for the welfare of society. The idea of Thunderstrock emerged back in the year 2008, the idea was to generate funds for Jharkhand Rock Music Association (JRMA) so that JRMA could further plan concerts for rock bands of Ranchi. The initiative was further taken up by band members from Kaalmantra, Genesis and Sonu Chhetry from the band Sparsh, which were the prominent bands of that time.\n\n==First edition in 2008==\nThe first season of Thunderstrock was held in August 2008 at Hotel Ashok in Ranchi. As the initiators for the concept of Thunderstrock, Kaalmantra and Genesis took up the stage that year. These bands were already famous with the rock music lovers of Ranchi, hence the footfall for the concert was immense and the show managed to fetch around Rs. 25,000 which was later donated to JRMA by Mr. K.C. Shashidhar, the Chief General Manager of NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development).\n\n==Second edition in 2009==\nThe second season happened in July 2009. Kaalmantra, Genesis and JRMA being the organizers this time. The event was brought forward with an agenda of spreading awareness among youth on the evils of alcoholism and child labour.\n\n==Third edition in 2010==\nThe third season happened in 2010 with an intention to support Yuwa which is an NGO that empowers girls by combating child marriage, illiteracy and human trafficking in Jharkhand through football and education. This season featured three bands namely Hypnotize, Kaos and none other than Sparsh which was the leading rock band of Ranchi back then. The show was a huge success and again it collected Rs. 25,000 and a donation was made to [[Yuwa-India]] after the show.\n\n==Break in between 2010-2014==\nWith the end of 2010s came the downfall in the audience count for rock and metal music. This really affected the footfall of the audience in the festival especially in a city like Ranchi which is a small city and has not much of people listening to rock and metal music. Also, the initiators of the festival got jobs and moved on leaving the festival for a complete break of four years. The gap was witnessed with the rise of other DIY (Do-It-Yourself) festivals in the city which followed the same momentum in which this festival was started. But the future of this festival was in no one's hand.\n\n==Start after a gap in 2014 and complete silence till 2017== \nThe fourth season happened on 7th September 2014 and from here on, [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69's]] vocalist Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of organizing this festival. For the first time, it was organized in an open-air festival style which experienced a footfall of around 2500. The season featured bands like Death Note, Destiny, Virus, Error 404, Highway 69, Genesis and the leading rock band of [[Darjeeling]] named Head Motif. The donations of that year went to Harmu Football Academy. \n\nHaving organized this festival on such a large scale for the first time, the next season in 2015 could not be conducted as there was a shortage of funds which is the major barrier to organizing this festival as there are no sponsors to the event. This one year gap in 2015 led to the failure of organizing this festival in 2016 and 2017 as well.\n\n==2018 and 2019==\nBut after four years of silence, the thunder struck again and Thunderstrock festival took place on 23rd September 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Thunderstrock Festival 2018|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/rock-concert-next-month/cid/1310535|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}</ref> in which What Escapes Me from Kolkata was the headliners along with Existence, Genesis and [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69]] in the line-up. Unlike the previous year, where the festival was advertised and promoted in the newspapers and social media, the festival in 2018 lacked in these aspects. But still, the festival experienced a strong footfall of 1500 people and it is actually a huge number in a city like Ranchi and especially in a time when the Metal Scene is completely down in India and people usually don't turn up to attend Metal Music Concerts.\n\nThe 2019 line-up had the initiators of this festival that is Sparsh from [[Ranchi]], modern metal band Reciprocal from [[Ranchi]], Math Rock (with Djent elements) band Bipolar Shadows<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref> from [[Gangtok]], [[Sikkim]], Progressive Metal band Cross Affinity from [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Odisha]] and folk metal fusion band Atript as our headliners from [[Jamshedpur]], [[Jharkhand]].

The festival is dedicated to bringing independent and newly emerging live acts based in rock, metal and it's sub-genres. The festival aims at making itself as a popular music festival just like [[NH7 Weekender]], [[Bangalore Open Air]], Control Alt Delete, [[Great Indian Rock]], Independence Rock etc and to highlight Ranchi on India's music concert map.

The initiative was further taken up by band members from Kaalmantra, Genesis and Sonu Chhetry from the band Sparsh, which were the prominent bands of that time.\n\n==First edition in 2008==\nThe first season of Thunderstrock was held in August 2008 at Hotel Ashok in Ranchi. As the initiators for the concept of Thunderstrock, Kaalmantra and Genesis took up the stage that year. These bands were already famous with the rock music lovers of Ranchi, hence the footfall for the concert was immense and the show managed to fetch around Rs. 25,000 which was later donated to JRMA by Mr. K.C. Shashidhar, the Chief General Manager of NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development).\n\n==Second edition in 2009==\nThe second season happened in July 2009. Kaalmantra, Genesis and JRMA being the organizers this time. The event was brought forward with an agenda of spreading awareness among youth on the evils of alcoholism and child labour.\n\n==Third edition in 2010==\nThe third season happened in 2010 with an intention to support Yuwa which is an NGO that empowers girls by combating child marriage, illiteracy and human trafficking in Jharkhand through football and education. This season featured three bands namely Hypnotize, Kaos and none other than Sparsh which was the leading rock band of Ranchi back then. The show was a huge success and again it collected Rs. 25,000 and a donation was made to [[Yuwa-India]] after the show.\n\n==Break in between 2010-2014==\nWith the end of 2010s came the downfall in the audience count for rock and metal music. This really affected the footfall of the audience in the festival especially in a city like Ranchi which is a small city and has not much of people listening to rock and metal music. Also, the initiators of the festival got jobs and moved on leaving the festival for a complete break of four years. The gap was witnessed with the rise of other DIY (Do-It-Yourself) festivals in the city which followed the same momentum in which this festival was started. But the future of this festival was in no one's hand.\n\n==Start after a gap in 2014 and complete silence till 2017== \nThe fourth season happened on 7th September 2014 and from here on, [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69's]] vocalist Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of organizing this festival. For the first time, it was organized in an open-air festival style which experienced a footfall of around 2500. The season featured bands like Death Note, Destiny, Virus, Error 404, Highway 69, Genesis and the leading rock band of [[Darjeeling]] named Head Motif. The donations of that year went to Harmu Football Academy. \n\nHaving organized this festival on such a large scale for the first time, the next season in 2015 could not be conducted as there was a shortage of funds which is the major barrier to organizing this festival as there are no sponsors to the event. This one year gap in 2015 led to the failure of organizing this festival in 2016 and 2017 as well.\n\n==2018 and 2019==\nBut after four years of silence, the thunder struck again and Thunderstrock festival took place on 23rd September 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Thunderstrock Festival 2018|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/rock-concert-next-month/cid/1310535|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}</ref> in which What Escapes Me from Kolkata was the headliners along with Existence, Genesis and [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69]] in the line-up. Unlike the previous year, where the festival was advertised and promoted in the newspapers and social media, the festival in 2018 lacked in these aspects. But still, the festival experienced a strong footfall of 1500 people and it is actually a huge number in a city like Ranchi and especially in a time when the Metal Scene is completely down in India and people usually don't turn up to attend Metal Music Concerts.\n\nThe 2019 line-up had the initiators of this festival that is Sparsh from [[Ranchi]], modern metal band Reciprocal from [[Ranchi]], Math Rock (with Djent elements) band Bipolar Shadows<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref> from [[Gangtok]], [[Sikkim]], Progressive Metal band Cross Affinity from [[Bhubaneswar]], [[Odisha]] and folk metal fusion band Atript as our headliners from [[Jamshedpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Festival's Manager, Tarun Paul Kachhap along with the band members of [[Highway 69 (band) | Highway 69]]shortlisted the band Cross Affinity and Bipolar Shadows who were the winners of Battle of Bands competitions held in [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology | Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar]] and [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]] respectively.\n\n==Present==\nThe Festival today stands as a [[DIY ethic | Do-It-Yourself (DIY)]] music festival in [[East India | Eastern India]] which is completely funded by the organizers. The festival is dedicated to bringing independent and newly emerging live acts based in rock, metal and it's sub-genres. The festival aims at making itself as a popular music festival just like [[NH7 Weekender]], [[Bangalore Open Air]], Control Alt Delete, [[Great Indian Rock]], Independence Rock etc and to highlight Ranchi on India's music concert map. They are now gearing up for 2020, with bringing the first-ever Battle of Bands competition organized by Thunderstrock Festival called \"Road to Thunderstrock\".\n", "name_user": "Tarun Paul Kachhap", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstrock_Festival"}

For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent.

In his works Plato makes extensive use of the [[Socratic method]] in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition.\n\nThe ''Timaeus'' begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions a tale he considered to be historical, that would make the perfect example, and he then follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the ''Critias''. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the \"perfect society\" and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the \"perfect\" traits described in the ''Republic''.\n\n===''Critias''===\n{{main|Critias (dialogue)}}\n\nAccording to Critias, the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] deities of old divided the land so that each deity might have their own lot; [[Poseidon]] was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than [[Ancient Libya]] and [[Asia Minor]] combined,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9010107/Atlantis |title=Atlantis\u2014Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com}}</ref><ref>Also it has been interpreted that Plato or someone before him in the chain of the oral or written tradition of the report, accidentally changed the very similar Greek words for \"bigger than\" (\"meson\") and \"between\" (\"mezon\") \u2013 {{cite book|last=Luce|first=J.V.|title=The End of Atlantis \u2013 New Light on an Old Legend|year=1969|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=224}}</ref> but it was later sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean. Plato asserted that the Egyptians described Atlantis as an island consisting mostly of mountains in the northern portions and along the shore and encompassing a great plain in an oblong shape in the south \"extending in one direction three thousand ''[[Stadia (length)|stadia]]'' [about 555&nbsp;km; 345&nbsp;mi], but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia [about 370&nbsp;km; 230&nbsp;mi].\" Fifty stadia [9&nbsp;km; 6&nbsp;mi] from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides&nbsp;... broke it off all round about&nbsp;... the central island itself was five stades in diameter [about 0.92&nbsp;km; 0.57&nbsp;mi].\n\nIn Plato's metaphorical tale, Poseidon fell in love with Cleito, the daughter of [[Evenor]] and Leucippe, who bore him five pairs of male twins. The eldest of these, [[Atlas of Atlantis|Atlas]], was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (called the Atlantic Ocean in his honor), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his [[fiefdom]]. Atlas's twin Gadeirus, or Eumelus in Greek, was given the extremity of the island toward the pillars of Hercules.<ref>The name is a back-formation from ''Gades'', the Greek name for [[Cadiz]].</ref> The other four pairs of twins\u2014Ampheres and Evaemon, [[Mneseus]] and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor, and Azaes and Diaprepes\u2014were also given \"rule over many men, and a large territory.\"\n\nPoseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular [[moat]]s of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each ring of the city. The walls were constructed of red, white, and black rock, quarried from the moats, and were covered with [[brass]], [[tin]], and the precious metal [[orichalcum]], respectively.\n\nAccording to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and those who dwelt within them. The Atlanteans had conquered the parts of Libya within the Pillars of Hercules, as far as Egypt, and the European continent as far as [[Tyrrhenia]], and had subjected its people to slavery. The Athenians led an alliance of resistors against the Atlantean empire, and as the alliance disintegrated, prevailed alone against the empire, liberating the occupied lands.\n\n{{quote|But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea.

Some have understood Ammianus's testimony as a claim that at the time of Atlantis's sinking into the sea, its inhabitants fled to western Europe; but Ammianus, in fact, says that \"the Drasidae (Druids) recall that a part of the population is indigenous but others also migrated in from islands and lands beyond the [[Rhine]]\" (''Res Gestae'' 15.9), an indication that the immigrants came to Gaul from the north (Britain, the Netherlands, or Germany), not from a theorized location in the Atlantic Ocean to the south-west.<ref>Fitzpatrick-Matthews, Keith.

The [[Europeans]] believed the [[indigenous people]] to be inferior and incapable of building that which was now in ruins and by sharing a common history, they insinuate that another race must have been responsible.\n\nIn the middle and late nineteenth century, several renowned [[Mesoamerica]]n scholars, starting with [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]], and including [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] and [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], formally proposed that Atlantis was somehow related to Mayan and [[Aztec]] culture.\n\nThe French scholar Brasseur de Bourbourg traveled extensively through Mesoamerica in the mid-1800s, and was renowned for his translations of [[Mayan languages|Mayan]] texts, most notably the sacred book [[Popol Vuh]], as well as a comprehensive history of the region. Soon after these publications, however, Brasseur de Bourbourg lost his academic credibility, due to his claim that the [[Maya peoples]] had descended from the [[Toltecs]], people he believed were the surviving population of the racially superior civilization of Atlantis.<ref>{{cite book |author=Evans, R.

She maintained that the Atlanteans were cultural heroes (contrary to [[Plato]], who describes them mainly as a military threat). She believed in a form of racial [[evolution]] (as opposed to primate evolution), in which the Atlanteans were the fourth \"[[Root Race]]\", succeeded by the fifth and most superior \"[[Aryan race]]\" (the modern human race).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The [[Theosophists]] believed that the civilization of Atlantis reached its peak between 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago, but destroyed itself through internal [[warfare]] brought about by the dangerous use of [[psychic]] and [[supernatural]] powers of the inhabitants. [[Rudolf Steiner]], the founder of [[anthroposophy]] and [[Waldorf Schools]], along with other well known Theosophists, such as [[Annie Besant]], also wrote of [[cultural]] evolution in much the same vein.\n\nSome subsequent occultists have followed Blavatsky, at least to the point of tracing the lineage of occult practices back to Atlantis.

Writing only a few decades after the ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias'', the historian [[Theopompus]] of [[Chios]] wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as [[Meropis]]. This description was included in Book 8 of his ''Philippica'', which contains a dialogue between [[Silenus]] and King [[Midas]]. Silenus describes the Meropids, a race of men who grow to twice normal size, and inhabit two cities on the island of Meropis: ''Eusebes'' ({{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f50\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03ae\u03c2}}, \"Pious-town\") and ''Machimos'' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Fighting-town\"). He also reports that an army of ten million soldiers crossed the ocean to conquer [[Hyperborea]], but abandoned this proposal when they realized that the Hyperboreans were the luckiest people on earth. Heinz-G\u00fcnther Nesselrath has argued that these and other details of Silenus' story are meant as imitation and exaggeration of the Atlantis story, by parody, for the purpose of exposing Plato's ideas to ridicule.<ref>[[Heinz-G\u00fcnther Nesselrath|Nesselrath, HG]] (1998).

Thomas Heyrick (1649-1694) followed him with \"The New Atlantis\" (1687), a satirical poem in three parts. His new continent of uncertain location, perhaps even a floating island either in the sea or the sky, serves as background for his exposure of what he described in a second edition as \"A True Character of Popery and Jesuitism\".<ref>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A43565.0001.001?view=toc University of Michigan]</ref>\n\nThe title of ''[[The New Atalantis]]'' by [[Delarivier Manley]] (1709), distinguished from the two others by the single letter, is an equally dystopian work but set this time on a fictional Mediterranean island.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/secretmemoirsman00manl#page/n5/mode/2up Archived online]</ref> In it sexual violence and exploitation is made a metaphor for the hypocritical behaviour of politicians in their dealings with the general public.<ref>Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, So\u0148a, [http://www.phil.muni.cz/angl/thepes/thepes_02_17.pdf pp.121-6 \"Sex and Politics: Delarivier Manley's New Atalantis\"]</ref> In Manley's case, the target of satire was the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]], while in David Maclean Parry's ''[[The Scarlet Empire]]'' (1906) it is [[Socialism]] as practised in foundered Atlantis.<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=dul1.ark:/13960/t3vt2bh65;view=1up;seq=7 Online edition]</ref> It was followed in Russia by [[Velemir Khlebnikov]]'s poem ''The Fall of Atlantis'' (''Gibel' Atlantidy'', 1912), which is set in a future rationalist dystopia that has discovered the secret of immortality and is so dedicated to progress that it has lost touch with the past.

Its three parts consist of a verse narrative of the life and training of an Atlantean wise one, followed by his Utopian moral teachings and then a psychic drama set in modern times in which a reincarnated child embodying the lost wisdom is reborn on earth.<ref>Archived [https://archive.org/stream/ancientatlantis00mansgoog#page/n15/mode/2up online]</ref>\n\nIn [[Hispanic]] eyes, Atlantis had a more intimate interpretation. The land had been a colonial power which, although it had brought civilization to ancient Europe, had also enslaved its peoples. Its tyrannical fall from grace had contributed to the fate that had overtaken it, but now its disappearance had unbalanced the world. This was the point of view of [[Jacint Verdaguer]]'s vast mythological epic ''L'Atlantida'' (1877).  After the sinking of the former continent, Hercules travels east across the Atlantic to found the city of [[Barcelona]] and then departs westward again to the [[Hesperides]]. The story is told by a hermit to a shipwrecked mariner, who is inspired to follow in his tracks and so \"call the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old\". This mariner, of course, was [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref>Robert Hughes, ''Barcelona'', London 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJd9esHdz5YC&pg=PA341&lpg=PA341&dq=Atlantida+%22poem%22#v=onepage&q=Atlantida%20%22poem%22 pp.341-3]</ref>\n \nVerdaguer's poem was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], but was widely translated in both Europe and Hispano-America.<ref>Isidor C\u00f2nsul, [http://www.visat.cat/traduccions-literatura-catalana/eng/ressenyes/85/122/0/3/poesia/jacint-verdaguer.html \"The translations of Verdaguer]</ref> One response was the similarly entitled Argentinian ''Atlantida'' of [[Olegario Victor Andrade]] (1881), which sees in \"Enchanted Atlantis that Plato foresaw, a golden promise to the fruitful race\" of Latins.<ref>''Obras Poeticas'', [https://archive.org/stream/3202277#page/151/mode/2up/search/atlantida pp.151-166]; there is a translation of canto 8 by [http://www.poetrynook.com/poem/atl%E2%94%9C%C3%ADntida Elijah Clarence Hills]</ref> The bad example of the colonising world remains, however.

In the poem a female figure rising from the sea against a background of Classical palaces is recognised as a priestess of Atlantis. The poet recalls \"that the Faroes lie there in the north Atlantic Ocean/ where before lay the poet-dreamt lands,\" but also that in Norse belief, such a figure only appears to those about to drown.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Joensen |first=Leyvoy |title=Atlantis, B\u00e1bylon, T\u00f3rshavn: The Djurhuus Brothers and William Heinesen in Faroese Literary History |journal=Scandinavian Studies |volume=74 |issue=2 |year=2002 |jstor=40920372 |pages=181\u2013204 [esp. 192\u20134] }}</ref>\n\n===A land lost in the distance===\n[[File:Faroe stamp 493 Djurhuus poems - atlantis.jpg|thumb|A Faroe Islands postage stamp honoring [[Janus Djurhuus]]' \"Atlantis\" ]]\n\nThe fact that Atlantis is a lost land has made of it a metaphor for something no longer attainable.

[[Charles Bewley]] in his [[Newdigate Prize]] poem (1910) thinks it grows from dissatisfaction with one's condition, \n::And, because life is partly sweet \n::And ever girt about with pain, \n::We take the sweetness, and are fain \n::To set it free from grief's alloy\nin a dream of Atlantis.<ref>Google Books [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/charles-bewley/atlantis-the-newdigate-prize-poem-1910-lwe/1-atlantis-the-newdigate-prize-poem-1910-lwe.shtml p.11]</ref> Similarly for the Australian [[Gary Catalano]] in a 1982 prose poem, it is \"a vision that sank under the weight of its own perfection\".<ref>Gary Catalano, Heaven of Rags, Sydney 1982, [http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/catalano-gary/atlantis-0359028 Australian Poetry Library]</ref> [[W.

Two of them report the disaster that overtook the continent as related by long-lived survivors. In [[Frederick Tennyson]]'s ''Atlantis'' (1888) an ancient Greek mariner sails west and discovers an inhabited island, which is all that remains of the former kingdom. He learns of its end and views the shattered remnant of its former glory, from which a few had escaped to set up the Mediterranean civilisations.<ref>In two parts at Black Cat Poems; [http://www.blackcatpoems.com/t/atlantis_part_i.html part 1] and [http://www.blackcatpoems.com/t/atlantis_part_ii.html part 2]</ref> In the second, ''Mona, Queen of Lost Atlantis: An Idyllic Re-embodiment of Long Forgotten History'' (Los Angeles CA 1925) by James Logue Dryden (1840-1925), the story is told in a series of visions. A Seer is taken to Mona's burial chamber in the ruins of Atlantis, where she revives and describes the catastrophe. There follows a survey of the lost civilisations of Hyperborea and Lemuria as well as Atlantis, accompanied by much spiritualist lore.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ3eIcpA4coC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Google Books]</ref>\n\nWilliam Walton Hoskins (1856-1919) admits to the readers of his ''Atlantis and other poems'' (Cleveland OH, 1881), that he is only 24.

It is a mountain-top view of a rocky bay breached by the sea, which is washing inland about the tall structures of an ancient city. A streak of lightning crosses the upper half of the painting, while below it rises the impassive figure of an enigmatic goddess who holds a blue dove between her breasts.

For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over many other islands also and parts of the continent.<ref>{{citeplato|Timaeus|24e\u201325a}}, [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.

In his works Plato makes extensive use of the [[Socratic method]] in order to discuss contrary positions within the context of a supposition.\n\nThe ''Timaeus'' begins with an introduction, followed by an account of the creations and structure of the universe and ancient civilizations. In the introduction, Socrates muses about the perfect society, described in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c. 380 BC), and wonders if he and his guests might recollect a story which exemplifies such a society. Critias mentions a tale he considered to be historical, that would make the perfect example, and he then follows by describing Atlantis as is recorded in the ''Critias''. In his account, ancient Athens seems to represent the \"perfect society\" and Atlantis its opponent, representing the very antithesis of the \"perfect\" traits described in the ''Republic''.\n\n===''Critias''===\n{{main|Critias (dialogue)}}\n\nAccording to Critias, the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] deities of old divided the land so that each deity might have their own lot; [[Poseidon]] was appropriately, and to his liking, bequeathed the island of Atlantis. The island was larger than [[Ancient Libya]] and [[Asia Minor]] combined,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9010107/Atlantis |title=Atlantis\u2014Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com}}</ref><ref>Also it has been interpreted that Plato or someone before him in the chain of the oral or written tradition of the report, accidentally changed the very similar Greek words for \"bigger than\" (\"meson\") and \"between\" (\"mezon\") \u2013 {{cite book|last=Luce|first=J.V.|title=The End of Atlantis \u2013 New Light on an Old Legend|year=1969|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|page=224}}</ref> but it was later sunk by an earthquake and became an impassable mud shoal, inhibiting travel to any part of the ocean. Plato asserted that the Egyptians described Atlantis as an island consisting mostly of mountains in the northern portions and along the shore and encompassing a great plain in an oblong shape in the south \"extending in one direction three thousand ''[[Stadia (length)|stadia]]'' [about 555&nbsp;km; 345&nbsp;mi], but across the center inland it was two thousand stadia [about 370&nbsp;km; 230&nbsp;mi].\" Fifty stadia [9&nbsp;km; 6&nbsp;mi] from the coast was a mountain that was low on all sides&nbsp;... broke it off all round about&nbsp;... the central island itself was five stades in diameter [about 0.92&nbsp;km; 0.57&nbsp;mi].\n\nIn Plato's metaphorical tale, Poseidon fell in love with Cleito, the daughter of [[Evenor]] and Leucippe, who bore him five pairs of male twins. The eldest of these, [[Atlas of Atlantis|Atlas]], was made rightful king of the entire island and the ocean (called the Atlantic Ocean in his honor), and was given the mountain of his birth and the surrounding area as his [[fiefdom]]. Atlas's twin Gadeirus, or Eumelus in Greek, was given the extremity of the island toward the pillars of Hercules.<ref>The name is a back-formation from ''Gades'', the Greek name for [[Cadiz]].</ref> The other four pairs of twins\u2014Ampheres and Evaemon, [[Mneseus]] and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor, and Azaes and Diaprepes\u2014were also given \"rule over many men, and a large territory.\"\n\nPoseidon carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular [[moat]]s of increasing width, varying from one to three stadia and separated by rings of land proportional in size. The Atlanteans then built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island. They dug a great canal to the sea, and alongside the bridges carved tunnels into the rings of rock so that ships could pass into the city around the mountain; they carved docks from the rock walls of the moats. Every passage to the city was guarded by gates and towers, and a wall surrounded each ring of the city. The walls were constructed of red, white, and black rock, quarried from the moats, and were covered with [[brass]], [[tin]], and the precious metal [[orichalcum]], respectively.\n\nAccording to Critias, 9,000 years before his lifetime a war took place between those outside the Pillars of Hercules at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and those who dwelt within them.

The mountains stood at either side of the southernmost gulf in Greece, the largest in the [[Peloponnese]], and that gulf opens onto the Mediterranean Sea. If from the beginning of discussions, misinterpretation of Gibraltar as the location rather than being at the Gulf of Laconia, would lend itself to many erroneous concepts regarding the location of Atlantis. Plato may have not been aware of the difference. The Laconian pillars open to the south toward Crete and beyond which is Egypt. The [[Thera eruption]] and the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] affected that area and might have been the devastation to which the sources used by Plato referred. Significant events such as these would have been likely material for tales passed from one generation to another for almost a thousand years.\n\n===In the Atlantic Ocean===\nThe location of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean has a certain appeal given the closely related names.

Writing only a few decades after the ''Timaeus'' and ''Critias'', the historian [[Theopompus]] of [[Chios]] wrote of a land beyond the ocean known as [[Meropis]]. This description was included in Book 8 of his ''Philippica'', which contains a dialogue between [[Silenus]] and King [[Midas]]. Silenus describes the Meropids, a race of men who grow to twice normal size, and inhabit two cities on the island of Meropis: ''Eusebes'' ({{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f50\u03c3\u03b5\u03b2\u03ae\u03c2}}, \"Pious-town\") and ''Machimos'' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Fighting-town\").

Thomas Heyrick (1649-1694) followed him with \"The New Atlantis\" (1687), a satirical poem in three parts. His new continent of uncertain location, perhaps even a floating island either in the sea or the sky, serves as background for his exposure of what he described in a second edition as \"A True Character of Popery and Jesuitism\".<ref>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A43565.0001.001?view=toc University of Michigan]</ref>\n\nThe title of ''[[The New Atalantis]]'' by [[Delarivier Manley]] (1709), distinguished from the two others by the single letter, is an equally dystopian work but set this time on a fictional Mediterranean island.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/secretmemoirsman00manl#page/n5/mode/2up Archived online]</ref> In it sexual violence and exploitation is made a metaphor for the hypocritical behaviour of politicians in their dealings with the general public.<ref>Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, So\u0148a, [http://www.phil.muni.cz/angl/thepes/thepes_02_17.pdf pp.121-6 \"Sex and Politics: Delarivier Manley's New Atalantis\"]</ref> In Manley's case, the target of satire was the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]], while in David Maclean Parry's ''[[The Scarlet Empire]]'' (1906) it is [[Socialism]] as practised in foundered Atlantis.<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=dul1.ark:/13960/t3vt2bh65;view=1up;seq=7 Online edition]</ref> It was followed in Russia by [[Velemir Khlebnikov]]'s poem ''The Fall of Atlantis'' (''Gibel' Atlantidy'', 1912), which is set in a future rationalist dystopia that has discovered the secret of immortality and is so dedicated to progress that it has lost touch with the past. When the high priest of this ideology is tempted by a slave girl into an act of irrationality, he murders her and precipitates a second flood, above which her severed head floats vengefully among the stars.<ref>Boris Thomson, ''Lot's Wife and the Venus of Milo: Conflicting Attitudes to the Cultural Heritage in Modern Russia'', Cambridge University 1978, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y3UTbrInnAoC&pg=PA77 pp.77\u20138]</ref>\n\nA slightly later work, ''The Ancient of Atlantis'' (Boston, 1915) by Albert Armstrong Manship, expounds the Atlantean wisdom that is to redeem the earth. Its three parts consist of a verse narrative of the life and training of an Atlantean wise one, followed by his Utopian moral teachings and then a psychic drama set in modern times in which a reincarnated child embodying the lost wisdom is reborn on earth.<ref>Archived [https://archive.org/stream/ancientatlantis00mansgoog#page/n15/mode/2up online]</ref>\n\nIn [[Hispanic]] eyes, Atlantis had a more intimate interpretation. The land had been a colonial power which, although it had brought civilization to ancient Europe, had also enslaved its peoples. Its tyrannical fall from grace had contributed to the fate that had overtaken it, but now its disappearance had unbalanced the world. This was the point of view of [[Jacint Verdaguer]]'s vast mythological epic ''L'Atlantida'' (1877).  After the sinking of the former continent, Hercules travels east across the Atlantic to found the city of [[Barcelona]] and then departs westward again to the [[Hesperides]]. The story is told by a hermit to a shipwrecked mariner, who is inspired to follow in his tracks and so \"call the New World into existence to redress the balance of the Old\". This mariner, of course, was [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref>Robert Hughes, ''Barcelona'', London 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HJd9esHdz5YC&pg=PA341&lpg=PA341&dq=Atlantida+%22poem%22#v=onepage&q=Atlantida%20%22poem%22 pp.341-3]</ref>\n \nVerdaguer's poem was written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], but was widely translated in both Europe and Hispano-America.<ref>Isidor C\u00f2nsul, [http://www.visat.cat/traduccions-literatura-catalana/eng/ressenyes/85/122/0/3/poesia/jacint-verdaguer.html \"The translations of Verdaguer]</ref> One response was the similarly entitled Argentinian ''Atlantida'' of [[Olegario Victor Andrade]] (1881), which sees in \"Enchanted Atlantis that Plato foresaw, a golden promise to the fruitful race\" of Latins.<ref>''Obras Poeticas'', [https://archive.org/stream/3202277#page/151/mode/2up/search/atlantida pp.151-166]; there is a translation of canto 8 by [http://www.poetrynook.com/poem/atl%E2%94%9C%C3%ADntida Elijah Clarence Hills]</ref> The bad example of the colonising world remains, however. [[Jose Juan Tablada]] characterises its threat in his \"De Atl\u00e1ntida\" (1894) through the beguiling picture of the lost world populated by the underwater creatures of Classical myth, among whom is the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]] of its final stanza with \n::her eye on the keel of the wandering vessel \n::that in passing deflowers the sea's smooth mirror,\n::launching into the night her amorous warbling\n::and the dulcet lullaby of her treacherous voice!<ref>Latin American Anthology, [http://homepage.univie.ac.at/friedrich.frosch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/anthologie-poes%C3%ADa-latinoamericana-siglo-XX.pdf p.1]</ref>\n   \nThere is a similar ambivalence in [[Janus Djurhuus]]' six-stanza \"Atlantis\" (1917), where a celebration of the [[Faroese language conflict|Faroese linguistic revival]] grants it an ancient pedigree by linking Greek to Norse legend. In the poem a female figure rising from the sea against a background of Classical palaces is recognised as a priestess of Atlantis. The poet recalls \"that the Faroes lie there in the north Atlantic Ocean/ where before lay the poet-dreamt lands,\" but also that in Norse belief, such a figure only appears to those about to drown.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Joensen |first=Leyvoy |title=Atlantis, B\u00e1bylon, T\u00f3rshavn: The Djurhuus Brothers and William Heinesen in Faroese Literary History |journal=Scandinavian Studies |volume=74 |issue=2 |year=2002 |jstor=40920372 |pages=181\u2013204 [esp. 192\u20134] }}</ref>\n\n===A land lost in the distance===\n[[File:Faroe stamp 493 Djurhuus poems - atlantis.jpg|thumb|A Faroe Islands postage stamp honoring [[Janus Djurhuus]]' \"Atlantis\" ]]\n\nThe fact that Atlantis is a lost land has made of it a metaphor for something no longer attainable. For the American poet Edith Willis Linn Forbes (1865-1945), \"The Lost Atlantis\" stands for idealisation of the past; the present moment can only be treasured once that is realised.<ref>[http://www.blackcatpoems.com/f/the_lost_atlantis.html Black Cat poems]</ref> [[Ella Wheeler Wilcox]] finds the location of \"The Lost Land\" (1910) in one's carefree youthful past.<ref>[http://www.litscape.com/author/Ella_Wheeler_Wilcox/The_Lost_Land.html  Litscape]</ref> Similarly, for the Irish poet [[Eavan Boland]] in \"Atlantis, a lost sonnet\" (2007), the idea was defined when \"the old fable-makers searched hard for a word/ to convey that what is gone is gone forever\".<ref>[https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/atlantis%E2%80%94-lost-sonnet Poets.org]</ref>\n\nFor some male poets too, the idea of Atlantis is constructed from what cannot be obtained. [[Charles Bewley]] in his [[Newdigate Prize]] poem (1910) thinks it grows from dissatisfaction with one's condition, \n::And, because life is partly sweet \n::And ever girt about with pain, \n::We take the sweetness, and are fain \n::To set it free from grief's alloy\nin a dream of Atlantis.<ref>Google Books [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/charles-bewley/atlantis-the-newdigate-prize-poem-1910-lwe/1-atlantis-the-newdigate-prize-poem-1910-lwe.shtml p.11]</ref> Similarly for the Australian [[Gary Catalano]] in a 1982 prose poem, it is \"a vision that sank under the weight of its own perfection\".<ref>Gary Catalano, Heaven of Rags, Sydney 1982, [http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/catalano-gary/atlantis-0359028 Australian Poetry Library]</ref> [[W.

Two of them report the disaster that overtook the continent as related by long-lived survivors. In [[Frederick Tennyson]]'s ''Atlantis'' (1888) an ancient Greek mariner sails west and discovers an inhabited island, which is all that remains of the former kingdom. He learns of its end and views the shattered remnant of its former glory, from which a few had escaped to set up the Mediterranean civilisations.<ref>In two parts at Black Cat Poems; [http://www.blackcatpoems.com/t/atlantis_part_i.html part 1] and [http://www.blackcatpoems.com/t/atlantis_part_ii.html part 2]</ref> In the second, ''Mona, Queen of Lost Atlantis: An Idyllic Re-embodiment of Long Forgotten History'' (Los Angeles CA 1925) by James Logue Dryden (1840-1925), the story is told in a series of visions. A Seer is taken to Mona's burial chamber in the ruins of Atlantis, where she revives and describes the catastrophe. There follows a survey of the lost civilisations of Hyperborea and Lemuria as well as Atlantis, accompanied by much spiritualist lore.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AZ3eIcpA4coC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Google Books]</ref>\n\nWilliam Walton Hoskins (1856-1919) admits to the readers of his ''Atlantis and other poems'' (Cleveland OH, 1881), that he is only 24. Its melodramatic plot concerns the poisoning of the descendant of god-born kings.

It is a mountain-top view of a rocky bay breached by the sea, which is washing inland about the tall structures of an ancient city. A streak of lightning crosses the upper half of the painting, while below it rises the impassive figure of an enigmatic goddess who holds a blue dove between her breasts. [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] identified the subject as Atlantis in a public lecture on the painting given in 1909, the year it was first exhibited, and he has been followed by other commentators in the years since.<ref>{{cite document |first=Pamela |last=Davidson |title=Cultural Memory and Survival: The Russian Renaissance of Classical Antiquity in the Twentieth Century |series=Studies in Russia and Eastern Europe |volume=6 |publisher=School of Slavonic and East European Studies, UCL |location=London, UK |year=2009 |url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/69111 |pages=5\u201315 }}</ref>\n\nSculptures referencing Atlantis have often been stylized single figures.
