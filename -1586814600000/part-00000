Based in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]] and later in [[DeSoto, Texas]], the Sky Ryders was a member corps of [[Drum Corps International]] and a six time DCI World Championship Finalist.<ref name=\"sky\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Sky Ryders History]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe organization was first established as a junior corps in 1952 called the Lysle Rishel Post 68 Drum & Bugle Corps and led by director Ken Fairbrother, a former member of the Hawthorne Caballeros. In 1955, under the direction of H.D. \"Prof\" McCosh, the corps was reorganized and adopted the name Sky Ryders.  In 1957, they began winning competitions in Kansas, and in 1959 they started competing in American Legion national competitions. They won their first [[American Legion]] Kansas state Championship in 1959, repeated in 1960-62, and won another in 1964. In 1959, the corps also attended its first American Legion National championship, placing tenth of 24 junior corps. This was followed by American Legion Nationals finishes of 6th, 5th, and 4th the following three seasons and 3rd in 1964.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\">{{cite book | title=A History of Drum & Bugle Corps | volume=Vol. 2 | first=Steve | last=Vickers | publisher=Drum Corps World | date=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe corps experienced financial and membership issues in 1966, taking the season off after nearly disbanding. When it returned in 1967, it was largely with members of their feeder corps, the Jets, and with girls allowed into the brass and percussion sections rather than being restricted to the color guard.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1969, brass instructor John Simpson recruited Larry Kerchner to collaborate on the corps' music. The corps had a successful year, again winning the Kansas American Legion title and placing 7th at the American Legion Nationals in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1967 through 1971, the corps mostly confined its travel to Kansas and the surrounding states. At around that same time, the Sky Ryders were one of the first corps to make the switch from French horns to mellophones for mid-range voices.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1972, the Sky Ryders traveled to [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]] for the inaugural Drum Corps International World Championship, placing 20th of the 39 corps from across the USA and Canada. The corps would not return to the DCI Championships until competing as a Class A corps at [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Denver]] in 1977, where they finished in 3rd place. Up until that time, the Sky Ryders had always been a hometown corps, drawing its members exclusively from the Hutchinson area, but in 1977, the corps began to recruit from a wider area.  In 1978, the corps switched from Class A to Open Class and had increasing success, placing 31st in Denver that year and to 22nd  and 17th in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] the next two years. During that time, corps director George Tuthill and brass instructor John Simpson attracted many members from Oklahoma and Texas, and Kerchner's unique and melodic arrangements were popular with fans and judges.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Tuthill set out to get the Sky Ryders into DCI's elite Top 12. In 1981, they placed 14th in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] at the first DCI Championships held outside the United States. In 1982, Tuthill's goal was accomplished with a 10th-place finish in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The corps' huge rainbow flag, unfolded behind the corps during their show and displayed in the stands afterwards, and their closing number of \"Over the Rainbow\" quickly became Sky Ryders traditions.  In 1983, the Sky Ryders received particular attention performing Kerchner's Grammy-nominated jazz arrangement of \"Home on the Range,\" and for the second year in a row, the corps placed in DCI's Top 12 with a 12th-place finish in [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nThe corps dropped out of DCI Finals in 1984, placing 17th in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1985, the corps had a stronger year with a 15th-place finish at [[Camp Randall Stadium]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], performing the first of two successive productions of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Starting in 1986, under the direction of alumnus Dale Antoine and a design team led by Tommy Keenum, the Sky Ryders returned to DCI's Top 12. Over the next three years, they entertained audiences with dramatized productions of the popular musicals \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"West Side Story,\" and \"The Sound of Music\" and gained a reputation as \"The Great Story Tellers.\" Their \"Wizard of Oz\" show in 1986 included elements such as a Wicked Witch riding a bicycle, gold lam\u00e9 \"yellow brick road\" flags, and colorful guard costumes for the various characters in the film. They finished the year with the corps' highest placement of 9th in Madison.1987's \"West Side Story\" placed 12th as did 1988's \"The Sound of Music\", with both of those programs also containing costuming and actions that helped to tell the story.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nAfter achieving popularity, the corps suddenly switched directions in 1989 with cadet-style uniforms and a more darkly themed show, including \"March (from Symphonic Metamorphosis)\" and selections from \"Carmina Burana.\" The corps finished the season out of DCI Finals with a Semifinals tie for 14th place. The stylistic change and the fall from Finals were elements in the  financial difficulties the corps faced in 1990. From its roots as a hometown corps, the Sky Ryders had evolved into a corps with mostly out-of-state members, with the bulk of those members coming from Texas, so, in order to survive, the corps' leadership relocated the organization to [[De Soto, Texas]], a suburb of [[Dallas]].  After the challenges of the move to Texas, the corps finished the 1990 season in 19th place during DCI Semifinals in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1991, the Sky Ryders once again regained DCI Top 12 status with a return to the corps' tradition of popular musicals, this time with Lerner and Loewe's \"Camelot.\" The corps placed 12th in DCI Finals held in their new hometown of Dallas. The corps performed another popular Lerner and Loewe musical in 1992 with the Scottish-themed \"Brigadoon,\" but during DCI's 20th Anniversary Championships in Madison, the corps only placed 15th in Semifinals.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1993, the Sky Ryders once more abandoned their successful formula for a \"more contemporary show\", including \"Connotations\" by Edward Gregson and \"Symphony No. 2\" by David Diamond, and the corps finished their last full season of competition with a placement of 20th in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. Despite plans for a 1994 season, the corps' continuing financial difficulties resulted in bankruptcy and the disbanding of the corps. Although the corps had departed the scene, the efforts of the unit's director during its Texas tenure, Paul Proctor, saw that all of the corps' substantial debt was eventually paid off.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\n== Show summary (1960\u20131993)==\nThe following is a list of Sky Ryders shows from 1960 to 1993.<ref name=\"songhistory\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpsdet&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Song History for Sky Ryders]</ref>\n\n''Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist.''\n\n{|border = \"1\" style = \"text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse; width:100%\"\n|-\n!

Based in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]] and later in [[DeSoto, Texas]], the Sky Ryders was a member corps of [[Drum Corps International]] and a six time DCI World Championship Finalist.<ref name=\"sky\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpshist&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Sky Ryders History]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe organization was first established as a junior corps in 1952 called the Lysle Rishel Post 68 Drum & Bugle Corps and led by director Ken Fairbrother, a former member of the Hawthorne Caballeros. In 1955, under the direction of H.D. \"Prof\" McCosh, the corps was reorganized and adopted the name Sky Ryders.  In 1957, they began winning competitions in Kansas, and in 1959 they started competing in American Legion national competitions. They won their first [[American Legion]] Kansas state Championship in 1959, repeated in 1960-62, and won another in 1964. In 1959, the corps also attended its first American Legion National championship, placing tenth of 24 junior corps. This was followed by American Legion Nationals finishes of 6th, 5th, and 4th the following three seasons and 3rd in 1964.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\">{{cite book | title=A History of Drum & Bugle Corps | volume=Vol. 2 | first=Steve | last=Vickers | publisher=Drum Corps World | date=2003}}</ref>\n\nThe corps experienced financial and membership issues in 1966, taking the season off after nearly disbanding. When it returned in 1967, it was largely with members of their feeder corps, the Jets, and with girls allowed into the brass and percussion sections rather than being restricted to the color guard.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1969, brass instructor John Simpson recruited Larry Kerchner to collaborate on the corps' music. The corps had a successful year, again winning the Kansas American Legion title and placing 7th at the American Legion Nationals in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1967 through 1971, the corps mostly confined its travel to Kansas and the surrounding states. At around that same time, the Sky Ryders were one of the first corps to make the switch from French horns to mellophones for mid-range voices.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1972, the Sky Ryders traveled to [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]] for the inaugural Drum Corps International World Championship, placing 20th of the 39 corps from across the USA and Canada. The corps would not return to the DCI Championships until competing as a Class A corps at [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Denver]] in 1977, where they finished in 3rd place. Up until that time, the Sky Ryders had always been a hometown corps, drawing its members exclusively from the Hutchinson area, but in 1977, the corps began to recruit from a wider area.  In 1978, the corps switched from Class A to Open Class and had increasing success, placing 31st in Denver that year and to 22nd  and 17th in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] the next two years. During that time, corps director George Tuthill and brass instructor John Simpson attracted many members from Oklahoma and Texas, and Kerchner's unique and melodic arrangements were popular with fans and judges.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Tuthill set out to get the Sky Ryders into DCI's elite Top 12. In 1981, they placed 14th in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] at the first DCI Championships held outside the United States. In 1982, Tuthill's goal was accomplished with a 10th-place finish in Montreal's Olympic Stadium. The corps' huge rainbow flag, unfolded behind the corps during their show and displayed in the stands afterwards, and their closing number of \"Over the Rainbow\" quickly became Sky Ryders traditions.  In 1983, the Sky Ryders received particular attention performing Kerchner's Grammy-nominated jazz arrangement of \"Home on the Range,\" and for the second year in a row, the corps placed in DCI's Top 12 with a 12th-place finish in [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nThe corps dropped out of DCI Finals in 1984, placing 17th in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1985, the corps had a stronger year with a 15th-place finish at [[Camp Randall Stadium]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], performing the first of two successive productions of \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Starting in 1986, under the direction of alumnus Dale Antoine and a design team led by Tommy Keenum, the Sky Ryders returned to DCI's Top 12. Over the next three years, they entertained audiences with dramatized productions of the popular musicals \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"West Side Story,\" and \"The Sound of Music\" and gained a reputation as \"The Great Story Tellers.\" Their \"Wizard of Oz\" show in 1986 included elements such as a Wicked Witch riding a bicycle, gold lam\u00e9 \"yellow brick road\" flags, and colorful guard costumes for the various characters in the film. They finished the year with the corps' highest placement of 9th in Madison.1987's \"West Side Story\" placed 12th as did 1988's \"The Sound of Music\", with both of those programs also containing costuming and actions that helped to tell the story.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nAfter achieving popularity, the corps suddenly switched directions in 1989 with cadet-style uniforms and a more darkly themed show, including \"March (from Symphonic Metamorphosis)\" and selections from \"Carmina Burana.\" The corps finished the season out of DCI Finals with a Semifinals tie for 14th place. The stylistic change and the fall from Finals were elements in the  financial difficulties the corps faced in 1990. From its roots as a hometown corps, the Sky Ryders had evolved into a corps with mostly out-of-state members, with the bulk of those members coming from Texas, so, in order to survive, the corps' leadership relocated the organization to [[De Soto, Texas]], a suburb of [[Dallas]].  After the challenges of the move to Texas, the corps finished the 1990 season in 19th place during DCI Semifinals in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1991, the Sky Ryders once again regained DCI Top 12 status with a return to the corps' tradition of popular musicals, this time with Lerner and Loewe's \"Camelot.\" The corps placed 12th in DCI Finals held in their new hometown of Dallas. The corps performed another popular Lerner and Loewe musical in 1992 with the Scottish-themed \"Brigadoon,\" but during DCI's 20th Anniversary Championships in Madison, the corps only placed 15th in Semifinals.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\nIn 1993, the Sky Ryders once more abandoned their successful formula for a \"more contemporary show\", including \"Connotations\" by Edward Gregson and \"Symphony No. 2\" by David Diamond, and the corps finished their last full season of competition with a placement of 20th in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. Despite plans for a 1994 season, the corps' continuing financial difficulties resulted in bankruptcy and the disbanding of the corps. Although the corps had departed the scene, the efforts of the unit's director during its Texas tenure, Paul Proctor, saw that all of the corps' substantial debt was eventually paid off.<ref name=\"A History of Drum & Bugle Corps\"/>\n\n== Show summary (1960\u20131993)==\nThe following is a list of Sky Ryders shows from 1960 to 1993.<ref name=\"songhistory\">[http://corpsreps.com/corpsreps.cfm?view=corpsdet&corps=28&corpstype=Junior The Drum Corps Repertoire Database - Song History for Sky Ryders]</ref>\n\n''Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist.''\n\n{|border = \"1\" style = \"text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse; width:100%\"\n|-\n!

It was the capital of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. The ruins of the city are located in the [[Samaria]] mountains of the [[West Bank]], almost 10 km to the northwest of [[Nablus]].\n\n==History==\nIsraelite Shomron (lit. \"watch-tower\"; also written \"Shomeron\") was located in the heart of the mountains of [[Samaria]], a few miles northwest of [[Shechem]]. The ruins of the Israelite town, as well the ruins of towns built at this same location later in history, are all adjacent or within the modern [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]]. \n \nThe \"hill of Shomron\" is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. According to biblical tradition, [[Omri]], the king of the northern kingdom of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] (reigned c. 870s BC), purchased this hill from [[Shemer (biblical figure)|Shemer]] its owner for two [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of \"Shomron\", i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|16:24|KJV}}). As such it possessed many advantages. Omri resided here during the last six years of his reign.<!--these paragraphs read like plagiarism-->\n\nOmri is thought to have granted the Arameans the right to \"make streets in Samaria\" as a sign of submission ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:34|KJV}}). This probably meant permission was granted to the [[Aramean]] merchants to carry on their trade in the city. This would imply the existence of a considerable Aramean population.\n\n<blockquote>It was the only great city of Israel created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, \"Beth-Khumri\" (\"the house or palace of Omri\"). (Stanley) <!--who is Stanley--></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Biblical tradition, Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of [[Ahab]], Benhadad II came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:1\u201321|KJV}}). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:28\u201334|KJV}}), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than \"two little flocks of kids.\"\n\nBiblical tradition also holds that in the days of [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]], Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke off the siege, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famished inhabitants of the city were soon relieved from the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that \"a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of [[barley]] for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria\" ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|7:1\u201320|KJV}}).\n\nAccording to [[Josephus]], the ancient name of the site ''Shomron'' (Samaria) was changed to ''[[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]]'' by King [[Herod the Great]], in honor of [[Augustus Caesar]].<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D15%3Asection%3D292 15.8.5.]</ref> .\n\n===Assyrian invasion===\n[[File:SamariaHellenisticTower.JPG|right|thumb|[[Hellenistic]] tower from the inside.]]\nDuring the reign of the last king of the northern kingdom, [[Hoshea]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|10|KJV}}), the [[Assyria]]ns invaded in 722/721 BC. (initially under [[Shalmaneser V]] and finally under [[Sargon II]]) when they established complete control over the capital city and the remainder of the northern kingdom. The fragment of a stela with an Assyrian inscription attributed to Sargon II was found on the eastern slope of the acropolis testifying to their presence. In addition, according to inscriptions from Sargon's palace at [[Khorsabad]], the inhabitants of Samaria were deported to Assyria.\n\n{{quote|[the Samar]ians [who had agreed with a hostile king]. ...

The palace was excavated solely by the Harvard Expedition and recognized by them as the Palace of Omri (designated Building Period I). The Omride palace was located on an elevated 4 meter high rock-cut platform that isolated it from its immediate surroundings. While immediately below the palace, cut into the face of the bedrock platform, there are two rock-cut tomb chambers that have only recently been recognized and attributed to Omri and Ahab. West of the palace there are meager remains of other Building Period I buildings but much of the rock surface has been severely damaged by later buildings.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Israelite city, Building Period II===\n[[File:Palace in the Kingdom of Israel \u00b7 HHWII77.svg|left|200px|thumb|An artist's depiction of a royal palace in the Kingdom of Israel.]]\nThe Omride palace continued in use during the next building phase (designated Building Period II), but it was no longer isolated on an elevated platform. The acropolis area was extended in all direction by the addition of a massive perimeter wall built in the casemate style; the new enlarged rectangular acropolis measured c. 290&nbsp;ft. (90 m.) from north to south and at least c. 585&nbsp;ft. (180 m.) from west to east (that is a capacity of approximately 7,500 persons by current fire standards), and the surface was now raised to a uniform elevation by the addition of a massive fill. This phase (Building Period II) was traditionally attributed to Ahab due to the misallocation of Wall 161 that run parallel to the northern casemates and the identification of a large rock-cut pool near the northern casemate wall as the Biblical \"Pool of Samaria\"; the wall (Wall 161) is now recognized to belong to Building Period II and the \"pool\" is a rock-cut grape-treading area that originated in Building Period 0 and continued in a reduced form in Building Period I. Consequently, the onset of Building Period II can only be relatively fixed. There is neither a biblical anchor nor securely dated pottery to establish the chronological affiliation of Building Period II.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe Omride Palace was still in use and the royal tombs were still accessible (now via subterranean rooms) and there was an administrative building the [[Ostraca House]] (due to the 63 ostraca retrieved from the floor's make-up) built west of the palace on the newly extended acropolis. The ostraca provide a wealth of data concerning oil and wine supplies, and can possibly be attributed to the period of [[Jeroboam II]] c. 785\u2013749, thus providing a probable date for Building Period II. North of the palace a rich cache of Phoenician ivories were retrieved, these were mixed with later debris but it was presumed by the excavators that it was in this area that the \"Ivory House\" that [[Ahab]] built for [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]] 1 Kings 22:39 stood. North-east and below the acropolis a number of Iron Age tombs were found and their location probably delimits the area of the city in that direction. In essence only the acropolis was excavated down to the Iron Age but it is presumed by the excavators that the city extended down over the northern and southern slopes of the hill.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cities of the ancient Near East]]\n*[[Short chronology timeline]]\n*[[List of modern names for biblical place names]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Tappy, R.

It was the capital of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. The ruins of the city are located in the [[Samaria]] mountains of the [[West Bank]], almost 10 km to the northwest of [[Nablus]].\n\n==History==\nIsraelite Shomron (lit. \"watch-tower\"; also written \"Shomeron\") was located in the heart of the mountains of [[Samaria]], a few miles northwest of [[Shechem]]. The ruins of the Israelite town, as well the ruins of towns built at this same location later in history, are all adjacent or within the modern [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]]. \n \nThe \"hill of Shomron\" is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. According to biblical tradition, [[Omri]], the king of the northern kingdom of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] (reigned c. 870s BC), purchased this hill from [[Shemer (biblical figure)|Shemer]] its owner for two [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of \"Shomron\", i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of [[Tirzah (ancient city)|Tirzah]] ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|16:24|KJV}}). As such it possessed many advantages. Omri resided here during the last six years of his reign.<!--these paragraphs read like plagiarism-->\n\nOmri is thought to have granted the Arameans the right to \"make streets in Samaria\" as a sign of submission ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:34|KJV}}). This probably meant permission was granted to the [[Aramean]] merchants to carry on their trade in the city. This would imply the existence of a considerable Aramean population.\n\n<blockquote>It was the only great city of Israel created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, \"Beth-Khumri\" (\"the house or palace of Omri\"). (Stanley) <!--who is Stanley--></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Biblical tradition, Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of [[Ahab]], Benhadad II came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:1\u201321|KJV}}). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|20:28\u201334|KJV}}), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than \"two little flocks of kids.\"\n\nBiblical tradition also holds that in the days of [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]], Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke off the siege, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famished inhabitants of the city were soon relieved from the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that \"a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of [[barley]] for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria\" ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|7:1\u201320|KJV}}).\n\nAccording to [[Josephus]], the ancient name of the site ''Shomron'' (Samaria) was changed to ''[[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebaste]]'' by King [[Herod the Great]], in honor of [[Augustus Caesar]].<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D15%3Asection%3D292 15.8.5.]</ref> .\n\n===Assyrian invasion===\n[[File:SamariaHellenisticTower.JPG|right|thumb|[[Hellenistic]] tower from the inside.]]\nDuring the reign of the last king of the northern kingdom, [[Hoshea]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|10|KJV}}), the [[Assyria]]ns invaded in 722/721 BC. (initially under [[Shalmaneser V]] and finally under [[Sargon II]]) when they established complete control over the capital city and the remainder of the northern kingdom. The fragment of a stela with an Assyrian inscription attributed to Sargon II was found on the eastern slope of the acropolis testifying to their presence. In addition, according to inscriptions from Sargon's palace at [[Khorsabad]], the inhabitants of Samaria were deported to Assyria.\n\n{{quote|[the Samar]ians [who had agreed with a hostile king]. ...

West of the palace there are meager remains of other Building Period I buildings but much of the rock surface has been severely damaged by later buildings.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Israelite city, Building Period II===\n[[File:Palace in the Kingdom of Israel \u00b7 HHWII77.svg|left|200px|thumb|An artist's depiction of a royal palace in the Kingdom of Israel.]]\nThe Omride palace continued in use during the next building phase (designated Building Period II), but it was no longer isolated on an elevated platform. The acropolis area was extended in all direction by the addition of a massive perimeter wall built in the casemate style; the new enlarged rectangular acropolis measured c. 290&nbsp;ft. (90 m.) from north to south and at least c. 585&nbsp;ft. (180 m.) from west to east (that is a capacity of approximately 7,500 persons by current fire standards), and the surface was now raised to a uniform elevation by the addition of a massive fill. This phase (Building Period II) was traditionally attributed to Ahab due to the misallocation of Wall 161 that run parallel to the northern casemates and the identification of a large rock-cut pool near the northern casemate wall as the Biblical \"Pool of Samaria\"; the wall (Wall 161) is now recognized to belong to Building Period II and the \"pool\" is a rock-cut grape-treading area that originated in Building Period 0 and continued in a reduced form in Building Period I. Consequently, the onset of Building Period II can only be relatively fixed. There is neither a biblical anchor nor securely dated pottery to establish the chronological affiliation of Building Period II.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe Omride Palace was still in use and the royal tombs were still accessible (now via subterranean rooms) and there was an administrative building the [[Ostraca House]] (due to the 63 ostraca retrieved from the floor's make-up) built west of the palace on the newly extended acropolis. The ostraca provide a wealth of data concerning oil and wine supplies, and can possibly be attributed to the period of [[Jeroboam II]] c. 785\u2013749, thus providing a probable date for Building Period II. North of the palace a rich cache of Phoenician ivories were retrieved, these were mixed with later debris but it was presumed by the excavators that it was in this area that the \"Ivory House\" that [[Ahab]] built for [[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]] 1 Kings 22:39 stood. North-east and below the acropolis a number of Iron Age tombs were found and their location probably delimits the area of the city in that direction. In essence only the acropolis was excavated down to the Iron Age but it is presumed by the excavators that the city extended down over the northern and southern slopes of the hill.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cities of the ancient Near East]]\n*[[Short chronology timeline]]\n*[[List of modern names for biblical place names]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Tappy, R.

It was released by Pikachu Records on June 10, 1998, in [[Japan]] only. This collection consists of composer [[Shinji Miyazaki]]'s orchestrated arrangements of musical compositions from the first four Pok\u00e9mon games by composer [[Junichi Masuda]] and exclusive musical cues heard throughout the first series. These instrumental tracks are categorized as sixteen chapters included with the show's first opening theme song \"Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\" and second closing theme \"Poketto ni Fantaj\u012b\" (both are the TV-size edits). Each of the instrumental tracks are followed by a brief commentary featuring [[Ash Ketchum|Satoshi]]'s [[Pok\u00e9dex|Pok\u00e9mon Zukan]] voiced by its voice actor [[Shin-ichiro Miki]] explaining each composition's association with the story and at what point it plays. Included with the album is a hard bound picture book (the {{nihongo|''Meibamen Sh\u016b''|\u540d\u5834\u9762\u96c6|famous  (impressive) scene collection}}), stickers, and a merchandise catalogue.\n\n====Track list====\n{{Tracklist\n| extra_column    =  Performed by\n| title1          = Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\n| note1           = {{Nihongo2|\u3081\u3056\u305b\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc}} ''Aim to Be a Pokemon Master''\n| music1          = Hirokazu Tanaka\n| lyrics1         = Akihito Toda\n| extra1          = [[Rika Matsumoto]]\n| length1         = 2:43\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline        = Chapter.1 {{Nihongo|Pokemon!

It was released by Pikachu Records on June 10, 1998, in [[Japan]] only. This collection consists of composer [[Shinji Miyazaki]]'s orchestrated arrangements of musical compositions from the first four Pok\u00e9mon games by composer [[Junichi Masuda]] and exclusive musical cues heard throughout the first series. These instrumental tracks are categorized as sixteen chapters included with the show's first opening theme song \"Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\" and second closing theme \"Poketto ni Fantaj\u012b\" (both are the TV-size edits). Each of the instrumental tracks are followed by a brief commentary featuring [[Ash Ketchum|Satoshi]]'s [[Pok\u00e9dex|Pok\u00e9mon Zukan]] voiced by its voice actor [[Shin-ichiro Miki]] explaining each composition's association with the story and at what point it plays. Included with the album is a hard bound picture book (the {{nihongo|''Meibamen Sh\u016b''|\u540d\u5834\u9762\u96c6|famous  (impressive) scene collection}}), stickers, and a merchandise catalogue.\n\n====Track list====\n{{Tracklist\n| extra_column    =  Performed by\n| title1          = Mezase Pokemon Masut\u0101\n| note1           = {{Nihongo2|\u3081\u3056\u305b\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc}} ''Aim to Be a Pokemon Master''\n| music1          = Hirokazu Tanaka\n| lyrics1         = Akihito Toda\n| extra1          = [[Rika Matsumoto]]\n| length1         = 2:43\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline        = Chapter.1 {{Nihongo|Pokemon!

[[Valentina Monetta]] represented [[San Marino]] in 2012, 2013 and 2014, making her the first Sanmarinese singer to participate in three consecutive contests.

San Marino holds the honour of being the 50th country to participate at Eurovision, participating 5th in the first semi-final of the contest. Miodio failed to qualify for the final, receiving just 5 points in total and coming last. SMRTV had originally planned to compete at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009 contest]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], with the Sammarinese Minister of Culture announcing shortly after the 2008 contest that they had \"good hopes to return\".

This was only slightly improved upon in 2018 with [[Jessika Muscat|Jessika]] and [[Jenifer Brening]]'s second to last place finish with \"[[Who We Are (Jessika Muscat song)|Who We Are]]\". In [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]] San Marino sent Serhat again with the song \"[[Say Na Na Na]] \", finishing in 19th place with 77 points, giving San Marino its best result to date.

San Marino holds the honour of being the 50th country to participate at Eurovision, participating 5th in the first semi-final of the contest.

Between 2012 and 2014, San Marino sent [[Valentina Monetta]] to the contest on three consecutive occasions, which made her the first singer to participate in three consecutive contests since [[Udo J\u00fcrgens]], who competed in 1964, 1965 and 1966 for Austria. Her entries in [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] (\"[[The Social Network Song]]\") and [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]] (\"[[Crisalide (Vola)]]\") also failed to qualify San Marino to the final. However, in [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]], Monetta managed to bring San Marino to the final for the first time, where she placed 24th with the song \"[[Maybe (Valentina Monetta song)|Maybe]]\". In [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]], the nation once again failed to qualify to the final with the song \"[[Chain of Lights]]\" performed by [[Anita Simoncini]] and [[Michele Perniola]]. In [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]], San Marino failed to qualify with \"[[I Didn't Know]]\" sung by Turkish performer [[Serhat]]. [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 |2017]] marked Valentina Monetta's fourth time in the contest, however, her song \"[[Spirit in the Night]]\" (with [[Jimmie Wilson (singer)|Jimmie Wilson]]) placed last in the semi-final, tying San Marino's worst performance. This was only slightly improved upon in 2018 with [[Jessika Muscat|Jessika]] and [[Jenifer Brening]]'s second to last place finish with \"[[Who We Are (Jessika Muscat song)|Who We Are]]\". In [[San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019|2019]] San Marino sent Serhat again with the song \"[[Say Na Na Na]] \", finishing in 19th place with 77 points, giving San Marino its best result to date.

For 2020, San Marino used a national final-type process titled ''Digital Battle Eurovision''.

Later in 1218, a German army led by [[Oliver of Paderborn]], and a mixed army of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers led by [[William I, Count of Holland]] joined the crusade. In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] under [[Kaykaus I]] and attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.\n\nAfter occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards Cairo in July 1221. On the way, they laid siege to [[Aswan]] from the north side, but were turned back after they were trapped and their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat. Sultan [[al-Kamil]] ordered the destruction of the dam blocking the Nile River which lead to the flooding of the Crusader camp. They retreated to a nearby hilltop where they resisted to the point of starvation. The siege resulted in a great number of Crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army. Al-Kamil forced Europe to retreat from Damietta - and Egypt altogether - and to an eight-year peace agreement.\n\n==Preparations==\n[[Pope Innocent III]] had already planned since 1208 a crusade to recapture Jerusalem.

Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the [[papacy]], as the [[First Crusade]] should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the [[Fourth Crusade]], which had been taken over by the [[Venice|Venetians]]. Pope Innocent planned for the crusaders to meet at [[Brindisi]] in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an [[indulgence]], including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves.\n\n===Hungary and Germany===\n[[Oliver of Paderborn]] had preached the crusade in [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the [[Papacy]] (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent died in 1216 and was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius III]], who barred Frederick from participating, but organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. Andrew was estimated to have the largest royal army in the history of the crusades. (Stated strengths of 20,000 knights, 12,000 castle-garrisons and 200,000 foot soldiers were likely an exaggeration).<ref>Wolff, Robert L. and Hazard, H. W., ''A History of the Crusades: Volume Two, The Later Crusades 1187-1311'', The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison, 1977, pg. 389</ref>\n\n===Portugal===\nAccording to [[Oliver of Paderborn]], the ''[[Gesta crucignorum rhenanorum]] '' and ''[[De itinere frisonum]]'', many of the Crusaders from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and [[Friesland]] decided to go to the [[Holy Land]] by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there led by Counts [[William I of Holland]] and [[George of Weid]] they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"A Frisian Perspective on Crusading in Iberia as Part of the Sea Journey to the Holy Land 1217-1218\", ''Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History'' 15 (2019)</ref>\nAt their arrival in Portugal as during the second Crusade, the Bishop of Lisbon and other members of the Portuguese clergy attempted to persuade the crusaders to help them capture the [[Almohad]] controlled city of [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]]. The [[Frisians]] according to ''[[De itinere frisonum]],'' however, refused on account of [[Innocent III]]'s disqualification of the venture at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 62. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref> The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of the city in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]] with the help of the [[Military order (religious society)|military orders]] on October 1217, after they repel an attempt by the governors of [[Seville]], [[Badajoz]], and [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]] to relieve the besieged garrison. According to William of Holland in his letter to [[Pope Honorius III]] the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces. From there on the Crusading fleet continued on its journey to the Levant.<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 64. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\nPope Innocent had managed to secure Georgia's participation in the crusade. Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. However, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in two successive battles, most notably at the [[Battle of Khunan]] in 1222.  After the death of Georgian King [[George IV of Georgia|George IV Lasha]], his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] wrote to the Pope informing him that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promise to assist in the Crusade because its army had been destroyed by unknown savages. It has been speculated that the oddly passive behavior of the Crusaders in the later years was due to them waiting for the Georgian army to join the fray.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan. DaCapo Press (2015), 322-327.</ref>\n\nDecades after this Crusade, Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan would take a census of the Kingdom of Georgia to ascertain how many troops it could muster. According to contemporary sources, the kingdom was judged to be able to field nine tumens.<ref>M.F. Brosset, \"Historie de la Georgie,\" I (St. Petersburg, 1849), pp. 548-549.</ref> A tumen was nominally 10,000 men, but usually averaged 5,000 in reality.<ref>David Morgan, \"The Mongols,\" 1986, p. 72. Morgan expresses skepticism that a tumen actually consisted of 10,000 men and notes that most were 3,000 to 7,000 men.</ref> If Hulegu's census was accurate, then the kingdom of Georgia in the 13th century was capable of mustering 45,000 soldiers. Had a force this size joined the Fifth Crusade, it would have more than doubled the Crusaders' strength.\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Ondrej.jpg|thumb|left|180px|King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]]]\n\n===Holy Land===\nThe first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King [[Andrew II of Hungary]].<ref>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: ''Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (page 311)</ref> In July 1217, Andrew departed from [[Zagreb]], accompanied by [[Leopold VI of Austria]] and [[Otto I, Duke of Merania]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|\u00c9rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=133}} King Andrew's army was so large{{mdash}}at least 10,000 mounted soldiers and even much more \"uncountable\" infantrymen{{mdash}}that most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=147\u2013148}} They were transported by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. {{sfn|Richard|1999|p=297}} Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in [[Split, Croatia|Split]].

Muslim forces retreated in their fortresses and towns. In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city, if they did manage to reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and [[trebuchet]]s did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]].

They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this [[William I, Count of Holland]] left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.\n\nImmediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned. \n\nThen in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary [[Prester John]], was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards [[Cairo]].<ref>Christopher Eric Taylor, ''Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War'', 2011, University of Texas at Austin.</ref> This move was observed by the forces of al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta.\n\nBy now al-Kamil was able to ally with the other [[Ayyubid]]s in Syria, who had defeated [[Kaykaus I]]. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the river [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the [[True Cross]]. However, the relic was never returned as al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.\n\nThe failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \"foolishness\" of the wicked.\n\n==Impact on literature==\nThe ''[[Pal\u00e4stinalied]]'' is a famous lyric poem by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] written in [[Middle High German]] describing a [[pilgrim]] travelling to the [[Holy Land]] during the height of the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Kaye, Haley Caroline, \"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=senproj_s2016.

Later in 1218, a German army led by [[Oliver of Paderborn]], and a mixed army of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers led by [[William I, Count of Holland]] joined the crusade. In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] under [[Kaykaus I]] and attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.\n\nAfter occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards Cairo in July 1221. On the way, they laid siege to [[Aswan]] from the north side, but were turned back after they were trapped and their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat. Sultan [[al-Kamil]] ordered the destruction of the dam blocking the Nile River which lead to the flooding of the Crusader camp. They retreated to a nearby hilltop where they resisted to the point of starvation. The siege resulted in a great number of Crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army.

The [[Frisians]] according to ''[[De itinere frisonum]],'' however, refused on account of [[Innocent III]]'s disqualification of the venture at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 62. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref> The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of the city in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]] with the help of the [[Military order (religious society)|military orders]] on October 1217, after they repel an attempt by the governors of [[Seville]], [[Badajoz]], and [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]] to relieve the besieged garrison. According to William of Holland in his letter to [[Pope Honorius III]] the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces. From there on the Crusading fleet continued on its journey to the Levant.<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 64. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\nPope Innocent had managed to secure Georgia's participation in the crusade. Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. However, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in two successive battles, most notably at the [[Battle of Khunan]] in 1222.  After the death of Georgian King [[George IV of Georgia|George IV Lasha]], his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] wrote to the Pope informing him that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promise to assist in the Crusade because its army had been destroyed by unknown savages. It has been speculated that the oddly passive behavior of the Crusaders in the later years was due to them waiting for the Georgian army to join the fray.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan. DaCapo Press (2015), 322-327.</ref>\n\nDecades after this Crusade, Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan would take a census of the Kingdom of Georgia to ascertain how many troops it could muster. According to contemporary sources, the kingdom was judged to be able to field nine tumens.<ref>M.F. Brosset, \"Historie de la Georgie,\" I (St. Petersburg, 1849), pp. 548-549.</ref> A tumen was nominally 10,000 men, but usually averaged 5,000 in reality.<ref>David Morgan, \"The Mongols,\" 1986, p. 72. Morgan expresses skepticism that a tumen actually consisted of 10,000 men and notes that most were 3,000 to 7,000 men.</ref> If Hulegu's census was accurate, then the kingdom of Georgia in the 13th century was capable of mustering 45,000 soldiers. Had a force this size joined the Fifth Crusade, it would have more than doubled the Crusaders' strength.\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Ondrej.jpg|thumb|left|180px|King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]]]\n\n===Holy Land===\nThe first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King [[Andrew II of Hungary]].<ref>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: ''Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (page 311)</ref> In July 1217, Andrew departed from [[Zagreb]], accompanied by [[Leopold VI of Austria]] and [[Otto I, Duke of Merania]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|\u00c9rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=133}} King Andrew's army was so large{{mdash}}at least 10,000 mounted soldiers and even much more \"uncountable\" infantrymen{{mdash}}that most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=147\u2013148}} They were transported by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. {{sfn|Richard|1999|p=297}} Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in [[Split, Croatia|Split]].

Muslim forces retreated in their fortresses and towns. In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city, if they did manage to reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and [[trebuchet]]s did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]]. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics.

With Leopold and John they discussed attacking [[Damietta]] in Egypt.

They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[Al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this [[William I, Count of Holland]] left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to Al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.\n\nImmediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned. \n\nThen in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary [[Prester John]], was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards [[Cairo]].<ref>Christopher Eric Taylor, ''Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War'', 2011, University of Texas at Austin.</ref> This move was observed by the forces of Al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta.\n\nBy now Al-Kamil was able to ally with the other [[Ayyubid]]s in Syria, who had defeated [[Keykavus I]]. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the river [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to Al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the [[True Cross]]. However, the relic was never returned as Al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.\n\nThe failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \"foolishness\" of the wicked.\n\n==Impact on literature==\nThe ''[[Pal\u00e4stinalied]]'' is a famous lyric poem by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] written in [[Middle High German]] describing a [[pilgrim]] travelling to the [[Holy Land]] during the height of the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Kaye, Haley Caroline, \"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=senproj_s2016.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n\n[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|Cynic - Focus]]1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008.

[[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. \n\nMasvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. \n\n\n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]\n\n\n\nDuring Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\n[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]] \n \nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus.

The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n\n[[File:CynicFocus.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|Cynic - Focus]]1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008.

[[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. \n\nMasvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. \n\n\n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]]]During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\n[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]]\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus.

The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''. The duo officially released the song [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/onwardwithlove/kali-in-my-arms digitally] in 2019 have plans to release a full-length record by 2021.\n\nIn 2016, Masvidal, along with collaborator [[Amy Correia]], composed the musical score for the award-winning feature film ''[[The Tiger Hunter]]'', featuring lead actor [[Danny Pudi]] \n\nMasvidal also writes and performs music for television and motion pictures. His credits include main title (composer credit) on an Emmy nominated NBC teen series show ''[[Operation Junkyard]]'', short films ''The Yellow Umbrella'', ''A Bride in Black'', assistant to [[Ben Vaughn]] and session musician for Carsey Warner network sitcoms ''[[That '70s Show]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. In 2013 Masvidal founded composing collective [http://stillmotionmusic.com/ Still Motion Music] which scored music for numerous TV series on H2, National Geographic, Bravo, ABC and PBS. Masvidal also has a library songs regularly performed on network and cable television.
