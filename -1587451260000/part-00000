The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is full of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater.

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is full of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater.

A major international [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Draw|draw]] within professional wrestling, he has been credited with changing the perception of mainstream North-American professional wrestling in the early 1990s by bringing technical in-ring performance to the fore.<!--LEDE MATERIAL CITED WITHIN ARTICLE PER WP:LEDE.--> Hart is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time; [[Sky Sports]] noted that [[#Legacy|his legacy]] is that of \"one of, if not the greatest, to have ever graced the squared circle\".

He gained championship success during the 1980s and 1990s in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]), where he helmed [[The Hart Foundation]] [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]]. He left for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) following the controversial \"[[Montreal Screwjob]]\" in November 1997, where he remained until October 2000. Having been inactive from in-ring competition since January 2000, owing to a December 1999 [[concussion]], he officially retired in October 2000, shortly after his departure from the company. He returned to sporadic in-ring competition from 2010\u20132011 with WWE, where he won his final championship, headlined the [[SummerSlam (2010)|2010]] [[SummerSlam]] event, and served as the [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Raw brand authorities|general manager]] of [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]].

In the 1998 documentary ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]'', Hart reflected on his father's discipline, describing how Stu uttered morbid words while inflicting excruciating [[Grappling hold|submission holds]] that left broken blood vessels in Bret's eyes.

Hart did not want to end his WWF career with a loss to Michaels in his home country particularly with the context of their nationality-fueled feud; and offered to lose, forfeit or otherwise give over the belt to Michaels in any other way that McMahon wanted. McMahon agreed to Hart's idea of forfeiting the championship the next night on ''Raw Is War'' or losing it a few weeks later.\n\nAlthough Hart stated to McMahon he would not take the WWF World Heavyweight Championship with him to WCW TV and despite insistence from then-WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]],<ref name=\"DVD\"/> that Hart would join WCW with a \"clean slate\", McMahon was still concerned and paranoid; this led to him breaking his word in what eventually came to be known as the [[Montreal Screwjob]].

Hart later appeared again on ''MADtv'' in 1999 and 2000 in an angle with actor [[Will Sasso]] in which the two feuded on the set of ''MADtv'' and in World Championship Wrestling; this culminated in a grudge match on ''WCW Monday Nitro'', where Hart decisively defeated Sasso.\n\nHart donned his \"Hit Man\" singlet, along with additional costume, and executed wrestling maneuvers on villain characters, as part of his performance as the [[Genie (Disney character)|Genie]] in a 2004 stage production of ''[[Aladdin]]''.<ref>\"Bret Hart's stroke and his battle to survive\".

A member of the [[Hart wrestling family]] and a second-generation wrestler, he has an [[amateur wrestling]] background, wrestling at [[Ernest Manning High School]] and [[Mount Royal University|Mount Royal College]]. A major international [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Draw|draw]] within professional wrestling, he has been credited with changing the perception of mainstream North-American professional wrestling in the early 1990s by bringing technical in-ring performance to the fore.<!--LEDE MATERIAL CITED WITHIN ARTICLE PER WP:LEDE.--> Hart is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time; [[Sky Sports]] noted that [[#Legacy|his legacy]] is that of \"one of, if not the greatest, to have ever graced the squared circle\". For most of his career, he used the nickname \"Hitman\".\n\nHart joined his father [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[Stampede Wrestling]] in 1976 as a referee and made his in-ring debut in 1978. He gained championship success during the 1980s and 1990s in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]), where he helmed [[The Hart Foundation]] [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]]. He left for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) following the controversial \"[[Montreal Screwjob]]\" in November 1997, where he remained until October 2000. Having been inactive from in-ring competition since January 2000, owing to a December 1999 [[concussion]], he officially retired in October 2000, shortly after his departure from the company. He returned to sporadic in-ring competition from 2010\u20132011 with WWE, where he won his final championship, headlined the [[SummerSlam (2010)|2010]] [[SummerSlam]] event, and served as the [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Raw brand authorities|general manager]] of [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]. Throughout his career, Hart headlined [[WrestleMania IX]], [[WrestleMania X|X]], and [[WrestleMania XII|XII]], and participated in the main event of [[Starrcade (1997)|Starrcade 1997]] and [[Starrcade (1999)|1999]] \u2013 as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special enforcer]] and referee in the former.{{Efn|Hart had been a special guest referee for the match before the main event, Larry Zbyszko vs. Eric Bischoff but returned to restart the main event after he deemed Hulk Hogan's victory over Sting illegitimate, he then acted as a referee for the rest of the main event.<ref name=\"books.google.se\">{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=G4aFAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT140&dq=sting+hogan+bret#v=onepage&q=sting%20hogan%20bret&f=false |title = Death of WCW, The: 10th Anniversary Edition of the Bestselling Classic - Revised and Expanded|isbn = 9781770906426|last1 = Reynolds|first1 = R.

Hart has most [[List of WWE Champions#Reigns|combined days as WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] during the 1990s (654), and was the [[List of WCW World Heavyweight Champions#Title history|first]] WCW World Heavyweight Champion born outside the United States.

Before school, Hart's father, also a wrestling promoter, had him hand out fliers to local wrestling shows. In the 1998 documentary ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]'', Hart reflected on his father's discipline, describing how Stu uttered morbid words while inflicting excruciating [[Grappling hold|submission holds]] that left broken blood vessels in Bret's eyes. Hart claimed his father had an otherwise pleasant demeanor.<ref>{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=4}}</ref>\n\nHart's first work in wrestling involved pulling out lucky numbers out of a metal box during intermission at the Stampede Wrestling shows when he was four years old. When he got slightly older he would sell programs to the shows, something all Hart's seven brothers would do.

In 1965, Northern and Eastern Samar were created.\n\nFishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.<ref>http://www.samar.lgu-ph.com/econo.htm Economical Data</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 2013, the province was significantly damaged by [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)]], particularly the towns of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]], [[Marabut, Samar|Marabut]] and [[Santa Rita, Samar|Santa Rita]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Samar'' is said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} to be derived from ''Samad'', the [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] word for \"wound\" or \"cut\", describing the rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams.\n\n==History==\n{{prose|date=April 2013}}\n\n* '''2 million-8,000 B.C''' \u2014 Based on geologic findings, during the ice ages or Pleistocene period (2 million years \u2013 8,000 B.C), the islands of Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao were connected as one big island through the islands of Samar, Leyte and Bohol.\n* '''8550 B.C.''' \u2014 Diggings in Sohoton Caves in Basey, Samar showed stone flake tools dated 8550 B.C.\n* '''1300''' \u2014 Other diggings along the Basey River revealed other stone flakes used until the 13th century.\n* '''1543''' \u2014 The explorer [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]], first came to the island and named it ''Las Islas Filipinas''.\n* '''1596''' \u2014 Many names (such as ''Samal'', ''Ibabao'', ''Tandaya'') were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. The name \"Samar\" was derived from the local language ''samad,'' meaning \"wound\" or \"cut\", aptly describing the rough physical features of the island, rugged and deeply dissected by streams. Recent scholars connect the name Samar to the ancient city of Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The early Datu of Samar, Iberein of Lawang Town, in the Northern part of the island may have a Samarian blood.  During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of [[Cebu]].\n* '''Arrival of the First Missionaries Jesuits''' \u2014 On October 15, 1596, the first [[Jesuit]] Mission arrived in ''Tinago'' (now [[Dapdap]]) in [[Tarangnan]]. From Tinago, the missionaries Fr. [[Francisco de Otazo]], [[Bartolome Martes]], and [[Domingo Alonzo]] began teaching [[Catechism]] healing the sick and spread the [[Christianity]] faith into the interior settlements.\n* '''1649''' '''to 1650''' \u2014 On June 1, 1649, the people of [[Palapag]] led by [[Agustin Sumuroy]] revolted against the decree of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Diego Fajardo Chac\u00f3n|Diego Fajardo]] requiring able bodied men from the [[Visayas]] for service at the Cavite Shipyards. Like fire, the revolt quickly spread the neighboring town in the Northern and Western coast of Samar and to the nearby provinces of Bicol, [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]], [[Cebu]], [[Camiguin]] and as far as [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]]. It was suppressed in 1650 by the combined forces of the [[Spaniards]], Lutaos, and Pampangos.\n* '''1735''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were united into one province with [[Carigara]], in Leyte, as the capital town.\n* '''1747''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were separated for administrative effectiveness.\n* '''1762''' \u2014 Complaints from the Jesuits that the division was not working well, thus it was reunited again by the approval from the King of Spain.\n* '''1768''' \u2014 Jesuits were expelled in all Spanish dominions. The Franciscans arrived on September 25, 1768 and succeeded the administration of 14 parishes which was under by the spiritual care of the Jesuits for almost 172 years. The remaining three parishes of Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey in the south of Samar went under the administration of the Augustinians.\n* '''1777''' \u2014 The two provinces were divided for the last time, it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.\n* '''1803''' \u2014 Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey were turned over to the Franciscans for the lack of Augustinian priests. \n* '''Royal Decree declares Samar as a Province''' \u2014 On August 11, 1841, [[Isabel II of Spain|Queen Isabella II of Spain]] signed a [[Royal Decree]] declaring Samar as a province.\n* '''1900''' \u2014 The [[Siege of Catubig|Battle of Catubig]] (April 15\u201318, 1900) occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. On April 15, 1900, the Filipino guerrillas launched a surprise attack on a detachment of US 43rd Infantry Regiment, forcing the Americans to abandon Catubig town after the four-day siege.\n* '''1901''' \u2014 The [[Balangiga massacre]] occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. September 28, 1901, the people of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]], [[Giporlos]], [[Lawaan]] and [[Quinapondan]] in [[Eastern Samar]] surprised and attacked the American forces station there, [[Balangiga massacre|killing 48 American soldiers]]. To avenge their defeat, American general [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered his men to turn Samar into a \"howling wilderness\".\n* '''1910''' \u2014 On April 10, 1910, upon the papal bull of Pope Pius X separated the islands of Samar and Leyte from the Diocese of Cebu and erected the Diocese of Calbayog comprising both islands. Pablo Singzon de Anuncacion was named first Bishop and consecrated on June 12, 1910.\n* '''1941''' \u2014 The [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|invasion by the Japanese]] via fighter and bomber planes.\n* '''1941''' to '''1942''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Infantry Division]], Philippine Commonwealth Army, and [[USAFFE]] (under the Visayan-Mindanao Force) were established, but all fell to the invading Japanese forces.

The province is bordered on the north by [[Northern Samar]], east by [[Eastern Samar]], south by [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and west by the [[Samar Sea]].\n\n===Topography===\nSamar province is hilly, with mountain peaks ranging from {{Convert|200|to|800|m}} high and narrow strips of lowlands, which tend to lie in coastal peripheries or in the [[alluvial plain]]s and [[river delta|delta]]s accompanying large rivers. The largest lowlands are located along the northern coast extending up to the valleys of [[Catubig River|Catubig]] and [[Catarman River|Catarman]] rivers. Smaller lowlands in Samar are to be found in the [[Calbayog]] area and on the deltas and small valleys of Gandara and [[Ulot River|Ulot]] rivers. Slopes are generally steep and barren of trees due to [[deforestation]]. Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.\n\n[[File:Ph fil samar.png|thumb]]\n\n===Climate and rainfall===\nAreas near the eastern coast of the province have no dry season (with a pronounced maximum rain period usually occurring from December to January), and are thus open to the northeast [[monsoon]]. Municipalities in the southeastern section of the province experience this type of climate.\n\nAreas located in the northwestern portion of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe province of Samar comprises two [[Legislative districts of Samar|congressional districts]], 24 [[municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|component cities]]. It has a total of 952 barangays.\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

Samar is connected to the [[Leyte|island of Leyte]] via the [[San Juanico Bridge]] (Marcos Bridge).\n\nIn 1768, Leyte and modern Samar was created out of the [[Samar Province (1768-1965)|historical province of Samar]].  In 1965, Northern and Eastern Samar were created.\n\nFishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.<ref>http://www.samar.lgu-ph.com/econo.htm Economical Data</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 2013, the province was significantly damaged by [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)]], particularly the towns of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]], [[Marabut, Samar|Marabut]] and [[Santa Rita, Samar|Santa Rita]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Samar'' is said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} to be derived from ''Samad'', the [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] word for \"wound\" or \"cut\", describing the rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams.\n\n==History==\n{{prose|date=April 2013}}\n\n* '''2 million-8,000 B.C''' \u2014 Based on geologic findings, during the ice ages or Pleistocene period (2 million years \u2013 8,000 B.C), the islands of Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao were connected as one big island through the islands of Samar, Leyte and Bohol.\n* '''8550 B.C.''' \u2014 Diggings in Sohoton Caves in Basey, Samar showed stone flake tools dated 8550 B.C.\n* '''1300''' \u2014 Other diggings along the Basey River revealed other stone flakes used until the 13th century.\n* '''1543''' \u2014 The explorer [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]], first came to the island and named it ''Las Islas Filipinas''.\n* '''1596''' \u2014 Many names (such as ''Samal'', ''Ibabao'', ''Tandaya'') were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. The name \"Samar\" was derived from the local language ''samad,'' meaning \"wound\" or \"cut\", aptly describing the rough physical features of the island, rugged and deeply dissected by streams. Recent scholars connect the name Samar to the ancient city of Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The early Datu of Samar, Iberein of Lawang Town, in the Northern part of the island may have a Samarian blood.  During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of [[Cebu]].\n* '''Arrival of the First Missionaries Jesuits''' \u2014 On October 15, 1596, the first [[Jesuit]] Mission arrived in ''Tinago'' (now [[Dapdap]]) in [[Tarangnan]]. From Tinago, the missionaries Fr. [[Francisco de Otazo]], [[Bartolome Martes]], and [[Domingo Alonzo]] began teaching [[Catechism]] healing the sick and spread the [[Christianity]] faith into the interior settlements.\n* '''1649''' '''to 1650''' \u2014 On June 1, 1649, the people of [[Palapag]] led by [[Agustin Sumuroy]] revolted against the decree of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Diego Fajardo Chac\u00f3n|Diego Fajardo]] requiring able bodied men from the [[Visayas]] for service at the Cavite Shipyards. Like fire, the revolt quickly spread the neighboring town in the Northern and Western coast of Samar and to the nearby provinces of Bicol, [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]], [[Cebu]], [[Camiguin]] and as far as [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]]. It was suppressed in 1650 by the combined forces of the [[Spaniards]], Lutaos, and Pampangos.\n* '''1735''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were united into one province with [[Carigara]], in Leyte, as the capital town.\n* '''1747''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were separated for administrative effectiveness.\n* '''1762''' \u2014 Complaints from the Jesuits that the division was not working well, thus it was reunited again by the approval from the King of Spain.\n* '''1768''' \u2014 Jesuits were expelled in all Spanish dominions. The Franciscans arrived on September 25, 1768 and succeeded the administration of 14 parishes which was under by the spiritual care of the Jesuits for almost 172 years. The remaining three parishes of Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey in the south of Samar went under the administration of the Augustinians.\n* '''1777''' \u2014 The two provinces were divided for the last time, it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.\n* '''1803''' \u2014 Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey were turned over to the Franciscans for the lack of Augustinian priests. \n* '''Royal Decree declares Samar as a Province''' \u2014 On August 11, 1841, [[Isabel II of Spain|Queen Isabella II of Spain]] signed a [[Royal Decree]] declaring Samar as a province.\n* '''1900''' \u2014 The [[Siege of Catubig|Battle of Catubig]] (April 15\u201318, 1900) occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. On April 15, 1900, the Filipino guerrillas launched a surprise attack on a detachment of US 43rd Infantry Regiment, forcing the Americans to abandon Catubig town after the four-day siege.\n* '''1901''' \u2014 The [[Balangiga massacre]] occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. September 28, 1901, the people of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]], [[Giporlos]], [[Lawaan]] and [[Quinapondan]] in [[Eastern Samar]] surprised and attacked the American forces station there, [[Balangiga massacre|killing 48 American soldiers]]. To avenge their defeat, American general [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered his men to turn Samar into a \"howling wilderness\".\n* '''1910''' \u2014 On April 10, 1910, upon the papal bull of Pope Pius X separated the islands of Samar and Leyte from the Diocese of Cebu and erected the Diocese of Calbayog comprising both islands. Pablo Singzon de Anuncacion was named first Bishop and consecrated on June 12, 1910.\n* '''1941''' \u2014 The [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|invasion by the Japanese]] via fighter and bomber planes.\n* '''1941''' to '''1942''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Infantry Division]], Philippine Commonwealth Army, and [[USAFFE]] (under the Visayan-Mindanao Force) were established, but all fell to the invading Japanese forces.

Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.\n\n[[File:Ph fil samar.png|thumb]]\n\n===Climate and rainfall===\nAreas near the eastern coast of the province have no dry season (with a pronounced maximum rain period usually occurring from December to January), and are thus open to the northeast [[monsoon]]. Municipalities in the southeastern section of the province experience this type of climate.\n\nAreas located in the northwestern portion of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe province of Samar comprises two [[Legislative districts of Samar|congressional districts]], 24 [[municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|component cities]]. It has a total of 952 barangays.\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

Supp. 707 (1956)</ref> Whites filled the middle seats from the front to back, and blacks filled seats from the back to front until the bus was full. If other black people boarded the bus, they were required to stand. If another white person boarded the bus, then everyone in the black row nearest the front had to get up and stand, so that a new row for white people could be created; it was illegal for whites and blacks to sit next to each other. When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white person, she was sitting in the first row of the middle section.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smithsonian Source|url=http://www.smithsoniansource.org/display/primarysource/viewdetails.aspx?PrimarySourceId=1203|website=www.smithsoniansource.org}}</ref>\n\nOften when boarding the buses, black people were required to pay at the front, get off, and reenter the bus through a separate door at the back.<ref>Garrow (1986) p. 13.

Twelve years before her history-making arrest, Parks was stopped from boarding a city bus by driver [[James F. Blake]], who ordered her to board at the back door and then drove off without her. Parks vowed never again to ride a bus driven by Blake. As a member of the NAACP, Parks was an investigator assigned to cases of sexual assault. In 1945, she was sent to [[Abbeville, Alabama]], to investigate the gang rape of [[Recy Taylor]]. The protest that arose around the Taylor case was the first instance of a nationwide civil rights protest, and it laid the groundwork for the Montgomery bus boycott.<ref>{{cite book|last=McGuire|first=Danielle L.|title=At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance- A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power|year=2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-307-26906-5|page=8 and 39}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rosaparks busdiagram.jpg|thumb|A diagram showing where Rosa Parks sat in the unreserved section at the time of her arrest]]\nIn 1955, Parks completed a course in \"Race Relations\" at the [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Folk School]] in Tennessee, where [[nonviolent]] [[civil disobedience]] had been discussed as a tactic.

D. Nixon===\n{{unref|section|date=December 2019}}\nSome action against segregation had been in the works for some time before Parks' arrest, under the leadership of [[Edgar Nixon|E. D. Nixon]], president of the local [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] chapter and a member of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]. Nixon intended that her arrest be a [[Test case (law)|test case]] to allow Montgomery's black citizens to challenge segregation on the city's public buses. With this goal, community leaders had been waiting for the right person to be arrested, a person who would anger the black community into action, who would agree to test the segregation laws in court, and who, most importantly, was \"above reproach\". When Colvin was arrested in March 1955, Nixon thought he had found the perfect person, but the teenager turned out to be pregnant. Nixon later explained, \"I had to be sure that I had somebody I could win with.\" Parks was a good candidate because of her employment and marital status, along with her good standing in the community.\n\nBetween Parks' arrest and trial, Nixon organized a meeting of local ministers at Martin Luther King Jr.'s church. Though Nixon could not attend the meeting because of his work schedule, he arranged that no election of a leader for the proposed boycott would take place until his return. When he returned, he caucused with [[Ralph Abernathy]] and Rev. E.N. French to name the association to lead the boycott to the city (they selected the \"[[Montgomery Improvement Association]]\", \"MIA\"), and they selected King (Nixon's choice) to lead the boycott. Nixon wanted King to lead the boycott because the young minister was new to Montgomery and the city fathers had not had time to intimidate him. At a subsequent, larger meeting of ministers, Nixon's agenda was threatened by the clergymen's reluctance to support the campaign. Nixon was indignant, pointing out that their poor congregations worked to put money into the collection plates so these ministers could live well, and when those congregations needed the clergy to stand up for them, those comfortable ministers refused to do so.  Nixon threatened to reveal the ministers' cowardice to the black community, and King spoke up, denying he was afraid to support the boycott. King agreed to lead the MIA, and Nixon was elected its treasurer.\n\n===Boycott===\n[[Image:Rosa Parks Bus.jpg|thumb|The [[National City Lines]] bus, No. 2857, on which Rosa Parks rode before she was arrested (a [[GM \"old-look\" transit bus]], serial number 1132), is now on exhibit at the [[Henry Ford Museum]].]]\nOn the night of Rosa Parks' arrest, the [[Women's Political Council]], led by [[Jo Ann Robinson]], printed and circulated a flyer throughout Montgomery's black community that read as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Another woman has been arrested and thrown in jail because she refused to get up out of her seat on the bus for a white person to sit down. It is the second time since the [[Claudette Colvin]] case that a Negro woman has been arrested for the same thing. This has to be stopped. Negroes have rights too, for if Negroes did not ride the buses, they could not operate. Three-fourths of the riders are Negro, yet we are arrested, or have to stand over empty seats. If we do not do something to stop these arrests, they will continue. The next time it may be you, or your daughter, or mother. This woman's case will come up on Monday. We are, therefore, asking every Negro to stay off the buses Monday in protest of the arrest and trial. Don't ride the buses to work, to town, to school, or anywhere on Monday. You can afford to stay out of school for one day if you have no other way to go except by bus. You can also afford to stay out of town for one day. If you work, take a cab, or walk.

Such a line would have meant that if the white section of the bus was oversubscribed, whites would have to stand; blacks would not be forced to give up their seats to whites.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nThis demand was a compromise for the leaders of the boycott, who believed that the city of Montgomery would be more likely to accept it rather than a demand for a full integration of the buses. In this respect, the MIA leaders followed the pattern of 1950s boycott campaigns in the [[Deep South]], including the successful boycott a few years earlier of service stations in [[Mississippi]] for refusing to provide restrooms for blacks. The organizer of that campaign, [[T. R. M. Howard]] of the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]], had spoken on the lynching of [[Emmett Till]] as King's guest at the [[Dexter Avenue Baptist Church]] only four days before Parks's arrest. Parks was in the audience and later said that Emmett Till was on her mind when she refused to give up her seat.<ref>{{cite book |first1=David T. |last1=Beito |first2=Linda Royster |last2=Beito |title=Black Maverick: T.R.M.

Martin Luther King later wrote \"[a] miracle had taken place.\" Instead of riding buses, boycotters organized a system of carpools, with car owners volunteering their vehicles or themselves driving people to various destinations. Some white housewives also drove their black domestic servants to work. When the city pressured local insurance companies to stop insuring cars used in the carpools, the boycott leaders arranged policies at [[Lloyd's of London]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gbQHxb_P0QC&pg=RA2-PA360&lpg=RA2-PA360&dq= |title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present |last=Finkleman |first=Paul |page=360 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195167795 }}</ref>\n\nBlack [[taxicab|taxi]] drivers charged ten cents per ride, a fare equal to the cost to ride the bus, in support of the boycott.  When word of this reached city officials on December 8, the order went out to fine any cab driver who charged a rider less than 45 cents. In addition to using private [[motor vehicles]], some people used non-motorized means to get around, such as cycling, walking, or even riding mules or driving horse-drawn buggies. Some people also hitchhiked. During rush hours, sidewalks were often crowded. As the buses received few, if any, passengers, their officials asked the City Commission to allow stopping service to black communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montgomeryboycott.com/article_overview.htm |title=Montgomery Bus Boycott: The story of Rosa Parks and the Civil Rights Movement |publisher=Montgomeryboycott.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref>  Across the nation, black churches raised money to support the boycott and collected new and slightly used shoes to replace the tattered footwear of Montgomery's black citizens, many of whom walked everywhere rather than ride the buses and submit to [[Jim Crow law]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn response, opposing whites swelled the ranks of the [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Council]], the membership of which doubled during the course of the boycott. The councils sometimes resorted to violence: King's and Abernathy's houses were [[Firebombing|firebombed]], as were four black Baptist churches. Boycotters were often physically attacked. After the attack at King's house, he gave a speech to the 300 angry African Americans who had gathered outside. He said:\n\n{{Quote|If you have weapons, take them home; if you do not have them, please do not seek to get them. We cannot solve this problem through retaliatory violence.

Supp. 707 (1956)</ref> Whites filled the middle seats from the front to back, and blacks filled seats from the back to front until the bus was full. If other black people boarded the bus, they were required to stand. If another white person boarded the bus, then everyone in the black row nearest the front had to get up and stand, so that a new row for white people could be created; it was illegal for whites and blacks to sit next to each other.

In 1945, she was sent to [[Abbeville, Alabama]], to investigate the gang rape of [[Recy Taylor]]. The protest that arose around the Taylor case was the first instance of a nationwide civil rights protest, and it laid the groundwork for the Montgomery bus boycott.<ref>{{cite book|last=McGuire|first=Danielle L.|title=At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance- A New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power|year=2010|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-307-26906-5|page=8 and 39}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rosaparks busdiagram.jpg|thumb|A diagram showing where Rosa Parks sat in the unreserved section at the time of her arrest]]\nIn 1955, Parks completed a course in \"Race Relations\" at the [[Highlander Research and Education Center|Highlander Folk School]] in Tennessee, where [[nonviolent]] [[civil disobedience]] had been discussed as a tactic.

D. Nixon===\n{{unref|section|date=December 2019}}\nSome action against segregation had been in the works for some time before Parks' arrest, under the leadership of [[Edgar Nixon|E. D. Nixon]], president of the local [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] chapter and a member of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]. Nixon intended that her arrest be a [[Test case (law)|test case]] to allow Montgomery's black citizens to challenge segregation on the city's public buses. With this goal, community leaders had been waiting for the right person to be arrested, a person who would anger the black community into action, who would agree to test the segregation laws in court, and who, most importantly, was \"above reproach\". When Colvin was arrested in March 1955, Nixon thought he had found the perfect person, but the teenager turned out to be pregnant. Nixon later explained, \"I had to be sure that I had somebody I could win with.\" Parks was a good candidate because of her employment and marital status, along with her good standing in the community.\n\nBetween Parks' arrest and trial, Nixon organized a meeting of local ministers at Martin Luther King Jr.'s church. Though Nixon could not attend the meeting because of his work schedule, he arranged that no election of a leader for the proposed boycott would take place until his return. When he returned, he caucused with [[Ralph Abernathy]] and Rev. E.N. French to name the association to lead the boycott to the city (they selected the \"[[Montgomery Improvement Association]]\", \"MIA\"), and they selected King (Nixon's choice) to lead the boycott. Nixon wanted King to lead the boycott because the young minister was new to Montgomery and the city fathers had not had time to intimidate him. At a subsequent, larger meeting of ministers, Nixon's agenda was threatened by the clergymen's reluctance to support the campaign. Nixon was indignant, pointing out that their poor congregations worked to put money into the collection plates so these ministers could live well, and when those congregations needed the clergy to stand up for them, those comfortable ministers refused to do so.  Nixon threatened to reveal the ministers' cowardice to the black community, and King spoke up, denying he was afraid to support the boycott. King agreed to lead the MIA, and Nixon was elected its treasurer.\n\n===Boycott===\n[[Image:Rosa Parks Bus.jpg|thumb|The [[National City Lines]] bus, No. 2857, on which Rosa Parks rode before she was arrested (a [[GM \"old-look\" transit bus]], serial number 1132), is now on exhibit at the [[Henry Ford Museum]].]]\nOn the night of Rosa Parks' arrest, the [[Women's Political Council]], led by [[Jo Ann Robinson]], printed and circulated a flyer throughout Montgomery's black community that read as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Another woman has been arrested and thrown in jail because she refused to get up out of her seat on the bus for a white person to sit down. It is the second time since the [[Claudette Colvin]] case that a Negro woman has been arrested for the same thing. This has to be stopped. Negroes have rights too, for if Negroes did not ride the buses, they could not operate. Three-fourths of the riders are Negro, yet we are arrested, or have to stand over empty seats. If we do not do something to stop these arrests, they will continue. The next time it may be you, or your daughter, or mother. This woman's case will come up on Monday. We are, therefore, asking every Negro to stay off the buses Monday in protest of the arrest and trial. Don't ride the buses to work, to town, to school, or anywhere on Monday. You can afford to stay out of school for one day if you have no other way to go except by bus. You can also afford to stay out of town for one day. If you work, take a cab, or walk. But please, children and grown-ups, don't ride the bus at all on Monday.

Zion Church]] to discuss boycott strategies. At that time [[Rosa Parks]] was introduced but not asked to speak, despite a standing ovation and calls from the crowd for her to speak; she asked someone if she should say something, but they replied, \"Why, you've said enough.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gwVbfvfYEZkC&pg=PA408&lpg=PA408&dq=rosa+parks+%22You've+said+enough%22#v=onepage&q=rosa%20parks%20%22You've%20said%20enough%22&f=false |title=Civil Rights History from the Ground Up: Local Struggles, a National Movement - Google Books |accessdate=2014-06-05|isbn=9780820338651 |year=2011 |last1=Crosby |first1=Emilye }}</ref> A citywide boycott of public transit was proposed to demand a fixed dividing line for the segregated sections of the buses. Such a line would have meant that if the white section of the bus was oversubscribed, whites would have to stand; blacks would not be forced to give up their seats to whites.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nThis demand was a compromise for the leaders of the boycott, who believed that the city of Montgomery would be more likely to accept it rather than a demand for a full integration of the buses. In this respect, the MIA leaders followed the pattern of 1950s boycott campaigns in the [[Deep South]], including the successful boycott a few years earlier of service stations in [[Mississippi]] for refusing to provide restrooms for blacks. The organizer of that campaign, [[T. R. M. Howard]] of the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]], had spoken on the lynching of [[Emmett Till]] as King's guest at the [[Dexter Avenue Baptist Church]] only four days before Parks's arrest. Parks was in the audience and later said that Emmett Till was on her mind when she refused to give up her seat.<ref>{{cite book |first1=David T. |last1=Beito |first2=Linda Royster |last2=Beito |title=Black Maverick: T.R.M.

To publicize the impending boycott it was advertised at black churches throughout Montgomery the following Sunday.{{citation needed|date = December 2017}}\n\nOn Saturday, December 3, it was evident that the black community would support the boycott, and very few blacks rode the buses that day. On December 5, a mass meeting was held at the [[Holt Street Baptist Church]] to determine if the protest would continue.<ref name=\"Phibbs\">{{cite book | last = Phibbs | first = Cheryl Fisher | title = The Montgomery Bus Boycott: A History and Reference Guide | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 2009 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HKPtlNXNILsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false | pages = 19| isbn = 9780313358876 }}</ref>  Given twenty minutes notice, King gave a speech<ref>{{cite web |author=Martin Luther King |publisher=Stanford University |title=Address to the first Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) Mass Meeting |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/the_addres_to_the_first_montgomery_improvement_association_mia_mass_meeting/ |access-date=2013-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206202721/http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/the_addres_to_the_first_montgomery_improvement_association_mia_mass_meeting/ |archive-date=2013-12-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> asking for a bus boycott and attendees enthusiastically agreed.

Martin Luther King later wrote \"[a] miracle had taken place.\" Instead of riding buses, boycotters organized a system of carpools, with car owners volunteering their vehicles or themselves driving people to various destinations. Some white housewives also drove their black domestic servants to work. When the city pressured local insurance companies to stop insuring cars used in the carpools, the boycott leaders arranged policies at [[Lloyd's of London]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gbQHxb_P0QC&pg=RA2-PA360&lpg=RA2-PA360&dq= |title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present |last=Finkleman |first=Paul |page=360 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195167795 }}</ref>\n\nBlack [[taxicab|taxi]] drivers charged ten cents per ride, a fare equal to the cost to ride the bus, in support of the boycott.  When word of this reached city officials on December 8, the order went out to fine any cab driver who charged a rider less than 45 cents. In addition to using private [[motor vehicles]], some people used non-motorized means to get around, such as cycling, walking, or even riding mules or driving horse-drawn buggies. Some people also hitchhiked. During rush hours, sidewalks were often crowded. As the buses received few, if any, passengers, their officials asked the City Commission to allow stopping service to black communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montgomeryboycott.com/article_overview.htm |title=Montgomery Bus Boycott: The story of Rosa Parks and the Civil Rights Movement |publisher=Montgomeryboycott.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref>  Across the nation, black churches raised money to support the boycott and collected new and slightly used shoes to replace the tattered footwear of Montgomery's black citizens, many of whom walked everywhere rather than ride the buses and submit to [[Jim Crow law]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn response, opposing whites swelled the ranks of the [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Council]], the membership of which doubled during the course of the boycott. The councils sometimes resorted to violence: King's and Abernathy's houses were [[Firebombing|firebombed]], as were four black Baptist churches. Boycotters were often physically attacked. After the attack at King's house, he gave a speech to the 300 angry African Americans who had gathered outside. He said:\n\n{{Quote|If you have weapons, take them home; if you do not have them, please do not seek to get them. We cannot solve this problem through retaliatory violence. We must meet violence with nonviolence. Remember the words of Jesus: \"He who lives by the sword will perish by the sword\". We must love our white brothers, no matter what they do to us. We must make them know that we love them. Jesus still cries out in words that echo across the centuries: \"Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; pray for them that despitefully use you\".

The related civil suit was heard in federal district court and, on June 4, 1956, the court ruled in ''[[Browder v.

The case moved on to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. On November 13, 1956, the Supreme Court upheld the district court's ruling that segregation on public buses and transportation was against the law.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe boycott officially ended December 20, 1956, after 381 days. The city passed an ordinance authorizing black bus passengers to sit virtually anywhere they chose on buses. The Montgomery bus boycott resounded far beyond the desegregation of public buses.
