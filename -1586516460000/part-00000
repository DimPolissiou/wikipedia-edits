Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing.

The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star.

In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]].

Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Space Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a vehicle which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in LEO in the early 1990s. The U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed. As a result, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Administered by the '''Hutt City Council''', it is one of the four cities that constitute the [[Wellington|Wellington metropolitan area]].\n\nIt is New Zealand's [[List of cities in New Zealand|seventh most populous city]], with a population of {{NZ population data| Lower Hutt City|y}}.<ref name=\"NZ_population_data\"/> The total area administered by the Council is {{convert|377|km2|sqmi|0|abbr= on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profile.idnz.co.nz/hutt/about|title=Hutt City \u2013 About the profile areas|publisher=.id \u2013 the population experts|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref> around the lower half of the [[Hutt Valley]] and along the eastern shores of [[Wellington Harbour]], of which {{convert|135|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} is urban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iportal.huttcity.govt.nz/Record/ReadOnly?Tab=3&Uri=3677436|title=Hutt City Council Forest Plan}}</ref> It is separated from the city of Wellington by the harbour, and from [[Upper Hutt]] by the Taita Gorge.\n\nLower Hutt is unique among New Zealand cities, as the name of the council does not match the name of the city it governs. Special legislation<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/local/1991/0002/latest/whole.html|title=Lower Hutt City (Name of City Council) Act 1991|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> has since 1991 given the council the name \"Hutt City Council\", while the name of the place itself remains \"Lower Hutt City\". This name has led to confusion, as Upper Hutt is administered by a separate city council, the Upper Hutt City Council. The entire Hutt Valley, including both Lower and Upper Hutt cities, is also often simply called \"the Hutt\".\n\n==History==\nBefore European settlement, thick forest covered most of the Hutt Valley, with areas of marshland close to the river's mouth. [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] inhabited the shoreline, with a [[Pa (M\u0101ori) |pa]] at each end of Petone beach.\n\nM\u0101ori welcomed the arrival of the [[New Zealand Company]] ship [[Tory (ship)|''Tory'']] in 1839, and [[William Wakefield]] (the company's agent) negotiated with local chiefs to allow settlement. The first immigrant ship, the ''Aurora'', arrived on 22 January 1840, an event still commemorated every year on the Monday closest as [[Wellington Province#Anniversary Day|Wellington's Anniversary Day]]. A settlement, Britannia, grew up close to the mouth of the Hutt River, and settlers set up New Zealand's first newspaper and bank.\n\nThe city takes its name from the river, named after the founding member, director and chairman of the New Zealand Company, Sir [[William Hutt (British MP)| William Hutt]]. The dual name of Hutt River Te Awa Kairaingi has been used since 2010.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2010-ln6564|title=Notice of Proposals to Assign or Alter Place Names - 2010-ln6564 - New Zealand Gazette|website=gazette.govt.nz|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Christ Church Taita.JPG|thumb|left|[[Christ Church, Taita]], built in 1853 \u2013 the oldest extant church in the Wellington region.]]\n\nWithin weeks of settlement the Hutt River flooded, and in March 1840 the majority of Britannia settlers decided to move to [[Thorndon, New Zealand| Thorndon]], ({{as of | 2013 | lc = on}} in the heart of Wellington city), though some settlers remained at the north end of the harbour. In the 1840s an area on the west bank of the Hutt River formed the village then known as Aglionby.<ref>{{cite book| last = Wakefield | first = Edward Jerningham | authorlink = Edward Jerningham Wakefield | title = The Hand-book for New Zealand: Consisting of the Most Recent Information | url = https://archive.org/details/handbookfornewz00wakegoog | accessdate = 5 June 2013 | year = 1848 | publisher = John W.

The fault escarpment from the earthquake is still visible, notably at Hutt Central School.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1859 the first permanent lighthouse to be built in New Zealand was lit at Pencarrow Head. New Zealand's only female lighthouse keeper, [[Mary Jane Bennett]], became the inaugural operator of the lighthouse.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.heritage.org.nz/places/places-to-visit/wellington-region/pencarrow-lighthouse |title = Pencarrow Lighthouse &#124; Wellington &#124; Places to Visit &#124; Places &#124; Heritage New Zealand}}</ref>\n\nThe railway line from central Wellington reached Lower Hutt station (subsequently [[Western Hutt railway station | Western Hutt]]) in April 1874, with the line running north up the west side of the Hutt River to Silverstream opening two years later.\n\nBefore the Second World War of 1939\u20131945, urban settlement in the lower Hutt Valley concentrated mainly on Petone, central Lower Hutt and Eastbourne, with a total population of 30,000. In 1927 the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works| Public Works Department]] completed the construction of a branch railway line to [[Waterloo railway station, Lower Hutt | Waterloo]] on the east side of the river; the route diverging from the main line between Lower Hutt and Petone. Two years later the railway workshops moved from Petone to a [[Hutt Workshops | new larger site off the new branch at Woburn]].\n\nIn the late 1940s new suburbs of [[state housing]] developed along the eastern side of the Hutt Valley, from Waiwhetu to Taita, to alleviate nationwide housing shortages and to cater for the [[baby boom | booming population]]. Between 1946 and 1954 the railway line from Waterloo extended through these new suburbs to [[Haywards]], becoming the main line in 1954 when the existing main line between Haywards and Melling closed. By the end of the 1950s, Lower Hutt had a population of 80,000.\n<!-- add about a century's-worth of history here!-->\n\n== Government ==\n===Local===\nThe Hutt City Council comprises a mayor and 12 councillors.

The boundaries of the Lower Hutt city local body have evolved from a series of amalgamations and boundary changes over the years.\n\nThe [[Hutt County Council]], established in 1877, covered the region from Wellington's south coast up to Waikanae, excluding the Wellington City Council area. As the region grew, urban parts of the Hutt County became autonomous boroughs: [[Petone]] in 1888, Lower Hutt in 1891, [[Eastbourne, New Zealand| Eastbourne]] in 1906, [[Johnsonville, New Zealand| Johnsonville]] in 1908, Upper Hutt in 1908, Porirua in 1962 and [[Kapiti Coast (district), New Zealand |Kapiti]] in 1974.<!-- the preceding paragraph would be better in the Hutt County Council article -->\n\nIn 1941 Lower Hutt became a city. It incorporated [[Normandale, New Zealand|Normandale]] in 1957.\n\nIn 1987/1989 the New Zealand Government forced local authorities to consolidate, which led to Lower Hutt amalgamating with the adjacent Boroughs of Petone and Eastbourne and with the [[Wainuiomata]] District (which had its independence for barely a year), and to the abolition of the Hutt County Council.\n\n===National===\nThe area of Lower Hutt is covered by two [[New Zealand electorates |general electorates]] ([[Hutt South]] and [[Rimutaka (New Zealand electorate)|Rimutaka]]) and by two [[M\u0101ori electorates]] ([[Ikaroa-R\u0101whiti]] in the north and [[Te Tai Tonga]] in the south).\n\n==Geography==\nThe city centres on the lower (southern) valley of the [[Hutt River, New Zealand |Hutt River]], to the northeast of the city of [[Wellington]]. The valley widens into a [[river delta | delta]] as the river nears its mouth, so the central urban area of the city forms a triangle with its longest side along the shoreline. In the upper reaches of the city the Western and Eastern Hutt Hills become closer, culminating in the Taita Gorge at the northern end of Lower Hutt, separating the city from neighbouring Upper Hutt.\n\nLower Hutt includes the cluster of small settlements that extend down the eastern coast of [[Wellington Harbour]]. These include the two large [[township]]s of [[Wainuiomata]] (inland) and [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Eastbourne]] (on the coast). The city also includes a large area of sparsely-populated land to the east of the harbour, extending to Pencarrow Head and into the [[Rimutaka Ranges]].\n\nLower Hutt's boundaries include the islands in Wellington Harbour, the largest of which, [[Matiu/Somes Island]], is commonly referred to by its former name of Somes Island.\n\n===Climate===\nLower Hutt has a wet [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''Cfb'''), which is similar to nearby Wellington, with relatively warm summers and mild winters with the occasional storm.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Lower Hutt\n|single line = yes\n|metric first = yes\n|Jan record high C = 28.8\n|Feb record high C = 30.9\n|Mar record high C = 28.6\n|Apr record high C = 26.5\n|May record high C = 23.0\n|Jun record high C = 19.6\n|Jul record high C = 18.2\n|Aug record high C = 20.1\n|Sep record high C = 24.3\n|Oct record high C = 23.6\n|Nov record high C = 27.5\n|Dec record high C = 29.6\n|year record high C = 30.9\n|Jan high C = 22.5\n|Feb high C = 22.6\n|Mar high C = 20.9\n|Apr high C = 18.4\n|May high C = 15.9\n|Jun high C = 13.4\n|Jul high C = 12.8\n|Aug high C = 13.8\n|Sep high C = 15.7\n|Oct high C = 16.9\n|Nov high C = 18.7\n|Dec high C = 20.7\n|Jan mean C = 18.2\n|Feb mean C = 18.3\n|Mar mean C = 16.6\n|Apr mean C = 14.1\n|May mean C = 12.1\n|Jun mean C = 9.9\n|Jul mean C = 9.0\n|Aug mean C = 9.9\n|Sep mean C = 11.6\n|Oct mean C = 13.0\n|Nov mean C = 14.5\n|Dec mean C = 16.7\n|Jan low C = 14.0\n|Feb low C = 14.0\n|Mar low C = 12.2\n|Apr low C = 9.8\n|May low C = 8.3\n|Jun low C = 6.3\n|Jul low C = 5.2\n|Aug low C = 6.0\n|Sep low C = 7.6\n|Oct low C = 9.1\n|Nov low C = 10.4\n|Dec low C = 12.8\n|Jan record low C = 5.2\n|Feb record low C = 5.0\n|Mar record low C = 4.6\n|Apr record low C = 2.5\n|May record low C = -1.0\n|Jun record low C = -1.9\n|Jul record low C = -3.3\n|Aug record low C = -1.1\n|Sep record low C = -2.2\n|Oct record low C = 0.8\n|Nov record low C = 2.1\n|Dec record low C = 5.0\n|year record low C = -3.3\n|Jan precipitation mm = 84\n|Feb precipitation mm = 81\n|Mar precipitation mm = 87\n|Apr precipitation mm = 88\n|May precipitation mm = 117\n|Jun precipitation mm = 154\n|Jul precipitation mm = 144\n|Aug precipitation mm = 136\n|Sep precipitation mm = 109\n|Oct precipitation mm = 145\n|Nov precipitation mm = 99\n|Dec precipitation mm = 94\n|Jan sun = 235\n|Feb sun = 199\n|Mar sun = 198\n|Apr sun = 159\n|May sun = 135\n|Jun sun = 105\n|Jul sun = 124\n|Aug sun = 146\n|Sep sun = 156\n|Oct sun = 176\n|Nov sun = 192\n|Dec sun = 204\n|source = Paradise.net<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/tmcgavin/lh_stats.html\n|title = Climate Statistics for Lower Hutt, NZ (1985\u20132010)\n|accessdate = 27 January 2012\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181129161752/http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/tmcgavin/lh_stats.html\n|archive-date = 29 November 2018\n|url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Hutt River===\nA single major aquifer dominates the lower Hutt Valley: the [[Hutt River (New Zealand) |Hutt River]], originally named Heretaunga, and since 2010 known as \"Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River\".<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Awakairangi'' in the [[Maori language]] means \"river of food from the sky\".\n\nLower Hutt occupies the lower regions of the [[floodplain | flood plain]] of the river, one of the most significant features{{citation needed|date= June 2016}} of the city.

In 1985 the river burst its banks, and since then floods have been on a smaller scale. Smaller streams and storm-water drains have also caused occasional problems when rainfall exceeds average levels.\n\nMuch of the land adjacent to the river is protected as reserve by the City Council and managed by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]] to provide popular recreational areas. From the river mouth, walking and cycling trails and grassed areas occur at various points along both sides of the river up the [[Hutt Valley]] to [[Te Marua] |Te M\u0101rua], 28km further north in Upper Hutt.\n\nWith lower river-levels in mid-summer, [[algal bloom]]s have contributed to making slow-flowing areas anoxic. The Regional Council has cited the algal blooms as the cause of death of a small number of dogs swimming in the river, as well as of skin reactions in the case of swimmers.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nSeven bridges cross the Hutt River within the city of Lower Hutt, with several other bridges built and replaced from the 1850s onwards.\n\nTributaries of the Hutt River within Lower Hutt include:\n\n* Waiwhetu Stream<ref>\n[https://www.waiwhetu-stream.org.nz/ Friends of Waiwhet\u016b Stream] - \"Waiwhet\u016b: Star-reflecting stream [...] The Waiwhet\u016b Stream starts in the Eastern Hutt Hills in the suburbs of Taita and Naenae and flows out to the mouth of the Hutt River.\"\n</ref>\n* Te Mome Stream\n* Opahu Stream (Black Creek)<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/stormwater/opahu-stream-hutt-city\n | title = Opahu Stream \u2013 Hutt City\n | publisher = Wellington Water\n | access-date = 3 June 2016\n | quote = The Opahu Stream (commonly known as Black Creek) begins near Boulcott Street, meanders through the central city and flows into the Hutt River at Whites Line West.\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160330161617/http://wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/stormwater/opahu-stream-hutt-city/\n | archive-date = 30 March 2016\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\n\n===Suburbs===\nHere are listed the following suburbs of Lower Hutt City (unofficial suburbs are in ''italics'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huttcity.govt.nz/Documents/maps/HuttCityWardsSuburbs.pdf |title=Hutt City Wards and Suburbs |publisher=Hutt City Council |accessdate=25 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209145201/http://huttcity.govt.nz/Documents/maps/HuttCityWardsSuburbs.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2013 }}</ref>\n\n;Northern Ward\n:''[[Pomare, Lower Hutt|Pomare]]''<sup>2</sup>;

As business have taken advantage of global manufacturing efficiencies, much of this large scale industry has changed to smaller design-led and medium-sized industries exporting to the world. Over the past 25 years service, distribution, and consumer-oriented sectors have increased. Lower Hutt remains the main location for light industrial activity in the Wellington Region.\n\nUntil post-war housing development took over, the central and northern areas of the city were largely market gardens.\n\nIn 2010 the lower reaches of the Waiwhetu Stream was cleaned up to remove toxins from decades of industry use. The channel was also widened to better protect against floods and native plantings and management has seen native waterlife and birds return to their habitat.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/public-excitement-over-waiwhetu-stream-clean-up/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503061323/http://www.gw.govt.nz/public-excitement-over-waiwhetu-stream-clean-up/ |archive-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nPetone's Jackson Street and neighbouring areas have seen a resurgence in to one of Wellington's most popular retail and hospitality area.\n\nLower Hutt has one of the greatest proportion of science, technology and high value manufacturing businesses in New Zealand.

This name has led to confusion, as Upper Hutt is administered by a separate city council, the Upper Hutt City Council. The entire Hutt Valley, including both Lower and Upper Hutt cities, is also often simply called \"the Hutt\".\n\n==History==\nBefore European settlement, thick forest covered most of the Hutt Valley, with areas of marshland close to the river's mouth. [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] inhabited the shoreline, with a [[Pa (M\u0101ori) |pa]] at each end of Petone beach.\n\nM\u0101ori welcomed the arrival of the [[New Zealand Company]] ship [[Tory (ship)|''Tory'']] in 1839, and [[William Wakefield]] (the company's agent) negotiated with local chiefs to allow settlement. The first immigrant ship, the ''Aurora'', arrived on 22 January 1840, an event still commemorated every year on the Monday closest as [[Wellington Province#Anniversary Day|Wellington's Anniversary Day]]. A settlement, Britannia, grew up close to the mouth of the Hutt River, and settlers set up New Zealand's first newspaper and bank.\n\nThe city takes its name from the river, named after the founding member, director and chairman of the New Zealand Company, Sir [[William Hutt (British MP)| William Hutt]]. The dual name of Hutt River Te Awa Kairaingi has been used since 2010.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2010-ln6564|title=Notice of Proposals to Assign or Alter Place Names - 2010-ln6564 - New Zealand Gazette|website=gazette.govt.nz|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Christ Church Taita.JPG|thumb|left|[[Christ Church, Taita]], built in 1853 \u2013 the oldest extant church in the Wellington region.]]\n\nWithin weeks of settlement the Hutt River flooded, and in March 1840 the majority of Britannia settlers decided to move to [[Thorndon, New Zealand| Thorndon]], ({{as of | 2013 | lc = on}} in the heart of Wellington city), though some settlers remained at the north end of the harbour. In the 1840s an area on the west bank of the Hutt River formed the village then known as Aglionby.<ref>{{cite book| last = Wakefield | first = Edward Jerningham | authorlink = Edward Jerningham Wakefield | title = The Hand-book for New Zealand: Consisting of the Most Recent Information | url = https://archive.org/details/handbookfornewz00wakegoog | accessdate = 5 June 2013 | year = 1848 | publisher = John W.

The fault escarpment from the earthquake is still visible, notably at Hutt Central School.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1859 the first permanent lighthouse to be built in New Zealand was lit at Pencarrow Head. New Zealand's only female lighthouse keeper, [[Mary Jane Bennett]], became the inaugural operator of the lighthouse.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.heritage.org.nz/places/places-to-visit/wellington-region/pencarrow-lighthouse |title = Pencarrow Lighthouse &#124; Wellington &#124; Places to Visit &#124; Places &#124; Heritage New Zealand}}</ref>\n\nThe railway line from central Wellington reached Lower Hutt station (subsequently [[Western Hutt railway station | Western Hutt]]) in April 1874, with the line running north up the west side of the Hutt River to Silverstream opening two years later.\n\nBefore the Second World War of 1939\u20131945, urban settlement in the lower Hutt Valley concentrated mainly on Petone, central Lower Hutt and Eastbourne, with a total population of 30,000. In 1927 the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works| Public Works Department]] completed the construction of a branch railway line to [[Waterloo railway station, Lower Hutt | Waterloo]] on the east side of the river; the route diverging from the main line between Lower Hutt and Petone. Two years later the railway workshops moved from Petone to a [[Hutt Workshops | new larger site off the new branch at Woburn]].\n\nIn the late 1940s new suburbs of [[state housing]] developed along the eastern side of the Hutt Valley, from Waiwhetu to Taita, to alleviate nationwide housing shortages and to cater for the [[baby boom | booming population]]. Between 1946 and 1954 the railway line from Waterloo extended through these new suburbs to [[Haywards]], becoming the main line in 1954 when the existing main line between Haywards and Melling closed. By the end of the 1950s, Lower Hutt had a population of 80,000.\n<!-- add about a century's-worth of history here!-->\n\n== Government ==\n===Local===\nThe Hutt City Council comprises a mayor and 12 councillors.

The boundaries of the Lower Hutt city local body have evolved from a series of amalgamations and boundary changes over the years.\n\nThe [[Hutt County Council]], established in 1877, covered the region from Wellington's south coast up to Waikanae, excluding the Wellington City Council area. As the region grew, urban parts of the Hutt County became autonomous boroughs: [[Petone]] in 1888, Lower Hutt in 1891, [[Eastbourne, New Zealand| Eastbourne]] in 1906, [[Johnsonville, New Zealand| Johnsonville]] in 1908, Upper Hutt in 1908, Porirua in 1962 and [[Kapiti Coast (district), New Zealand |Kapiti]] in 1974.<!-- the preceding paragraph would be better in the Hutt County Council article -->\n\nIn 1941 Lower Hutt became a city. It incorporated [[Normandale, New Zealand|Normandale]] in 1957.\n\nIn 1987/1989 the New Zealand Government forced local authorities to consolidate, which led to Lower Hutt amalgamating with the adjacent Boroughs of Petone and Eastbourne and with the [[Wainuiomata]] District (which had its independence for barely a year), and to the abolition of the Hutt County Council.\n\n===National===\nThe area of Lower Hutt is covered by two [[New Zealand electorates |general electorates]] ([[Hutt South]] and [[Rimutaka (New Zealand electorate)|Rimutaka]]) and by two [[M\u0101ori electorates]] ([[Ikaroa-R\u0101whiti]] in the north and [[Te Tai Tonga]] in the south).\n\n==Geography==\nThe city centres on the lower (southern) valley of the [[Hutt River, New Zealand |Hutt River]], to the northeast of the city of [[Wellington]]. The valley widens into a [[river delta | delta]] as the river nears its mouth, so the central urban area of the city forms a triangle with its longest side along the shoreline. In the upper reaches of the city the Western and Eastern Hutt Hills become closer, culminating in the Taita Gorge at the northern end of Lower Hutt, separating the city from neighbouring Upper Hutt.\n\nLower Hutt includes the cluster of small settlements that extend down the eastern coast of [[Wellington Harbour]]. These include the two large [[township]]s of [[Wainuiomata]] (inland) and [[Eastbourne, New Zealand|Eastbourne]] (on the coast). The city also includes a large area of sparsely-populated land to the east of the harbour, extending to Pencarrow Head and into the [[Rimutaka Ranges]].\n\nLower Hutt's boundaries include the islands in Wellington Harbour, the largest of which, [[Matiu/Somes Island]], is commonly referred to by its former name of Somes Island.\n\n===Climate===\nLower Hutt has a wet [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: '''Cfb'''), which is similar to nearby Wellington, with relatively warm summers and mild winters with the occasional storm.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Lower Hutt\n|single line = yes\n|metric first = yes\n|Jan record high C = 28.8\n|Feb record high C = 30.9\n|Mar record high C = 28.6\n|Apr record high C = 26.5\n|May record high C = 23.0\n|Jun record high C = 19.6\n|Jul record high C = 18.2\n|Aug record high C = 20.1\n|Sep record high C = 24.3\n|Oct record high C = 23.6\n|Nov record high C = 27.5\n|Dec record high C = 29.6\n|year record high C = 30.9\n|Jan high C = 22.5\n|Feb high C = 22.6\n|Mar high C = 20.9\n|Apr high C = 18.4\n|May high C = 15.9\n|Jun high C = 13.4\n|Jul high C = 12.8\n|Aug high C = 13.8\n|Sep high C = 15.7\n|Oct high C = 16.9\n|Nov high C = 18.7\n|Dec high C = 20.7\n|Jan mean C = 18.2\n|Feb mean C = 18.3\n|Mar mean C = 16.6\n|Apr mean C = 14.1\n|May mean C = 12.1\n|Jun mean C = 9.9\n|Jul mean C = 9.0\n|Aug mean C = 9.9\n|Sep mean C = 11.6\n|Oct mean C = 13.0\n|Nov mean C = 14.5\n|Dec mean C = 16.7\n|Jan low C = 14.0\n|Feb low C = 14.0\n|Mar low C = 12.2\n|Apr low C = 9.8\n|May low C = 8.3\n|Jun low C = 6.3\n|Jul low C = 5.2\n|Aug low C = 6.0\n|Sep low C = 7.6\n|Oct low C = 9.1\n|Nov low C = 10.4\n|Dec low C = 12.8\n|Jan record low C = 5.2\n|Feb record low C = 5.0\n|Mar record low C = 4.6\n|Apr record low C = 2.5\n|May record low C = -1.0\n|Jun record low C = -1.9\n|Jul record low C = -3.3\n|Aug record low C = -1.1\n|Sep record low C = -2.2\n|Oct record low C = 0.8\n|Nov record low C = 2.1\n|Dec record low C = 5.0\n|year record low C = -3.3\n|Jan precipitation mm = 84\n|Feb precipitation mm = 81\n|Mar precipitation mm = 87\n|Apr precipitation mm = 88\n|May precipitation mm = 117\n|Jun precipitation mm = 154\n|Jul precipitation mm = 144\n|Aug precipitation mm = 136\n|Sep precipitation mm = 109\n|Oct precipitation mm = 145\n|Nov precipitation mm = 99\n|Dec precipitation mm = 94\n|Jan sun = 235\n|Feb sun = 199\n|Mar sun = 198\n|Apr sun = 159\n|May sun = 135\n|Jun sun = 105\n|Jul sun = 124\n|Aug sun = 146\n|Sep sun = 156\n|Oct sun = 176\n|Nov sun = 192\n|Dec sun = 204\n|source = Paradise.net<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/tmcgavin/lh_stats.html\n|title = Climate Statistics for Lower Hutt, NZ (1985\u20132010)\n|accessdate = 27 January 2012\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181129161752/http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/tmcgavin/lh_stats.html\n|archive-date = 29 November 2018\n|url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Hutt River===\nA single major aquifer dominates the lower Hutt Valley: the [[Hutt River (New Zealand) |Hutt River]], originally named Heretaunga, and since 2010 known as \"Te Awa Kairangi / Hutt River\".<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Awakairangi'' in the [[Maori language]] means \"river of food from the sky\".\n\nLower Hutt occupies the lower regions of the [[floodplain | flood plain]] of the river, one of the most significant features{{citation needed|date= June 2016}} of the city.

In 1985 the river burst its banks, and since then floods have been on a smaller scale. Smaller streams and storm-water drains have also caused occasional problems when rainfall exceeds average levels.\n\nMuch of the land adjacent to the river is protected as reserve by the City Council and managed by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]] to provide popular recreational areas. From the river mouth, walking and cycling trails and grassed areas occur at various points along both sides of the river up the [[Hutt Valley]] to [[Te Marua] |Te M\u0101rua], 28km further north in Upper Hutt.\n\nWith lower river-levels in mid-summer, [[algal bloom]]s have contributed to making slow-flowing areas anoxic. The Regional Council has cited the algal blooms as the cause of death of a small number of dogs swimming in the river, as well as of skin reactions in the case of swimmers.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nSeven bridges cross the Hutt River within the city of Lower Hutt, with several other bridges built and replaced from the 1850s onwards.\n\nTributaries of the Hutt River within Lower Hutt include:\n\n* Waiwhetu Stream<ref>\n[https://www.waiwhetu-stream.org.nz/ Friends of Waiwhet\u016b Stream] - \"Waiwhet\u016b: Star-reflecting stream [...] The Waiwhet\u016b Stream starts in the Eastern Hutt Hills in the suburbs of Taita and Naenae and flows out to the mouth of the Hutt River.\"\n</ref>\n* Te Mome Stream\n* Opahu Stream (Black Creek)<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/stormwater/opahu-stream-hutt-city\n | title = Opahu Stream \u2013 Hutt City\n | publisher = Wellington Water\n | access-date = 3 June 2016\n | quote = The Opahu Stream (commonly known as Black Creek) begins near Boulcott Street, meanders through the central city and flows into the Hutt River at Whites Line West.\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160330161617/http://wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/stormwater/opahu-stream-hutt-city/\n | archive-date = 30 March 2016\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\n\n===Suburbs===\nHere are listed the following suburbs of Lower Hutt City (unofficial suburbs are in ''italics'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huttcity.govt.nz/Documents/maps/HuttCityWardsSuburbs.pdf |title=Hutt City Wards and Suburbs |publisher=Hutt City Council |accessdate=25 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209145201/http://huttcity.govt.nz/Documents/maps/HuttCityWardsSuburbs.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2013 }}</ref>\n\n;Northern Ward\n:''[[Pomare, Lower Hutt|Pomare]]''<sup>2</sup>;

As business have taken advantage of global manufacturing efficiencies, much of this large scale industry has changed to smaller design-led and medium-sized industries exporting to the world. Over the past 25 years service, distribution, and consumer-oriented sectors have increased. Lower Hutt remains the main location for light industrial activity in the Wellington Region.\n\nUntil post-war housing development took over, the central and northern areas of the city were largely market gardens.\n\nIn 2010 the lower reaches of the Waiwhetu Stream was cleaned up to remove toxins from decades of industry use.

The Tapiola [[library]] is located in the cultural centre.\n\n==Urban planning==\nTapiola brought worldwide fame for Finnish urban planning. From its first stages it gained both a national and international reputation for its high class architecture and landscaping, as well as an ideological experiment.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> Tapiola's planners aimed at demonstrating a new direction for Finnish town planning and housing. The aim of the Housing Foundation was to create a garden city which would be a microcosm of Finnish society: all social classes would live there and there would be different types of buildings, ranging from detached houses to terraced and multi-storey blocks.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> The slogan of the project was: \"we do not want to build houses or dwellings but socially healthful surroundings for contemporary man and his family\".<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> Tapiola provided a utopian vision of society and an alternative to what was seen at the time as an oppressive urban environment. In this sense, Tapiola was both an experiment and a model.\n\nTapiola was built on the principles of [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s garden city. The founder of Tapiola, Heikki von Hertzen, believed that it was not possible to create a satisfactory residential centre if the population density exceeds a certain figure.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/> Hertzen's vision for Tapiola, which was originally planned for an area of 600 acres, was to have only 26 residents per acre, and a total of 15,000 people.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/> The ground was divided into four neighbourhood units, separated by green belts, and in the middle was built a main shopping and cultural centre to meet the needs of 30,000 inhabitants (including those of surrounding districts) (Hertzen 1959). An important feature of the Tapiola and garden cities is the development of a self-contained community. This meant that as many jobs as possible had to be provided \u2013 as many as could be at a distance of less than 10&nbsp;km from Helsinki.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n\nThe architects commissioned to plan Tapiola had also been influenced by [[Le Corbusier]]<ref name=Tuomi/> and other propagandists of Modernism, and thus their urban ideals also included tower blocks forming impressive silhouettes, as well as a dense method of building.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> The various residential units which made up Tapiola compromise multi-storey blocks and individual homes, either detached or in rows, introducing a note of variety in the neighbourhood and allowing for the mixing of residents.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/> Combining the architecture of modernism and the ideology of the garden city movement is credited for the huge interest in Tapiola's planning history.\n\nThe main planning features on which Tapiola was built, as synthesised from Von Hertzen's writings, are summarised below:\n*The starting point of planning is the individuality of man and closeness to nature, and the aesthetic value of nature and use of natural contours of the landscape are retained wherever possible.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n*Nature dominates, architecture is secondary. All buildings must harmonise with the natural setting.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/>\n*To be a working town, not a dormitory or nursery, providing as many jobs as possible to its inhabitants.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/>\n*The town should provide for a range of income levels \u2013 \"a community of everyman, where the ordinary worker, successful businessman and university professor can live side-by-side\".<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n*Consistent placing of multi-story buildings with alternatively low housing, resulting in a feeling of spaciousness and variety.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/>\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:TapiolaMantytorniH.jpg|thumb|right|250px|M\u00e4ntytorni apartment building, designed by [[Aarne Ervi]]]]\n[[File:Tapiolan keskusta aamu 280619.png|thumb|right|250px|The park east of the center of Tapiola.]]\nThe development of Tapiola occurred in several stages: the eastern neighbourhood 1952 \u2013 1956, the western neighbourhood, 1957-1960, the town centre 1958-1961-1970, the northern neighbourhood 1958-1967, the southern neighbourhood 1961-1965.<ref name=\"armen\"/> Planning in Tapiola commenced with architect, Otto-Iivari Meurman's site plan and building schedule which were reviewed from 1951 onwards.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> His original plan detailed four neighbourhoods split by two crossing roads and set apart by green belts.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n\nArchitects Aarne Ervi, Viljo Revell, Aulis Blomstedt and Markus Tavio were charged with designing the eastern neighbourhood based on Meurman's plan.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> They were required to design buildings suited to the surrounding environment and the topography of the area.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n\nA housing team was created to appraise the architects' housing designs; this process occurred more frequently during the development of the eastern neighbourhood.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> Team members were from a wide range of fields and included a building engineer, a heating engineer, two independent architects, an electrical engineer, a landscape gardener, a domestic science expert, a child welfare expert, a sociologist, and a housewife.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> This unique team, coupled with the board of the Housing Foundation, assessed housing designs, taking into consideration the needs and desires of future residents from a diverse range of backgrounds.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> The parties had different beliefs and values, which sometimes led to disagreements, for example the Housing Foundation was concerned with economising whilst the home-economics experts were chiefly concerned with the needs of families.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> Thus planning in Tapiola was collaborative and proactive as it involved targeting specific family types and classes, deciding on an ideal lifestyle for these residents, which accordingly influenced their behaviours.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> Many dwellings were designed to house a specific family-type and lifestyle.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> For example, it was perceived to be ideal to have families with children reside in dwellings, at or close to ground level in order for the children to have better access to the outdoors and to parks, whilst a tower block with one-room flats was designed to accommodate childless couples.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/>\n\nMeurman resigned from the board of governors of the Housing Foundation in 1954 following a shift from developing a town with low population density (six persons per acre) and low-rise buildings dwellings, as advocated by Meurman, to more multi-storey buildings and a higher population density (30 persons per acre) as recommended by other architects and the Housing Foundation.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/><ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> This shift was prompted by the need to accommodate a larger population, triggered by the housing shortage in Finland.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> Ervi took up Meurman\u2019s position as master planner.<ref name=\"lahti\"/>\n\nThe development of the eastern neighbourhood led to the implementation of important planning principles such as providing facilities that encourage interaction and foster a sense of community as well as the separation of vehicles and pedestrians.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> It was also deemed necessary to have a mixture of building types located within the one area to encourage social diversification.<ref name=\"armen\"/> The eastern and western residential areas of Tapiola featured curved streets with lots of varying sizes and positions, whilst the northern neighbourhood designed by architect Pentti Ahola, marked a return to the orthogonal grid plan.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> Ahola's design however, reflected the original aims of Tapiola; that of encouraging social diversification by locating a variety of building types within the one area.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> Financial concerns affected the development of the western area of Tapiola, leading to the construction of housing units that were economically feasible.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/>\n\nIn 1953 Aarne Ervi was awarded the commission to plan the town centre.<ref name=\"lahti\"/> The aim of the town centre's design was to provide all the facilities necessary for a modern urban centre and to maximise social interaction.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> The centre included a market square, public square, church, public premises, businesses and an administration building.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> As with the other areas of Tapiola, the centre was designed with consideration for the site's features and terrain as well as to provide an active and versatile environment for pedestrians.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> Roads surrounded the central area producing a modern design completely separate from vehicles and featuring a special route for pedestrians and cyclists only (Tapionraitti).<ref name=\"lahti\"/> Ervi ensured the centre preserved the garden-city character of Tapiola by locating the buildings around an artificial lake, however this plan was considered strange and criticised for its lack of density.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> The centre was later expanded with a pedestrian based shopping centre linked to the Tapionraitti, notable for its undercover, outdoor pathways.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> Later developments showed less consideration for the natural surroundings, though most developments respected the dominance of the existing buildings.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> Tapiola's centre did not expand to such an extent as to rival Helsinki.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/>\n\n== Espoo ==\n{{POV section|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe building of Tapiola and other areas of Espoo was largely influenced by funding from the state.<ref name=Tuomi/> Without state funds, the construction would not have been possible; however the state imposed restrictions on average and maximum size of the apartments and so on.<ref name=Tuomi/>\n\nIn the 1980s, the state of Finland demanded that this all be given, free of charge, to the city of Espoo against the residents' opinions. Espoo decided that the center of Tapiola and the area with the main offices of the [[Mets\u00e4 Group]], [[Finnforest (company)|Finnforest]], Vapo, the main user of the [[peat energy in Finland]], [[Mets\u00e4 Board]] (formerly Mets\u00e4 Botnia), the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK) and Tapiola Constructing and Insurance company here, the [[Tapiola Bank]] company, is not the real Tapiola and may be constructed neglecting all garden city principles. This applied also to the Tapiola Garden hotel constructed by the Tapiola Bank and managed by [[HOK Elanto]].\n\nOriginally, nature was a valuable part of Tapiola. During the last years new high-rise buildings, new shopping areas and underground car parks were situated in the place of massive bedrock. Car parking free of charge has been promised for everybody in the center to promote the private use of cars. The cost is estimated as \u20ac30,000-\u20ac50,000 per car. The [[International Association of Public Transport]] recommends ensuring the management of all costs of private cars to the users instead of tax payers. According to the [[International Association of Public Transport]] the restriction of car parking in the cities is the most effective way to promote [[public transport]].\n\n==Services==\n[[File:Tapiolan keskustaa illalla.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Tapiola commercial centre at Christmas time]]\nFinland's first [[shopping centre]], [[Heikintori]], was opened in Tapiola in 1968. The Tapiola centre has a large selection of services: a [[department store]] ([[Stockmann]]), a book store ([[Akateeminen kirjakauppa]]), [[grocery|groceries]] ([[K-Supermarket]], [[Stockmann Herkku]]), [[Alko]], a [[post office]], [[bank]]s ([[Nordea]], [[Danske Bank]], [[Aktia Savings Bank|Aktia]], [[Osuuspankki]], [[\u00c5landsbanken]], [[Handelsbanken]] and [[Nooa S\u00e4\u00e4st\u00f6pankki]]), [[photography]] stores, barber's shops, and other small businesses. Public services include the Tapiola health centre, a library, an employment bureau, and the Espoo tax bureau.\n\n===Public transportation===\n[[Public transport]] in Tapiola consists of buses and the metro maintained by the [[Helsinki Regional Transport Authority]]. The [[Tapiola metro station]], a station of the [[Helsinki Metro]], opened as a part of [[L\u00e4nsimetro]] (the Western Metro Extension) in November 2017.\n\n===Sports services===\nThe Tapiola centre houses a [[Tapiola swimming pool|swimming pool]] and the Tapiola [[bowling alley]]. Near the centre is also the Tapiola [[tennis]] park. In the Tuulim\u00e4ki defense shelter there are premises for [[wrestling]], [[judo]], shooting (air guns and archery), [[table tennis]], [[gymnastics]] and [[fencing]]. There is also a [[boxing ring]] in connection to the Tuulim\u00e4ki gymnasium. In western Tapiola there is the [[Tapiolan Urheilupuisto|Tapiola sports park]], housing the [[ice hockey rink]], [[ice rink|skating rink]] and the tennis centre. The name Tapiola comes from a competition held by the apartment foundation. The lands originally belonged to the Hagalund mansion.\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:Taskumattitaloja Tapiolassa.jpg|thumb|200px|right|So-called \"[[hip flask]] houses\", designed by [[Viljo Revell]]]]\nIn the centre of Tapiola, next to the central pool, there is the Tapiola Garden [[hotel]], designed by Aarne Ervi. In autumn 2005, the highest [[wood]]en office building in [[Europe]], called the Modular-office, was built in southern Tapiola by next to the [[L\u00e4nsiv\u00e4yl\u00e4]] highway. The building is operated by Finnforest.\n\n[[File:Mini-Tapiola.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tapiola centre has a playground that features miniature versions of some of the iconic buildings in Tapiola.]]\nTapiola is also the name of a Finnish [[insurance]] company, presumably from the location of its headquarters. Among other major companies headquartered in Tapiola are [[Huhtam\u00e4ki]] and [[M-real]].\n\nIn Otsolahti in eastern Tapiola, there is a small [[Marina|boat harbour]] for motor boats.\n\n[[File:Kino Tapiola Espoo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kino Tapiola movie theater by [[Aarne Ervi]]]]\nThe It\u00e4kartano area east of the Tapiola centre is famous for its [[apartment building]]s built in the 1950s, visited by architects from all around the world. The It\u00e4kartano centre operated as the centre of the whole district of Tapiola before the current central area was built. Remnants of this central role include Tapiola's [[Movie theater|cinema]], Kino Tapiola, by the M\u00e4ntyviita street, and office apartments. The area belongs to the Finnish museum bureau's list of significant cultural environments. The highest, oldest, and most significant building in the area is the white, 11-storey-high [[M\u00e4ntytorni]] building.\n\nTo the north of Tapiola centre is a central park, [[Silkkiniitty]], a large grass field reaching to [[Pohjois-Tapiola]]. It is popular among sportspeople and sunbathers.\n\nAccording to the Finnish museum bureau, Tapiola is a unique phenomenon in the world. According to the bureau, new proposed changes to the city planning threaten the existence of this cultural heritage.<ref>\"Kansallismaisema uhattuna\", Vartti, 9 May 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.mfa.fi/tapiola Lukkarinen, P\u00e4ivi: \"Tapiolan puutarhakaupunki\", Finnish museum of building art.] (Last retrieved on 29 June 2007)</ref>\n\nThe [[WeeGee house]], designed by architect [[Aarno Ruusuvuori]] and completed in 1964, is the former printing house of the Weilin+G\u00f6\u00f6s publishing house. It currently hosts the [[Espoo Museum of Modern Art]] (EMMA), the Espoo City Museum, the Helin\u00e4 Rautavaara Museum, the Finnish Museum of Horology, the Finnish Toy Museum, Galleria AARNI, and other cultural institutions.\n\nTapiola has its own metro station, the [[Tapiola metro station]]. The station was opened in November 2017.\n\n== Controversies ==\nThe founder of the Garden City Tapiola, Heikki von Hertzen, considered suing the insurance company Tapiola in 1981 for stealing the trade name of Tapiola. The Garden City had used substantial resources in advertisement.<ref>Kenen vasikalla kynnet\u00e4\u00e4n?

(1971). ''Building a new town: Finland\u2019s new garden city: Tapiola''.

The winning name was suggested by eleven different people, which in Finnish means the home of the Tapio, the forest god from The Kalevala.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n\nTapiola is also the cultural centre of Espoo, as it houses the [[Espoo cultural centre]] (home of the [[Tapiola Sinfonietta]]), the city museum (in the [[WeeGee house]]), and the Espoo City Theatre. The Tapiola [[library]] is located in the cultural centre.\n\n==Urban planning==\nTapiola brought worldwide fame for Finnish urban planning. From its first stages it gained both a national and international reputation for its high class architecture and landscaping, as well as an ideological experiment.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> Tapiola's planners aimed at demonstrating a new direction for Finnish town planning and housing. The aim of the Housing Foundation was to create a garden city which would be a microcosm of Finnish society: all social classes would live there and there would be different types of buildings, ranging from detached houses to terraced and multi-storey blocks.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> The slogan of the project was: \"we do not want to build houses or dwellings but socially healthful surroundings for contemporary man and his family\".<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> Tapiola provided a utopian vision of society and an alternative to what was seen at the time as an oppressive urban environment. In this sense, Tapiola was both an experiment and a model.\n\nTapiola was built on the principles of [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s garden city. The founder of Tapiola, Heikki von Hertzen, believed that it was not possible to create a satisfactory residential centre if the population density exceeds a certain figure.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/> Hertzen's vision for Tapiola, which was originally planned for an area of 600 acres, was to have only 26 residents per acre, and a total of 15,000 people.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/> The ground was divided into four neighbourhood units, separated by green belts, and in the middle was built a main shopping and cultural centre to meet the needs of 30,000 inhabitants (including those of surrounding districts) (Hertzen 1959). An important feature of the Tapiola and garden cities is the development of a self-contained community. This meant that as many jobs as possible had to be provided \u2013 as many as could be at a distance of less than 10&nbsp;km from Helsinki.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n\nThe architects commissioned to plan Tapiola had also been influenced by [[Le Corbusier]]<ref name=Tuomi/> and other propagandists of Modernism, and thus their urban ideals also included tower blocks forming impressive silhouettes, as well as a dense method of building.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> The various residential units which made up Tapiola compromise multi-storey blocks and individual homes, either detached or in rows, introducing a note of variety in the neighbourhood and allowing for the mixing of residents.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/> Combining the architecture of modernism and the ideology of the garden city movement is credited for the huge interest in Tapiola's planning history.\n\nThe main planning features on which Tapiola was built, as synthesised from Von Hertzen's writings, are summarised below:\n*The starting point of planning is the individuality of man and closeness to nature, and the aesthetic value of nature and use of natural contours of the landscape are retained wherever possible.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n*Nature dominates, architecture is secondary. All buildings must harmonise with the natural setting.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/>\n*To be a working town, not a dormitory or nursery, providing as many jobs as possible to its inhabitants.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/>\n*The town should provide for a range of income levels \u2013 \"a community of everyman, where the ordinary worker, successful businessman and university professor can live side-by-side\".<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n*Consistent placing of multi-story buildings with alternatively low housing, resulting in a feeling of spaciousness and variety.<ref name=\"hertzen\"/>\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:TapiolaMantytorniH.jpg|thumb|right|250px|M\u00e4ntytorni apartment building, designed by [[Aarne Ervi]]]]\n[[File:Tapiolan keskusta aamu 280619.png|thumb|right|250px|The park east of the center of Tapiola.]]\nThe development of Tapiola occurred in several stages: the eastern neighbourhood 1952 \u2013 1956, the western neighbourhood, 1957-1960, the town centre 1958-1961-1970, the northern neighbourhood 1958-1967, the southern neighbourhood 1961-1965.<ref name=\"armen\"/> Planning in Tapiola commenced with architect, Otto-Iivari Meurman's site plan and building schedule which were reviewed from 1951 onwards.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> His original plan detailed four neighbourhoods split by two crossing roads and set apart by green belts.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n\nArchitects Aarne Ervi, Viljo Revell, Aulis Blomstedt and Markus Tavio were charged with designing the eastern neighbourhood based on Meurman's plan.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> They were required to design buildings suited to the surrounding environment and the topography of the area.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/>\n\nA housing team was created to appraise the architects' housing designs; this process occurred more frequently during the development of the eastern neighbourhood.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> Team members were from a wide range of fields and included a building engineer, a heating engineer, two independent architects, an electrical engineer, a landscape gardener, a domestic science expert, a child welfare expert, a sociologist, and a housewife.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> This unique team, coupled with the board of the Housing Foundation, assessed housing designs, taking into consideration the needs and desires of future residents from a diverse range of backgrounds.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> The parties had different beliefs and values, which sometimes led to disagreements, for example the Housing Foundation was concerned with economising whilst the home-economics experts were chiefly concerned with the needs of families.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> Thus planning in Tapiola was collaborative and proactive as it involved targeting specific family types and classes, deciding on an ideal lifestyle for these residents, which accordingly influenced their behaviours.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> Many dwellings were designed to house a specific family-type and lifestyle.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> For example, it was perceived to be ideal to have families with children reside in dwellings, at or close to ground level in order for the children to have better access to the outdoors and to parks, whilst a tower block with one-room flats was designed to accommodate childless couples.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/>\n\nMeurman resigned from the board of governors of the Housing Foundation in 1954 following a shift from developing a town with low population density (six persons per acre) and low-rise buildings dwellings, as advocated by Meurman, to more multi-storey buildings and a higher population density (30 persons per acre) as recommended by other architects and the Housing Foundation.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/><ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> This shift was prompted by the need to accommodate a larger population, triggered by the housing shortage in Finland.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> Ervi took up Meurman\u2019s position as master planner.<ref name=\"lahti\"/>\n\nThe development of the eastern neighbourhood led to the implementation of important planning principles such as providing facilities that encourage interaction and foster a sense of community as well as the separation of vehicles and pedestrians.<ref name=\"hertzen_spreiregen\"/> It was also deemed necessary to have a mixture of building types located within the one area to encourage social diversification.<ref name=\"armen\"/> The eastern and western residential areas of Tapiola featured curved streets with lots of varying sizes and positions, whilst the northern neighbourhood designed by architect Pentti Ahola, marked a return to the orthogonal grid plan.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> Ahola's design however, reflected the original aims of Tapiola; that of encouraging social diversification by locating a variety of building types within the one area.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> Financial concerns affected the development of the western area of Tapiola, leading to the construction of housing units that were economically feasible.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/>\n\nIn 1953 Aarne Ervi was awarded the commission to plan the town centre.<ref name=\"lahti\"/> The aim of the town centre's design was to provide all the facilities necessary for a modern urban centre and to maximise social interaction.<ref name=\"tuomi_paatero\"/> The centre included a market square, public square, church, public premises, businesses and an administration building.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> As with the other areas of Tapiola, the centre was designed with consideration for the site's features and terrain as well as to provide an active and versatile environment for pedestrians.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> Roads surrounded the central area producing a modern design completely separate from vehicles and featuring a special route for pedestrians and cyclists only (Tapionraitti).<ref name=\"lahti\"/> Ervi ensured the centre preserved the garden-city character of Tapiola by locating the buildings around an artificial lake, however this plan was considered strange and criticised for its lack of density.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> The centre was later expanded with a pedestrian based shopping centre linked to the Tapionraitti, notable for its undercover, outdoor pathways.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> Later developments showed less consideration for the natural surroundings, though most developments respected the dominance of the existing buildings.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/> Tapiola's centre did not expand to such an extent as to rival Helsinki.<ref name=\"tuomi\"/>\n\n== Espoo ==\n{{POV section|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe building of Tapiola and other areas of Espoo was largely influenced by funding from the state.<ref name=Tuomi/> Without state funds, the construction would not have been possible; however the state imposed restrictions on average and maximum size of the apartments and so on.<ref name=Tuomi/>\n\nIn the 1980s, the state of Finland demanded that this all be given, free of charge, to the city of Espoo against the residents' opinions. Espoo decided that the center of Tapiola and the area with the main offices of the [[Mets\u00e4 Group]], [[Finnforest]], Vapo, the main user of the [[peat energy in Finland]], [[Mets\u00e4 Board]] (formerly Mets\u00e4 Botnia), the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK) and Tapiola Constructing and Insurance company here, the [[Tapiola Bank]] company, is not the real Tapiola and may be constructed neglecting all garden city principles. This applied also to the Tapiola Garden hotel constructed by the Tapiola Bank and managed by [[HOK Elanto]].\n\nOriginally, nature was a valuable part of Tapiola. During the last years new high-rise buildings, new shopping areas and underground car parks were situated in the place of massive bedrock. Car parking free of charge has been promised for everybody in the center to promote the private use of cars. The cost is estimated as \u20ac30,000-\u20ac50,000 per car. The [[International Association of Public Transport]] recommends ensuring the management of all costs of private cars to the users instead of tax payers. According to the [[International Association of Public Transport]] the restriction of car parking in the cities is the most effective way to promote [[public transport]].\n\n==Services==\n[[File:Tapiolan keskustaa illalla.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Tapiola commercial centre at Christmas time]]\nFinland's first [[shopping centre]], [[Heikintori]], was opened in Tapiola in 1968. The Tapiola centre has a large selection of services: a [[department store]] ([[Stockmann]]), a book store ([[Akateeminen kirjakauppa]]), [[grocery|groceries]] ([[K-Supermarket]], [[Stockmann Herkku]]), [[Alko]], a [[post office]], [[bank]]s ([[Nordea]], [[Danske Bank]], [[Aktia Savings Bank|Aktia]], [[Osuuspankki]], [[\u00c5landsbanken]], [[Handelsbanken]] and [[Nooa S\u00e4\u00e4st\u00f6pankki]]), [[photography]] stores, barber's shops, and other small businesses. Public services include the Tapiola health centre, a library, an employment bureau, and the Espoo tax bureau.\n\n===Public transportation===\n[[Public transport]] in Tapiola consists of buses and the metro maintained by the [[Helsinki Regional Transport Authority]]. The [[Tapiola metro station]], a station of the [[Helsinki Metro]], opened as a part of [[L\u00e4nsimetro]] (the Western Metro Extension) in November 2017.\n\n===Sports services===\nThe Tapiola centre houses a [[Tapiola swimming pool|swimming pool]] and the Tapiola [[bowling alley]]. Near the centre is also the Tapiola [[tennis]] park. In the Tuulim\u00e4ki defense shelter there are premises for [[wrestling]], [[judo]], shooting (air guns and archery), [[table tennis]], [[gymnastics]] and [[fencing]]. There is also a [[boxing ring]] in connection to the Tuulim\u00e4ki gymnasium. In western Tapiola there is the [[Tapiolan Urheilupuisto|Tapiola sports park]], housing the [[ice hockey rink]], [[ice rink|skating rink]] and the tennis centre. The name Tapiola comes from a competition held by the apartment foundation. The lands originally belonged to the Hagalund mansion.\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:Taskumattitaloja Tapiolassa.jpg|thumb|200px|right|So-called \"[[hip flask]] houses\", designed by [[Viljo Revell]]]]\nIn the centre of Tapiola, next to the central pool, there is the Tapiola Garden [[hotel]], designed by Aarne Ervi. In autumn 2005, the highest [[wood]]en office building in [[Europe]], called the Modular-office, was built in southern Tapiola by next to the [[L\u00e4nsiv\u00e4yl\u00e4]] highway. The building is operated by Finnforest.\n\n[[File:Mini-Tapiola.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tapiola centre has a playground that features miniature versions of some of the iconic buildings in Tapiola.]]\nTapiola is also the name of a Finnish [[insurance]] company, presumably from the location of its headquarters. Among other major companies headquartered in Tapiola are [[Huhtam\u00e4ki]] and [[M-real]].\n\nIn Otsolahti in eastern Tapiola, there is a small [[Marina|boat harbour]] for motor boats.\n\n[[File:Kino Tapiola Espoo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kino Tapiola movie theater by [[Aarne Ervi]]]]\nThe It\u00e4kartano area east of the Tapiola centre is famous for its [[apartment building]]s built in the 1950s, visited by architects from all around the world. The It\u00e4kartano centre operated as the centre of the whole district of Tapiola before the current central area was built. Remnants of this central role include Tapiola's [[Movie theater|cinema]], Kino Tapiola, by the M\u00e4ntyviita street, and office apartments. The area belongs to the Finnish museum bureau's list of significant cultural environments. The highest, oldest, and most significant building in the area is the white, 11-storey-high [[M\u00e4ntytorni]] building.\n\nTo the north of Tapiola centre is a central park, [[Silkkiniitty]], a large grass field reaching to [[Pohjois-Tapiola]]. It is popular among sportspeople and sunbathers.\n\nAccording to the Finnish museum bureau, Tapiola is a unique phenomenon in the world. According to the bureau, new proposed changes to the city planning threaten the existence of this cultural heritage.<ref>\"Kansallismaisema uhattuna\", Vartti, 9 May 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.mfa.fi/tapiola Lukkarinen, P\u00e4ivi: \"Tapiolan puutarhakaupunki\", Finnish museum of building art.] (Last retrieved on 29 June 2007)</ref>\n\nThe [[WeeGee house]], designed by architect [[Aarno Ruusuvuori]] and completed in 1964, is the former printing house of the Weilin+G\u00f6\u00f6s publishing house. It currently hosts the [[Espoo Museum of Modern Art]] (EMMA), the Espoo City Museum, the Helin\u00e4 Rautavaara Museum, the Finnish Museum of Horology, the Finnish Toy Museum, Galleria AARNI, and other cultural institutions.\n\nTapiola has its own metro station, the [[Tapiola metro station]]. The station was opened in November 2017.\n\n== Controversies ==\nThe founder of the Garden City Tapiola, Heikki von Hertzen, considered suing the insurance company Tapiola in 1981 for stealing the trade name of Tapiola. The Garden City had used substantial resources in advertisement.<ref>Kenen vasikalla kynnet\u00e4\u00e4n?

In this year he was instrumental in not letting the Indian officers shift books from the famous library of the ''British Indian Army Staff College'' (now [[Command and Staff College]]) at [[Quetta]], where Yahya was posted as the only Muslim instructor at the time of partition of India.

The post-1965 situation saw major organisational as well as technical changes in the Pakistan Army. Until 1965 it was thought that divisions could function effectively while getting orders directly from the army's [[General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)|GHQ]]. This idea failed miserably in the 1965 war and the need to have intermediate corps headquarters in between the GHQ and the fighting combat divisions was recognised as a foremost operational necessity after the 1965 war. In 1965 war the Pakistan Army had only one corps headquarters (the [[I Corps (Pakistan)|I Corps]]).<ref name=\"dawn.com\"/>\n\nSoon after the war had started the United States had imposed an embargo on military aid to both India and Pakistan. This embargo did not affect the Indian Army but produced major changes in the Pakistan Army's technical composition. US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] well summed it up when he said, \"Well if you are going to fight, go ahead and fight, but we\u2019re not going to pay for it\".<ref>Dennis Kux, India and the United States: Estranged Democracies (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press, 1992), 239.</ref>\n\nPakistan now turned to China for military aid and the Chinese tank [[T-59 (tank)|T-59]] started replacing the US [[M47 Patton|M-47/48]] tanks as the Pakistan Army's MBT (Main Battle Tank) from 1966. 80 tanks, the first batch of T-59s, a low-grade version of the Russian [[T-54/55]] series were delivered to Pakistan in 1965\u201366. The first batch was displayed in the Joint Services Day Parade on 23 March 1966. The 1965 War had proved that Pakistan Army's tank-infantry ratio was lopsided and more infantry was required. Three more infantry divisions (9, 16 and 17 Divisions) largely equipped with Chinese equipment and popularly referred to by the rank and file as \"The China Divisions\" were raised by the beginning of 1968. Two more corps headquarters: the [[II Corps (Pakistan)|2nd Corps]] Headquarters (Jhelum-Ravi Corridor) and the [[IV Corps (Pakistan)|4th Corps]] Headquarters (Ravi-Sutlej Corridor) were raised, also in [[East Pakistan]] a corps-sized formation titles as the [[Eastern Command (Pakistan)|Eastern Command]] was created.\n\n==President of Pakistan==\n[[File:President Nixon meets with President of Pakistan Yahya Khan - NARA - 194693.tif|thumb|President of Pakistan Yahya Khan with United States President [[Richard Nixon]] in October 1970.]]{{POV section|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] was President of Pakistan for most of the 1960s, but by the end of the decade, popular resentment had boiled over against him. Pakistan had fallen into a state of disarray, and long ongoing civil unrest in East Pakistan evolved into a [[1969 Mass uprising in East Pakistan|mass uprising]] in January of the year. After having held unsuccessful talks with the opposition, Ayub Khan handed over power to Yahya Khan in March, who immediately imposed [[martial law]]. When Yahya assumed the office on 25 March 1969, he inherited a two-decade constitutional problem of inter-provincial ethnic rivalry between the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]-[[Pashtuns|Pashtun]]-[[Muhajir people|Mohajir]] dominated West Pakistan province and the ethnically [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Muslim East Pakistan province. In addition, Yahya also inherited an 11 year old problem of transforming an essentially one man ruled country to a democratic country, which was the ideological basis of the anti-Ayub movement of 1968\u201369. As an Army Chief Yahya had all the capabilities, qualifications and potential. But Yahya inherited an extremely complex problem and was forced to perform the multiple roles of ''caretaker'' head of the country, ''drafter'' of a provisional constitution, resolving the ''One Unit question'', satisfying the frustrations and the sense of exploitation and discrimination successively created in the ''East Wing'' by a series of government policies since 1948.\n\nThe American political scientist [[Lawrence Ziring]] observed that,\n{{quote|text=Yahya Khan has been widely portrayed as a ruthless uncompromising insensitive and grossly inept leader ... While Yahya cannot escape responsibility for these tragic events, it is also on record that he did not act alone ... All the major actors of the period were creatures of a historic legacy and a psycho-political milieu which did not lend itself to accommodation and compromise, to bargaining and a reasonable settlement. Nurtured on conspiracy theories, they were all conditioned to act in a manner that neglected agreeable solutions and promoted violent judgments.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ziring |first=Lawrence |year=1980 |title=Pakistan: The Enigma of Political Development |publisher=Dawson |page=104 |isbn=978-0-7129-0954-9}}</ref>\n}}\n\nYahya Khan attempted to solve Pakistan's constitutional and inter-provincial/regional rivalry problems once he took over power from [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] in March 1969. The tragedy of the whole affair was the fact that all actions that Yahya took, although correct in principle, were too late in timing, and served only to further intensify the political polarisation between the East and West wings.\n* He dissolved the one unit restoring the pre-1955 provinces of West Pakistan\n* He promised free direct, one man one vote, fair elections on adult franchise, a basic human right which had been denied to the Pakistani people since the pre-independence 1946 elections by political inefficiency, double play and intrigue, by civilian governments from 1947 to 1958 and by Ayub's one-man rule from 1958 to 1969.\n\nHowever, dissolution of one unit did not lead to the positive results that it might have led to in case \"One Unit\" was dissolved earlier. Yahya also made an attempt to accommodate the East Pakistanis by abolishing the principle of parity, thereby hoping that greater share in the assembly would redress their wounded ethnic regional pride and ensure the integrity of Pakistan. Instead of satisfying the Bengalis it intensified their separatism since they felt that the west wing had politically suppressed them since 1958. Thus came the rise of anti-West Wing sentiment in the East Wing.\n\nDuring the course of 1968, the [[political pressure]] exerted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had weakened the President Ayub Khan, who had earlier sacked Bhutto after disagreeing with President Ayub's decision to implement on [[Tashkent Agreement]], facilitated by the [[Soviet Union]] to end the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|hostilities]] with India.<ref name=\"Mittal Publications\">{{cite book|last=Akbar|first=M.K.|title=Pakistan from Jinnah to Sharif|year=1997|publisher=Mittal Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8170996743|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BcIniHQAHfUC&pg=PA50&dq=Yahya+Khan#v=onepage&q&f=true}}</ref> To ease the situation, President Ayub had tried reaching out to terms with the major parties, the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) and the [[Awami League]] (AL), but remained unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Mittal Publications\"/> In poor health, President Ayub abrogated his own [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|constitution]] and suddenly resigned from the presidency.<ref name=\"Diane Publication Co.\">{{cite book|last=Peter R.

The socialist [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) had won the [[exclusive mandate]] in the four provinces of Pakistan, but none in the East Pakistan. The [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Pakistan Muslim League]] (PML) led by [[Nurul Amin]] was the only party to have representation from all over the country, though it had failed to gain the mandate to run the government. The Awami League had 160 seats, all won from the East Pakistan; the socialist PPP had secured 81; the conservative PML had 10 seats in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. The [[1970 Pakistani general elections|general elections]]'s results truly reflected the ugly political reality: the division of the Pakistani electorate along regional lines and political polarisation of the country between the two states, East Pakistan and Pakistan.\n\nIn political terms, therefore, Pakistan as a nation stood divided as a result. Series of bilateral talks between PPP and Mujibur Rahman produced no results and were unable to come to an agreement of [[Transfer of Power|transfer of power]]  from to East Pakistan's representatives on the basis of the [[Six point movement|Six-Point]] programme. In Pakistan, the people had felt that the Six-point agenda was a step towards secession.\n\n===Massacres in East Pakistan===\nWhile, the political deadlock remains between the Awami League, PPP, and the military government after the general elections in 1970. During this time, Yahya began coordinating several meetings with his military strategists over the issue in East Pakistan. On 25 March 1971, President Yahya initiated the [[Operation Searchlight|''Searchlight'']] in order to restore the writ of the government. The situation in East Pakistan worsened and the gulf between the two wings now was too wide to be bridged. Agitation was now transformed into a vicious insurgency as Bengali elements of [[Pakistan armed forces]] and [[Pakistan police|Police]] mutinied and formed [[Bangladesh Forces]] along with common people of all classes to launch both unconventional and hit and run operations. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe ''Searchlight'' ordered by Yahya was a violent planned military pacification carried out by the Pakistan Armed Forces to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in erstwhile East Pakistan in March 1971.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bose |first=Sarmila |date=8 October 2005 |title=Anatomy of Violence: Analysis of Civil War in East Pakistan in 1971 |url=http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&leaf=10&filename=9223&filetype=html |journal=[[Economic and Political Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301084941/http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&leaf=10&filename=9223&filetype=html |archive-date=1 March 2007}}</ref> Ordered by the government in Pakistan, this was seen as the sequel to Operation Blitz which had been launched in November 1970.\n\nThe original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on 26 March 1971, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military,<ref>{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |title=Witness to surrender |publisher=University Press |location=Dhaka |year=1997 |pages=63, 228\u20139 |isbn=978-984-05-1373-4}}</ref> within one month.

Yahya's crackdown, however, had led to a [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] within Pakistan and India drew into the war and fought on behalf of Bangladeshis against Pakistan which would later extend in to the Indo Pak war of 1971.\n\nThe aftermaths of this war were mainly that East Pakistan became independent as Bangladesh and India captured approximately 15,000+ square kilometres (5,000+ square miles) of land of West Pakistan (now Pakistan).

But, both Kissinger and Gandhi's aide Jayakar maintained, Gandhi did not respond to these proposals. Kissinger noted that she \"listened to what was, in fact, one of Nixon's better presentations with aloof indifference\" but \"took up none of the points.\" Jayakar pointed out that Gandhi listened to Nixon \"without a single comment, creating an impregnable space so that no real contact was possible.\" She also refrained from assuring that India would follow Pakistan's suit if it withdrew from India's borders.

Rumors of an impending [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by junior military officers against President Yahya swept the country. Yahya became the highest-ranking casualty of the war: to forestall further unrest, on 20 December 1971 he handed over the [[Pakistani presidency|presidency]] and [[Government of Pakistan|government]] to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]\u2014 the ambitious leader of Pakistan's powerful and popular (at that time) [[Pakistan Peoples Party|People's Party]].\n\nWithin hours of Yahya stepping down, President Bhutto reversed [[Judge Advocate General Branch (Pakistan)|JAG]]'s verdict against [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] and instead released him to see him off to London. President Bhutto also signed orders for Yahya's [[House arrest|house confinement]], the man who imprisoned Mujib in the first place. Both actions produced headlines around the world.\n\n==Death==\nYahya remained under house arrest orders until 1979 when he was released from the custody by [[Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|martial law]] administrator General [[Fazle Haq]].

The post-1965 situation saw major organisational as well as technical changes in the Pakistan Army. Until 1965 it was thought that divisions could function effectively while getting orders directly from the army's [[General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)|GHQ]]. This idea failed miserably in the 1965 war and the need to have intermediate corps headquarters in between the GHQ and the fighting combat divisions was recognised as a foremost operational necessity after the 1965 war. In 1965 war the Pakistan Army had only one corps headquarters (the [[I Corps (Pakistan)|I Corps]]).<ref name=\"dawn.com\"/>\n\nSoon after the war had started the United States had imposed an embargo on military aid to both India and Pakistan. This embargo did not affect the Indian Army but produced major changes in the Pakistan Army's technical composition. US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] well summed it up when he said, \"Well if you are going to fight, go ahead and fight, but we\u2019re not going to pay for it\".<ref>Dennis Kux, India and the United States: Estranged Democracies (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press, 1992), 239.</ref>\n\nPakistan now turned to China for military aid and the Chinese tank [[T-59 (tank)|T-59]] started replacing the US [[M47 Patton|M-47/48]] tanks as the Pakistan Army's MBT (Main Battle Tank) from 1966. 80 tanks, the first batch of T-59s, a low-grade version of the Russian [[T-54/55]] series were delivered to Pakistan in 1965\u201366. The first batch was displayed in the Joint Services Day Parade on 23 March 1966. The 1965 War had proved that Pakistan Army's tank-infantry ratio was lopsided and more infantry was required. Three more infantry divisions (9, 16 and 17 Divisions) largely equipped with Chinese equipment and popularly referred to by the rank and file as \"The China Divisions\" were raised by the beginning of 1968. Two more corps headquarters: the [[II Corps (Pakistan)|2nd Corps]] Headquarters (Jhelum-Ravi Corridor) and the [[IV Corps (Pakistan)|4th Corps]] Headquarters (Ravi-Sutlej Corridor) were raised, also in [[East Pakistan]] a corps-sized formation titles as the [[Eastern Command (Pakistan)|Eastern Command]] was created.\n\n==President of Pakistan==\n[[File:President Nixon meets with President of Pakistan Yahya Khan - NARA - 194693.tif|thumb|President of Pakistan Yahya Khan with United States President [[Richard Nixon]] in October 1970.]]{{POV section|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] was President of Pakistan for most of the 1960s, but by the end of the decade, popular resentment had boiled over against him. Pakistan had fallen into a state of disarray, and long ongoing civil unrest in East Pakistan evolved into a [[1969 Mass uprising in East Pakistan|mass uprising]] in January of the year. After having held unsuccessful talks with the opposition, Ayub Khan handed over power to Yahya Khan in March, who immediately imposed [[martial law]]. When Yahya assumed the office on 25 March 1969, he inherited a two-decade constitutional problem of inter-provincial ethnic rivalry between the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]-[[Pashtuns|Pashtun]]-[[Muhajir people|Mohajir]] dominated West Pakistan province and the ethnically [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Muslim East Pakistan province. In addition, Yahya also inherited an 11 year old problem of transforming an essentially one man ruled country to a democratic country, which was the ideological basis of the anti-Ayub movement of 1968\u201369. As an Army Chief Yahya had all the capabilities, qualifications and potential. But Yahya inherited an extremely complex problem and was forced to perform the multiple roles of ''caretaker'' head of the country, ''drafter'' of a provisional constitution, resolving the ''One Unit question'', satisfying the frustrations and the sense of exploitation and discrimination successively created in the ''East Wing'' by a series of government policies since 1948.\n\nThe American political scientist [[Lawrence Ziring]] observed that,\n{{quote|text=Yahya Khan has been widely portrayed as a ruthless uncompromising insensitive and grossly inept leader ... While Yahya cannot escape responsibility for these tragic events, it is also on record that he did not act alone ... All the major actors of the period were creatures of a historic legacy and a psycho-political milieu which did not lend itself to accommodation and compromise, to bargaining and a reasonable settlement. Nurtured on conspiracy theories, they were all conditioned to act in a manner that neglected agreeable solutions and promoted violent judgments.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ziring |first=Lawrence |year=1980 |title=Pakistan: The Enigma of Political Development |publisher=Dawson |page=104 |isbn=978-0-7129-0954-9}}</ref>\n}}\n\nYahya Khan attempted to solve Pakistan's constitutional and inter-provincial/regional rivalry problems once he took over power from [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] in March 1969. The tragedy of the whole affair was the fact that all actions that Yahya took, although correct in principle, were too late in timing, and served only to further intensify the political polarisation between the East and West wings.\n* He dissolved the one unit restoring the pre-1955 provinces of West Pakistan\n* He promised free direct, one man one vote, fair elections on adult franchise, a basic human right which had been denied to the Pakistani people since the pre-independence 1946 elections by political inefficiency, double play and intrigue, by civilian governments from 1947 to 1958 and by Ayub's one-man rule from 1958 to 1969.\n\nHowever, dissolution of one unit did not lead to the positive results that it might have led to in case \"One Unit\" was dissolved earlier. Yahya also made an attempt to accommodate the East Pakistanis by abolishing the principle of parity, thereby hoping that greater share in the assembly would redress their wounded ethnic regional pride and ensure the integrity of Pakistan. Instead of satisfying the Bengalis it intensified their separatism since they felt that the west wing had politically suppressed them since 1958. Thus came the rise of anti-West Wing sentiment in the East Wing.\n\nDuring the course of 1968, the [[political pressure]] exerted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had weakened the President Ayub Khan, who had earlier sacked Bhutto after disagreeing with President Ayub's decision to implement on [[Tashkent Agreement]], facilitated by the [[Soviet Union]] to end the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|hostilities]] with India.<ref name=\"Mittal Publications\">{{cite book|last=Akbar|first=M.K.|title=Pakistan from Jinnah to Sharif|year=1997|publisher=Mittal Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8170996743|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BcIniHQAHfUC&pg=PA50&dq=Yahya+Khan#v=onepage&q&f=true}}</ref> To ease the situation, President Ayub had tried reaching out to terms with the major parties, the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) and the [[Awami League]] (AL), but remained unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Mittal Publications\"/> In poor health, President Ayub abrogated his own [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962|constitution]] and suddenly resigned from the presidency.<ref name=\"Diane Publication Co.\">{{cite book|last=Peter R.

Finally, the [[1970 Pakistani general election|general elections]] were held in all over the country. In East Pakistan, the [[Awami League]] led by [[Mujibur Rahman]] held almost all [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]], but no seat in any of [[Four Provinces (Pakistan)|four provinces]] of [[West Pakistan]]. The socialist [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) had won the [[exclusive mandate]] in the four provinces of Pakistan, but none in the East Pakistan. The [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Pakistan Muslim League]] (PML) led by [[Nurul Amin]] was the only party to have representation from all over the country, though it had failed to gain the mandate to run the government. The Awami League had 160 seats, all won from the East Pakistan; the socialist PPP had secured 81; the conservative PML had 10 seats in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. The [[1970 Pakistani general elections|general elections]]'s results truly reflected the ugly political reality: the division of the Pakistani electorate along regional lines and political polarisation of the country between the two states, East Pakistan and Pakistan.\n\nIn political terms, therefore, Pakistan as a nation stood divided as a result. Series of bilateral talks between PPP and Mujibur Rahman produced no results and were unable to come to an agreement of [[Transfer of Power|transfer of power]]  from to East Pakistan's representatives on the basis of the [[Six point movement|Six-Point]] programme. In Pakistan, the people had felt that the Six-point agenda was a step towards secession.\n\n===Massacres in East Pakistan===\nWhile, the political deadlock remains between the Awami League, PPP, and the military government after the general elections in 1970. During this time, Yahya began coordinating several meetings with his military strategists over the issue in East Pakistan. On 25 March 1971, President Yahya initiated the [[Operation Searchlight|''Searchlight'']] in order to restore the writ of the government. The situation in East Pakistan worsened and the gulf between the two wings now was too wide to be bridged. Agitation was now transformed into a vicious insurgency as Bengali elements of [[Pakistan armed forces]] and [[Pakistan police|Police]] mutinied and formed [[Bangladesh Forces]] along with common people of all classes to launch both unconventional and hit and run operations. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nThe ''Searchlight'' ordered by Yahya was a violent planned military pacification carried out by the Pakistan Armed Forces to curb the Bengali nationalist movement in erstwhile East Pakistan in March 1971.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bose |first=Sarmila |date=8 October 2005 |title=Anatomy of Violence: Analysis of Civil War in East Pakistan in 1971 |url=http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&leaf=10&filename=9223&filetype=html |journal=[[Economic and Political Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301084941/http://www.epw.org.in/showArticles.php?root=2005&leaf=10&filename=9223&filetype=html |archive-date=1 March 2007}}</ref> Ordered by the government in Pakistan, this was seen as the sequel to Operation Blitz which had been launched in November 1970.\n\nThe original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on 26 March 1971, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military,<ref>{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |title=Witness to surrender |publisher=University Press |location=Dhaka |year=1997 |pages=63, 228\u20139 |isbn=978-984-05-1373-4}}</ref> within one month.

The following is a transcription of the 3rd Battalion After Action Report for D-Day. Photograph shows the D-Day 16th Infantry Regimental Combat Team (RCT) commanders taken just prior to the Normandy invasion.\n\n  ''HEADQUARTERS THIRD BATTALION''\n  ''SIXTEENTH INFANTRY''\n  ''APO #1  U.S. ARMY''\n  ''23 June 1944''\n  \n  ''SUBJECT: ''Unit Report on D-Day Operations''\n  ''TO: ''Commanding Officer, 16th Infantry''\n \n        ''At 1800 hours on 5 June 1944, the Third Battalion, 16th Infantry, and attached units on board \u201cSS Empire Anvil\u201d departed from the port of embarkation and in convoy headed for the coast of France. At 0315 hours, 6 June 1944, with the men of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cL\u201d Companies loaded six LCA's per company and the order,\u2018Lower boats\u2019, was given. These men were to make up the assault companies in the landing on Fox Green Beach.''\n        ''The objectives of the 3rd Battalion were to neutralize the beach defenses then swing east clearing the beach defenses and enemy strong points between beach exit and Port en Bessin; then seize and prepare to defend high ground 3000 yards south of Port en Bessin; contact the British on left; and build road blocks on likely approaches.''\n        ''The assault wave craft headed for their rendezvous area in a rough sea awaiting the minute to cross the LD and make the run to the beach. Finally the navy gave the signal and the crafts headed for shore landing the men thirty minutes late because of heavy seas and poor visibility. At this time, 0700 hours, all naval shelling had ceased, the air corps had failed to knock out ant beach defenses, and there was no supporting fire the beach defenses where the battalion landed. Supporting tanks were also late \u2013 landing several minutes after our assault sections. The DD tanks never did reach the shore. As these craft approached shore they were greeted with all types of deadly fire.''\n        ''\u201cL\u201d Company landed on the right of Fox Green beach which was near the vicinity of Colleville Sur Mer. The company consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th assault sections and company headquarters section. The 4th section craft capsized in rough water shortly after debarking from the transport. The assault landing craft touched in front of several rows of underwater obstacles \u2013 element \u201cC\u201d, tetrahedrons, and hedgehogs. The personnel waded and struggled ashore by crossing 200 yards of open beach under intense enemy fire \u2013 machine gun, rifle, mortar, artillery, and anti-tank weapons. Many men were hit and injured while still in the water. The company gained comparative shelter of a vertical cliff where section leaders attempted to reorganize their men amid much confusion caused by enemy fire on the beach. The company losses at this stage were high \u2013 4th section was missing, 1st section landing craft was hit by artillery fire and 19 men of that section were missing. The wounded in the other sections was as follows: 2nd Section \u2013 5, 3rd section \u2013 10, company headquarters \u2013 4. These losses reduced the strength from 187 to 123. Company aid-men distinguished themselves by treating wounded while exposed to enemy fire.''\n        ''\u201cI\u201d Company was to be the left flank assault company but from the rendezvous area the navy headed their craft, by mistake, toward a beach west of Port en Bessin. The alert Company Commander of \u201cI\u201d Company noticed the navy's error as they were about to land and ordered the boats to be taken back to the correct beach. On the way back the craft carrying Lt. Funcheon and the 4th section and the craft with Lt. Cunningham and the 5th section were swamped and started to sink. The personnel were picked up by a patrol boat and taken to another ship. The time was now 0700 hours when Captain Richmond contacted Lt. Col. Horner, the Battalion Commander, a told him of the situation. The Battalion Commander then ordered \u201cK\u201d Company to take over \u201cI\u201d Company's mission.''\n        ''At 0705 hours \u201cK\u201d Company came in on Fox Green beach in six boats. All boats made the landing safely but two were blown up but mines shortly thereafter. Machine gun and sniper fire was sweeping the beach. Enemy mortar and artillery fire had zeroed in on the beach causing heavy casualties. \u201cK\u201d Company being pinned down on the beach upon landing, the riflemen took up positions behind an embankment at the high tide mark. Lt. Brandt, Company Executive Officer, was wounded and later killed by the same shell that mortally wounded Captain Prucnal, the Company Commander, who was trying to reorganize his company which was spread out over the beach. Lt. Zyblut was wounded while coming in from his landing craft. Lt. Robinson was killed by a sniper while directing orders for the attack.''\n        ''The navy landed the C.P. group by mistake with the assault waves of the 2nd Battalion. This group was pinned down on the beach until it was able to work its way down to our sector many hours later. This group was led by Major White.''\n        ''The personnel of Company \u201cM\u201d made up the third wave which landed at 0750. The situation on the beach made it impossible to approach the beach in prearranged orders. Despite enemy machine gun, sniper, and artillery fire, \u201cM\u201d Company reached the beach with few casualties. The officers attempted to reorganize their sections on the beach which was by this time crowded with men from the Infantry, Engineers, and Artillery. The 1st section of machine guns, under Lt. Lazo, effectively engaged one of the pillboxes the enemy was manning and forced it to close it embrasure.  This support made it possible for elements of Company \u201cK\u201d and Company \u201cL\u201d to work their way up to one of the strong points later. Lt. Booth managed to get one section into position from which it knocked out a fortified position where machine gun fire was coming and had pinned riflemen down on the beach. The platoon sergeant reorganized the 2nd section.''\n        ''Under trying conditions, Lt. McCarty assembled his mortar platoon; had men collecting ammunition on the beach and placed his 81's in position to support the attack that was to follow. When \u201cI\u201d Company landed Lt. McCarthy place grenade launcher fire upon emplacements delivering fire upon the boats landing.''\n        ''At 0800 hours the four remaining boats of Company \u201cI\u201d attempter a landing. The CP boat hit a mine and received machinegun fire directly in the boat. The 2nd and 3rd section boats received direct artillery hits or blew up on a mine. The remaining boat landed safely. Although personnel on the beach had been pinned down they managed to set up a base of fire along the wall.\n        ''At this point Captain Richmond organized as many men as he could locate from the battalion among the men now assembled on the beach, taking shelter of the small rise of the beach which gave protection from direct enemy fire. A section of machine guns under Lt. Booth of Company \u201cM\u201d was ready to follow this assault group.  By this time Lt. McCarthy had four of his 81mm mortars in battery position under the cliff and sent observers with the rifle groups about to work their way to the strong points on top of the ridge.''\n        ''Captain Armellino was wounded while exposing himself to enemy fire in order to direct tank fire upon his company\u2019s objectives.''\n        ''When Captain Richmond attempted to reorganize the battalion the situation was as follows: Lt. Cutler, commanding Company \u201cL\u201d, had already ordered [[Jimmie W. Monteith|Lt. Monteith]] to take his section up the draw; Lt. Williams to take his section up the right side of the draw. These sections slowly advanced through mine fields, wire, and were subjected to sniper and machine gun fire. Yard by yard they moved forward, killing the enemy and also receiving casualties. After these sections finally reached the top of the draw they took up a hasty defensive positions until they made contact. They then drove forward across the road and dug in waiting orders of the Company Commander. Lt Stumbaugh had led his section up the draw and then worked their way, against much opposition and fire, to the top of the high ground on the right and later contacted \u201cL\u201d Company which was in position on the left.''\n        ''While the action was going on there were on the beach about 15 men from Company \u201cI\u201d under Lt. Kemp and Lt. Godwin, in front of the left strong point. In the center facing the draw were two sections of \u201cK\u201d Company men under Lt. Robinson. On the right was a platoon of men from the 116th Infantry plus Lt. Klenk and part of his men. It was from these positions that the men drove forward and up the Hill when the attack started.''\n        ''As they pushed off, Lt. Kemp's men started up the high ground to the fortified position. Just before reaching it the Germans started to roll grenades down the hill, causing them to back down. Then with the support of tank fire they started up again. They had nearly reached the top and the Naval Support guns opened fire on the position requiring them to drop back again. Finally when this supporting fire was lifted they took the position.  By this time Lt. Klenk and his men had taken the right strong point and came down the hill across the draw and up the left hill to aid in the attack with Lt. Kemp on the left strong point.''\n        ''The two sections of Company \u201cK\u201d pushed forward and mopped up the draw taking prisoners and knocking out machine guns. Losses were sustained because of some stubborn resistance.''\n        ''Upon reaching the top of the high ground contact was made with the two sections of \u201cL\u201d Company with Lt. Cutler and Lt. Stumbaugh's section. LT Klenk took twenty men and protected the left flank by placing his men in trenches on the left aided by a machine gun section placed in position on the left.''\n        ''Lt. Kemp took a section in the rear of the forward sections over to the high ground to mop up some Germans placing scattered machine gun fire on troops coming up the draw.''\n        ''During all this action many Germans were taken prisoner. On this high ground reorganization was conducted and replacements which landed were brought up. Patrol were sent out and machine guns were emplaced.''\n        ''A patrol from Company \u201cL\u201d (Mulander, Butt, and O\u2019Dell) was captured in Cabourg when surrounded by 52 of the enemy. Pfc Mulander, who speaks German, talked the Germans into surrendering by telling them how helpless their plight was. He then led the 52 Germans back through our lines and turned them over to the 2nd Battalion, 18th Infantry.''\n        ''In the meantime Captain Richmond sent out a strong combat patrol under Lt. Williams to take Le gd Hameau which was located about 1500 yards inland and to the east. After a lapse of one hour he followed the combat patrol up with the remainder of his combined force which totaled 104 men \u201379 from \u201cL\u201d Company and the rest from Companies \u201cI\u201d and \u201cK\u201d. Kt. Williams outposted the main road with five riflemen and a light machine gun. After this had been done, a German scout car approached the town and was halted. Of its two occupants one was taken prisoner and the other killed as he tried to escape. Pfc Hodge who was manning a light machine gun capture two staff cars and one scout car which belong to the enemy. Valuable papers, maps, and a complete radio set was taken from these cars.''\n        ''At about 2000 hours Lt. Col. Horner ordered the battalion to take up defensive positions around Le gd Hameau for the night \u2013 \u201cK\u201d Company on the left, \u201cL\u201d Company on the right, and \u201cI\u201d Company to the from. Many enemy infiltrating patrols were encountered and driven off. The following morning small enemy groups were mopped up behind our positions. This battalion then prepared to move on.''\n        ''During the night 17 tanks from the 741st Tank Battalion were led up the draw to our positions where they prepared to support our advance the following day.''\n  \n  ''For the Battalion Commander:''\n  ''KARL E.

The following is a transcription of the 3rd Battalion After Action Report for D-Day. Photograph shows the D-Day 16th Infantry Regimental Combat Team (RCT) commanders taken just prior to the Normandy invasion.\n\n  ''HEADQUARTERS THIRD BATTALION\n  ''SIXTEENTH INFANTRY\n  ''APO #1  U.S. ARMY\n  ''23 June 1944\n  ''\n  ''SUBJECT: ''Unit Report on D-Day Operations\n  ''TO: ''Commanding Officer, 16th Infantry\n \n        ''At 1800 hours on 5 June 1944, the Third Battalion, 16th Infantry, and attached units on board \u201cSS Empire Anvil\u201d departed from the port of embarkation and in convoy headed for the coast of France. At 0315 hours, 6 June 1944, with the men of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cL\u201d Companies loaded six LCA's per company and the order,\u2018Lower boats\u2019, was given. These men were to make up the assault companies in the landing on Fox Green Beach.\n        ''The objectives of the 3rd Battalion were to neutralize the beach defenses then swing east clearing the beach defenses and enemy strong points between beach exit and Port en Bessin; then seize and prepare to defend high ground 3000 yards south of Port en Bessin; contact the British on left; and build road blocks on likely approaches.\n        ''The assault wave craft headed for their rendezvous area in a rough sea awaiting the minute to cross the LD and make the run to the beach. Finally the navy gave the signal and the crafts headed for shore landing the men thirty minutes late because of heavy seas and poor visibility. At this time, 0700 hours, all naval shelling had ceased, the air corps had failed to knock out ant beach defenses, and there was no supporting fire the beach defenses where the battalion landed. Supporting tanks were also late \u2013 landing several minutes after our assault sections. The DD tanks never did reach the shore. As these craft approached shore they were greeted with all types of deadly fire.\n        ''\u201cL\u201d Company landed on the right of Fox Green beach which was near the vicinity of Colleville Sur Mer. The company consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th assault sections and company headquarters section. The 4th section craft capsized in rough water shortly after debarking from the transport. The assault landing craft touched in front of several rows of underwater obstacles \u2013 element \u201cC\u201d, tetrahedrons, and hedgehogs. The personnel waded and struggled ashore by crossing 200 yards of open beach under intense enemy fire \u2013 machine gun, rifle, mortar, artillery, and anti-tank weapons. Many men were hit and injured while still in the water. The company gained comparative shelter of a vertical cliff where section leaders attempted to reorganize their men amid much confusion caused by enemy fire on the beach. The company losses at this stage were high \u2013 4th section was missing, 1st section landing craft was hit by artillery fire and 19 men of that section were missing. The wounded in the other sections was as follows: 2nd Section \u2013 5, 3rd section \u2013 10, company headquarters \u2013 4. These losses reduced the strength from 187 to 123. Company aid-men distinguished themselves by treating wounded while exposed to enemy fire. \n        ''\u201cI\u201d Company was to be the left flank assault company but from the rendezvous area the navy headed their craft, by mistake, toward a beach west of Port en Bessin. The alert Company Commander of \u201cI\u201d Company noticed the navy's error as they were about to land and ordered the boats to be taken back to the correct beach. On the way back the craft carrying Lt. Funcheon and the 4th section and the craft with Lt. Cunningham and the 5th section were swamped and started to sink. The personnel were picked up by a patrol boat and taken to another ship. The time was now 0700 hours when Captain Richmond contacted Lt. Col. Horner, the Battalion Commander, a told him of the situation. The Battalion Commander then ordered \u201cK\u201d Company to take over \u201cI\u201d Company's mission.\n        ''At 0705 hours \u201cK\u201d Company came in on Fox Green beach in six boats. All boats made the landing safely but two were blown up but mines shortly thereafter. Machine gun and sniper fire was sweeping the beach. Enemy mortar and artillery fire had zeroed in on the beach causing heavy casualties. \u201cK\u201d Company being pinned down on the beach upon landing, the riflemen took up positions behind an embankment at the high tide mark. Lt. Brandt, Company Executive Officer, was wounded and later killed by the same shell that mortally wounded Captain Prucnal, the Company Commander, who was trying to reorganize his company which was spread out over the beach. Lt. Zyblut was wounded while coming in from his landing craft. Lt. Robinson was killed by a sniper while directing orders for the attack.\n        ''The navy landed the C.P. group by mistake with the assault waves of the 2nd Battalion. This group was pinned down on the beach until it was able to work its way down to our sector many hours later. This group was led by Major White.\n        ''The personnel of Company \u201cM\u201d made up the third wave which landed at 0750. The situation on the beach made it impossible to approach the beach in prearranged orders. Despite enemy machine gun, sniper, and artillery fire, \u201cM\u201d Company reached the beach with few casualties. The officers attempted to reorganize their sections on the beach which was by this time crowded with men from the Infantry, Engineers, and Artillery. The 1st section of machine guns, under Lt. Lazo, effectively engaged one of the pillboxes the enemy was manning and forced it to close it embrasure.  This support made it possible for elements of Company \u201cK\u201d and Company \u201cL\u201d to work their way up to one of the strong points later. Lt. Booth managed to get one section into position from which it knocked out a fortified position where machine gun fire was coming and had pinned riflemen down on the beach. The platoon sergeant reorganized the 2nd section.\n        ''Under trying conditions, Lt. McCarty assembled his mortar platoon; had men collecting ammunition on the beach and placed his 81's in position to support the attack that was to follow. When \u201cI\u201d Company landed Lt. McCarthy place grenade launcher fire upon emplacements delivering fire upon the boats landing.\n        ''At 0800 hours the four remaining boats of Company \u201cI\u201d attempter a landing. The CP boat hit a mine and received machinegun fire directly in the boat. The 2nd and 3rd section boats received direct artillery hits or blew up on a mine. The remaining boat landed safely. Although personnel on the beach had been pinned down they managed to set up a base of fire along the wall.\n        ''At this point Captain Richmond organized as many men as he could locate from the battalion among the men now assembled on the beach, taking shelter of the small rise of the beach which gave protection from direct enemy fire. A section of machine guns under Lt. Booth of Company \u201cM\u201d was ready to follow this assault group.  By this time Lt. McCarthy had four of his 81mm mortars in battery position under the cliff and sent observers with the rifle groups about to work their way to the strong points on top of the ridge.\n        ''Captain Armellino was wounded while exposing himself to enemy fire in order to direct tank fire upon his company\u2019s objectives.\n        ''When Captain Richmond attempted to reorganize the battalion the situation was as follows: Lt. Cutler, commanding Company \u201cL\u201d, had already ordered [[Jimmie W. Monteith|Lt. Monteith]] to take his section up the draw; Lt. Williams to take his section up the right side of the draw. These sections slowly advanced through mine fields, wire, and were subjected to sniper and machine gun fire. Yard by yard they moved forward, killing the enemy and also receiving casualties. After these sections finally reached the top of the draw they took up a hasty defensive positions until they made contact. They then drove forward across the road and dug in waiting orders of the Company Commander. Lt Stumbaugh had led his section up the draw and then worked their way, against much opposition and fire, to the top of the high ground on the right and later contacted \u201cL\u201d Company which was in position on the left.\n        ''While the action was going on there were on the beach about 15 men from Company \u201cI\u201d under Lt. Kemp and Lt. Godwin, in front of the left strong point. In the center facing the draw were two sections of \u201cK\u201d Company men under Lt. Robinson. On the right was a platoon of men from the 116th Infantry plus Lt. Klenk and part of his men. It was from these positions that the men drove forward and up the Hill when the attack started.\n        ''As they pushed off, Lt. Kemp's men started up the high ground to the fortified position. Just before reaching it the Germans started to roll grenades down the hill, causing them to back down. Then with the support of tank fire they started up again. They had nearly reached the top and the Naval Support guns opened fire on the position requiring them to drop back again. Finally when this supporting fire was lifted they took the position.  By this time Lt. Klenk and his men had taken the right strong point and came down the hill across the draw and up the left hill to aid in the attack with Lt. Kemp on the left strong point.\n        ''The two sections of Company \u201cK\u201d pushed forward and mopped up the draw taking prisoners and knocking out machine guns. Losses were sustained because of some stubborn resistance.\n        ''Upon reaching the top of the high ground contact was made with the two sections of \u201cL\u201d Company with Lt. Cutler and Lt. Stumbaugh's section. LT Klenk took twenty men and protected the left flank by placing his men in trenches on the left aided by a machine gun section placed in position on the left.\n        ''Lt. Kemp took a section in the rear of the forward sections over to the high ground to mop up some Germans placing scattered machine gun fire on troops coming up the draw.\n        ''During all this action many Germans were taken prisoner. On this high ground reorganization was conducted and replacements which landed were brought up. Patrol were sent out and machine guns were emplaced.\n        ''A patrol from Company \u201cL\u201d (Mulander, Butt, and O\u2019Dell) was captured in Cabourg when surrounded by 52 of the enemy. Pfc Mulander, who speaks German, talked the Germans into surrendering by telling them how helpless their plight was. He then led the 52 Germans back through our lines and turned them over to the 2nd Battalion, 18th Infantry.\n        ''In the meantime Captain Richmond sent out a strong combat patrol under Lt. Williams to take Le gd Hameau which was located about 1500 yards inland and to the east. After a lapse of one hour he followed the combat patrol up with the remainder of his combined force which totaled 104 men \u201379 from \u201cL\u201d Company and the rest from Companies \u201cI\u201d and \u201cK\u201d. Kt. Williams outposted the main road with five riflemen and a light machine gun. After this had been done, a German scout car approached the town and was halted. Of its two occupants one was taken prisoner and the other killed as he tried to escape. Pfc Hodge who was manning a light machine gun capture two staff cars and one scout car which belong to the enemy. Valuable papers, maps, and a complete radio set was taken from these cars.\n        ''At about 2000 hours Lt. Col. Horner ordered the battalion to take up defensive positions around Le gd Hameau for the night \u2013 \u201cK\u201d Company on the left, \u201cL\u201d Company on the right, and \u201cI\u201d Company to the from. Many enemy infiltrating patrols were encountered and driven off. The following morning small enemy groups were mopped up behind our positions. This battalion then prepared to move on.\n        ''During the night 17 tanks from the 741st Tank Battalion were led up the draw to our positions where they prepared to support our advance the following day.\n  \n  ''For the Battalion Commander: \n  ''KARL E.

Clinton's defense counsel argued that Clinton's grand jury testimony had too many inconsistencies to be a clear case of perjury, that the investigation and impeachment had been tainted by partisan political bias, that the President's approval rating of more than 70 percent indicated his ability to govern had not been impaired by the scandal, and that the managers had ultimately presented \"an unsubstantiated, circumstantial case that does not meet the constitutional standard to remove the President from office\".<ref name=\"historyplace\" /> January 22 and 23 were devoted to questions from members of the Senate to the House managers and Clinton's defense counsel. Under the rules, all questions (over 150) were to be written down and given to Rehnquist to read to the party being questioned.\n\nOn January 25, Senator [[Robert Byrd]] moved for dismissals of both articles of impeachment for lack of merit. On the following day, Representative Bryant moved to call witnesses to the trial, a question the Senate had scrupulously avoided to that point. In both cases, the Senate voted to deliberate on the question in private session, rather than public, televised procedure. On January 27, the Senate voted on both motions in public session; the motion to dismiss failed on a nearly party line vote of 56\u201344, while the motion to depose witnesses passed by the same margin. A day later, the Senate voted down motions to move directly to a vote on the articles of impeachment and to suppress videotaped depositions of the witnesses from public release, Senator [[Russ Feingold]] again voting with the Republicans.\n\nOver three days, February 1\u20133, House managers took videotaped closed-door depositions from Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's friend [[Vernon Jordan]], and White House aide [[Sidney Blumenthal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/03/us/president-s-trial-overview-senators-see-lewinsky-tape-vernon-jordan-testifies.html|title=THE PRESIDENT'S TRIAL: THE OVERVIEW; Senators See Lewinsky Tape And Vernon Jordan Testifies|first=Francis X.|last=Clines|work=The New York Times|date=February 3, 1999|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}</ref> On February 4, however, the Senate voted 70\u201330 that excerpting these videotapes would suffice as testimony, rather than calling live witnesses to appear at trial. The videos were played in the Senate on February 6, featuring 30 excerpts of Lewinsky discussing her affidavit in the Paula Jones case, the hiding of small gifts Clinton had given her, and his involvement in procurement of a job for Lewinsky.\n\nOn February 8, closing arguments were presented with each side allotted a three-hour time slot. On the President's behalf, White House Counsel Charles Ruff declared:\n{{quote|There is only one question before you, albeit a difficult one, one that is a question of fact and law and constitutional theory. Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to retain the President in office? Putting aside partisan animus, if you can honestly say that it would not, that those liberties are safe in his hands, then you must vote to acquit.<ref name=\"historyplace\" />}}\n\nChief Prosecutor Henry Hyde countered:\n{{quote|A failure to convict will make the statement that lying under oath, while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that serious{{nbsp}}... We have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette, but only if you are the President{{nbsp}}... And now let us all take our place in history on the side of honor, and, oh, yes, let right be done.<ref name=\"historyplace\" />}}\n\n=== Verdict ===\n\nOn February 9, after voting against a public deliberation on the verdict, the Senate began closed-door deliberations instead. On February 12, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] emerged from its closed deliberations and voted on the articles of impeachment. A [[supermajority|two-thirds vote]], 67 votes, would have been necessary to convict on either charge and remove the President from office. The perjury charge was defeated with 45 votes for conviction and 55 against, and the [[obstruction of justice]] charge was defeated with 50 for conviction and 50 against.<ref name=WaPo02131999/><ref name=CNN21299>{{cite news| title=How the senators voted on impeachment| date=February 12, 1999| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.vote/| publisher=CNN| accessdate=June 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=ClintonDA>{{cite web| url=https://millercenter.org/president/clinton/domestic-affairs| last=Riley| first=Russell L.| title=Bill Clinton: Domestic Affairs| publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref> Senator [[Arlen Specter]] voted \"[[not proven|not proved]]\"{{efn|a verdict used in [[Scots law]]}} for both charges,<ref>{{cite news | author = Specter, Arlen | title = Senator Specter's closed-door impeachment statement | date = February 12, 1999 | url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.statements/specter.html | publisher = CNN | accessdate = March 13, 2008 | quote = My position in the matter is that the case has not been proved.

A day later, the Senate voted down motions to move directly to a vote on the articles of impeachment and to suppress videotaped depositions of the witnesses from public release, Senator [[Russ Feingold]] again voting with the Republicans.\n\nOver three days, February 1\u20133, House managers took videotaped closed-door depositions from Monica Lewinsky, Clinton's friend [[Vernon Jordan]], and White House aide [[Sidney Blumenthal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/03/us/president-s-trial-overview-senators-see-lewinsky-tape-vernon-jordan-testifies.html|title=THE PRESIDENT'S TRIAL: THE OVERVIEW; Senators See Lewinsky Tape And Vernon Jordan Testifies|first=Francis X.|last=Clines|work=The New York Times|date=February 3, 1999|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}</ref> On February 4, however, the Senate voted 70\u201330 that excerpting these videotapes would suffice as testimony, rather than calling live witnesses to appear at trial. The videos were played in the Senate on February 6, featuring 30 excerpts of Lewinsky discussing her affidavit in the Paula Jones case, the hiding of small gifts Clinton had given her, and his involvement in procurement of a job for Lewinsky.\n\nOn February 8, closing arguments were presented with each side allotted a three-hour time slot. On the President's behalf, White House Counsel Charles Ruff declared:\n{{quote|There is only one question before you, albeit a difficult one, one that is a question of fact and law and constitutional theory. Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to retain the President in office? Putting aside partisan animus, if you can honestly say that it would not, that those liberties are safe in his hands, then you must vote to acquit.<ref name=\"historyplace\" />}}\n\nChief Prosecutor Henry Hyde countered:\n{{quote|A failure to convict will make the statement that lying under oath, while unpleasant and to be avoided, is not all that serious{{nbsp}}... We have reduced lying under oath to a breach of etiquette, but only if you are the President{{nbsp}}... And now let us all take our place in history on the side of honor, and, oh, yes, let right be done.<ref name=\"historyplace\" />}}\n\n=== Verdict ===\n\nOn February 9, after voting against a public deliberation on the verdict, the Senate began closed-door deliberations instead. On February 12, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] emerged from its closed deliberations and voted on the articles of impeachment. A [[supermajority|two-thirds vote]], 67 votes, would have been necessary to convict on either charge and remove the President from office. The perjury charge was defeated with 45 votes for conviction and 55 against, and the [[obstruction of justice]] charge was defeated with 50 for conviction and 50 against.<ref name=WaPo02131999/><ref name=CNN21299>{{cite news| title=How the senators voted on impeachment| date=February 12, 1999| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.vote/| publisher=CNN| accessdate=June 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=ClintonDA>{{cite web| url=https://millercenter.org/president/clinton/domestic-affairs| last=Riley| first=Russell L.| title=Bill Clinton: Domestic Affairs| publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia| location=Charlottesville, Virginia| accessdate=June 12, 2019}}</ref> Senator [[Arlen Specter]] voted \"[[not proven|not proved]]\"{{efn|a verdict used in [[Scots law]]}} for both charges,<ref>{{cite news | author = Specter, Arlen | title = Senator Specter's closed-door impeachment statement | date = February 12, 1999 | url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/12/senate.statements/specter.html | publisher = CNN | accessdate = March 13, 2008 | quote = My position in the matter is that the case has not been proved.

The President has dodged perjury by calculated evasion and poor interrogation.
