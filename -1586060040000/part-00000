The game borrows heavily from the [[paddleball]] concept and consists of players using the Wii Remote to hit the character, Zip, towards obstacles and collectable items.\n\n==Plot==\nThe game is set on the fictional Suthon Island. It is said to hold the power to protect the world from harm, which was protected by a large palm tree and watched over by the nature spirits in the island. Before the game, the antagonist, Omminus, takes over the island in order to rule the world. As a result, the palm tree begins to wither and the princess becomes ill. The leader of the nature spirits recalls an old legend about a hero using sacred pearls to restore the peace. He finds the treasure chest where the hero, Zip, resides. Zip, and a friend from the neighboring Eesturn Island, Pip, set out to retrieve the pearls and defeat Omminus.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Worlds and stages===\nThe game consists of eight worlds, each of which consists of three levels. In each level, the screen will scroll constantly in one direction. The direction depends on the stage and Wii Remote Hand. Players must collect a pearl to complete the level. To collect a pearl, players will need to find three medals. Medals are hidden within each stage, and are sometimes carried by enemies that the player must hit. If the player falls back to the edge of the screen for too long, he/she will get eaten by Hydracoil, and will lose a life. If the player loses all of his/her lives, the game is over. If the players collects a pearl in all three levels, a boss stage is unlocked in each world. The world is cleared after the player beats the boss.\n\n===Mini-games===\nIf the player gets an A ranking in all three stages of a specific world, a mini-game option will appear on the world's selection screen. Each mini-game shows instructions on how to play it. If playing with a friend, players will see a gold icon for a competitive game and a blue icon for cooperative play.\n\n==Reception==\n''FlingSmash'' received mixed reviews. However, it has a Metacritic score of 48 out of 100.\n\n''FlingSmash'' is one of [https://scott-the-woz.fandom.com Scott The Woz]'s favorite games as it is featured in a lot of his [[YouTube]] videos.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> December 26, 1893{{spaced ndash}}September 9, 1976), also known as '''Chairman Mao''', was a Chinese [[Communism|communist]] [[revolutionary]] who became the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), which he ruled as the [[chairman of the Communist Party of China]] from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976. Ideologically a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]], his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as [[Maoism]].\n\nMao was the son of a prosperous peasant in [[Shaoshan]], Hunan. He had a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] and an [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919. He later adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at [[Peking University]], and became a founding member of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), leading the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in 1927. During the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]], led the [[Jiangxi Soviet]]'s radical land policies, and ultimately became head of the CPC during the [[Long March]]. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), China's civil war resumed after [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's surrender]] and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the [[Nationalist government]], which withdrew to [[Taiwan]].\n\nOn October 1, 1949, Mao [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|proclaimed the foundation of the PRC]], a [[single-party state]] controlled by the CPC. In the following years he solidified his control through [[Chinese Land Reform|campaigns against landlords]], [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries|suppression of \"counter-revolutionaries\"]], \"[[Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns]]\" and through a psychological victory in the [[Korean War]], which altogether caused the deaths of several-million Chinese. From 1953\u20131958, Mao played an important role in enforcing [[planned economy]] in China, constructing the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|first Constitution of the PRC]], launching the [[Industry of China|industrialisation program]], and initiating the \"[[Two Bombs, One Satellite]]\" project. On the other hand, in 1955-1957, Mao launched the [[Sufan movement]] and the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], with at least 550,000 people persecuted in the latter, most of whom were intellectuals and dissidents. In 1958, he launched the [[Great Leap Forward]] that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] to [[Industrial society|industrial]], which led to the [[Great Chinese Famine|deadliest famine in history]] and the deaths of 20\u201346 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1963, Mao launched the [[Socialist Education Movement]], and in 1966 he initiated the [[Cultural Revolution]], a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements in Chinese society which lasted 10 years and was marked by violent [[class struggle]], widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of [[Mao's cult of personality]]. Tens of millions of people were persecuted during the Revolution, while the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions, including [[Liu Shaoqi]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|2nd Chairman of the PRC]]. After years of ill health, Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. During Mao's era, China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million while the government did not strictly enforce its [[family planning policy]], forcing Mao's successors such as [[Deng Xiaoping]] to take [[One-child policy|stricter policies]] to cope with the [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation crisis]].\n\nA controversial figure, Mao is regarded as one of the most important and influential individuals in [[Modern history|modern world history]]. He is also known as a political intellect, theorist, military strategist, poet, and visionary. During Mao's era, China was involved in the [[Korean War]], the [[Sino-Soviet split]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the rise of [[Khmer Rouge]]; in particular, in 1972, Mao [[1972 Nixon visit to China|welcomed U.S. President Richard Nixon]] in Beijing, signalling the start of [[Open Door Policy#In modern China|a policy]] of opening China to the world. Supporters credit him with driving [[imperialism]] out of China, modernising the nation and building it into a [[world power]], promoting the status of women, improving education and health care, as well as increasing [[life expectancy]] of average Chinese. Conversely, his regime has been called autocratic and [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and condemned for bringing about mass repression and destroying religious and cultural artifacts and sites.

Under this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives that had been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger [[people's commune]]s, and many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel. Some private food production was banned, and livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership.\n\nUnder the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other party leaders ordered the implementation of a variety of unproven and unscientific new agricultural techniques by the new communes. The combined effect of the diversion of labour to steel production and infrastructure projects, and cyclical [[natural disasters]] led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959 followed by a further 10% decline in 1960 and no recovery in 1961.<ref name=\"Spence1999 p553\">{{Harvnb|Spence|1999}}{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}<!-- Book has only 188 pages, so page 553 does not look right --></ref>\n\nIn an effort to win favour with their superiors and avoid being purged, each layer in the party hierarchy exaggerated the amount of grain produced under them. Based upon the fabricated success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a disproportionately high amount of that fictitious harvest for state use, primarily for use in the cities and urban areas but also for export. The result, compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, was that rural peasants were left with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. China's population suffered from the Great Famine during the late 20th century. This came as a result of the lack of food production and distribution to the population of China. The people of urban areas in China were given food stamps each month, but the people of rural areas were expected to grow their own crops and give some of the crops back to the government. The deaths in the rural parts of China out ranked the ones in the Urban cities. Also, the government of China continued to export food to other countries during the Great Famine; this food could have been used to feed the starving citizens.

At a secret meeting in the Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai dated March 25, 1959, Mao specifically ordered the party to procure up to one third of all the grain, much more than had ever been the case. At the meeting he announced that \"To distribute resources evenly will only ruin the Great Leap Forward. When there is not enough to eat, people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill.\"<ref name=Dikottersite>{{cite web|title=Famine 2|url=http://web.mac.com/dikotter/Dikotter/Famine_2.html|website=web.mac.com|accessdate=28 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809001243/http://web.mac.com/dikotter/Dikotter/Famine_2.html|archivedate=August 9, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Jasper|title=A utopian nightmare|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/8659581/a-utopian-nightmare/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=15 January 2015|date=2012-10-13}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nProfessor Emeritus Thomas P.

My own view is that this is an instance of Mao's use of hyperbole, another being his casual acceptance of death of half the population during a nuclear war. In other contexts, Mao did not in fact accept mass death. Zhou's Chronology shows that in October 1958, Mao expressed real concern that 40,000 people in Yunnan had starved to death (p. 173). Shortly after the March 25 meeting, he worried about 25.2 million people who were at risk of starvation.<ref name=\"wilfulness\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas P.|first1=Bernstein|title=Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959\u20131960: A Study in Wilfulness|journal=The China Quarterly|date=June 2006|volume=186|issue=186|pages=421\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0305741006000221|jstor=20192620}}</ref> But from late summer on, Mao essentially forgot about this issue, until, as noted, the \"Xinyang Incident\" came to light in October 1960.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=Thomas P.|title=Book Reviews: Zhou Xun (ed), The Great Famine in China, 1958\u20131962: A Documentary History|journal=China Perspectives|volume=2013/2|issue=Real Estate Speculation and its Social Consequences|pages=74|url=http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/6196|accessdate=15 January 2015|date=June 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:People's commone canteen3.jpg|thumb|Early in the Great Leap Forward, commune members were encouraged to eat their fill in communal canteens,<ref>{{Harvnb|Dik\u00f6tter|2010|p=54}}</ref> and later many canteens shut down as they ran out of food and fuel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dik\u00f6tter|2010|p=281}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the article \"Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959\u20131960: A Study in Wilfulness\", published in 2006 in ''[[The China Quarterly]]'', Professor Thomas P. Bernstein also discussed Mao's change of attitudes during different phases of the Great Leap Forward:\n\n<blockquote>In late autumn 1958, Mao Zedong strongly condemned widespread practices of the Great Leap Forward (GLF) such as subjecting peasants to exhausting labour without adequate food and rest, which had resulted in epidemics, starvation and deaths. At that time Mao explicitly recognized that anti-rightist pressures on officialdom were a major cause of \"production at the expense of livelihood.\" While he was not willing to acknowledge that only abandonment of the GLF could solve these problems, he did strongly demand that they be addressed. After the July 1959 [[Lushan Conference|clash at Lushan]] with [[Peng Dehuai]], Mao revived the GLF in the context of a new, extremely harsh anti-rightist campaign, which he relentlessly promoted into the spring of 1960 together with the radical policies that he previously condemned. Not until spring 1960 did Mao again express concern about abnormal deaths and other abuses, but he failed to apply the pressure needed to stop them. Given what he had already learned about the costs to the peasants of GLF extremism, the Chairman should have known that the revival of GLF radicalism would exact a similar or even bigger price. Instead, he wilfully ignored the lessons of the first radical phase for the sake of achieving extreme ideological and developmental goals.<ref name=\"wilfulness\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn ''[[Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine]]'', [[Jasper Becker]] notes that Mao was dismissive of reports he received of food shortages in the countryside and refused to change course, believing that peasants were lying and that rightists and [[kulaks]] were hoarding grain. He refused to open state granaries,<ref name=\"Becker81\">{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=81}}</ref> and instead launched a series of \"anti-grain concealment\" drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=86}}</ref> Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs. Many peasants accused of hiding food were tortured and beaten to death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=93}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the cause of the disaster, Mao lost esteem among many of the top party cadres. He was eventually forced to abandon the policy in 1962, and he lost political power to moderate leaders such as [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Mao, however, supported by national propaganda, claimed that he was only partly to blame for the famine. As a result, he was able to remain Chairman of the Communist Party, with the Presidency transferred to Liu Shaoqi.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward was a tragedy for the vast majority of the Chinese. Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal. This meant that proper [[smelting]] conditions could not be achieved. According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward:\n\n<blockquote>We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbours did likewise. We put everything in a big fire and melted down all the metal.</blockquote>\n\nThe worst of the famine was steered towards enemies of the state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=128}}</ref> As [[Jasper Becker]] explains:\n\n<blockquote>The most vulnerable section of China's population, around five per cent, were those whom Mao called '[[enemies of the people]]'. Anyone who had in previous campaigns of repression been labeled a 'black element' was given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. Landlords, rich peasants, former members of the nationalist regime, religious leaders, rightists, counter-revolutionaries and the families of such individuals died in the greatest numbers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=103}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAt a large Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, called the \"Conference of the Seven Thousand\", State Chairman Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap Forward as responsible for widespread famine.<ref name=\"Chang\">{{Harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|pp=568, 579}}</ref> The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister [[Lin Biao]] staunchly defended Mao.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> Liu Shaoqi and [[Deng Xiaoping]] rescued the economy by disbanding the people's communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lsHLDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT373&lpg=PT373&dq=Liu+Shaoqi+and+Deng+Xiaoping+rescued+the+economy+by+disbanding+the+people's+communes,+introducing+elements+of+private+control+of+peasant+smallholdings+and+importing+grain+from+Canada+and+Australia+to+mitigate+the+worst+effects+of+famine.|title=50 Great Military Leaders of All Time|last=Tibbetts|first=Jann|date=2016-07-30|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-93-85505-66-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Consequences===\n[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|Mao with [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Zhou Enlai]], Beijing, 1972]]\n\nAt the [[Lushan Conference]] in July/August 1959, several ministers expressed concern that the Great Leap Forward had not proved as successful as planned. The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and [[Korean War]] veteran General [[Peng Dehuai]]. Following Peng's criticism of the Great Leap Forward, Mao orchestrated a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. Senior officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as \"right opportunists.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|pp=92\u201393}}</ref> A campaign against right-wing opportunism was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to prison labor camps where many would subsequently die in the famine. Years later the CPC would conclude that as many as six million people were wrongly punished in the campaign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=127}}</ref>\n\nThe number of deaths by starvation during the Great Leap Forward is deeply controversial. Until the mid-1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success. There was also an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must have been localised or exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net exporter of grain through the period. Because Mao wanted to pay back early to the Soviets debts totalling 1.973 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] from 1960 to 1962,<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\"/> exports increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] were provided grain free of charge.<ref name=\"Becker81\"/>\n\nCensuses were carried out in China in 1953, 1964 and 1982. The first attempt to analyse this data to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer Dr. Judith Banister and published in 1984. Given the lengthy gaps between the censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during 1958\u201361, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years, the figure was around 30 million. The official statistic is 20 million deaths, as given by [[Hu Yaobang]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Short|2001|p=761}}</ref> [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]], a former [[Xinhua News Agency]] reporter who had privileged access and connections available to no other scholars, estimates a death toll of 36 million.<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\">Mark O'Neill.

The [[Sino-Soviet split]] resulted in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s withdrawal of all Soviet technical experts and aid from the country. The split concerned the leadership of [[world communism]]. The USSR had a network of Communist parties it supported; China now created its own rival network to battle it out for local control of the left in numerous countries.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 20029719|title = Sino-Soviet Competition in Africa|journal = Foreign Affairs|volume = 42|issue = 4|pages = 640\u2013654|last1 = Scalapino|first1 = Robert A.|year = 1964|doi = 10.2307/20029719}}</ref> Lorenz M. L\u00fcthi argues:\n\n<blockquote>The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement.

Only [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] openly sided with China, thereby forming an alliance between the two countries which would last until after Mao's death in 1976. Warned that the Soviets had nuclear weapons, Mao minimized the threat. Becker says that \"Mao believed that the bomb was a 'paper tiger', declaring to Khrushchev that it would not matter if China lost 300 million people in a nuclear war: the other half of the population would survive to ensure victory\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Jasper|last=Becker|title=The Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyGtw4cXJjMC&pg=PA271|year=2002|publisher=Oxford UP|page=271|isbn=978-0-19-972722-3}}</ref>\n\nStalin had established himself as the successor of \"correct\" Marxist thought well before Mao controlled the [[Communist Party of China]], and therefore Mao never challenged the suitability of any Stalinist doctrine (at least while Stalin was alive). Upon the death of Stalin, Mao believed (perhaps because of seniority) that the leadership of Marxist doctrine would fall to him. The resulting tension between Khrushchev (at the head of a politically and militarily superior government), and Mao (believing he had a superior understanding of Marxist ideology) eroded the previous patron-client relationship between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the CPC.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In China, the formerly favoured Soviets were now denounced as \"revisionists\" and listed alongside \"American imperialism\" as movements to oppose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nPartly surrounded by hostile American military bases in South Korea, Japan, and [[Taiwan]], China was now confronted with a new threat from the Soviet Union north and west. Both the internal crisis and the external threat called for extraordinary statesmanship from Mao, but as China entered the new decade the statesmen of China were in hostile confrontation with each other.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution===\n{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}\nDuring the early 1960s, Mao became concerned with the nature of post-1959 China. He saw that the revolution and Great Leap Forward had replaced the old ruling elite with a new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve. Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the \"ruling class\" and keep China in a state of \"perpetual revolution\" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged elite.<ref>{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=140}}</ref> State Chairman [[Liu Shaoqi]] and General Secretary [[Deng Xiaoping]] favoured the idea that Mao be removed from actual power as China's head of state and government but maintain his ceremonial and symbolic role as Chairman of the Communist Party of China, with the party upholding all of his positive contributions to the revolution. They attempted to marginalise Mao by taking control of economic policy and asserting themselves politically as well. Many claim that Mao responded to Liu and Deng's movements by launching the [[Cultural Revolution|Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] in 1966. Some scholars, such as Mobo Gao, claim the case for this is overstated.<ref>For a full treatment of this idea, see {{Harvnb|Gao|2008}}</ref> Others, such as [[Frank Dik\u00f6tter]], hold that Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to wreak revenge on those who had dared to challenge him over the Great Leap Forward.<ref>Jonathan Mirsky.

Lin Biao died on September 13, 1971 in a plane crash over the air space of Mongolia, presumably as he fled China, probably anticipating his arrest. The CPC declared that Lin was planning to depose Mao and posthumously expelled Lin from the party. At this time, Mao lost trust in many of the top CPC figures.

And Jackson still appears on $20 bills, even though Americans tend to view as heinous the institution of slavery (of which he was a passionate defender) and the early 19th-century military campaigns against Native Americans (in which he took part).\n\nAt times Jackson, for all his flaws, is invoked as representing an egalitarian strain within the American democratic tradition, a [[self-made man]] of the people who rose to power via straight talk and was not allied with moneyed interests.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> December 26, 1893{{spaced ndash}}September 9, 1976), also known as '''Chairman Mao''', was a Chinese [[Communism|communist]] [[revolutionary]] who became the [[Father of the Nation|founding father]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), which he ruled as the [[chairman of the Communist Party of China]] from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976. Ideologically a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]], his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as [[Maoism]].\n\nMao was the son of a prosperous peasant in [[Shaoshan]], Hunan. He had a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] and an [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919. He later adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at [[Peking University]], and became a founding member of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), leading the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in 1927. During the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]], led the [[Jiangxi Soviet]]'s radical land policies, and ultimately became head of the CPC during the [[Long March]]. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), China's civil war resumed after [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's surrender]] and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the [[Nationalist government]], which withdrew to [[Taiwan]].\n\nOn October 1, 1949, Mao [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|proclaimed the foundation of the PRC]], a [[single-party state]] controlled by the CPC. In the following years he solidified his control through [[Chinese Land Reform|campaigns against landlords]], [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries|suppression of \"counter-revolutionaries\"]], \"[[Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns]]\" and through a psychological victory in the [[Korean War]], which altogether caused the deaths of several-million Chinese. From 1953\u20131958, Mao played an important role in enforcing [[planned economy]] in China, constructing the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|first Constitution of the PRC]], launching the [[Industry of China|industrialisation program]], and initiating the \"[[Two Bombs, One Satellite]]\" project. On the other hand, in 1957, Mao launched the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], which persecuted at least 550,000 people, most of whom were intellectuals and dissidents, and in 1958 he launched the [[Great Leap Forward]] that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] to [[Industrial society|industrial]]. The latter led to the [[Great Chinese Famine|deadliest famine in history]] and the deaths of 20\u201346 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1963, Mao launched the [[Socialist Education Movement]], and in 1966 he initiated the [[Cultural Revolution]], a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements in Chinese society which lasted 10 years and was marked by violent [[class struggle]], widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of [[Mao's cult of personality]]. Tens of millions of people were persecuted during the Revolution, while the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions, including [[Liu Shaoqi]], the [[President of the People's Republic of China|2nd Chairman of the PRC]]. After years of ill health, Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. During Mao's era, China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million while the government did not strictly enforce its [[family planning policy]], forcing Mao's successors such as [[Deng Xiaoping]] to take [[One-child policy|stricter policies]] to cope with the [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation crisis]].\n\nA controversial figure, Mao is regarded as one of the most important and influential individuals in [[Modern history|modern world history]]. He is also known as a political intellect, theorist, military strategist, poet, and visionary. During Mao's era, China was involved in the [[Korean War]], the [[Sino-Soviet split]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the rise of [[Khmer Rouge]]; in particular, in 1972, Mao [[1972 Nixon visit to China|welcomed U.S. President Richard Nixon]] in Beijing, signalling the start of [[Open Door Policy#In modern China|a policy]] of opening China to the world. Supporters credit him with driving [[imperialism]] out of China, modernising the nation and building it into a [[world power]], promoting the status of women, improving education and health care, as well as increasing [[life expectancy]] of average Chinese. Conversely, his regime has been called autocratic and [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and condemned for bringing about mass repression and destroying religious and cultural artifacts and sites. It was additionally responsible for vast numbers of deaths with estimates ranging from 30 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, [[Laogai|prison labour]] and mass executions.\n\n==English Romanization of name==\nDuring Mao's lifetime the English-language media universally rendered his name as '''Mao Tse-tung''', using the [[Wade-Giles]] system of transliteration for Standard Chinese though with the circumflex accent in the syllable \"Ts\u00ea\" dropped. Due to its recognizability, the spelling was used widely, even by the Foreign Ministry of the PRC after pinyin (''[[Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]]'') became the PRC's official romanization system for [[Mandarin Chinese]] in 1958.  For example, the well-known booklet of Mao's political statements, ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|\"The Little Red Book\"]]'', was officially entitled ''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung'' in English translations.  {{citation needed span|While the pinyin-derived spelling \"Mao Zedong\" is increasingly common, the Wade-Giles-derived spelling \"Mao Tse-tung\" continues to be used in modern publications to some extent.|date=January 2020|reason=As with all material on the Wikipedia website, a source does actually need to be provided for these claims.}}  The spelling \"Mao Zedong\" will be used in the rest of this article, except in citations and reference to the titles of books, articles, and other media.\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Mao Zedong}}\n\n===Youth and the Xinhai Revolution: 1893\u20131911===\nMao Zedong was born on December 26, 1893 in [[Shaoshan]] village, [[Hunan]].{{sfnm|1a1=Schram|1y=1966|1p=19|2a1=Hollingworth|2y=1985|2p=15|3a1=Pantsov|3a2=Levine|3y=2012|3p=11}} His father, [[Mao Yichang]], was a formerly impoverished peasant who had become one of the wealthiest farmers in Shaoshan.

With the [[Soviet Union]]'s assistance, new industrial plants were built and agricultural production eventually fell{{clarify|date=May 2016}} to a point where industry was beginning to produce enough capital that China no longer needed the USSR's support.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The declared success of the First-Five Year Plan was to encourage Mao to instigate the Second [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]] in 1958.

Large-scale industrialization projects were also undertaken.\n\nPrograms pursued during this time include the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]], in which Mao indicated his supposed willingness to consider different opinions about how China should be governed.

Under this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives that had been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger [[people's commune]]s, and many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel. Some private food production was banned, and livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership.\n\nUnder the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other party leaders ordered the implementation of a variety of unproven and unscientific new agricultural techniques by the new communes. The combined effect of the diversion of labour to steel production and infrastructure projects, and cyclical [[natural disasters]] led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959 followed by a further 10% decline in 1960 and no recovery in 1961.<ref name=\"Spence1999 p553\">{{Harvnb|Spence|1999}}{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}<!-- Book has only 188 pages, so page 553 does not look right --></ref>\n\nIn an effort to win favour with their superiors and avoid being purged, each layer in the party hierarchy exaggerated the amount of grain produced under them. Based upon the fabricated success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a disproportionately high amount of that fictitious harvest for state use, primarily for use in the cities and urban areas but also for export. The result, compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, was that rural peasants were left with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. China's population suffered from the Great Famine during the late 20th century. This came as a result of the lack of food production and distribution to the population of China. The people of urban areas in China were given food stamps each month, but the people of rural areas were expected to grow their own crops and give some of the crops back to the government. The deaths in the rural parts of China out ranked the ones in the Urban cities. Also, the government of China continued to export food to other countries during the Great Famine; this food could have been used to feed the starving citizens. These factors lead to the catastrophic death of about 52 million citizens.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Yushi|first=Mao|date=September 1, 2014|title=Lessons from China's Great Famine|journal=Cato Journal|volume=34|pages=483\u201390|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> The famine was a direct cause of the death of some 30 million Chinese peasants between 1959 and 1962.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1136/bmj.319.7225.1619\n| last1 = Smil | first1 = V.\n| title = China's great famine: 40 years later\n| journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.)\n| volume = 319\n| issue = 7225\n| pages = 1619\u201321\n| year = 1999\n| pmid = 10600969\n| pmc = 1127087\n}}</ref> Further, many children who became emaciated and malnourished during years of hardship and struggle for survival died shortly after the Great Leap Forward came to an end in 1962.<ref name=\"Spence1999 p553\"/>\n\nThe extent of Mao's knowledge of the severity of the situation has been disputed.

At a secret meeting in the Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai dated March 25, 1959, Mao specifically ordered the party to procure up to one third of all the grain, much more than had ever been the case. At the meeting he announced that \"To distribute resources evenly will only ruin the Great Leap Forward. When there is not enough to eat, people starve to death.

My own view is that this is an instance of Mao's use of hyperbole, another being his casual acceptance of death of half the population during a nuclear war. In other contexts, Mao did not in fact accept mass death. Zhou's Chronology shows that in October 1958, Mao expressed real concern that 40,000 people in Yunnan had starved to death (p. 173).

Bernstein also discussed Mao's change of attitudes during different phases of the Great Leap Forward:\n\n<blockquote>In late autumn 1958, Mao Zedong strongly condemned widespread practices of the Great Leap Forward (GLF) such as subjecting peasants to exhausting labour without adequate food and rest, which had resulted in epidemics, starvation and deaths. At that time Mao explicitly recognized that anti-rightist pressures on officialdom were a major cause of \"production at the expense of livelihood.\" While he was not willing to acknowledge that only abandonment of the GLF could solve these problems, he did strongly demand that they be addressed. After the July 1959 [[Lushan Conference|clash at Lushan]] with [[Peng Dehuai]], Mao revived the GLF in the context of a new, extremely harsh anti-rightist campaign, which he relentlessly promoted into the spring of 1960 together with the radical policies that he previously condemned. Not until spring 1960 did Mao again express concern about abnormal deaths and other abuses, but he failed to apply the pressure needed to stop them. Given what he had already learned about the costs to the peasants of GLF extremism, the Chairman should have known that the revival of GLF radicalism would exact a similar or even bigger price. Instead, he wilfully ignored the lessons of the first radical phase for the sake of achieving extreme ideological and developmental goals.<ref name=\"wilfulness\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn ''[[Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine]]'', [[Jasper Becker]] notes that Mao was dismissive of reports he received of food shortages in the countryside and refused to change course, believing that peasants were lying and that rightists and [[kulaks]] were hoarding grain. He refused to open state granaries,<ref name=\"Becker81\">{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=81}}</ref> and instead launched a series of \"anti-grain concealment\" drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=86}}</ref> Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs. Many peasants accused of hiding food were tortured and beaten to death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=93}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the cause of the disaster, Mao lost esteem among many of the top party cadres. He was eventually forced to abandon the policy in 1962, and he lost political power to moderate leaders such as [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Mao, however, supported by national propaganda, claimed that he was only partly to blame for the famine. As a result, he was able to remain Chairman of the Communist Party, with the Presidency transferred to Liu Shaoqi.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward was a tragedy for the vast majority of the Chinese. Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal. This meant that proper [[smelting]] conditions could not be achieved. According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward:\n\n<blockquote>We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbours did likewise. We put everything in a big fire and melted down all the metal.</blockquote>\n\nThe worst of the famine was steered towards enemies of the state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=128}}</ref> As [[Jasper Becker]] explains:\n\n<blockquote>The most vulnerable section of China's population, around five per cent, were those whom Mao called '[[enemies of the people]]'. Anyone who had in previous campaigns of repression been labeled a 'black element' was given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. Landlords, rich peasants, former members of the nationalist regime, religious leaders, rightists, counter-revolutionaries and the families of such individuals died in the greatest numbers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=103}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAt a large Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, called the \"Conference of the Seven Thousand\", State Chairman Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap Forward as responsible for widespread famine.<ref name=\"Chang\">{{Harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|pp=568, 579}}</ref> The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister [[Lin Biao]] staunchly defended Mao.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> Liu Shaoqi and [[Deng Xiaoping]] rescued the economy by disbanding the people's communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lsHLDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT373&lpg=PT373&dq=Liu+Shaoqi+and+Deng+Xiaoping+rescued+the+economy+by+disbanding+the+people's+communes,+introducing+elements+of+private+control+of+peasant+smallholdings+and+importing+grain+from+Canada+and+Australia+to+mitigate+the+worst+effects+of+famine.|title=50 Great Military Leaders of All Time|last=Tibbetts|first=Jann|date=2016-07-30|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-93-85505-66-9|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Consequences===\n[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|Mao with [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Zhou Enlai]], Beijing, 1972]]\n\nAt the [[Lushan Conference]] in July/August 1959, several ministers expressed concern that the Great Leap Forward had not proved as successful as planned. The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and [[Korean War]] veteran General [[Peng Dehuai]]. Following Peng's criticism of the Great Leap Forward, Mao orchestrated a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. Senior officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as \"right opportunists.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|pp=92\u201393}}</ref> A campaign against right-wing opportunism was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to prison labor camps where many would subsequently die in the famine. Years later the CPC would conclude that as many as six million people were wrongly punished in the campaign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=127}}</ref>\n\nThe number of deaths by starvation during the Great Leap Forward is deeply controversial. Until the mid-1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success. There was also an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must have been localised or exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net exporter of grain through the period. Because Mao wanted to pay back early to the Soviets debts totalling 1.973 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] from 1960 to 1962,<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\"/> exports increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] were provided grain free of charge.<ref name=\"Becker81\"/>\n\nCensuses were carried out in China in 1953, 1964 and 1982. The first attempt to analyse this data to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer Dr. Judith Banister and published in 1984. Given the lengthy gaps between the censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during 1958\u201361, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years, the figure was around 30 million. The official statistic is 20 million deaths, as given by [[Hu Yaobang]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Short|2001|p=761}}</ref> [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]], a former [[Xinhua News Agency]] reporter who had privileged access and connections available to no other scholars, estimates a death toll of 36 million.<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\">Mark O'Neill.

The [[Sino-Soviet split]] resulted in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s withdrawal of all Soviet technical experts and aid from the country. The split concerned the leadership of [[world communism]].

Only [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] openly sided with China, thereby forming an alliance between the two countries which would last until after Mao's death in 1976. Warned that the Soviets had nuclear weapons, Mao minimized the threat. Becker says that \"Mao believed that the bomb was a 'paper tiger', declaring to Khrushchev that it would not matter if China lost 300 million people in a nuclear war: the other half of the population would survive to ensure victory\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Jasper|last=Becker|title=The Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyGtw4cXJjMC&pg=PA271|year=2002|publisher=Oxford UP|page=271|isbn=978-0-19-972722-3}}</ref>\n\nStalin had established himself as the successor of \"correct\" Marxist thought well before Mao controlled the [[Communist Party of China]], and therefore Mao never challenged the suitability of any Stalinist doctrine (at least while Stalin was alive). Upon the death of Stalin, Mao believed (perhaps because of seniority) that the leadership of Marxist doctrine would fall to him. The resulting tension between Khrushchev (at the head of a politically and militarily superior government), and Mao (believing he had a superior understanding of Marxist ideology) eroded the previous patron-client relationship between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the CPC.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In China, the formerly favoured Soviets were now denounced as \"revisionists\" and listed alongside \"American imperialism\" as movements to oppose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nPartly surrounded by hostile American military bases in South Korea, Japan, and [[Taiwan]], China was now confronted with a new threat from the Soviet Union north and west. Both the internal crisis and the external threat called for extraordinary statesmanship from Mao, but as China entered the new decade the statesmen of China were in hostile confrontation with each other.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution===\n{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}\nDuring the early 1960s, Mao became concerned with the nature of post-1959 China. He saw that the revolution and Great Leap Forward had replaced the old ruling elite with a new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve. Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the \"ruling class\" and keep China in a state of \"perpetual revolution\" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged elite.<ref>{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=140}}</ref> State Chairman [[Liu Shaoqi]] and General Secretary [[Deng Xiaoping]] favoured the idea that Mao be removed from actual power as China's head of state and government but maintain his ceremonial and symbolic role as Chairman of the Communist Party of China, with the party upholding all of his positive contributions to the revolution. They attempted to marginalise Mao by taking control of economic policy and asserting themselves politically as well. Many claim that Mao responded to Liu and Deng's movements by launching the [[Cultural Revolution|Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] in 1966. Some scholars, such as Mobo Gao, claim the case for this is overstated.<ref>For a full treatment of this idea, see {{Harvnb|Gao|2008}}</ref> Others, such as [[Frank Dik\u00f6tter]], hold that Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to wreak revenge on those who had dared to challenge him over the Great Leap Forward.<ref>Jonathan Mirsky.

Chaos reigned in much of the nation, and millions were persecuted. During the Cultural Revolution, nearly all of the schools and universities in China were closed, and the young intellectuals living in cities were ordered to the countryside to be \"re-educated\" by the peasants, where they performed hard manual labour and other work.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution led to the destruction of much of China's traditional cultural heritage and the imprisonment of a huge number of Chinese citizens, as well as the creation of general economic and social chaos in the country. Millions of lives were ruined during this period, as the Cultural Revolution pierced into every part of Chinese life, depicted by such Chinese films as ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'', ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]''. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps millions, perished in the violence of the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=\"maostats\"/> This included prominent figures such as Liu Shaoqi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/05/cultural-revolution-china/482964/|title=The Cultural Revolution's Legacy in China|last=Vasilogambros|first=Matt|date=May 16, 2016|website=The Atlantic|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/1179|title=Debating the Cultural Revolution in China {{!}} Reviews in History|website=reviews.history.ac.uk|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pye|first=Lucian W.|year=1986|title=Reassessing the Cultural Revolution|journal=The China Quarterly|issue=108|pages=597\u2013612|issn=0305-7410|jstor=653530}}</ref>\n\nWhen Mao was informed of such losses, particularly that people had been driven to suicide, he is alleged to have commented: \"People who try to commit suicide\u2014don't attempt to save them!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Lin was later officially named as Mao's successor. By 1971, however, a divide between the two men had become apparent. Official history in China states that Lin was planning a military coup or an assassination attempt on Mao. Lin Biao died on September 13, 1971 in a plane crash over the air space of Mongolia, presumably as he fled China, probably anticipating his arrest. The CPC declared that Lin was planning to depose Mao and posthumously expelled Lin from the party. At this time, Mao lost trust in many of the top CPC figures. The highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] described his conversation with [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]], who told him about a plot to kill Mao Zedong with the help of Lin Biao organised by the [[KGB]].<ref name=\"Pacepa0\">{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ= |title=The Kremlin's Killing Ways |author=Ion Mihai Pacepa |work=National Review |date=November 28, 2006 |accessdate=August 23, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808171854/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzY4NWU2ZjY3YWYxMDllNWQ5MjQ3ZGJmMzg3MmQyNjQ%3D |archivedate=August 8, 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\nDespite being considered a [[feminist]] figure by some and a supporter of women's rights, documents released by the [[US Department of State]] in 2008 show that Mao declared women to be a \"nonsense\" in 1973, in conversation with Kissinger, joking that \"China is a very poor country.

And all of them shared an ideology in which the end justified the means.

And Jackson still appears on $20 bills, even though Americans tend to view as heinous the institution of slavery (of which he was a passionate defender) and the early 19th-century military campaigns against Native Americans (in which he took part).\n\nAt times Jackson, for all his flaws, is invoked as representing an egalitarian strain within the American democratic tradition, a [[self-made man]] of the people who rose to power via straight talk and was not allied with moneyed interests.

Deng Xiaoping, who was opposed to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, has to a certain extent rejected Mao's legacy, famously saying that Mao was \"70% right and 30% wrong\".\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Mao Zedong's picture began to appear on all new [[renminbi]] currency from the People's Republic of China. This was officially instituted as an anti-counterfeiting measure as Mao's face is widely recognised in contrast to the generic figures that appear in older currency.
