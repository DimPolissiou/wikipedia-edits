In 2013 ''P. kochi'' was reviewed by Bennet<ref name=BennettPZ/> and synonymised with ''P. antiquus''. Vidovic and Martill<ref name=aerodactylus/> disagreed with the findings of Bennett<ref name=BennettPZ/> and considered the content of ''P. kochi'' to be paraphyletic. When Vidovic and Martill separated ''P. scolopaciceps'' from ''P. kochi'' they considered it so distinct they gave it the genus name ''Aerodactylus'', formed from the Greek words for \"wind finger\", but chosen in reference to the [[Pok\u00e9mon]] [[List of generation I Pok\u00e9mon#Aerodactyl|Aerodactyl]], which was based on an amalgamation of different pterosaurian features.<ref name=aerodactylus/>\n\nIn 2018 pterosaur researcher Christopher Bennett challenged the status of ''Aerodactylus'' on several grounds: 1) that the alleged skull features are only trivially different from those seen in ''Pterodactylus''; 2) that the specimens referred to ''Aerodactylus'' have an unusual growth regime compared to other Solnhofen pterodactyloids, suggesting that Vidovic and Martill<ref name=\"aerodactylus\" /> had grouped an unnatural assemblage of specimens; and 3) that no evidence had been presented to rule out effects of preservation or individual variation on the slight differences between ''Aerodactylus'' and ''Pterodactylus''<ref name=\":0\" />''.'' Bennett concluded that ''Aerodactylus scolopaciceps'' is a [[junior synonym]] of ''Pterodactylus antiquus''.<ref name=\"aerodactylus\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Palaeontology}}\n* [[Timeline of pterosaur research]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n{{Commons category|Aerodactylus}}\n{{Pterosauria|Ar.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q18341804}}\n\n[[Category:Late Jurassic pterosaurs of Europe]]\n[[Category:Ctenochasmatoids]]\n[[Category:Solnhofen fauna]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 2014]]\n", "name_user": "119.237.203.92", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodactylus"}
