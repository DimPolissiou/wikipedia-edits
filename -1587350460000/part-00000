There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.  The first category consists of [[needle telegraph]]s in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of [[electric current]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[dynamo]] down the telegraph line.  Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires.  The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], invented in 1837.  Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category consists of armature systems in which the pulse activates a [[telegraph sounder]] which makes a click.  The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by [[Samuel Morse]] in 1838, using a single wire.  At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].  Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.  In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways.  However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nIn the 1840s the electrical telegraph superseded [[optical telegraph]] systems (except in France), becoming the standard way to send urgent messages.  By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had created commercial telegraph networks with local [[telegraph office]]s in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages called [[telegram]]s addressed to any person in the country, for a fee.  Beginning in 1854 [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowed for the first rapid communication between continents. Electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.<ref>{{Citation|last= Tancia |title= A History of Telegraphy |year= 2014 |url= https://www.pens.co.uk/pen2paper/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-History-of-Telegraphy.pdf }}</ref>  In the early 20th century the telegraph was slowly replaced by [[Teleprinter|teletype]] networks.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance.

The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].{{sfn|Jones|1999}} Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.{{sfn|Jones|1999}} This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).\n\t \t\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year [[Johann Schweigger]] invented the [[galvanometer]], with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current.<ref>M.

The receiving instrument consisted of six [[galvanometer]]s with magnetic needles, suspended from [[silk]] [[Yarn|threads]]. Both stations of Schilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the [[galvanometer]]s, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus. He reduced the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\n[[File:Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G.png|thumb|left|Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G]]At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals; finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university were too poor to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835\u20131836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.  Steinheil built a telegraph along the [[Nuremberg - F\u00fcrth railway line]] in 1938, the first [[earth-return telegraph]] put into service.\n\nBy 1837, [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] had co-developed a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|telegraph system]] which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet's 26 letters.\n\n[[File:Wallace Study-Telegraph.jpg|thumb|Morse key and sounder]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse's assistant [[Alfred Vail]] developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet.{{sfn|Calvert|2008}} Morse and Vail developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]].

System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a \"communicator\" at the sending end and an \"indicator\" at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a [[magneto]] actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would move the pointers at both ends on by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator's pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator's pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose [[Armature (electrical)|armature]] was coupled to it through an [[escapement]]. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator's pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last= Freebody |first= J.

They had an extensive [[optical telegraph]] system built during the [[Napoleonic era]].  There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations.  The [[Foy-Breguet telegraph]] was eventually adopted.  This was a two-needle system using two signal wires, but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs.  The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators.  The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completed until 1855.

Proce Wellcome V0025510.jpg|thumb|left|Wheatstone automated telegraph network equipment]]\nA continuing goal in telegraphy was to reduce the cost per message by reducing hand-work, or increasing the sending rate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} There were many experiments with moving pointers, and various electrical encodings. However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York\u2013Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications. Mercer University Press, 1992. 67</ref>\n\n[[Royal Earl House]] developed and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic keyboard for the transmitter and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/14/letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-4464/|title=Royal Earl House Printing-Telegraph Patent #4464, 1846|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> and followed this up with a steam-powered version in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/15/steam-powered-letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-9505/|title=Royal Earl House Steam-Powered Printing-Telegraph Patent #9505, 1852|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators' errors. The House machine was used on four main American telegraph lines by 1852. The speed of the House machine was announced as 2600 words an hour.<ref>Oslin, George, P. The Story of Telecommunications, 1992. 71</ref>\n\n[[File:Clavier Baudot.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=1.5|A Baudot keyboard, 1884]]\n[[David Edward Hughes]] invented the printing telegraph in 1855; it used a keyboard of 26 keys for the alphabet and a spinning type wheel that determined the letter being transmitted by the length of time that had elapsed since the previous transmission. The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter in 1930]]\n[[File:Teletype-IMG 7289.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\nWith the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]].\n\nIn the 1930s teleprinters were produced by [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These resulting system was called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the [[duplex (telegraph)|duplex]] and the [[Quadruplex telegraph|quadruplex]] which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction.  However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines.  In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\n\nOne approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal.  This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.\n\nWith a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.<ref>https://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html</ref>)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon [[William Montgomerie]]<ref name=Haigh26>{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=K R|title=Cable Ships and Submarine Cables|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles Ltd|location=London|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> introduced [[gutta-percha]], the adhesive juice of the ''[[Palaquium gutta]]'' tree, to Europe. [[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. It was tried on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 1849, [[C.V. Walker]], electrician to the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]], submerged a two-mile wire coated with gutta-percha off the coast from Folkestone, which was tested successfully.<ref name=Haigh26/>\n\n[[John Watkins Brett]], an engineer from [[Bristol]], sought and obtained permission from [[Louis-Philippe]] in 1847 to establish [[telegraph|telegraphic communication]] between France and England. The first undersea cable was laid in 1850, connecting the two countries and was followed by connections to Ireland and the Low Countries.\n\nThe [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in [[London]] in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. It was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], captained by [[Sir James Anderson]] after many mishaps along the away.<ref>Wilson, Arthur (1994).

The 1857 cable only operated intermittently for a few days or weeks before it failed. The study of underwater telegraph cables accelerated interest in mathematical analysis of very long [[transmission line]]s. The telegraph lines from Britain to India were connected in 1870 (those several companies combined to form the ''Eastern Telegraph Company'' in 1872).\n\nAustralia was first linked to the rest of the world in October 1872 by a submarine telegraph cable at Darwin.<ref>Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter: \"A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet\", p110.

Secret messages were encoded, so interception alone would not be sufficient for the opposing side to gain an advantage. There were geographical constraints on intercepting the telegraph cables, but once radio was used, interception could be much more widespread.\n\n===Crimean war===\nThe [[Crimean War]] was one of the first conflicts to use [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] and was one of the first to be documented extensively. In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Engineers]]. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers & Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |title = Distant Writing A History of Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868: 16.

After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, the news reached [[London]] in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours. The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the government and led to Lord Palmerston becoming prime minister.{{sfn|Figes|2010|pp=304\u201311}}\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] the telegraph proved its value as a tactical, operational, and strategic communication medium and an important contributor to Union victory.<ref>{{Citation |last= Hochfelder |first= David |title= Essential Civil WAR Curriculum: The Telegraph |publisher= Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech |year= 2019 |url= https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-telegraph.html }}</ref> By contrast the Confederacy failed to make effective use of the South's much smaller telegraph network. Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of Government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} It wasn't until the Civil War that the Government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of [[Fort Sumter]], the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}}\n\nWithin 6 months of the start of the war, the [[U.S. Military Telegraph Corps]] (USMT) had laid approximately 300 miles of line. By war's end they had laid approximately 15,000 miles of cable, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nEven before the war, the [[American Telegraph Company]] censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]], and later [[Edwin Stanton]], wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Even Stanton himself said \"[telegraphy] is my right arm\". Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862), the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (1863), and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] (1865).{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nThe telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators didn't have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they didn't have to, so [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\n===First World War===\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{sfn|Kennedy|1971}} British access to transatlantic cables and its codebreaking expertise led to the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] incident that contributed to the US joining the war.<ref>{{cite news|title= The telegram that brought America into the First World War |url= http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/telegram-brought-america-first-world-war |work= BBC History Magazin e|date= 17 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n[[World War II]] revived the 'cable war' of 1914\u20131918. In 1939, German-owned cables across the Atlantic were cut once again, and, in 1940, Italian cables to South America and Spain were cut in retaliation for Italian action against two of the five British cables linking Gibraltar and Malta.

The Germans developed a highly complex teleprinter attachment (German: ''Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz'') that was used for enciphering telegrams between German High Command ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) and the army groups in the field. These contained situation reports, battle plans, and discussions of strategy and tactics. Britain intercepted these signals, diagnosed how the encrypting machine worked, and [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|decrypted]] a large amount of teleprinter traffic.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|pp=1-6}}\n\n==End of the telegraph era==\n{{further|Telegraphy}}\nIn America, the end of the telegraph era can be associated with the fall of the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]]. Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]]. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future{{explain|date=October 2019}} and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}} [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.  AT&T bought Western Union's electronic mail and [[Telex]] businesses in 1990.\n\nAlthough commercial \"telegraph\" services are still available in [[Worldwide use of telegrams by country|many countries]], transmission is usually done by some form of [[data transmission]] other than traditional telegraphy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[92 Code]]\n* [[Aurora (astronomy)#Auroral events of historical significance|Aurora (astronomy)]]\n* [[Geomagnetically induced current]]\n* [[Great Northern Telegraph Company]]\n* [[Harrison Gray Dyar]], who supposedly erected the first telegraph line and dispatched the first telegram\n* [[Neutral direct-current telegraph system]]\n* [[Western Electric Company]]\n* [[Wireless telegraphy]]\n* [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&T)\n* [[Bell Canada]]\n* [[Speedwell Ironworks]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Citation |last = Beauchamp |first = Ken |title = History Of Telegraphy |place = London |publisher = The Institution Of Electrical Engineers |year = 2001 |isbn = 978-0-85296-792-8 }}\n*Bowers, Brian, ''Sir Charles Wheatstone: 1802\u20131875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0852961030}}.\n*{{Citation | last = Calvert | first = J.

There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.  The first category consists of [[needle telegraph]]s in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of [[electric current]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[dynamo]] down the telegraph line.  Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires.  The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], invented in 1837.  Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category consists of armature systems in which the pulse activates a [[telegraph sounder]] which makes a click.  The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by [[Samuel Morse]] in 1838, using a single wire.  At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].  Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.  In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways.  However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nIn the 1840s the electrical telegraph superseded [[optical telegraph]] systems (except in France), becoming the standard way to send urgent messages.  By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had created commercial telegraph networks with local [[telegraph office]]s in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages called [[telegram]]s addressed to any person in the country, for a fee.  Beginning in 1854 [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowed for the first rapid communication between continents. Electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.<ref>{{Citation|last= Tancia |title= A History of Telegraphy |year= 2014 |url= https://www.pens.co.uk/pen2paper/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-History-of-Telegraphy.pdf }}</ref>  In the early 20th century the telegraph was slowly replaced by [[Teleprinter|teletype]] networks.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance. All the known effects of electricity\u2014such as [[electric spark|sparks]], [[electrostatic attraction]], [[chemical change]]s, [[electric shock]]s, and later [[electromagnetism]]\u2014were applied to the problems of detecting controlled transmissions of electricity at various distances.<ref>{{Citation |last= Fahie |first= J.

Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of [[pith]] balls at the far end.<ref>E.

The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].{{sfn|Jones|1999}} Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.{{sfn|Jones|1999}} This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).\n\t \t\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year [[Johann Schweigger]] invented the [[galvanometer]], with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current.<ref>M.

[[Joseph Henry]] improved it in 1828 by placing several windings of insulated wire around the bar, creating a much more powerful electromagnet which could operate a telegraph through the high resistance of long telegraph wires.<ref>{{cite book|title= Technology and Society| author=R.

The receiving instrument consisted of six [[galvanometer]]s with magnetic needles, suspended from [[silk]] [[Yarn|threads]]. Both stations of Schilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the [[galvanometer]]s, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus. He reduced the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\n[[File:Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G.png|thumb|left|Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G]]At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals; finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university were too poor to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835\u20131836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.  Steinheil built a telegraph along the [[Nuremberg - F\u00fcrth railway line]] in 1938, the first [[earth-return telegraph]] put into service.\n\nBy 1837, [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] had co-developed a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|telegraph system]] which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet's 26 letters.\n\n[[File:Wallace Study-Telegraph.jpg|thumb|Morse key and sounder]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse's assistant [[Alfred Vail]] developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet.{{sfn|Calvert|2008}} Morse and Vail developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]].

System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a \"communicator\" at the sending end and an \"indicator\" at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a [[magneto]] actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would move the pointers at both ends on by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator's pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator's pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose [[Armature (electrical)|armature]] was coupled to it through an [[escapement]]. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator's pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last= Freebody |first= J.

With different codes, additional operators were required to translate and retransmit the message.  In 1865, a conference in Paris adopted Gerke's code as the International Morse code and was henceforth the international standard.  The US, however, continued to use [[American Morse code]] internally for some time, hence international messages required retransmission in both directions.<ref>Andrew L.

They had an extensive [[optical telegraph]] system built during the [[Napoleonic era]].  There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations.  The [[Foy-Breguet telegraph]] was eventually adopted.  This was a two-needle system using two signal wires, but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs.  The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators.  The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completed until 1855.  In that year the Foy-Breguet system was replaced with the Morse system.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n===Expansion===\nAs well as the rapid expansion of the use of the telegraphs along the railways, they soon spread into the field of mass communication with the instruments being installed in [[post office]]s.

Proce Wellcome V0025510.jpg|thumb|left|Wheatstone automated telegraph network equipment]]\nA continuing goal in telegraphy was to reduce the cost per message by reducing hand-work, or increasing the sending rate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} There were many experiments with moving pointers, and various electrical encodings. However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York\u2013Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications. Mercer University Press, 1992. 67</ref>\n\n[[Royal Earl House]] developed and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic keyboard for the transmitter and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/14/letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-4464/|title=Royal Earl House Printing-Telegraph Patent #4464, 1846|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> and followed this up with a steam-powered version in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/15/steam-powered-letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-9505/|title=Royal Earl House Steam-Powered Printing-Telegraph Patent #9505, 1852|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators' errors. The House machine was used on four main American telegraph lines by 1852. The speed of the House machine was announced as 2600 words an hour.<ref>Oslin, George, P. The Story of Telecommunications, 1992. 71</ref>\n\n[[File:Clavier Baudot.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=1.5|A Baudot keyboard, 1884]]\n[[David Edward Hughes]] invented the printing telegraph in 1855; it used a keyboard of 26 keys for the alphabet and a spinning type wheel that determined the letter being transmitted by the length of time that had elapsed since the previous transmission. The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter in 1930]]\n[[File:Teletype-IMG 7289.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\nWith the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]].\n\nIn the 1930s teleprinters were produced by [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These resulting system was called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the [[duplex (telegraph)|duplex]] and the [[Quadruplex telegraph|quadruplex]] which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction.  However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines.  In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\n\nOne approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal.  This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.\n\nWith a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.<ref>https://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html</ref>)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon [[William Montgomerie]]<ref name=Haigh26>{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=K R|title=Cable Ships and Submarine Cables|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles Ltd|location=London|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> introduced [[gutta-percha]], the adhesive juice of the ''[[Palaquium gutta]]'' tree, to Europe. [[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. It was tried on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 1849, [[C.V. Walker]], electrician to the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]], submerged a two-mile wire coated with gutta-percha off the coast from Folkestone, which was tested successfully.<ref name=Haigh26/>\n\n[[John Watkins Brett]], an engineer from [[Bristol]], sought and obtained permission from [[Louis-Philippe]] in 1847 to establish [[telegraph|telegraphic communication]] between France and England. The first undersea cable was laid in 1850, connecting the two countries and was followed by connections to Ireland and the Low Countries.\n\nThe [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in [[London]] in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. It was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], captained by [[Sir James Anderson]] after many mishaps along the away.<ref>Wilson, Arthur (1994).

The 1857 cable only operated intermittently for a few days or weeks before it failed. The study of underwater telegraph cables accelerated interest in mathematical analysis of very long [[transmission line]]s. The telegraph lines from Britain to India were connected in 1870 (those several companies combined to form the ''Eastern Telegraph Company'' in 1872).\n\nAustralia was first linked to the rest of the world in October 1872 by a submarine telegraph cable at Darwin.<ref>Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter: \"A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet\", p110.

In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Engineers]]. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers & Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |title = Distant Writing A History of Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868: 16.

When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours.

Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of Government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} It wasn't until the Civil War that the Government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of [[Fort Sumter]], the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}}\n\nWithin 6 months of the start of the war, the [[U.S. Military Telegraph Corps]] (USMT) had laid approximately 300 miles of line. By war's end they had laid approximately 15,000 miles of cable, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nEven before the war, the [[American Telegraph Company]] censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]], and later [[Edwin Stanton]], wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Even Stanton himself said \"[telegraphy] is my right arm\". Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862), the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (1863), and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] (1865).{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nThe telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators didn't have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they didn't have to, so [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\n===First World War===\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{sfn|Kennedy|1971}} British access to transatlantic cables and its codebreaking expertise led to the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] incident that contributed to the US joining the war.<ref>{{cite news|title= The telegram that brought America into the First World War |url= http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/telegram-brought-america-first-world-war |work= BBC History Magazin e|date= 17 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n[[World War II]] revived the 'cable war' of 1914\u20131918.

The Germans developed a highly complex teleprinter attachment (German: ''Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz'') that was used for enciphering telegrams between German High Command ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) and the army groups in the field. These contained situation reports, battle plans, and discussions of strategy and tactics. Britain intercepted these signals, diagnosed how the encrypting machine worked, and [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|decrypted]] a large amount of teleprinter traffic.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|pp=1-6}}\n\n==End of the telegraph era==\n{{further|Telegraphy}}\nIn America, the end of the telegraph era can be associated with the fall of the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]]. Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]]. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future{{explain|date=October 2019}} and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}} [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.  AT&T bought Western Union's electronic mail and [[Telex]] businesses in 1990.\n\nAlthough commercial \"telegraph\" services are still available in [[Worldwide use of telegrams by country|many countries]], transmission is usually done by some form of [[data transmission]] other than traditional telegraphy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[92 Code]]\n* [[Aurora (astronomy)#Auroral events of historical significance|Aurora (astronomy)]]\n* [[Geomagnetically induced current]]\n* [[Great Northern Telegraph Company]]\n* [[Harrison Gray Dyar]], who supposedly erected the first telegraph line and dispatched the first telegram\n* [[Neutral direct-current telegraph system]]\n* [[Western Electric Company]]\n* [[Wireless telegraphy]]\n* [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&T)\n* [[Bell Canada]]\n* [[Speedwell Ironworks]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Citation |last = Beauchamp |first = Ken |title = History Of Telegraphy |place = London |publisher = The Institution Of Electrical Engineers |year = 2001 |isbn = 978-0-85296-792-8 }}\n*Bowers, Brian, ''Sir Charles Wheatstone: 1802\u20131875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0852961030}}.\n*{{Citation | last = Calvert | first = J.

The bridge was proposed in the early 20th century as part of a plan to link Chicago's south side and north side parks with a grand boulevard. Construction of the bridge started in 1918, it opened to traffic in 1920, and decorative work was completed in 1928. The bridge provides passage for vehicles and pedestrians on two levels. An example of a fixed [[trunnion]] bascule bridge (which is also known as a \"Chicago style bascule bridge\"), it may be raised to allow tall ships and boats to pass underneath. The bridge is included in the [[Michigan\u2013Wacker Historic District]] and has been designated as a [[Chicago Landmark]].\n\nThe location is significant in the early history of Chicago, connecting on the north near the 1780s homestead site of [[Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]] and on the south the early 19th century site of [[Fort Dearborn]]. Events from the city's past are commemorated with sculptures and plaques on the bridge, and exhibits in the McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum\u2014housed in one of the [[bridge tender's house|bridge tender houses]]\u2014detail the history of the Chicago River.\n\n==Location==\n{{multiple image\n| align=left\n| footer   = Aerial view of the bridge, looking south along [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], 1945 (left) and 2008 (right) \n| width    = 127\n\n| image1   = Michigan Ave looking south, Chicago, 6-20-1945.jpg\n| alt1     = 1945\n\n| image2   = Michigan Avenue Bridge 20080811.jpg\n| alt2     = 2010\n}}\n\nThe Michigan Avenue Bridge has a north\u2013south orientation, spanning the main stem of the Chicago River between the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] and [[Loop, Chicago|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community areas]] of Chicago.<ref>{{cite map |publisher=Google Inc |title=Google Maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.888861,-87.624361(Michigan+Avenue+Bridge)&ie=UTF8&ll=41.88886,-87.624357&spn=0.003582,0.005901&z=18 |accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref> Its northern portal lies at the foot of the [[Magnificent Mile]], between the [[Wrigley Building]] and [[Tribune Tower]].

The bridge was proposed in the early 20th century as part of a plan to link Chicago's south side and north side parks with a grand boulevard. Construction of the bridge started in 1918, it opened to traffic in 1920, and decorative work was completed in 1928. The bridge provides passage for vehicles and pedestrians on two levels. An example of a fixed [[trunnion]] bascule bridge (which is also known as a \"Chicago style bascule bridge\"), it may be raised to allow tall ships and boats to pass underneath. The bridge is included in the [[Michigan\u2013Wacker Historic District]] and has been designated as a [[Chicago Landmark]].\n\nThe location is significant in the early history of Chicago, connecting on the north near the 1780s homestead site of [[Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]] and on the south the early 19th century site of [[Fort Dearborn]]. Events from the city's past are commemorated with sculptures and plaques on the bridge, and exhibits in the McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum\u2014housed in one of the [[bridge tender's house|bridge tender houses]]\u2014detail the history of the Chicago River.\n\n==Location==\n{{multiple image\n| align=left\n| footer   = Aerial view of the bridge, looking south along [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], 1945 (left) and 2008 (right) \n| width    = 127\n\n| image1   = Michigan Ave looking south, Chicago, 6-20-1945.jpg\n| alt1     = 1945\n\n| image2   = Michigan Avenue Bridge 20080811.jpg\n| alt2     = 2010\n}}\n\nThe Michigan Avenue Bridge has a north\u2013south orientation, spanning the main stem of the Chicago River between the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] and [[Loop, Chicago|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community areas]] of Chicago.<ref>{{cite map |publisher=Google Inc |title=Google Maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.888861,-87.624361(Michigan+Avenue+Bridge)&ie=UTF8&ll=41.88886,-87.624357&spn=0.003582,0.005901&z=18 |accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref> Its northern portal lies at the foot of the [[Magnificent Mile]], between the [[Wrigley Building]] and [[Tribune Tower]].
