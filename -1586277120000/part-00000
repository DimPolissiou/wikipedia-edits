Their mother announces that she is ready to depart, then tells them to have fun and says she'll return at 3:30 sharp. While their mother is out, they have no other choice but to think of something to do.\n\nThe mysterious Cat in the Hat suddenly enters with a bump and fools around a bit. The family goldfish named \"Karlos K. Krinklebein\" orders him to leave, but instead the Cat plays a game which he calls \"Up, Up, Up, With a Fish\", placing the fishbowl on top of a stack of bubbles. The children notice that the Cat is making the house a little untidy, and David recalls their mother's projected return at 3:30. Noting their objections, the Cat bows to the voice of the majority and dejectedly states that he is going to [[Siberia]], Russia. Immediately after leaving, however, the Cat bursts back in claiming that his \"moss-covered three-handled family gredunza\" has been stolen. The Cat accuses Karlos of being the thief, and sings a ballad about the loss of his treasured keepsake.\n\nThe Cat then leads the kids on a search for the missing gredunza using his method of \"[[process of elimination|Calculatus Eliminatus]]\" in which random numbers and letters are drawn anywhere the gredunza should be to mark that they have already checked there. This makes a mess of everything, and Karlos once again orders the Cat to leave. Ostensibly to gain sympathy, the Cat sings a pessimistic song to convey his low self-esteem, then puts Karlos to sleep by singing a lullaby. Having made a miraculous recovery from his bout of depression, the Cat brings out Thing One and Thing Two to aid in the search for the gredunza, singing to the kids that they can find \"anything under the sun\", but instead of being productive, the Things play a variety of sports using Karlos' fishbowl, noting that every house they visit has a pessimistic fish \u201cwhose only one wish is to flatten the fun.\u201d Furious, Karlos accuses the Cat of not being a real cat, and his hat of not being a real hat. However, the Cat indignantly asserts his legitimacy by singing his name in several languages. The tune becomes so catchy that everyone, even Karlos, joins in and contributes, telling the Cat that in Russian he is a \"chapka in a shlyapa\".\n\nAs the song ends, a car horn is heard in the distance. Karlos spots the kids' mother on her way home. The Things get back into their box and disappear, then the Cat exits immediately after. With the house an extreme mess, the kids wonder how they'll clean the house in time. The Cat quickly returns, using a motorized vehicle to tidy things up in a jiffy. After cleaning the house, he departs, hinting that he may return someday. Just as he departs through the back door, the mother walks in through the front door; she asks the kids how their day was, and then tells them that she just saw a cat in a hat \"going down the street with a moss-covered three-handled family gredunza\". The exact identity of the object has never been revealed, but this indicates that the gredunza was never really lost, and the Cat simply wanted an excuse to have more fun. Sally and David look out the window much as they did at the beginning of the special, and watch as the Cat walks off to his next adventure.\n\n==Crew==\n*Voice of the Cat: [[Allan Sherman]]\n*Music: [[Dean Elliott]]\n*Production Designed by [[Maurice Noble]]\n*Directed by [[Hawley Pratt]]\n*Produced by [[Chuck Jones]] & [[Dr. Seuss|Ted Geisel]]\n*Executive Producers: [[David H.

Krinklebine\n* Tony Frazier as David\n* [[Pamelyn Ferdin]] as Sally\n* Gloria Camacho as Mother\n* [[Thurl Ravenscroft]] as Thing One\n* Lewis Morford as Thing Two\n\n==Production==\nThe production began at Chuck Jones' [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts|MGM Animation Studio]] in the late 1960s after the studio had finished ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth (film)|The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' and another Dr. Seuss special, ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]''. After MGM stopped animation production and closed down its animation department for good in 1970, production was moved to [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (marking the company's first Dr. Seuss television special), which was run by Jones' fellow [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] alumnus [[Friz Freleng]] and WB's last original production executive [[David H. DePatie|David DePatie]].\n\nAlthough Chuck Jones and his staff were retained by DePatie\u2013Freleng in the production of the special, Jones left the studio and did not work on any other Seuss projects after ''The Cat in the Hat''. Other staff members that have worked with Jones such as [[Dean Elliott]] and [[Maurice Noble]] eventually stopped working on Seuss projects also. DePatie and Freleng were credited together as executive producers, while Jones was credited as producer with Seuss (under his actual name). For the next three Dr. Seuss animation specials, Freleng and Seuss (again using his real name) were credited as producers, although separately.\n\nDePatie\u2013Freleng animated a new Cat in the Hat Productions logo for this special, which would be used in the next three specials. The pace and rhyming sequences of several of the songs (particularly \"Calculatus Eliminatus\") led many to believe that they were composed by Sherman, since they closely resemble his earlier song parodies, however only Seuss is credited.\n\n==Differences from the book==\nThe plot of the special differs significantly from the original book. Among the many deviations, the sequence in the book where the Cat balances all sorts of objects while standing on a ball, only to overdo it and come crashing down, is left out. The closest equivalent is the fishbowl and bubbles sequences.\n\nAlso differing is the role of Thing 1 and Thing 2; in the original book, they were simply things the Cat brought along to demonstrate fun, but in this special, they are commissioned to help find the cat's \"[[MacGuffin|moss-covered three-handled family gredunza]]\". The vocabulary used in the special is also on a higher level than the book's, though still in Seuss' trademark rhyme.\n\n==Home media==\nThe special was originally released as a [[VHS]] [[videocassette]] on the [[CBS/Fox Video]] label's [[Playhouse Video]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] in 1989. It was later released as part of the ''Dr. Seuss Sing-Along Classics'' release from [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] with [[CBS/Fox Video|CBS Video]] and [[Fox Kids|Fox Kids Video]] in the mid-90's. It was later released on [[DVD]] by [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]]/[[Universal Studios Family Productions]] on October 7th, 2003. [[Warner Home Video]] released the special on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on August 7th, 2012.\n\n==The Cat in other TV specials and series==\nAlthough the original book's sequel ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]'' did not receive an animated adaptation, the character went on to appear in several more Dr. Seuss specials. In 1973, there came ''[[Dr. Seuss on the Loose]]'', where Sherman reprised his role as The Cat in the Hat. Here, The Cat in the Hat appeared in bridging sequences where he introduced animated adaptations of three other Dr. Seuss stories: ''[[The Sneetches and Other Stories|The Sneetches]]'', ''[[The Sneetches and Other Stories|The Zax]]'' and ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]''. In 1982's ''[[The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat]]'', the character, now voiced by [[Mason Adams]] (Sherman had died shortly after ''Dr. Seuss on the Loose'' finished production), meets the title character of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' and sets out to reform his new green adversary. In 1995, the Cat appeared again, this time with the voice of [[Henry Gibson]], to narrate ''[[Daisy-Head Mayzie]]'', a special based on a posthumously published Dr. Seuss book. In 1996, a [[puppet]] version of the Cat starred in ''[[The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss]]'', where he was voiced by [[Bruce Lanoil]] and [[Martin P. Robinson]]. ''[[The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!]]'', an educational animated series based on the ''Random House Library'' series, premiered in September 2010; the Cat is voiced by [[Martin Short]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*{{IMDb title|0284714|The Cat in the Hat}}\n*{{bcdb title|18827|The Cat in the Hat}}\n\n{{Dr. Seuss}}\n{{The Cat in the Hat}}\n{{DePatie-Freleng Enterprises}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cat In The Hat, The}}\n[[Category:1971 television specials]]\n[[Category:Animated television specials]]\n[[Category:CBS television specials]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on works by Dr. Seuss]]\n[[Category:Television programs written by Dr. Seuss]]\n[[Category:Musical television specials]]\n[[Category:Television specials by DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Dean Elliott]]\n[[Category:1970s American television specials]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the TV special|other uses|The Cat in the Hat (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2017}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name          = The Cat in the Hat\n| image              =\n| caption            =\n| genre              = [[Animation]]<br />[[Comedy]]\n| writer             = Dr. Seuss\n| based_on       = {{Based on|[[The Cat in the Hat]]||[[Dr. Seuss]]}}\n| producer           = [[Chuck Jones]]<br />[[Dr. Seuss|Ted Geisel]]\n| voices             = [[Allan Sherman]]<br />[[Daws Butler]]<br />Tony Frazier<br />[[Pamelyn Ferdin]]<br />[[Thurl Ravenscroft]]<br />Lewis Morford\n| company            = [[The Cat in the Hat|Cat in the Hat Productions]]<br>[[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]]<br>[[CBS Productions]]\n| executive_producer = [[David H.

After MGM stopped animation production and closed down its animation department for good in 1970, production was moved to [[DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]] (marking the company's first Dr. Seuss television special), which was run by Jones' fellow [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] alumnus [[Friz Freleng]] and WB's last original production executive [[David H. DePatie|David DePatie]].\n\nAlthough Chuck Jones and his staff were retained by DePatie\u2013Freleng in the production of the special, Jones left the studio and did not work on any other Seuss projects after ''The Cat in the Hat''. Other staff members that have worked with Jones such as [[Dean Elliott]] and [[Maurice Noble]] eventually stopped working on Seuss projects also. DePatie and Freleng were credited together as executive producers, while Jones was credited as producer with Seuss (under his actual name). For the next three Dr. Seuss animation specials, Freleng and Seuss (again using his real name) were credited as producers, although separately.\n\nDePatie\u2013Freleng animated a new Cat in the Hat Productions logo for this special, which would be used in the next three specials. The pace and rhyming sequences of several of the songs (particularly \"Calculatus Eliminatus\") led many to believe that they were composed by Sherman, since they closely resemble his earlier song parodies, however only Seuss is credited.\n\n==Differences from the book==\nThe plot of the special differs significantly from the original book. Among the many deviations, the sequence in the book where the Cat balances all sorts of objects while standing on a ball, only to overdo it and come crashing down, is left out. The closest equivalent is the fishbowl and bubbles sequences.\n\nAlso differing is the role of Thing 1 and Thing 2; in the original book, they were simply things the Cat brought along to demonstrate fun, but in this special, they are commissioned to help find the cat's \"[[MacGuffin|moss-covered three-handled family gredunza]]\". The vocabulary used in the special is also on a higher level than the book's, though still in Seuss' trademark rhyme.\n\n==Home media==\nThe special was originally released as a [[VHS]] [[videocassette]] on the [[CBS/Fox Video]] label's [[Playhouse Video]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] in 1989. It was later released as part of the ''Dr. Seuss Sing-Along Classics'' release from [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]] with [[CBS/Fox Video|CBS Video]] and [[Fox Kids|Fox Kids Video]] in the mid-90's. It was later released on [[DVD]] by [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]]/[[Universal Studios Family Productions]] on October 7th, 2003. [[Warner Home Video]] released the special on [[Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] on August 7th, 2012.\n\n==The Cat in other TV specials and series==\nAlthough the original book's sequel ''[[The Cat in the Hat Comes Back]]'' did not receive an animated adaptation, the character went on to appear in several more Dr. Seuss specials. In 1973, there came ''[[Dr. Seuss on the Loose]]'', where Sherman reprised his role as The Cat in the Hat. Here, The Cat in the Hat appeared in bridging sequences where he introduced animated adaptations of three other Dr. Seuss stories: ''[[The Sneetches and Other Stories|The Sneetches]]'', ''[[The Sneetches and Other Stories|The Zax]]'' and ''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]''. In 1982's ''[[The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat]]'', the character, now voiced by [[Mason Adams]] (Sherman had died shortly after ''Dr. Seuss on the Loose'' finished production), meets the title character of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' and sets out to reform his new green adversary. In 1995, the Cat appeared again, this time with the voice of [[Henry Gibson]], to narrate ''[[Daisy-Head Mayzie]]'', a special based on a posthumously published Dr. Seuss book. In 1996, a [[puppet]] version of the Cat starred in ''[[The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss]]'', where he was voiced by [[Bruce Lanoil]] and [[Martin P. Robinson]]. ''[[The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!]]'', an educational animated series based on the ''Random House Library'' series, premiered in September 2010; the Cat is voiced by [[Martin Short]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n*{{IMDb title|0284714|The Cat in the Hat}}\n*{{bcdb title|18827|The Cat in the Hat}}\n\n{{Dr. Seuss}}\n{{The Cat in the Hat}}\n{{DePatie-Freleng Enterprises}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cat In The Hat, The}}\n[[Category:1971 television specials]]\n[[Category:Animated television specials]]\n[[Category:CBS television specials]]\n[[Category:Television programs based on works by Dr. Seuss]]\n[[Category:Television programs written by Dr. Seuss]]\n[[Category:Musical television specials]]\n[[Category:Television specials by DePatie\u2013Freleng Enterprises]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Dean Elliott]]\n[[Category:1970s American television specials]]\n", "name_user": "2601:581:4300:ee30:adc6:a7f:3d87:51ec", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePlot)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat_(TV_special)"}

The population was 17,578 at the 2010 census. It is part of the [[North Penn School District]] and the [[North Penn Valley]] region that is centered around the borough of [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]]. Towamencin has residential neighborhoods, historic farmhouses, recreational facilities, many schools, and open spaces.  The community is a mix of residential, commercial and rural development. The Township is centrally located within [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] with easy access to the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]\u2019s [[Interstate 476|Northeast Extension]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\nThe first settlers, of German, Welsh, and Dutch descent, arrived in Towamencin Township around the turn of the 18th century. They mainly pursued agricultural endeavors to sustain their livelihood.\n\nThe first grant of land in Towamencin Township was in 1703 from [[William Penn]]'s Commissioners to Benjamin Furley on June 8. The Commissioners granted 1,000 acres (4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) to him. On June 17 of that same year, Abraham Tennis and Jan Lucken bought the property from him, and then divided the land in half in 1709. The [[Edward Morgan Log House]] stands on land that was part of 600 acres (2.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) granted to Griffith Jones by the Commissioners. Edward Morgan purchased 309 acres (1.25&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of this land, which included an existing \"dwelling house\", from Griffith Jones on February 26, 1708. In 1720, his daughter Sarah, who in 1734 would give birth to the famous frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]], married Squire Boone.<ref name=morganhouse>{{cite book\n|title=Edward Morgan House, 1973, Nomination Document\n|publisher=National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places|location=Washington, D.C}}</ref>\nThe land containing the house was then deeded to John Morgan, son of Edward, on August 23, 1723 as part of a 104-acre (.42&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) tract.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.morganloghouse.org/history.php | title=History of the Morgan Log House | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001215505/http://www.morganloghouse.org/history.php | archivedate=2011-10-01 }}</ref> In March 1728 the settlers of the area petitioned [[William Penn]]'s Commissioners for Towamencin to become a Township. The request was granted and a charter given. The land was surveyed and recorded, outlining the boundaries of the Township, known as antioch. Those boundaries are similar to what they are today. In the enumeration of 1734 there were 32 landholders within the Township, with William Tennis having the most area at 250 acres (1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).\n\n===The Indians of Towamencin===\n\nThe American Indians who inhabited the area were the [[Lenni Lenape]]. They lived in [[Pennsylvania]], as well as [[Delaware]], [[New Jersey]], and parts of [[Maryland]]. They were divided into three tribes: the Turtle, Turkeys, and Wolf, which were subdivided into clans, each clan having a name representing the character and situation of the tribe as a whole.\n\nThe Indians of Towamencin Township are of the [[Delaware Nation]]. They had a settlement in the southwest section of the Township along the Towamencin Creek. They established friendly relations with the settlers when they came to the Township. There are some accounts of violence attributed to the Indians, but they cannot be proven and are probably fictional.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} There are many accounts of Indians helping to tend the sick, and trading food and goods with the settlers.\n\nIt is not recorded when the tribes of Indians left Towamencin; it is suspected they left after the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe Maltese Cross of the Towamencin Volunteer Fire Company has an American Indian in the center.\n\n===American Revolutionary War===\nPennsylvania is known as the Keystone State for its role in the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], and as one of the oldest settlements during the time, Towamencin Township played a part: the Township had encampments of soldiers, had many citizens that served, and was the retreating place for [[George Washington|General Washington]] and his troops after the [[Battle of Germantown]].\n\nThe [[Continental Army]] troops were in Towamencin from [[List of American Revolutionary War battles|October 8, 1777 to October 16, 1777]] and camped in the Northern section of the Township. The Township provided a secure area to rest, without fear of surprise attack by the [[British Empire|British]].<ref name=Specht>{{cite book\n  | last =Specht\n  | first =J.

In early 2007 the Board authorized the formation of a [[Strategic Planning]] Committee.\n\nA committee of five residents, two supervisors, and the Township Manager was formed in late February, charged with developing a Five-Year Strategic Plan and a goal of completing it in time for the 2008 budget process.  The committee expanded to six residents in mid-May.\n\nThe committee began weekly meetings in March 2007, starting with the task of developing a Community [[Strategic Planning#Mission statements and vision statements|Vision and Mission]] Statement.  They then received planning inputs from all Department Heads and the Township Manager. At the end of the input process, the committee developed [[Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania#Committee Priorities|Priorities]], which were then voted on by each member of the committee for prioritization.\n\nThe committee then developed [[Strategic Planning#Goals.2C objectives and targets|Goals, Sustainability Objectives]] and Implementation Tools and Techniques for each of the [[Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania#Committee Priorities|Priorities]], segmenting them by areas of the Township Budget.\n\nThe Strategic Plan was then briefed to the Board of Supervisors 22 August 2007 by Mr. Fred Seipt, who represented the entire committee.  The plan was accepted and approved by the Board of Supervisors 26 September 2007.

The population was 17,578 at the 2010 census. It is part of the [[North Penn School District]] and the [[North Penn Valley]] region that is centered around the borough of [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]]. Towamencin has residential neighborhoods, historic farmhouses, recreational facilities, many schools, and open spaces.  The community is a mix of residential, commercial and rural development. The Township is centrally located in the middle of [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] with easy access to the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]\u2019s [[Interstate 476|Northeast Extension]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\nThe first settlers, of German, Welsh, and Dutch descent, arrived in Towamencin Township around the turn of the 18th century. They mainly pursued agricultural endeavors to sustain their livelihood.\n\nThe first grant of land in Towamencin Township was in 1703 from [[William Penn]]'s Commissioners to Benjamin Furley on June 8. The Commissioners granted 1,000 acres (4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) to him. On June 17 of that same year, Abraham Tennis and Jan Lucken bought the property from him, and then divided the land in half in 1709. The [[Edward Morgan Log House]] stands on land that was part of 600 acres (2.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) granted to Griffith Jones by the Commissioners. Edward Morgan purchased 309 acres (1.25&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of this land, which included an existing \"dwelling house\", from Griffith Jones on February 26, 1708. In 1720, his daughter Sarah, who in 1734 would give birth to the famous frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]], married Squire Boone.<ref name=morganhouse>{{cite book\n|title=Edward Morgan House, 1973, Nomination Document\n|publisher=National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places|location=Washington, D.C}}</ref>\nThe land containing the house was then deeded to John Morgan, son of Edward, on August 23, 1723 as part of a 104-acre (.42&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) tract.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.morganloghouse.org/history.php | title=History of the Morgan Log House | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001215505/http://www.morganloghouse.org/history.php | archivedate=2011-10-01 }}</ref> In March 1728 the settlers of the area petitioned [[William Penn]]'s Commissioners for Towamencin to become a Township. The request was granted and a charter given. The land was surveyed and recorded, outlining the boundaries of the Township, known as antioch. Those boundaries are similar to what they are today. In the enumeration of 1734 there were 32 landholders within the Township, with William Tennis having the most area at 250 acres (1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).\n\n===The Indians of Towamencin===\n\nThe American Indians who inhabited the area were the [[Lenni Lenape]]. They lived in [[Pennsylvania]], as well as [[Delaware]], [[New Jersey]], and parts of [[Maryland]]. They were divided into three tribes: the Turtle, Turkeys, and Wolf, which were subdivided into clans, each clan having a name representing the character and situation of the tribe as a whole.\n\nThe Indians of Towamencin Township are of the [[Delaware Nation]]. They had a settlement in the southwest section of the Township along the Towamencin Creek. They established friendly relations with the settlers when they came to the Township. There are some accounts of violence attributed to the Indians, but they cannot be proven and are probably fictional.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} There are many accounts of Indians helping to tend the sick, and trading food and goods with the settlers.\n\nIt is not recorded when the tribes of Indians left Towamencin; it is suspected they left after the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe Maltese Cross of the Towamencin Volunteer Fire Company has an American Indian in the center.\n\n===American Revolutionary War===\nPennsylvania is known as the Keystone State for its role in the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], and as one of the oldest settlements during the time, Towamencin Township played a part: the Township had encampments of soldiers, had many citizens that served, and was the retreating place for [[George Washington|General Washington]] and his troops after the [[Battle of Germantown]].\n\nThe [[Continental Army]] troops were in Towamencin from [[List of American Revolutionary War battles|October 8, 1777 to October 16, 1777]] and camped in the Northern section of the Township. The Township provided a secure area to rest, without fear of surprise attack by the [[British Empire|British]].<ref name=Specht>{{cite book\n  | last =Specht\n  | first =J.

The damage was to 696 fence rails used for firewood. The cost to replace those rails was 8.14 [[Pound sterling|pounds]]. It is not known whether the newly formed government paid.<ref name=Specht />\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of 9.7&nbsp;square miles (25.1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), all of it land. It is drained via the [[Skippack Creek]] into the [[Perkiomen Creek]] and [[Schuylkill River]]. Its villages include Inglewood, [[Kulpsville, Pennsylvania|Kulpsville]], and Oak Park (also in Hatfield Township.)\n\nThe Lansdale Interchange to [[Interstate 476]] is with Sumneytown Pike ([[Pennsylvania Route 63|Route 63]]) in Kulpsville. Other roads of note include Allentown Road, Bustard Road/Forty Foot Road, Morris Road, Valley Forge Road ([[Pennsylvania Route 363|Route 363]],) Wambold Road, and Welsh Road. 63 follows Forty Foot Road and Welsh Road east into Lansdale. The township boundaries consists entirely of straight sides at right angles and most of its boundaries consist of roads.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1800= 413\n|1820= 571\n|1850= 904\n|1860= 1137\n|1870= 1209\n|1880= 1232\n|1890= 1140\n|1900= 1005\n|1910= 1160\n|1920= 1166\n|1930= 1275\n|1940= 1412\n|1950= 1604\n|1960= 3724\n|1970= 4738\n|1980= 11112\n|1990= 14167\n|2000= 17597\n|2010= 17578\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=18491\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=April 4, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the 2010 census, the township was 85.1% White, 4.1% Black or African American, 0.1% Native American, 8.4% Asian, and 1.6% were two or more races. 2.5% of the population were of Hispanic or Latino ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/census/profile/PA|title=Census 2010: Pennsylvania - USATODAY.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref> of 2000, 17,597 people, 6,872 households, and 4,810 families resided in the township.

In early 2007 the Board authorized the formation of a [[Strategic Planning]] Committee.\n\nA committee of five residents, two supervisors, and the Township Manager was formed in late February, charged with developing a Five-Year Strategic Plan and a goal of completing it in time for the 2008 budget process.  The committee expanded to six residents in mid-May.\n\nThe committee began weekly meetings in March 2007, starting with the task of developing a Community [[Strategic Planning#Mission statements and vision statements|Vision and Mission]] Statement.  They then received planning inputs from all Department Heads and the Township Manager. At the end of the input process, the committee developed [[Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania#Committee Priorities|Priorities]], which were then voted on by each member of the committee for prioritization.\n\nThe committee then developed [[Strategic Planning#Goals.2C objectives and targets|Goals, Sustainability Objectives]] and Implementation Tools and Techniques for each of the [[Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania#Committee Priorities|Priorities]], segmenting them by areas of the Township Budget.\n\nThe Strategic Plan was then briefed to the Board of Supervisors 22 August 2007 by Mr. Fred Seipt, who represented the entire committee.  The plan was accepted and approved by the Board of Supervisors 26 September 2007.

The season consisted of 15 races. [[Al Unser]] was the national champion, and the rookie of the year was [[Arie Luyendyk]]. The [[1985 Indianapolis 500]] was sanctioned by [[United States Auto Club|USAC]], but counted towards the CART points championship. [[Danny Sullivan]] won the Indy 500, in dramatic fashion, a race that became known as the \"Spin and Win.\"\n\nIn the fall of 1984, [[Rick Mears]] suffered serious leg injuries in a crash at [[Sanair Super Speedway|Sanair]]. Mears drove only a part-time schedule in 1985, racing at Indianapolis, and subsequently on ovals only. [[Al Unser|Al Unser, Sr.]] took Mears' full-time seat at [[Team Penske|Penske Racing]] as a substitute for the season. Unser, Sr. had one win, ten top fives, and one other top ten, en route to the championship, a battle that climaxed in dramatic fashion in the final race of the season.\n\nDefending series champion [[Mario Andretti]] won the season opener, finished 2nd at Indy, and won the next two races, jumping out to the early points lead. A mid-season slump, however, saw him have only one top five finish the remainder of the year. He then broke his collarbone in a crash at Michigan, and was forced to sit out one race. The driver of the season became [[Al Unser, Jr.]], who won the next two races (Meadowlands and Cleveland), and finished the year with nine finishes in the top 4.\n\nAt the midpoint of the season, Mario Andretti's points lead had dwindled, while [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], [[Al Unser|Al Unser, Sr.]], and [[Al Unser, Jr.]] were all closing in. At the Pocono 500, Rick Mears triumphantly returned to victory lane after his leg injuries. Finishing second and third were Al Jr. and Al Sr., respectively, with Al Sr. now taking the points lead. Unser, Jr. ate away at the points lead over the next four races, and the Unsers were neck-and-neck approaching the season finale. Meanwhile, [[Bobby Rahal]] was making a championship run of his own, winning 3 of 5 races, and closing within 13 points of the points lead.\n\nWith two races to go, Unser, Jr. led Unser, Sr. by 3 points. Father and son finished 1st and 2nd at Phoenix, and the standings were flipped. Al Sr. led Al Jr. by 3 points going into the finale at Miami. Rahal finished a distant 6th at Phoenix, and was mathematically eliminated from the championship.\n\nThe season finale at Tamiami Park ended in dramatic fashion. Danny Sullivan and Bobby Rahal finished 1st and 2nd, respectively, but the attention of the day was focused on the Unsers. Late in the race, Al Unser, Jr. was running third, and Al Unser, Sr. was running 5th. At the moment, Al Jr. was leading the hypothetical title race by one point. Unser, Sr. caught and passed [[Roberto Moreno]] for 4th place in the closing laps, and thus won the championship by 1 point over his son. Unser, Sr. afterwards expressed some regret about snatching the championship title from his son, but felt it was his responsibility to his own team and his own sponsors to race to his ability all the way to the end, and it was also in the best interests of sportsmanship to all competitors not to give favor to his son. Unser, Sr. also knew his days were numbered as a competitive driver on the circuit, while he knew Unser, Jr. had many years ahead to have another chance at the title (Al Jr. would indeed win the championship twice - 1990 and 1994).\n\nThe 1985 season saw two controversies at two separate races. The Michigan 500 had to be postponed for a week due to tire issues. In September, the race at Sanair came to a bizarre conclusion when the pace car, leading the field on the final lap under caution, suddenly veered into the pits on the final turn. Leader Johnny Rutherford was not informed, and second place Pancho Carter accelerated past him and beat him to the finish line. Officials initially awarded the victory to Carter, and Rutherford protested. After review, Rutherford was eventually restored the victory.\n\n==Drivers and teams==\nThe following teams and [[List of Champ Car drivers|drivers]] competed in the 1985 [[Champ Car|Indy Car World Series]] season.

Later in the race [[Jacques Villeneuve (elder)|Jacques Villeneuve, Sr.]] collided with leader [[Bobby Rahal]] in attempt to challenge for the lead, taking both out. The race finished under a yellow flag, but the safety car entered pit lane on the final lap, and thinking there would be a final restart, [[Pancho Carter]] passed [[Johnny Rutherford]] after the safety car entered pit lane and before the finish line.  CART initially declared Carter the winner, but an appeals panel later overturned the decision and confirmed Rutherford's victory.  In many codes of motorsport (typically FIA Code) the safety car enters pit lane as the field is on the final lap, and the cars cross the checkered flag together without the safety car on course.  However, this practice is not accepted in North America, where the safety car leads the leaders to the finish line if the safety car situation exists.\n\n==See also==\n* [[1985 Indianapolis 500]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.driverdb.com/standings/5-1985/|title=PPG Indy Car World Series 1985|author=\u00c5berg, Andreas|publisher=Driver Database|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.champcarstats.com/year/1985.htm|title=1985 PPG Indy Car World Series|publisher=Champ Car Stats|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.indy500.com/stats/view/boxscore/year/1985/|title=Official Box Score: 69th Indianapolis 500-Mile Race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway|publisher=Indianapolis Motor Speedway|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.champcar.ws/Results/Standings.asp?Year=1985 |title=Champ Car > Standings after Beatrice Indy {{sic|nolink=y|Challange|expected=Challenge}} |publisher=Champ Car World Series |date=October 24, 2008 |accessdate=July 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022080242/http://www.champcar.ws/Results/Standings.asp?Year=1985 |archivedate=2008-10-22 |url-status=dead }}\n* [http://www.champcarstats.com/ ChampCarStats.com] ([https://www.webcitation.org/5iYYQRbme?url=http://www.champcarstats.com/ Archived] 2009-07-26)]\n\n{{American Championship Car seasons}}\n{{Champ Car Seasons}}\n\n[[Category:Champ Car seasons]]\n[[Category:1985 in motorsport|IndyCar]]\n[[Category:1985 in CART| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{American Championship Car season\n|year               = 1985\n|series             = CART\n|series_name = [[PPG Industries|PPG]] Indy Car World Series\n|series_logo    =\n|races          = 15\n|start_date     = April 14\n|end_date       = November 10\n|season_champ   = {{Flagicon|United States}} [[Al Unser]]\n|constructor_champ = {{Flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[March Engineering|March 85C/84C]]\n|manufacturer_champ = {{Flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Cosworth DFV#DFX|Cosworth DFX]] \n|rookie_of_year = {{Flagicon|The Netherlands}} [[Arie Luyendyk]]\n|pole_positions =  {{Flagicon|United States}} [[Bobby Rahal]]\n|nations_cup = {{Flagicon|United States}} United States\n|indy_winner    =  {{Flagicon|United States}} [[Danny Sullivan]]\n|previous       = [[1984 CART PPG Indy Car World Series|1984]]\n|next           = [[1986 CART PPG Indy Car World Series|1986]]\n}}\nThe '''1985 CART PPG Indy Car World Series''' season was the 7th national championship season of [[American open-wheel car racing|American open wheel racing]] sanctioned by [[Champ Car|CART]]. The season consisted of 15 races. [[Al Unser]] was the national champion, and the rookie of the year was [[Arie Luyendyk]]. The [[1985 Indianapolis 500]] was sanctioned by [[United States Auto Club|USAC]], but counted towards the CART points championship. [[Danny Sullivan]] won the Indy 500, in dramatic fashion, a race that became known as the \"Spin and Win.\"\n\nIn the fall of 1984, [[Rick Mears]] suffered serious leg injuries in a crash at [[Sanair Super Speedway|Sanair]]. Mears drove only a part-time schedule in 1985, racing at Indianapolis, and subsequently on ovals only. [[Al Unser|Al Unser, Sr.]] took Mears' full-time seat at [[Team Penske|Penske Racing]] as a substitute for the season. Unser, Sr. had one win, ten top fives, and one other top ten, en route to the championship, a battle that climaxed in dramatic fashion in the final race of the season.\n\nDefending series champion [[Mario Andretti]] won the season opener, finished 2nd at Indy, and won the next two races, jumping out to the early points lead. A mid-season slump, however, saw him have only one top five finish the remainder of the year. He then broke his collarbone in a crash at Michigan, and was forced to sit out one race. The driver of the season became [[Al Unser, Jr.]], who won the next two races (Meadowlands and Cleveland), and finished the year with nine finishes in the top 4.\n\nAt the midpoint of the season, Mario Andretti's points lead had dwindled, while [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], [[Al Unser|Al Unser, Sr.]], and [[Al Unser, Jr.]] were all closing in. At the Pocono 500, Rick Mears triumphantly returned to victory lane after his leg injuries. Finishing second and third were Al Jr. and Al Sr., respectively, with Al Sr. now taking the points lead. Unser, Jr. ate away at the points lead over the next four races, and the Unsers were neck-and-neck approaching the season finale. Meanwhile, [[Bobby Rahal]] was making a championship run of his own, winning 3 of 5 races, and closing within 13 points of the points lead.\n\nWith two races to go, Unser, Jr. led Unser, Sr. by 3 points. Father and son finished 1st and 2nd at Phoenix, and the standings were flipped. Al Sr. led Al Jr. by 3 points going into the finale at Miami. Rahal finished a distant 6th at Phoenix, and was mathematically eliminated from the championship.\n\nThe season finale at Tamiami Park ended in dramatic fashion. Danny Sullivan and Bobby Rahal finished 1st and 2nd, respectively, but the attention of the day was focused on the Unsers. Late in the race, Al Unser, Jr. was running third, and Al Unser, Sr. was running 5th. At the moment, Al Jr. was leading the hypothetical title race by one point. Unser, Sr. caught and passed [[Roberto Moreno]] for 4th place in the closing laps, and thus won the championship by 1 point over his son. Unser, Sr. afterwards expressed some regret about snatching the championship title from his son, but felt it was his responsibility to his own team and his own sponsors to race to his ability all the way to the end, and it was also in the best interests of sportsmanship to all competitors not to give favor to his son. Unser, Sr. also knew his days were numbered as a competitive driver on the circuit, while he knew Unser, Jr. had many years ahead to have another chance at the title (Al Jr. would indeed win the championship twice - 1990 and 1994).\n\nThe 1985 season saw two controversies at two separate races. The Michigan 500 had to be postponed for a week due to tire issues. In September, the race at Sanair came to a bizarre conclusion when the pace car, leading the field on the final lap under caution, suddenly veered into the pits on the final turn. Leader Johnny Rutherford was not informed, and second place Pancho Carter accelerated past him and beat him to the finish line. Officials initially awarded the victory to Carter, and Rutherford protested.

Later in the race [[Jacques Villeneuve (elder)|Jacques Villeneuve, Sr.]] collided with leader [[Bobby Rahal]] in attempt to challenge for the lead, taking both out. The race finished under a yellow flag, but the safety car entered pit lane on the final lap, and thinking there would be a final restart, [[Pancho Carter]] passed [[Johnny Rutherford]] after the safety car entered pit lane and before the finish line.  CART initially declared Carter the winner, but an appeals panel later overturned the decision and confirmed Rutherford's victory.  In many codes of motorsport (typically FIA Code) the safety car enters pit lane as the field is on the final lap, and the cars cross the checkered flag together without the safety car on course.

The character of Clark Kent, first created for [[comic book]]s by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] in 1938 as the alternate identity of [[Superman]], was adapted to television in 2001 by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]]. This is the fourth time the character has been adapted to a [[live-action]] television series. Clark Kent has been played continually by [[Tom Welling]], with various other actors portraying Clark as a child. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the ''Smallville'' series, all of which are completely independent of the television episodes. As of 2011, ''Smallville''{{'}}s Clark Kent has appeared in eighteen [[young adult novels]].\n\nIn the series, Clark Kent attempts to live the life of a normal human being, and struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In ''Smallville'', Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all of them at the start of the show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until [[Smallville (season 2)|season two]] and [[Smallville (season 6)|six]], respectively.\n\nWhen developing ''Smallville''{{'s}} version of Clark Kent, the producers decided to strip him down to the \"bare essence\" of Superman;<ref name=\"genesis\"/> he is also fallible, which allows the audience to see his humanity, but that he is also \"... good to the core\".<ref name=\"Core\"/> In the series, he has been seen by critics, and intentionally portrayed by the filmmakers, as a symbolic representation of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].

His main priority was to fit in with his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, \"He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, \u2018Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play.\" Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers \"... alienate[s] him from others\".<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Welling reasoned that by the end of season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run.<ref name=\"TW2\"/> Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:<blockquote>\"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain\u2014and everyone else so much pain\u2014and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run.\"<ref name=\"TW3\">{{cite book|author=Simpson, Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 3|publisher=Titan Books|date=September 1, 2005|pages=116\u2013119|isbn=1-84023-952-2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA significant moment in the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict between him and his father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a \"... callback to [Hothead] ...\" in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow.<ref name=\"TW4\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 4 Companion) pp.&nbsp; 112\u2013115</ref> Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, \"... [Clark] learned a little bit more about what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has.\"<ref name=\"TW5\"/> The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 66</ref> Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 132</ref>\n\nWriter Holly Harold noted that the introduction of [[Green Arrow]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark was able to see how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark to start thinking about things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as \"... soon-to-be Man of Steel\".<ref name=\"TW6\">{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 6|publisher=Titan Books|date=March 2008|pages=112\u2013115|location=London|isbn=1-84576-656-3}}</ref> Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] ([[Alan Ritchson]]) and [[Acrata|Andrea Rojas]] ([[Denise Qui\u00f1ones]]), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes at the end of the episode \"Justice\". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward the day that he would put on the cape and become Superman.<ref name=\"TW6\"/>\n\n===Characterization===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nThe idea Gough and Millar came up with for their show's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his \"... bare essence ...\", discovering the reasons why Clark became Superman.<ref name=\"genesis\"/> In ''Smallville'', Clark is fallible, as Gough explains: <blockquote>The thing that we've tried to portray...is that Clark doesn't always make the right decisions, and by not making the right decisions, he brings further consequences on himself. Whether it's running away from Jor-El at the end of season two, or choosing humanity over some sort of Kryptonian mission, those decisions get him in more trouble, and cause more people to suffer, or in Jonathan Kent's case, to die.</blockquote> Welling agreed with Gough's opinion of Clark's fallibility, stating that the mistakes Clark made showed his humanity.<ref name=\"TW5\"/>\n[[File:clarkjesus.jpg|thumb|left|'''Above:''' The imagery used in the pilot episode, where Clark is strung to a scarecrow pole, drew early comparisons to Jesus Christ and his crucifixion.<br>]]\nEven though Clark could make the wrong choices, season five's \"Aqua\" helped illustrate the concept that Clark was \"... good to the core\". The episode showed how protective he could be over someone, even when that person annoyed him. In this case, he was trying to warn Lois that Arthur Curry may not have been the man she believed him to be.<ref name=\"Core\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg.124</ref> This concept was echoed by the ''[[Seattle Times]]''' Julia Waterhous, who noted that Clark, despite all his flaws, always put others before himself.<ref name=\"Waterhouse\"/> Welling's fellow actors also had their own insights into the character. Kristin Kreuk saw Clark as a kindred spirit who was sad, lonely, but also endearing;<ref>Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.116</ref> whereas John Schneider classified Clark as a [[special needs]] child.<ref>Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.140</ref>\n\nJust like his comic book counterpart, ''Smallville'''s Clark Kent was a symbolic representation of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Established early on, the pilot episode contained a moment when Clark was crucified on a scarecrow post during a high school hazing.<ref name=\"Byun\">{{cite news|author=Judge Bryan Byun |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |title=Season 1 DVD review |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=November 24, 2003 |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704144317/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}</ref> The [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'s [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, \"Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?\"<ref name=\"Owen 3\">{{cite news|author=Rob Owen|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011014smallvilletv2.asp|title=Superman revisited in \"Smallville\"|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=October 14, 2001|accessdate=July 8, 2007|authorlink=Rob Owen (journalist)}}</ref> Echoing Owen, Judge Byun identified the same symbolism: \"Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good of humanity, and ''Smallville'' shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role.\"<ref name=\"Byun\"/>\n\nThis was extended to the end of season nine, where Clark sacrificed his own life in the finale, in order to send General Zod and the rest of the Kandorians to their own world. In doing so, Clark fell off a building \"... in full crucifixion pose, driving home the point that he is sacrificing himself for the good of the planet\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Carlos Delgado |url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=4071 |title=TV Review: Smallville&nbsp;\u2014 Season Nine Finale - 'Salvation' |publisher=ifMagazine |date=May 15, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519115041/http://www.ifmagazine.com/Review.asp?article=4071 |archivedate=May 19, 2010 }}</ref> To this point, [[Cinefantastique]]'s Tom Powers suggested that these images and metaphorical emphasis through dialogue exchanges came across so heavy-handed that a very devout individual might have found them offensive.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Powers|url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/05/smallvillesalvation-%e2%80%94-review/|title=Smallville:Salvation&nbsp;\u2014 Review|publisher=[[Cinefantastique|CinefantastiqueOnline]]|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and camera movements to create their own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.<ref name=\"MemCom\"/>\n\n===Relationships===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nClark's relationships with the other characters evolved over the course of the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a [[yin and yang]] type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite.<ref name=\"metcom\">{{cite video|title=\"Metamorphosis\" commentary by Al Gough and Miles Millar|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|year=2002}}</ref> His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.<ref name=\"TW1\"/>\n\nHis relationship with Lana Lang was one of ''Smallville'''s central relationships. When Clark and Lana met in the cemetery, Clark realized that he had found someone who understood him, who he could talk to, even though it was not in as strong a way as he would have liked. Although Clark felt close to Lana, his fear that she would \"... kick him out of her life ...\" if she learned his secret&nbsp;\u2014 that he came in the meteor shower that killed her parents&nbsp;\u2014 was strong enough to keep him from becoming as close to her as he wished. The lack of honesty caused issues between them.<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Judge Byun wondered how this Clark Kent would have room in his heart for Lois Lane later in life, as he had bounced back and forth between Lana and Chloe in the first season.<ref name=\"Byun\"/>\n\nWith Lana's boyfriend gone by season two, the door opened for Clark, but Welling stated he understood why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart, even after Whitney's departure: \"There's the clich\u00e9 that television shows with a main love interest fail once they get it together.\"<ref name=\"TW2\"/> After briefly being together at the beginning of the fifth season, Clark's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five. Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand in her way, but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana's safety in jeopardy. Apart from that, Clark had learned to walk the lonely road of a hero.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> His inability to cope with Lana moving on with Lex was carried over to season six. This season was the time the writers put Clark through an emotional wringer when they had Lana accept Lex's marriage proposal. For writer Kelly Souders, this presented Clark's worst fear: the woman he loved was marrying his worst enemy.<ref name=\"TW6\"/>\n\nApart from Lana, Clark had a growing [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|relationship with Lois]]. Season five saw the melting of the ice between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, and the fact that both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp.124-127</ref> In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a \"brother and sister friendship\" label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 6 Companion) pp. 124-127</ref> By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rachel Thomas|url=http://tvdramas.about.com/od/smallville/a/ericaduranceint.htm|title=Interview with Erica Durance (Lois, 'Smallville')|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=September 2008|accessdate=October 18, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922134458/http://tvdramas.about.com/od/smallville/a/ericaduranceint.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> His relationship with Lois was included in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of the best TV couples of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Couples Pictures, Smallville Photos&nbsp;\u2014 Photo Gallery: The Best TV Couples of All Time|url=http://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/Best-TV-Couples-1026715/1026726|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Costume===\n[[File:Tomwelling smallville 500.jpg|thumb|upright|In season nine, Clark began wearing a black costume while fighting crime in Metropolis.]]\n\nFor most of the series, Clark did not wear any sort of costume when in his superhero persona.

Abandoning the theme of red, blue, and yellow, the producers chose to keep the costume completely black, save for a silver Superman \"S\" shield painted on the front.

comparing ''Smallville's'' Clark Kent to [[Bryan Singer]]'s Superman ([[Brandon Routh]]) in ''Superman Returns'', ''[[Seattle Times]]''' Julia Waterhous found ''Smallville's'' Clark Kent to be the

The character of Clark Kent, first created for [[comic book]]s by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] in 1938 as the alternate identity of [[Superman]], was adapted to television in 2001 by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]]. This is the fourth time the character has been adapted to a [[live-action]] television series. Clark Kent has been played continually by [[Tom Welling]], with various other actors portraying Clark as a child. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the ''Smallville'' series, all of which are completely independent of the television episodes. As of 2011, ''Smallville''{{'}}s Clark Kent has appeared in eighteen [[young adult novels]].\n\nIn the series, Clark Kent attempts to live the life of a normal human being, and struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In ''Smallville'', Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all of them at the start of the show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until [[Smallville (season 2)|season two]] and [[Smallville (season 6)|six]], respectively.\n\nWhen developing ''Smallville''{{'s}} version of Clark Kent, the producers decided to strip him down to the \"bare essence\" of Superman;<ref name=\"genesis\"/> he is also fallible, which allows the audience to see his humanity, but that he is also \"... good to the core\".<ref name=\"Core\"/> In the series, he has been seen by critics, and intentionally portrayed by the filmmakers, as a symbolic representation of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Tom Welling has been nominated for multiple [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice]] and [[Saturn Award]]s for his portrayal of Clark Kent since the show's [[Smallville (season 1)|first season]].\n\n==Role in ''Smallville''==\n[[Clark Kent]] first appears in the pilot episode of ''Smallville'' as a teen with superhuman abilities that he uses to help others. Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] and [[Annette O'Toole]]) as an infant, when he crash lands on Earth on the day of the Smallville meteor shower in 1989. Twelve years later, trying to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father, Clark saves the life of [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]), the son of billionaire [[Lionel Luthor]] ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]), and the pair become quick friends.<ref name=\"Pilot ep\">{{cite episode|title=Pilot|series=Smallville|credits=[[Alfred Gough]], [[Miles Millar]] (writers) & [[David Nutter]] (director)|network=The WB|airdate=October 16, 2001|season=1|number=1|minutes=42}}</ref> During season one, Clark struggles with the burden of keeping his powers a secret from those close to him.

When he asked about Welling, the casting director said Welling's manager did not want him to do the role because it could hurt his feature film career. After a conversation with Welling's manager, Nutter got Welling to read the script for the pilot, which convinced him to do the part.<ref name=\"pilcom\">{{cite video|title=\"Pilot\" commentary by Al Gough, Miles Millar and David Nutter|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

While waiting for his turn, he realized that the character is one thing above all else: \"... a high school kid ....\" To Welling, simply acting like he was a normal teenager, instead of like a super hero, was the perfect way to embody the character.

According to Welling, he wanted to learn about Clark's heritage simultaneously to Clark learning about it on ''Smallville''. Welling believed that it was important for him to learn with the character, to help him be the Clark Kent envisioned by Al Gough and Miles Millar.<ref name=\"TW1\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.112-115</ref> The actor believed his lack of knowledge of the Superman mythology helped his performance, because Gough and Millar set up the series so that the previous mythology was not as important.<ref name=\"Tom\"/> Welling also enjoyed that he was in the same predicament as Clark with neither knowing the future of the character, beyond the fact that he will be Superman. When Welling landed the role of Clark Kent he was sent various Superman-related gifts, including books and toys, which Welling planned to leave unopened until the show was over.<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Welling was adamant from the beginning that he had not signed on to play Superman, but rather Clark Kent on his journey to becoming Superman, and as such had no intention of wearing the costume.<ref name=\"TW4\"/> When asked about the decision to not wear the suit in the series finale, Welling started \u201cWe jumped onto this idea that at the end of the show, the idea is that Clark becomes Superman and he\u2019s out there, and we know he\u2019s out there, but we can\u2019t go with him, but that we know and we feel good that he\u2019s out there doing good.

This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nEarly in the series, Clark was still learning how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was to fit in with his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, \"He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, \u2018Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play.\" Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers \"... alienate[s] him from others\".<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Welling reasoned that by the end of season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run.<ref name=\"TW2\"/> Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:<blockquote>\"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain\u2014and everyone else so much pain\u2014and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run.\"<ref name=\"TW3\">{{cite book|author=Simpson, Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 3|publisher=Titan Books|date=September 1, 2005|pages=116\u2013119|isbn=1-84023-952-2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA significant moment in the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict between him and his father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a \"... callback to [Hothead] ...\" in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow.<ref name=\"TW4\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 4 Companion) pp.&nbsp; 112\u2013115</ref> Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, \"... [Clark] learned a little bit more about what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has.\"<ref name=\"TW5\"/> The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 66</ref> Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 132</ref>\n\nWriter Holly Harold noted that the introduction of [[Green Arrow]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark was able to see how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark to start thinking about things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as \"... soon-to-be Man of Steel\".<ref name=\"TW6\">{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 6|publisher=Titan Books|date=March 2008|pages=112\u2013115|location=London|isbn=1-84576-656-3}}</ref> Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] ([[Alan Ritchson]]) and [[Acrata|Andrea Rojas]] ([[Denise Qui\u00f1ones]]), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes at the end of the episode \"Justice\". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward the day that he would put on the cape and become Superman.<ref name=\"TW6\"/>\n\n===Characterization===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nThe idea Gough and Millar came up with for their show's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his \"... bare essence ...\", discovering the reasons why Clark became Superman.<ref name=\"genesis\"/> In ''Smallville'', Clark is fallible, as Gough explains: <blockquote>The thing that we've tried to portray...is that Clark doesn't always make the right decisions, and by not making the right decisions, he brings further consequences on himself. Whether it's running away from Jor-El at the end of season two, or choosing humanity over some sort of Kryptonian mission, those decisions get him in more trouble, and cause more people to suffer, or in Jonathan Kent's case, to die.</blockquote> Welling agreed with Gough's opinion of Clark's fallibility, stating that the mistakes Clark made showed his humanity.<ref name=\"TW5\"/>\n[[File:clarkjesus.jpg|thumb|left|'''Above:''' The imagery used in the pilot episode, where Clark is strung to a scarecrow pole, drew early comparisons to Jesus Christ and his crucifixion.<br>]]\nEven though Clark could make the wrong choices, season five's \"Aqua\" helped illustrate the concept that Clark was \"... good to the core\". The episode showed how protective he could be over someone, even when that person annoyed him. In this case, he was trying to warn Lois that Arthur Curry may not have been the man she believed him to be.<ref name=\"Core\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg.124</ref> This concept was echoed by the ''[[Seattle Times]]''' Julia Waterhous, who noted that Clark, despite all his flaws, always put others before himself.<ref name=\"Waterhouse\"/> Welling's fellow actors also had their own insights into the character. Kristin Kreuk saw Clark as a kindred spirit who was sad, lonely, but also endearing;<ref>Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.116</ref> whereas John Schneider classified Clark as a [[special needs]] child.<ref>Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.140</ref>\n\nJust like his comic book counterpart, ''Smallville'''s Clark Kent was a symbolic representation of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Established early on, the pilot episode contained a moment when Clark was crucified on a scarecrow post during a high school hazing.<ref name=\"Byun\">{{cite news|author=Judge Bryan Byun |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |title=Season 1 DVD review |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=November 24, 2003 |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704144317/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}</ref> The [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'s [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, \"Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?\"<ref name=\"Owen 3\">{{cite news|author=Rob Owen|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011014smallvilletv2.asp|title=Superman revisited in \"Smallville\"|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=October 14, 2001|accessdate=July 8, 2007|authorlink=Rob Owen (journalist)}}</ref> Echoing Owen, Judge Byun identified the same symbolism: \"Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good of humanity, and ''Smallville'' shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role.\"<ref name=\"Byun\"/>\n\nThis was extended to the end of season nine, where Clark sacrificed his own life in the finale, in order to send General Zod and the rest of the Kandorians to their own world. In doing so, Clark fell off a building \"... in full crucifixion pose, driving home the point that he is sacrificing himself for the good of the planet\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Carlos Delgado |url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=4071 |title=TV Review: Smallville&nbsp;\u2014 Season Nine Finale - 'Salvation' |publisher=ifMagazine |date=May 15, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519115041/http://www.ifmagazine.com/Review.asp?article=4071 |archivedate=May 19, 2010 }}</ref> To this point, [[Cinefantastique]]'s Tom Powers suggested that these images and metaphorical emphasis through dialogue exchanges came across so heavy-handed that a very devout individual might have found them offensive.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Powers|url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/05/smallvillesalvation-%e2%80%94-review/|title=Smallville:Salvation&nbsp;\u2014 Review|publisher=[[Cinefantastique|CinefantastiqueOnline]]|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and camera movements to create their own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.<ref name=\"MemCom\"/>\n\n===Relationships===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nClark's relationships with the other characters evolved over the course of the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a [[yin and yang]] type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite.<ref name=\"metcom\">{{cite video|title=\"Metamorphosis\" commentary by Al Gough and Miles Millar|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|year=2002}}</ref> His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.<ref name=\"TW1\"/>\n\nHis relationship with Lana Lang was one of ''Smallville'''s central relationships. When Clark and Lana met in the cemetery, Clark realized that he had found someone who understood him, who he could talk to, even though it was not in as strong a way as he would have liked. Although Clark felt close to Lana, his fear that she would \"... kick him out of her life ...\" if she learned his secret&nbsp;\u2014 that he came in the meteor shower that killed her parents&nbsp;\u2014 was strong enough to keep him from becoming as close to her as he wished. The lack of honesty caused issues between them.<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Judge Byun wondered how this Clark Kent would have room in his heart for Lois Lane later in life, as he had bounced back and forth between Lana and Chloe in the first season.<ref name=\"Byun\"/>\n\nWith Lana's boyfriend gone by season two, the door opened for Clark, but Welling stated he understood why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart, even after Whitney's departure: \"There's the clich\u00e9 that television shows with a main love interest fail once they get it together.\"<ref name=\"TW2\"/> After briefly being together at the beginning of the fifth season, Clark's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five. Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand in her way, but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana's safety in jeopardy. Apart from that, Clark had learned to walk the lonely road of a hero.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> His inability to cope with Lana moving on with Lex was carried over to season six. This season was the time the writers put Clark through an emotional wringer when they had Lana accept Lex's marriage proposal. For writer Kelly Souders, this presented Clark's worst fear: the woman he loved was marrying his worst enemy.<ref name=\"TW6\"/>\n\nApart from Lana, Clark had a growing [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|relationship with Lois]]. Season five saw the melting of the ice between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, and the fact that both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp.124-127</ref> In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a \"brother and sister friendship\" label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 6 Companion) pp. 124-127</ref> By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rachel Thomas|url=http://tvdramas.about.com/od/smallville/a/ericaduranceint.htm|title=Interview with Erica Durance (Lois, 'Smallville')|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=September 2008|accessdate=October 18, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922134458/http://tvdramas.about.com/od/smallville/a/ericaduranceint.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> His relationship with Lois was included in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of the best TV couples of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Couples Pictures, Smallville Photos&nbsp;\u2014 Photo Gallery: The Best TV Couples of All Time|url=http://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/Best-TV-Couples-1026715/1026726|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Costume===\n[[File:Tomwelling smallville 500.jpg|thumb|upright|In season nine, Clark began wearing a black costume while fighting crime in Metropolis.]]\n\nFor most of the series, Clark did not wear any sort of costume when in his superhero persona.

Every Friday for three weeks in a row, the stories which follow the primary story arcs, were released online and were referred to as episodes. The following week, the preceding three episodes were released as a print comic. Parallel to the main story arc, other story arcs featuring other characters (many of which were part of the future \"Justice League America\") were released online every fourth Friday, and collected and printed in special editions by themselves, separate from the main story. Written by [[Bryan Q. Miller]], who wrote for the television series, the comic took up the story of the ''Smallville'' characters six months after The Blur saved Earth from the Apokolips.
