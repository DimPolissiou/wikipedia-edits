Similarly, the 17th-century exorcist [[S\u00e9bastien Micha\u00eblis]], in his ''Admirable History'' (1612), placed Beelzebub among the three most prominent fallen [[angel]]s, the other two being Lucifer and [[Leviathan]]. [[John Milton]], in his epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', first published in 1667, identified an unholy trinity consisting of Beelzebub, Lucifer, and [[Astaroth]], with Beelzebub as the second-ranking of the many fallen angels. Milton wrote of Beelzebub \"than whom, Satan except, none higher sat.\" Beelzebub is also a character in [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', first published in 1678.\n\nSebastien Michaelis associated Beelzebub with the deadly sin of [[pride]]. However, according to [[Peter Binsfeld]], Beelzebub was the demon of [[gluttony]], one of the other [[seven deadly sins]], whereas [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]] asserted that Beelzebub was the prince of [[Idolatry|false gods]].\n\nWithin religious circles, the accusation of demon possession has been used as both an insult and an attempt to categorize unexplained behavior. Not only had the [[Pharisees]] disparagingly accused [[Jesus]] of using Beelzebub's demonic powers to heal people (Luke 11:14\u201326), but others have been labeled possessed for acts of an extreme nature. Down through history, Beelzebub has been held responsible for many cases of [[demonic possession]], such as that of Sister Madeleine de Demandolx de la Palud, [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 1611, whose relationship with Father Jean-Baptiste Gaufridi led not only to countless traumatic events at the hands of her inquisitors, but also to the torture and execution of that \"bewitcher of young nuns\", Gaufridi himself. Beelzebub was also imagined to be sowing his influence in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]; his name came up repeatedly during the [[Salem witch trials]], the last large-scale public expression of [[Witch-hunt|witch hysteria]] in either [[North America]] or [[Europe]], and afterwards, the Rev.

Satan and Beelzebub.jpg|alt=|thumb|Satan and Beelzebub]]\nIn [[Mark 3]]:22, the [[scribes]] accuse [[Jesus]] of [[Exorcism#Jesus|driving out demons]] by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons, the name also appearing in the expanded version in [[Matthew 12]]:24,27 and [[Luke 11]]:15, 18\u201319. The name also occurs in [[Matthew 10]]:25.\n\n{{quote|Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, \"Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.\"\n: \u2014[[Matthew 12]]:25-28}}\n\nIt is unknown whether [[Symmachus the Ebionite]] was correct in identifying these names, because we otherwise know nothing about either of them. ''Zeboul'' might derive from a slurred pronunciation of ''zeb\u00fbb''; from ''zebel'', a word used to mean \"dung\" in the Targums; or from Hebrew ''zeb\u00fbl'' found in {{Bibleref2|1Kings|8:13|NIV|1 Kings 8:13}} in the phrase ''b\u00eat-zeb\u00fbl'', \"lofty house\".\n\nIn any case, the form ''Beelzebub'' was substituted for ''Beelzeboul'' in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation and Latin [[Vulgate]] translation of the gospels, and this substitution was repeated in the [[King James Version]], the resulting form ''Beelzeboul'' being mostly unknown to [[Western Europe]]an and descendant cultures until some more recent translations restored it.\n\nBeelzebub is also identified in the [[New Testament]] as the [[Devil in Christianity|devil]], \"the prince of demons\".<ref>\"In NT Gk. beelzeboul, beezeboul (Beelzebub in TR and AV) is the prince of the demons (Mt. 12:24, 27; Mk. 3:22; Lk. 11:15, 18f.), identified with Satan (Mt. 12:26; Mk. 3:23, 26; Lk. 11:18).\", Bruce, \"Baal-Zebub, Beelzebul\", Wood, D.

The name is used by [[Hades]] as a secondary name for the [[devil]], but it may vary with each translation of the text; other versions separate Beelzebub from the devil.\n\n==Christian tradition==\nBeelzebub is commonly described as placed high in [[Hell]]'s hierarchy. According to the stories of the 16th-century occultist [[Johann Weyer]], Beelzebub led a successful revolt against the devil,<ref name=\"rudwin87\">{{Cite book|last=Rudwin|first=Maximilian|title=The Devil in Legend and Literature|publisher=AMS Press|location=New York|year=1970|origyear=1931|edition=2nd|page=76|isbn=0-404-05451-X}}</ref>is the chief lieutenant of [[Lucifer]], the Emperor of Hell, and presides over the Order of the Fly.  Similarly, the 17th-century exorcist [[S\u00e9bastien Micha\u00eblis]], in his ''Admirable History'' (1612), placed Beelzebub among the three most prominent fallen [[angel]]s, the other two being Lucifer and [[Leviathan]]. [[John Milton]], in his epic poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', first published in 1667, identified an unholy trinity consisting of Beelzebub, Lucifer, and [[Astaroth]], with Beelzebub as the second-ranking of the many fallen angels. Milton wrote of Beelzebub \"than whom, Satan except, none higher sat.\" Beelzebub is also a character in [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', first published in 1678.\n\nSebastien Michaelis associated Beelzebub with the deadly sin of [[pride]]. However, according to [[Peter Binsfeld]], Beelzebub was the demon of [[gluttony]], one of the other [[seven deadly sins]], whereas [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]] asserted that Beelzebub was the prince of [[Idolatry|false gods]].\n\nWithin religious circles, the accusation of demon possession has been used as both an insult and an attempt to categorize unexplained behavior. Not only had the [[Pharisees]] disparagingly accused [[Jesus]] of using Beelzebub's demonic powers to heal people (Luke 11:14\u201326), but others have been labeled possessed for acts of an extreme nature. Down through history, Beelzebub has been held responsible for many cases of [[demonic possession]], such as that of Sister Madeleine de Demandolx de la Palud, [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 1611, whose relationship with Father Jean-Baptiste Gaufridi led not only to countless traumatic events at the hands of her inquisitors, but also to the torture and execution of that \"bewitcher of young nuns\", Gaufridi himself. Beelzebub was also imagined to be sowing his influence in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]; his name came up repeatedly during the [[Salem witch trials]], the last large-scale public expression of [[Witch-hunt|witch hysteria]] in either [[North America]] or [[Europe]], and afterwards, the Rev. [[Cotton Mather]] wrote a [[pamphlet]] titled ''Of Beelzebub and his Plot''.<ref>{{cite book|first=Cotton|last=Mather|authorlink=Cotton Mather|url=http://www.4literature.net/Cotton_Mather/Of_Beelzebub_and_His_Plot|title=Of Beelzebub and his Plot|date=1693|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020921203915/http://www.4literature.net/Cotton_Mather/Of_Beelzebub_and_His_Plot|archive-date=June 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Judaism==\nThe name ''Ba\u02bfal Z\u0259v\u00fbv'' ({{lang-he|\u05d1\u05e2\u05dc \u05d6\u05d1\u05d5\u05d1}}) is found in {{Bibleverse|2Kings|1:2-3,6,16|JPR|Melachim II 1:2-3, 6, 16}}, where King [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], after seriously injuring himself in a fall, sends messengers to inquire of Ba'al Zeb\u00fbb, the god of the Philistine city of Ekron, to learn if he will recover.\n\n{{Quote|Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and he became ill; and he sent messengers and said to them, \"Go inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover from this illness.\"|{{Bibleverse|2Kings|1:2|JPR}}}}\n\n[[Elijah]] the Prophet then condemns Ahaziah to die by [[YHWH|God]]'s words because Ahaziah sought counsel from Ba'al Zeb\u00fbb rather than from God.\n\n{{Quote|But an angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the Tishbite [saying], \"Arise, go up toward the king of Samaria's messengers, and speak to them, [saying], 'Is it because there is no God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
