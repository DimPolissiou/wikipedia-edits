Unlike the other ships in the class, ''Olympic'' had a long career spanning 24 years from 1911 to 1935. This included service as a [[troopship]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], which gained her the nickname \"Old Reliable\". She returned to civilian service after the war, and served successfully as an ocean liner throughout the 1920s and into the first half of the 1930s, although increased competition, and the slump in trade during the [[Great Depression]] after 1930, made her operation increasingly unprofitable.\n\n''Olympic'' was the [[Timeline of largest passenger ships|largest ocean liner]] in the world for two periods during 1911\u201313, interrupted only by the brief tenure of the slightly larger {{RMS|Titanic||2}} (which had the same dimensions but higher gross tonnage owing to revised interior configurations), before she was then surpassed by {{SS|Imperator}}. ''Olympic'' also retained the title of the largest British-built liner until {{RMS|Queen Mary}} was launched in 1934, interrupted only by the short careers of her slightly larger sister ships.<ref>Chirnside, Mark, [http://www.markchirnside.co.uk/rms_olympic_specification.html RMS ''Olympic'' Specification File] (November 2007)</ref><ref name=\"thegreatoceanliners\"/>\n\nThe ''Olympic'' was withdrawn from service and sold for scrap in 1935; demolition was completed in 1937. Decorative elements of ''Olympic'' were removed and sold at auction before she was scrapped, and now adorn buildings and a cruise ship.\n\nBy contrast with ''Olympic'', the other two ships in the class, {{RMS|Titanic||2}} and {{HMHS|Britannic||2}}, had short service lives: in 1912, ''Titanic'' collided with an iceberg in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] on her maiden voyage and sank; in 1916, ''Britannic'' struck a [[Naval mine|mine]] and sank in the [[Kea Channel]] in Greece. ''Britannic'' never served her intended role as a passenger ship, instead serving as a [[hospital ship]] during the First World War.And the truth is they switched Titanic with Olympic the actual truth is Titanic is out of service in 1935 and the ship that downed is olymipic\n\n== Background and construction ==\n[[File:Olympic under construction.JPG|thumb|left|The ''Olympic'' under construction between 1909 and 1910.

Bruce Ismay]], and the American financier [[J. Pierpont Morgan]], who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the [[International Mercantile Marine Co.]] The White Star Line faced a growing challenge from its main rivals [[Cunard Line|Cunard]], which had just launched {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}} \u2013 the fastest passenger ships then in service \u2013 and the German lines [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg America]] and [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]].<ref>{{harvnb|Le Goff|1998|pp=32\u201333}}.</ref> Ismay preferred to compete on size and economics rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be bigger than anything that had gone before as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury. The company sought an upgrade in their fleet primarily in response to the Cunard giants but also to replace their largest and now outclassed ships from 1890, {{RMS|Teutonic}} and {{RMS|Majestic|1889|6}}. The former was replaced by ''Olympic'' while ''Majestic'' was replaced by ''Titanic''. ''Majestic'' would be brought back into her old spot on White Star's New York service after ''Titanic''{{'}}s loss.\n\nThe ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilders [[Harland and Wolff]], who had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.<ref>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2004|p=18}}.</ref> Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for the latter to sketch out a general concept which the former would take away and turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were relatively low on the agenda and Harland and Wolff was authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=25}} In the case of the ''Olympic''-class ships, a cost of \u00a33&nbsp;million for the first two ships was agreed plus \"extras to contract\" and the usual five per cent fee.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=12}}\n\n[[File:Launch of Olympic.jpg|thumb|left|The launch of ''Olympic'' on 20 October 1910]]\n\nHarland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing the ''Olympic''-class vessels. It was overseen by [[William Pirrie|Lord Pirrie]], a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; [[Naval architecture|naval architect]] [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]], the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews' deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and [[Alexander Carlisle]], the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=14}} Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] [[davit]] design.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=20}}<ref name=MC19>{{harvsp|Chirnside|2004|p=19}}.</ref>\n\nOn 29 July 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three \"letters of agreement\" two days later authorising the start of construction.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=55}} At this point the first ship \u2013 which was later to become ''Olympic'' \u2013 had no name, but was referred to simply as \"Number 400\", as it was Harland and Wolff's four hundredth hull. ''Titanic'' was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=56}} Bruce Ismay's father [[Thomas Henry Ismay]] had previously planned to build a ship named ''Olympic'' as a sister ship to {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|2}}. The senior Ismay died in 1899 and the order for the ship was cancelled.<ref>[http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/oceanic2.html Oceanic II] \u2013 thegreatoceanliners.com</ref>\n\nConstruction of ''Olympic'' began three months before ''Titanic'' to ease pressures on the shipyard. Several years would pass before ''Britannic'' would be launched. In order to accommodate the construction of the class, Harland and Wolff upgraded their facility in Belfast; the most dramatic change was the combining of three slipways into two larger ones. ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' were constructed side by side.<ref name=MC19/> ''Olympic''{{'}}s [[keel]] was laid on 16 December 1908 and she was launched on 20 October 1910, without having been christened beforehand.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=319}} For her launch, the hull was painted in a light grey colour for photographic purposes; a common practice of the day for the first ship in a new class, as it made the lines of the ship clearer in the black-and-white photographs.<ref>{{harvnb|Piouffre|2009|p=52}}.</ref> Her hull was repainted black following the launch.<ref name=\"thegreatoceanliners\"/>\n\nThe ship was then dry-docked for her fitting out (at the moment of the launching, the ship was merely an empty shell, without machines, installations, or funnels). At first, only three funnels were planned to be installed.<ref name=P35>{{harvnb|Piouffre|2009|p=35}}.</ref> However, in order for her not to appear weaker than the Cunard's four-funnels duo, a fourth funnel was added. Its function was the ventilation of the kitchen and the storage of deck chairs.<ref name=chem>{{in lang|fr}} [http://pagesperso-orange.fr/titanic/page33.htm \u00ab L'histoire d'une chemin\u00e9e \u00bb], ''Le Site du \u00ab Titanic \u00bb''. Accessed 29 June 2009.</ref> For her propulsion, ''Olympic'' was driven by three propellers. The two three-bladed side propellers were driven by two triple-expansion engines, while the four-bladed central propeller was driven by a turbine that utilised recovered steam escaping from the triple expansion engines.<ref>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2004|pp=29\u201330}}.</ref> The utilisation of escaped steam was tested on the [[SS Laurentic (1909)|SS ''Laurentic'']] two years before.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/White_Star_Liners/Laurentic-I.html \u00ab SS ''Laurentic'' (I) \u00bb], ''White Star Liners''.

The final two collapsibles were stored on the top of the officers' quarters on either side of number one funnel. The only difference with ''Titanic'' is that the two boats on the officers quarters were stored upside down while on ''Olympic'', [on sea-trial and maiden voyage photos], they were stored right side up covered with tarpaulin. Most likely they were also turned upside down after experience with ''Olympic'' during several transatlantic voyages.\n\n== Features ==\n{{main|Olympic-class ocean liner#Specification}}\n[[File:Grand staircase.jpg|thumb|The Grand Staircase of ''Olympic'']]\n[[File:RMS Olympic second class library (30556329924).jpg|thumb|Second-class library of ''Olympic'']]\n''Olympic'' was designed as a luxury ship; her passenger facilities, fittings, deck plans and technical facilities were largely identical to those of her more famous sister ''Titanic'', although with some small variations.<ref name=\"titanico\">{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicandco.com/olympic.html|title=RMS Olympic \u2013 The Old Reliable|work=titanicandco.com}}</ref> The [[First class travel|first-class]] passengers enjoyed luxurious cabins, and some were equipped with private bathrooms.

Instead of large dormitories offered by most ships of the time, the third-class passengers of ''Olympic'' travelled in cabins containing two to ten bunks. Facilities for the third class included a smoking room, a common area, and a dining room.<ref name=\"thegreatoceanliners\"/><ref name=\"Olympiclikecity\"/>\n\n''Olympic'' had a cleaner, sleeker look than other ships of the day: rather than fitting her with bulky exterior air vents, Harland and Wolff used smaller air vents with electric fans, with a \"dummy\" fourth funnel used for additional ventilation. For the power plant Harland and Wolff employed a combination of [[reciprocating engines]] with a centre low-pressure [[steam turbine|turbine]], as opposed to the steam turbines used on Cunard's ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania''.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=28}} White Star had successfully tested this engine set up on an earlier liner {{SS|Laurentic|1908|6}}, where it was found to be more economical than expansion engines or turbines alone. ''Olympic'' consumed 650 tons of coal per 24 hours with an average speed of 21.7 knots on her maiden voyage, compared to 1000 tons of coal per 24 hours for both ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merchantnavyofficers.com/cunard6.html|title=RMS Mauretania}}</ref>\n\n==Differences from ''Titanic''==\nAlthough ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' were nearly identical, and were based on the same core design, a few alterations were made to ''Titanic'' (and later on ''Britannic'') based on experience gained from ''Olympic''{{'}}s first year in service. The most noticeable of these was that the forward half of ''Titanic''{{'}}s A Deck promenade was enclosed by a steel screen with sliding windows, to provide additional shelter, whereas ''Olympic''{{'}}s promenade deck remained open along its whole length. This was a major contributor to ''Titanic''{{'}}s' increased [[Gross register tons|gross tonnage]] of 46,328 tons over ''Olympic''{{'}}s 45,324 tons, which allowed ''Titanic'' to claim the title of largest ship in the world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chirnside|first=Mark|title=The 'Olympic' Class Ships|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-0-7524-5895-3|pages=142}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the B-Deck First-Class promenade decks installed on ''Olympic'' had proven to be scarcely used because of the already ample promenade space on A-Deck. Accordingly, [[Thomas Andrews]] eliminated this feature on ''Titanic'' and built additional, enlarged staterooms with en-suite bathrooms. It also allowed a Caf\u00e9 Parisien in the style of a French sidewalk caf\u00e9 to be added as an annexe to the \u00c0 la Carte Restaurant, and for the Restaurant itself to be expanded to the Port-side of the ship. One drawback of this was that the Second-Class promenade space on B-Deck was reduced aboard ''Titanic''.\n\nA reception area for the restaurant was added in the foyer of the B-Deck aft Grand Staircase on ''Titanic'', which did not exist on ''Olympic'', and the main reception room on D-Deck was also slightly enlarged. {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} private promenade decks were added to the two luxury parlour suites on B-Deck on ''Titanic'', as well as additional First-Class gangway entrances on B-Deck. Cosmetic differences also existed between the two ships, most noticeably concerning the wider use of [[Axminster Carpets|Axminster]] carpeting in ''Titanic''{{'}}s public rooms, as opposed to the more durable [[linoleum]] flooring on ''Olympic''.\n\nMost of these shortcomings on ''Olympic'' would be addressed in her 1913 refit, which altered the configuration of ''Olympic''{{'}}s First-Class sections to be more like those of ''Titanic''. Although the A-Deck Promenade remained open for the entirety of ''Olympic''{{'}}s career, the B-Deck promenade was vetoed and staterooms added like those on ''Titanic'', as well as a Caf\u00e9 Parisien and enlarged restaurant. The 1913 refit also included modifications for greater safety after the loss of the ''Titanic'', including the addition of extra lifeboats.<ref name=\"The Titanic's Forgotten Sister\">{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniecarlson/2019/01/01/the-titanics-forgotten-sister/#393849af2706|website=Forbes|date=1 January 2018|title=The Titanic's Forgotten Sister|accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Olympic in New York cropped.jpg|thumb|''Olympic'' arriving at New York on her maiden voyage on 21 June 1911]]\nFollowing completion, ''Olympic'' started her [[sea trial]]s on 29 May 1911 during which her manoeuvrability, compass, and wireless telegraphy were tested.

By mid-October, bookings had fallen sharply as the threat from German U-boats became increasingly serious, and White Star Line decided to withdraw ''Olympic'' from commercial service. On 21 October 1914, she left New York for Glasgow on her last commercial voyage of the war, though carrying only 153 passengers.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=88}}<ref name=\"Olympiclinersp8889\"/>\n\n==== ''Audacious'' incident ====\nOn the sixth day of her voyage, 27 October, as ''Olympic'' passed near [[Lough Swilly]] off the north coast of Ireland, she received distress signals from the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Audacious|1912|6}}, which had struck a [[Naval mine|mine]] off [[Tory Island]] and was taking on water.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|pp=89\u201390}}\n[[File:HMS Audacious crew take to lifeboats.jpg|thumb|left|The crew of the stricken ''Audacious'' take to lifeboats to be rescued by ''Olympic'']]\n''Olympic'' took off 250 of ''Audacious''{{'}}s crew, then the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Fury|1911|6}} managed to attach a tow cable between ''Audacious'' and ''Olympic'' and they headed west for Lough Swilly. However, the cable parted after ''Audacious''{{'}}s steering gear failed. A second attempt was made to tow the warship, but the cable became tangled in {{HMS|Liverpool|1909|6}}'s propellers and was severed. A third attempt was tried but also failed when the cable gave way. By 17:00 the ''Audacious''{{'}}s quarterdeck was awash and it was decided to evacuate the remaining crew members to ''Olympic'' and ''Liverpool'', and at 20:55 there was an explosion aboard ''Audacious'' and she sank.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=90}}\n\nAdmiral Sir [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]], Commander of the Home Fleet, was anxious to suppress the news of the sinking of ''Audacious'', for fear of the demoralising effect it could have on the British public, so he ordered ''Olympic'' to be held in custody at Lough Swilly. No communications were permitted and passengers were not allowed to leave the ship. The only people departing her were the crew of ''Audacious'' and Chief Surgeon John Beaumont, who was transferring to {{RMS|Celtic|1901|6}}. Steel tycoon [[Charles M. Schwab]], who was travelling aboard the liner, sent word to Jellicoe that he had urgent business in London with the Admiralty, and Jellicoe agreed to release Schwab if he remained silent about the fate of ''Audacious''.

The Admiralty had initially been reluctant to use large ocean liners as [[troop transport]]s because of their vulnerability to enemy attack; however, a shortage of ships gave them little choice. At the same time, ''Olympic''{{'}}s other sister ship ''Britannic'', which had not yet been completed, was requisitioned as a [[hospital ship]]. In that role she would strike a mine and sink the following year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chirnside|first=Mark|title=The 'Olympic' Class Ships|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-0-7524-5895-3|pages=94}}</ref>\n\nStripped of her peacetime fittings and now armed with 12-pounders and 4.7-inch guns, ''Olympic'' was converted to a troopship, with the capacity to transport up to 6,000 troops. On 24 September 1915 the newly designated HMT (Hired Military Transport) 2810, now under the command of [[Bertram Fox Hayes]], left Liverpool carrying 6,000 soldiers to [[Mudros]], Greece for the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. On 1 October lifeboats from the French ship ''Provincia'' which had been sunk by a U-boat that morning off [[Cape Matapan]] were sighted and 34 survivors rescued by ''Olympic''. Hayes was criticised for this action by the British Admiralty, who accused him of putting the ship in danger by stopping her in waters where enemy U-boats were active. The ship's speed was considered to be her best defence against U-boat attack, and such a large ship stopped would have made an unmissable target. However, the French Vice-Admiral [[Louis Dartige du Fournet]] took a different view, and awarded Hayes with the [[M\u00e9daille d\u2019honneur pour acte de courage et de d\u00e9vouement|Gold Medal of Honour]]. ''Olympic'' made several more trooping journeys to the [[Mediterranean]] until early 1916, when the Gallipoli Campaign was abandoned.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chirnside|first=Mark|title=The 'Olympic' Class Ships|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-0-7524-5895-3|pages=96}}</ref>\n[[File:Arthur Lismer - Olympic with Returned Soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|''Olympic'' in dazzle at [[Pier 2, Halifax|Pier 2]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] painted by [[Arthur Lismer]]]]\nIn 1916, considerations were made to use ''Olympic'' to transport troops to [[India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

Her dazzle colours were brown, dark blue, light blue, and white. Her many visits to [[Halifax Harbour]] carrying Canadian troops safely overseas, and back home after the war at [[Pier 2, Halifax|Pier 2]], made her a favourite symbol in the city of Halifax. Noted [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] artist [[Arthur Lismer]] made several paintings of her in Halifax. A large dance hall, \"Olympic Gardens\" was also named in her honour. After the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, ''Olympic'' also transported thousands of American troops to Britain.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=100}}\n\n====Attack on U-103====\nIn the early hours of 12 May 1918, while en route for France with U.S. troops under the command of Captain Hayes, ''Olympic'' sighted a surfaced U-boat {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}} ahead.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=101}} ''Olympic''{{'}}s gunners opened fire at once, and the ship turned to ram the submarine, which immediately crash dived to {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} and turned to a parallel course.

As ''Olympic'' was reversing from her berth at New York harbour, her stern collided with the smaller liner [[HMAT Wandilla|''Fort St George'']], which had crossed into her path. The collision caused extensive damage to the smaller ship.

Until 1930 there had generally been around one million passengers a year on the transatlantic route, but by 1934 this had dropped by more than half.

Unlike the other ships in the class, ''Olympic'' had a long career spanning 24 years from 1911 to 1935. This included service as a [[troopship]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], which gained her the nickname \"Old Reliable\". She returned to civilian service after the war, and served successfully as an ocean liner throughout the 1920s and into the first half of the 1930s, although increased competition, and the slump in trade during the [[Great Depression]] after 1930, made her operation increasingly unprofitable.\n\n''Olympic'' was the [[Timeline of largest passenger ships|largest ocean liner]] in the world for two periods during 1911\u201313, interrupted only by the brief tenure of the slightly larger {{RMS|Titanic||2}} (which had the same dimensions but higher gross tonnage owing to revised interior configurations), before she was then surpassed by {{SS|Imperator}}. ''Olympic'' also retained the title of the largest British-built liner until {{RMS|Queen Mary}} was launched in 1934, interrupted only by the short careers of her slightly larger sister ships.<ref>Chirnside, Mark, [http://www.markchirnside.co.uk/rms_olympic_specification.html RMS ''Olympic'' Specification File] (November 2007)</ref><ref name=\"thegreatoceanliners\"/>\n\nThe ''Olympic'' was withdrawn from service and sold for scrap in 1935; demolition was completed in 1937. Decorative elements of ''Olympic'' were removed and sold at auction before she was scrapped, and now adorn buildings and a cruise ship.\n\nBy contrast with ''Olympic'', the other two ships in the class, {{RMS|Titanic||2}} and {{HMHS|Britannic||2}}, had short service lives: in 1912, ''Titanic'' collided with an iceberg in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] on her maiden voyage and sank; in 1916, ''Britannic'' struck a [[Naval mine|mine]] and sank in the [[Kea Channel]] in Greece. ''Britannic'' never served her intended role as a passenger ship, instead serving as a [[hospital ship]] during the First World War.\n\n== Background and construction ==\n[[File:Olympic under construction.JPG|thumb|left|The ''Olympic'' under construction between 1909 and 1910. The [[Arrol Gantry]] can be seen towering over the ship. ''Titanic's'' keel is visible to the left.]]\nBuilt in [[Belfast]], Ireland<!--DO NOT ALTER, Northern Ireland did not exist in 1912!-->,<ref>https://discovernorthernireland.com/things-to-do/attractions/titanic/rms-brittanicolympic-and-titanic/</ref> ''Olympic'' was the first of the three {{sclass-|Olympic|ocean liner|1}}s \u2013 the others were {{RMS|Titanic||2}} and {{HMHS|Britannic||2}}.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=319}} They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company [[White Star Line]]'s fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912.{{sfn|Beveridge|Hall|2011|p=27}} The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, [[J. Bruce Ismay]], and the American financier [[J. Pierpont Morgan]], who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the [[International Mercantile Marine Co.]] The White Star Line faced a growing challenge from its main rivals [[Cunard Line|Cunard]], which had just launched {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} and {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}} \u2013 the fastest passenger ships then in service \u2013 and the German lines [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg America]] and [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]].<ref>{{harvnb|Le Goff|1998|pp=32\u201333}}.</ref> Ismay preferred to compete on size and economics rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be bigger than anything that had gone before as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury. The company sought an upgrade in their fleet primarily in response to the Cunard giants but also to replace their largest and now outclassed ships from 1890, {{RMS|Teutonic}} and {{RMS|Majestic|1889|6}}. The former was replaced by ''Olympic'' while ''Majestic'' was replaced by ''Titanic''. ''Majestic'' would be brought back into her old spot on White Star's New York service after ''Titanic''{{'}}s loss.\n\nThe ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilders [[Harland and Wolff]], who had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.<ref>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2004|p=18}}.</ref> Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for the latter to sketch out a general concept which the former would take away and turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were relatively low on the agenda and Harland and Wolff was authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin.{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=25}} In the case of the ''Olympic''-class ships, a cost of \u00a33&nbsp;million for the first two ships was agreed plus \"extras to contract\" and the usual five per cent fee.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=12}}\n\n[[File:Launch of Olympic.jpg|thumb|left|The launch of ''Olympic'' on 20 October 1910]]\n\nHarland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing the ''Olympic''-class vessels. It was overseen by [[William Pirrie|Lord Pirrie]], a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; [[Naval architecture|naval architect]] [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]], the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews' deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and [[Alexander Carlisle]], the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager.{{sfn|Hutchings|de Kerbrech|2011|p=14}} Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] [[davit]] design.{{sfn|McCluskie|1998|p=20}}<ref name=MC19>{{harvsp|Chirnside|2004|p=19}}.</ref>\n\nOn 29 July 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three \"letters of agreement\" two days later authorising the start of construction.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=55}} At this point the first ship \u2013 which was later to become ''Olympic'' \u2013 had no name, but was referred to simply as \"Number 400\", as it was Harland and Wolff's four hundredth hull. ''Titanic'' was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1995|p=56}} Bruce Ismay's father [[Thomas Henry Ismay]] had previously planned to build a ship named ''Olympic'' as a sister ship to {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|2}}. The senior Ismay died in 1899 and the order for the ship was cancelled.<ref>[http://www.thegreatoceanliners.com/oceanic2.html Oceanic II] \u2013 thegreatoceanliners.com</ref>\n\nConstruction of ''Olympic'' began three months before ''Titanic'' to ease pressures on the shipyard. Several years would pass before ''Britannic'' would be launched. In order to accommodate the construction of the class, Harland and Wolff upgraded their facility in Belfast; the most dramatic change was the combining of three slipways into two larger ones. ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' were constructed side by side.<ref name=MC19/> ''Olympic''{{'}}s [[keel]] was laid on 16 December 1908 and she was launched on 20 October 1910, without having been christened beforehand.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=319}} For her launch, the hull was painted in a light grey colour for photographic purposes; a common practice of the day for the first ship in a new class, as it made the lines of the ship clearer in the black-and-white photographs.<ref>{{harvnb|Piouffre|2009|p=52}}.</ref> Her hull was repainted black following the launch.<ref name=\"thegreatoceanliners\"/>\n\nThe ship was then dry-docked for her fitting out (at the moment of the launching, the ship was merely an empty shell, without machines, installations, or funnels). At first, only three funnels were planned to be installed.<ref name=P35>{{harvnb|Piouffre|2009|p=35}}.</ref> However, in order for her not to appear weaker than the Cunard's four-funnels duo, a fourth funnel was added. Its function was the ventilation of the kitchen and the storage of deck chairs.<ref name=chem>{{in lang|fr}} [http://pagesperso-orange.fr/titanic/page33.htm \u00ab L'histoire d'une chemin\u00e9e \u00bb], ''Le Site du \u00ab Titanic \u00bb''. Accessed 29 June 2009.</ref> For her propulsion, ''Olympic'' was driven by three propellers. The two three-bladed side propellers were driven by two triple-expansion engines, while the four-bladed central propeller was driven by a turbine that utilised recovered steam escaping from the triple expansion engines.<ref>{{harvnb|Chirnside|2004|pp=29\u201330}}.</ref> The utilisation of escaped steam was tested on the [[SS Laurentic (1909)|SS ''Laurentic'']] two years before.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/White_Star_Liners/Laurentic-I.html \u00ab SS ''Laurentic'' (I) \u00bb], ''White Star Liners''.

The final two collapsibles were stored on the top of the officers' quarters on either side of number one funnel. The only difference with ''Titanic'' is that the two boats on the officers quarters were stored upside down while on ''Olympic'', [on sea-trial and maiden voyage photos], they were stored right side up covered with tarpaulin. Most likely they were also turned upside down after experience with ''Olympic'' during several transatlantic voyages.\n\n== Features ==\n{{main|Olympic-class ocean liner#Specification}}\n[[File:Grand staircase.jpg|thumb|The Grand Staircase of ''Olympic'']]\n[[File:RMS Olympic second class library (30556329924).jpg|thumb|Second-class library of ''Olympic'']]\n''Olympic'' was designed as a luxury ship; her passenger facilities, fittings, deck plans and technical facilities were largely identical to those of her more famous sister ''Titanic'', although with some small variations.<ref name=\"titanico\">{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicandco.com/olympic.html|title=RMS Olympic \u2013 The Old Reliable|work=titanicandco.com}}</ref> The [[First class travel|first-class]] passengers enjoyed luxurious cabins, and some were equipped with private bathrooms.

Instead of large dormitories offered by most ships of the time, the third-class passengers of ''Olympic'' travelled in cabins containing two to ten bunks. Facilities for the third class included a smoking room, a common area, and a dining room.<ref name=\"thegreatoceanliners\"/><ref name=\"Olympiclikecity\"/>\n\n''Olympic'' had a cleaner, sleeker look than other ships of the day: rather than fitting her with bulky exterior air vents, Harland and Wolff used smaller air vents with electric fans, with a \"dummy\" fourth funnel used for additional ventilation. For the power plant Harland and Wolff employed a combination of [[reciprocating engines]] with a centre low-pressure [[steam turbine|turbine]], as opposed to the steam turbines used on Cunard's ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania''.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=28}} White Star had successfully tested this engine set up on an earlier liner {{SS|Laurentic|1908|6}}, where it was found to be more economical than expansion engines or turbines alone. ''Olympic'' consumed 650 tons of coal per 24 hours with an average speed of 21.7 knots on her maiden voyage, compared to 1000 tons of coal per 24 hours for both ''Lusitania'' and ''Mauretania''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merchantnavyofficers.com/cunard6.html|title=RMS Mauretania}}</ref>\n\n==Differences from ''Titanic''==\nAlthough ''Olympic'' and ''Titanic'' were nearly identical, and were based on the same core design, a few alterations were made to ''Titanic'' (and later on ''Britannic'') based on experience gained from ''Olympic''{{'}}s first year in service. The most noticeable of these was that the forward half of ''Titanic''{{'}}s A Deck promenade was enclosed by a steel screen with sliding windows, to provide additional shelter, whereas ''Olympic''{{'}}s promenade deck remained open along its whole length. This was a major contributor to ''Titanic''{{'}}s' increased [[Gross register tons|gross tonnage]] of 46,328 tons over ''Olympic''{{'}}s 45,324 tons, which allowed ''Titanic'' to claim the title of largest ship in the world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chirnside|first=Mark|title=The 'Olympic' Class Ships|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-0-7524-5895-3|pages=142}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the B-Deck First-Class promenade decks installed on ''Olympic'' had proven to be scarcely used because of the already ample promenade space on A-Deck. Accordingly, [[Thomas Andrews]] eliminated this feature on ''Titanic'' and built additional, enlarged staterooms with en-suite bathrooms. It also allowed a Caf\u00e9 Parisien in the style of a French sidewalk caf\u00e9 to be added as an annexe to the \u00c0 la Carte Restaurant, and for the Restaurant itself to be expanded to the Port-side of the ship. One drawback of this was that the Second-Class promenade space on B-Deck was reduced aboard ''Titanic''.\n\nA reception area for the restaurant was added in the foyer of the B-Deck aft Grand Staircase on ''Titanic'', which did not exist on ''Olympic'', and the main reception room on D-Deck was also slightly enlarged. {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} private promenade decks were added to the two luxury parlour suites on B-Deck on ''Titanic'', as well as additional First-Class gangway entrances on B-Deck. Cosmetic differences also existed between the two ships, most noticeably concerning the wider use of [[Axminster Carpets|Axminster]] carpeting in ''Titanic''{{'}}s public rooms, as opposed to the more durable [[linoleum]] flooring on ''Olympic''.\n\nMost of these shortcomings on ''Olympic'' would be addressed in her 1913 refit, which altered the configuration of ''Olympic''{{'}}s First-Class sections to be more like those of ''Titanic''. Although the A-Deck Promenade remained open for the entirety of ''Olympic''{{'}}s career, the B-Deck promenade was vetoed and staterooms added like those on ''Titanic'', as well as a Caf\u00e9 Parisien and enlarged restaurant. The 1913 refit also included modifications for greater safety after the loss of the ''Titanic'', including the addition of extra lifeboats.<ref name=\"The Titanic's Forgotten Sister\">{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/berniecarlson/2019/01/01/the-titanics-forgotten-sister/#393849af2706|website=Forbes|date=1 January 2018|title=The Titanic's Forgotten Sister|accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Olympic in New York cropped.jpg|thumb|''Olympic'' arriving at New York on her maiden voyage on 21 June 1911]]\nFollowing completion, ''Olympic'' started her [[sea trial]]s on 29 May 1911 during which her manoeuvrability, compass, and wireless telegraphy were tested.

However, the cable parted after ''Audacious''{{'}}s steering gear failed. A second attempt was made to tow the warship, but the cable became tangled in {{HMS|Liverpool|1909|6}}'s propellers and was severed. A third attempt was tried but also failed when the cable gave way. By 17:00 the ''Audacious''{{'}}s quarterdeck was awash and it was decided to evacuate the remaining crew members to ''Olympic'' and ''Liverpool'', and at 20:55 there was an explosion aboard ''Audacious'' and she sank.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=90}}\n\nAdmiral Sir [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]], Commander of the Home Fleet, was anxious to suppress the news of the sinking of ''Audacious'', for fear of the demoralising effect it could have on the British public, so he ordered ''Olympic'' to be held in custody at Lough Swilly. No communications were permitted and passengers were not allowed to leave the ship. The only people departing her were the crew of ''Audacious'' and Chief Surgeon John Beaumont, who was transferring to {{RMS|Celtic|1901|6}}. Steel tycoon [[Charles M. Schwab]], who was travelling aboard the liner, sent word to Jellicoe that he had urgent business in London with the Admiralty, and Jellicoe agreed to release Schwab if he remained silent about the fate of ''Audacious''.

The Admiralty had initially been reluctant to use large ocean liners as [[troop transport]]s because of their vulnerability to enemy attack; however, a shortage of ships gave them little choice. At the same time, ''Olympic''{{'}}s other sister ship ''Britannic'', which had not yet been completed, was requisitioned as a [[hospital ship]]. In that role she would strike a mine and sink the following year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chirnside|first=Mark|title=The 'Olympic' Class Ships|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-0-7524-5895-3|pages=94}}</ref>\n\nStripped of her peacetime fittings and now armed with 12-pounders and 4.7-inch guns, ''Olympic'' was converted to a troopship, with the capacity to transport up to 6,000 troops. On 24 September 1915 the newly designated HMT (Hired Military Transport) 2810, now under the command of [[Bertram Fox Hayes]], left Liverpool carrying 6,000 soldiers to [[Mudros]], Greece for the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. On 1 October lifeboats from the French ship ''Provincia'' which had been sunk by a U-boat that morning off [[Cape Matapan]] were sighted and 34 survivors rescued by ''Olympic''. Hayes was criticised for this action by the British Admiralty, who accused him of putting the ship in danger by stopping her in waters where enemy U-boats were active. The ship's speed was considered to be her best defence against U-boat attack, and such a large ship stopped would have made an unmissable target. However, the French Vice-Admiral [[Louis Dartige du Fournet]] took a different view, and awarded Hayes with the [[M\u00e9daille d\u2019honneur pour acte de courage et de d\u00e9vouement|Gold Medal of Honour]]. ''Olympic'' made several more trooping journeys to the [[Mediterranean]] until early 1916, when the Gallipoli Campaign was abandoned.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chirnside|first=Mark|title=The 'Olympic' Class Ships|year=2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-0-7524-5895-3|pages=96}}</ref>\n[[File:Arthur Lismer - Olympic with Returned Soldiers.jpg|thumb|left|''Olympic'' in dazzle at [[Pier 2, Halifax|Pier 2]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] painted by [[Arthur Lismer]]]]\nIn 1916, considerations were made to use ''Olympic'' to transport troops to [[India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]].

Her dazzle colours were brown, dark blue, light blue, and white. Her many visits to [[Halifax Harbour]] carrying Canadian troops safely overseas, and back home after the war at [[Pier 2, Halifax|Pier 2]], made her a favourite symbol in the city of Halifax. Noted [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] artist [[Arthur Lismer]] made several paintings of her in Halifax. A large dance hall, \"Olympic Gardens\" was also named in her honour. After the United States declared war on Germany in 1917, ''Olympic'' also transported thousands of American troops to Britain.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=100}}\n\n====Attack on U-103====\nIn the early hours of 12 May 1918, while en route for France with U.S. troops under the command of Captain Hayes, ''Olympic'' sighted a surfaced U-boat {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}} ahead.{{sfn|Chirnside|2004|p=101}} ''Olympic''{{'}}s gunners opened fire at once, and the ship turned to ram the submarine, which immediately crash dived to {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} and turned to a parallel course.

As ''Olympic'' was reversing from her berth at New York harbour, her stern collided with the smaller liner [[HMAT Wandilla|''Fort St George'']], which had crossed into her path. The collision caused extensive damage to the smaller ship.

Until 1930 there had generally been around one million passengers a year on the transatlantic route, but by 1934 this had dropped by more than half.

It was first proposed as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' response to [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s early explanation for the low-entropy state of our universe.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean |author-link= Sean M.

Theoretically over a period of time on the order of hundreds of billions of years, by sheer chance atoms in a void could spontaneously come together in such a way as to assemble a functioning human brain.

The film is directed by [[Chris Sanders]], in his live-action directorial debut, written by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Omar Sy]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Colin Woodell]]. Set in the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], a dog named Buck is stolen from his home in California and sent to the Yukon, where he befriends an old man and begins a life-altering adventure.\n\n''The Call of the Wild'' was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by [[20th Century Studios]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the \"entertaining action and earnest tone\" but criticized the \"uncanny\" CGI of the animals.<ref name=WrapProj/> The film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $107 million against a production budget of $125\u2013150 million, and is projected to lose the studio $50\u2013100 million. However, it is currently the seventh highest-grossing film of 2020.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]], lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller in [[Santa Clara, California]]. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the [[Yukon]] aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant, Francoise. They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood-in for the CGI creation of Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing the film adaptation of the [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] around 1890s about the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which would be directed by [[Chris Sanders]] from the script by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and would be produced by [[Erwin Stoff]].<ref name=\"Oct2017D\">{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title='Gambit' Starring Channing Tatum Will Open Valentine's Day 2019 |url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/channing-tatum-gambit-to-open-valentines-day-2019-release-1202187558/ |accessdate=July 17, 2018 |work=Deadline |date=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn July 2018, [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Dan Stevens]] were cast in the film, with Ford set to star as John Thornton, who goes on the hunt for gold.

The film is directed by [[Chris Sanders]], in his live-action directorial debut, written by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Omar Sy]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Colin Woodell]]. Set in the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], a dog named Buck is stolen from his home in California and sent to the Yukon, where he befriends an old man and begins a life-altering adventure.\n\n''The Call of the Wild'' was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by [[20th Century Studios]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the \"entertaining action and earnest tone\" but criticized the \"uncanny\" CGI of the animals.<ref name=WrapProj/> The film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $107 million against a production budget of $125\u2013150 million, and is projected to lose the studio $50\u2013100 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]], lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller in [[Santa Clara, California]]. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the [[Yukon]] aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant, Francoise. They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood-in for the CGI creation of Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing the film adaptation of the [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] around 1890s about the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which would be directed by [[Chris Sanders]] from the script by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and would be produced by [[Erwin Stoff]].<ref name=\"Oct2017D\">{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title='Gambit' Starring Channing Tatum Will Open Valentine's Day 2019 |url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/channing-tatum-gambit-to-open-valentines-day-2019-release-1202187558/ |accessdate=July 17, 2018 |work=Deadline |date=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn July 2018, [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Dan Stevens]] were cast in the film, with Ford set to star as John Thornton, who goes on the hunt for gold.

Oceans are important in this regard. When the Earth was formed it had only a very thin atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium similar to the present atmosphere of Mercury. Later the gases hydrogen and helium were expelled from the atmosphere. The gases and water vapor released as the Earth cooled became its present atmosphere. Other gases and water vapor released by volcanoes also entered the atmosphere. As the Earth cooled the water vapor in the atmosphere condensed and fell as rain. The atmosphere cooled further as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in to rain water. In turn this further caused the water vapor to condense and fall as rain.

Oceans are important in this regard. When the Earth was formed it had only a very thin atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium similar to the present atmosphere of Mercury. Later the gases hydrogen and helium were expelled from the atmosphere. The gases and water vapor released as the Earth cooled became its present atmosphere. Other gases and water vapor released by volcanoes also entered the atmosphere. As the Earth cooled the water vapor in the atmosphere condensed and fell as rain. The atmosphere cooled further as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in to rain water. In turn this further caused the water vapor to condense and fall as rain.

They have long, thin legs; a pointy, downward curving bill; and a brush-like tipped tongue. Adult males are covered in brown feathers, have red crowns and under parts; a black mask around their eyes; and white throats. Females and younger chats are colored similarly, but with paler markings. The males are usually more brightly colored than females, specifically during the breeding season in order to attract a mate.\n\n==='''Similar species'''===\nA bird species similar to and often confused with the crimson chat is the male [[red-capped robin]], whose scientific name is ''Petroica goodenovii''.

According to relevant Federal and NSW organizations, the conservation of this bird is secure. Its only significant threat is being killed by predators.'''\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nCrimson chats can be found in deserts, semi-arid regions, woodlands, grasslands and coastal shrublands in the central part of Australia from the west coast to the Great Dividing Range and from the tropics to the south coast. Generally, they tend to inhabit areas on the fringes of wet regions, where it is more dry. They live in various types of shrubland: saltbush, bluebush, acacia and samphire. They move to wetter areas when rainfall is insufficient, which means that there are not enough nutrients produced for the birds to consume. Flocks of crimson chats may wander over a wide area around their range in order to track rain. This nomadic movement helps them find the best flowers and nectar. However, chats do not follow routine seasonal migrations.\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[Image:Crimson Chat female.jpg|thumb|left|Female]]\n\n===Diet===\nCrimson chats eat insects and spiders that are on the ground or in shrubs, and they can use their brush-like tongue to extract nectar or take seeds from flowers close to the ground. They walk more often than they hop and are usually seen on or near the ground.\n\n===Breeding===\nCrimson chats are found in small flocks and go in pairs throughout the breeding season and the rest of the year. Chats have a long breeding season from August to November and a shorter period after the rain season from March to April. These flocks form clusters of nests, which are defended by both the male and female chats. Most calls are soft, metallic twangs (\u2018dik it - dik it\u2019) or high pitched whistles (like \u2018see\u2019 or 'seet'). When agitated they make a chattering sound (a quick \u2018check - check\u2019), which is where their name originates.\n\nIn this species, both sexes help build a nest in a cup shape, which is located close to the ground. It is usually made with grass, rootlets, hair, feathers and twigs. The female lays 2 to 5 pink and white, brown-red spotted eggs, approximately 1\u20132&nbsp;cm (\u00bd inch) in length and width. Both parents help incubate the eggs for around two weeks and feed the young birds once they have hatched until they can fly on their own to find food. If a predator comes near the nest either parent will fake an injury to distract the creature away from the nest. Predators include cats, snakes, foxes and larger birds like ravens.\n\n<tt>==== Summary of Facts ====</tt><br />'''Minimum Size:''' 11&nbsp;cm<br />'''Maximum Size:''' 13&nbsp;cm<br />'''Average Size:''' 12&nbsp;cm<br />'''Minimum Weight:''' 9 g<br />'''Maximum Weight:''' 12 g<br />'''Average Weight:''' 10.5 g<br />'''Breeding Season:''' August to October (or any time after rain)<br />'''Clutch Size:''' 2 to 4<br />'''Incubation:''' 14 days<br />'''Time in Nest:''' 14 days<br />'''Egg Size:''' 17x14&nbsp;mm\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \"Honeyeaters and Australian Chats.\"Firefly Encyclopedia of Birds. 1st ed. 2003.\n* Perrins, Christopher. \"Australian Chats.\"Birds: Their Life, Their Ways, Their World. 3rd ed. 1979.\n* \"Australian Chats: Epthianuridae.\" 21 Dec 2003. 13 Dec 2006 [http://montereybay.com/creagrus/Australian_chats.html].\n* \"Australian Chat.\" Ebsco Animals.

The series premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on January 2, 2019, and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]].\n\nThe series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|after]] [[Super Bowl LIV]] on February 2, 2020.\n\n==History==\n''The Masked Singer'' is based on the South Korean show ''[[King of Mask Singer]]''. Executive producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a Thai restaurant. While an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing on a television, he observed that the other patrons \"were all just staring at this TV watching this crazy kangaroo in like a [[Artificial leather|pleather]] outfit singing, and we didn't even finish dinner.\" Plestis and his daughter began to research the series, and he later secured the rights to produce an American adaptation, which he sold to Fox.\n\nDue to Plestis' relationship with the studio, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]] of ''The Masked Singer'' was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s parent [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]). For the second season, production transitioned to a new in-house studio under the Fox network, Fox Alternative Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1019279/the-secrets-of-the-masked-singer-everything-we-ve-learned-about-tv-s-most-mysterious-show|title=The Secrets of The Masked Singer: Everything We've Learned About TV's Most Mysterious Show|date=February 27, 2019|website=E!

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, and the panelists and audience vote for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask and reveal their identity.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\">{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Natalie |title=The Masked Singer Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl |url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/ |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |accessdate=May 13, 2019 |date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show, referred to as the \"clue package\" by the panelists. Such clues may feature cryptic allusions to what the celebrity is known for, or may be more direct references to public but somewhat obscure knowledge of the celebrity. Pre-taped interviews are given as hints and feature celebrities' distorted voices.

2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This ambition was evident in many of the season's costumes. Tree was experimental; Toybina and her team challenged themselves to question \"what fabric can do\" by creating something new and different. Meanwhile, Fox was steampunk-inspired and the Penguin's triple tail coat was [[samurai]]-like and had its mask [[chrome plating|chromed]] in silver. Ice Cream was also innovative; the costume was formed during a complicated process of sculpting the head \"out of foam and [waxing it] onto the shoulder.\" As opposed to than stereotypical black and red accents, Toybina wanted to create a sleek costume for Black Widow by experimenting with texture and movement for its design, and rather than designing the expected appearance of a Leopard, Toybina relegated animal print to the costume's mask only and instead created a vintage look with a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] dress and large collar. Toybina says she wanted to push the boundaries of costume design and created a \"theatrical environment\" made of petals surrounding the face mask of the Flower. In order to confuse viewers, the celebrity inside the Flamingo saw out of a peephole in the neck instead of the head to hide their true height.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/> \n\nMovie and cultural influences were also present in the season; the [[hippie]]-like Eagle embodied [[Americana]] and was influenced by [[rock and roll|rock]] musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], while the Panda was imagined as a playful costume that would appeal to younger viewers of the show as the necklace was inspired by [[gumball machine|gumball machines]] and the clothing [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]]-like. Skeleton was heavily inspired by the character [[Jack Skellington]] of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and included a top hat made of foam. In the case of the Egg, the costume was requested by a contestant. The end result, which was described as \"somewhere between the runway and [[Lady Gaga]],\" incorporated egg features in four different ways: the costume's mask was a [[boiled egg]], the hat was a [[fried egg]], the intricacy of the [[breastplate]] (which was hand-beaded) represented a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], and the [[overcoat]] resembled a cracked [[eggshell]]. Toybina inserted the beads and stones into the costume by hand, which she says transforms the costume's darkness and sex appeal into beauty onstage.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/> \n\nIncreasing the mobility of the celebrities inside the costumes was also a focus of the season's designs, Toybina says.<ref name=\"TW Oct 2\"/> For safety purposes, Toybina had to reduce the extravagance of Ladybug's face mask so as to make it tight to the face and instead accentuated the volume of the body of the costume. Alternatively, the mask is the main feature of the street-inspired Rottweiler costume in order to allow the celebrity to move freely onstage. One of the last costumes that was created for the season was Thingamajig, which Toybina says resembles a grandfather and an elf with its long bead and ears. Contrary to popular belief, Toybina insists the costume was not made to resemble asparagus, rather, it was born out of pure creativity.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/>\n\nThe third season featured eighteen new costumes. In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons. A fan favorite costume from the first season, Monster, was reimagined as a female (Miss Monster) to create a \"fun and outgoing\" costume that kids would enjoy, while White Tiger was designed to resemble an Egyptian [[List of war deities|warrior]] \"[[King of the Gods|god of all gods]].\"<ref name=\"EW Jan 17\">{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Rachel|title=''The Masked Singer'' reveals White Tiger costume for season 3, plus hints about celebrity under the mask |url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/17/the-masked-singer-white-tiger-costume-season-3-celebrity-identity-clues/|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=March 28, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200118051128/https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/17/the-masked-singer-white-tiger-costume-season-3-celebrity-identity-clues/|archivedate=January 18, 2020|date=January 17, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Series overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! colspan=\"2\" | Number of\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Duration\n! colspan=\"3\" | Finalists\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Celebrities\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Weeks\n! background:gold;\" align=\"center\" | Winner\n! background:silver;\" align=\"center\"| Runner-up\n! background:tan;\" align=\"center\" | Third place\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|1]]\n| 12\n| 9\n| January 2 \u2013 February 27, 2019\n| [[T-Pain]]<br>as \"Monster\"\n| [[Donny Osmond]]<br>as \"Peacock\"\n| [[Gladys Knight]]<br>as \"Bee\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[The Masked Singer (American season 2)|2]]\n| 16\n| 10\n| September 25 \u2013 December 18, 2019\n| [[Wayne Brady]]<br>as \"Fox\"\n| [[Chris Daughtry]]<br>as \"Rottweiler\"\n| [[Adrienne Bailon]]<br>as \"Flamingo\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|3]]\n| 18\n| 14<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=''The Masked Singer'': Fox Alternative Boss On Format Tweaks In Expanded Season 3 & More Guest Judges|url=https://deadline.com/2020/01/the-masked-singer-season-3-expansed-spoilers-details-fox-alternative-boss-format-tweaks-more-guest-judges-1202823886/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=January 7, 2020|date=January 7, 2020}}</ref>\n| February 2, 2020 \u2013 present\n! colspan=3|TBA\n|-\n|}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

series, part of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise, featuring celebrities in head-to-toe costumes and face masks which conceal their identities from other contestants, panelists, and an audience. The series premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on January 2, 2019, and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]].\n\nThe series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|after]] [[Super Bowl LIV]] on February 2, 2020.\n\n==History==\n''The Masked Singer'' is based on the South Korean show ''[[King of Mask Singer]]''. Executive producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a Thai restaurant. While an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing on a television, he observed that the other patrons \"were all just staring at this TV watching this crazy kangaroo in like a [[Artificial leather|pleather]] outfit singing, and we didn't even finish dinner.\" Plestis and his daughter began to research the series, and he later secured the rights to produce an American adaptation, which he sold to Fox.\n\nDue to Plestis' relationship with the studio, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]] of ''The Masked Singer'' was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s parent [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]). For the second season, production transitioned to a new in-house studio under the Fox network, Fox Alternative Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1019279/the-secrets-of-the-masked-singer-everything-we-ve-learned-about-tv-s-most-mysterious-show|title=The Secrets of The Masked Singer: Everything We've Learned About TV's Most Mysterious Show|date=February 27, 2019|website=E!

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, and the panelists and audience vote for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask and reveal their identity.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\">{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Natalie |title=The Masked Singer Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl |url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/ |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |accessdate=May 13, 2019 |date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show, referred to as the \"clue package\" by the panelists. Such clues may feature cryptic allusions to what the celebrity is known for, or may be more direct references to public but somewhat obscure knowledge of the celebrity. Pre-taped interviews are given as hints and feature celebrities' distorted voices. The panelists are given time to speculate the identity of the singer after the performance, including the opportunity to ask questions or gain additional clues offered by the host.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\"/>\n\n===Panelists and host===\n{{multiple image\n| total_width = 420\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = Robin Thicke 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Robin Thicke]]\n| image2   = Jenny McCarthy at E3 2006.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Jenny McCarthy]]\n| image3   = Ken Jeong March 2015.jpg\n| caption3 = [[Ken Jeong]]\n| image4   = Nicole Scherzinger 2012.jpg\n| caption4 = [[Nicole Scherzinger]]\n| image5   = Nick Cannon by David Shankbone.jpg\n| caption5 = [[Nick Cannon]] \n}}\n\nFollowing the announcement of the series, it was confirmed by Fox that the judging panel would consist of singer-songwriter [[Robin Thicke]], television personality [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], actor and comedian [[Ken Jeong]], and recording artist [[Nicole Scherzinger]].

Further, passionate fans of the show had been able to work out identities of the singers from early clue packages, so more difficult clue packages were created for the celebrities in the third season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/masked-singer-season-3-cast-contestants-clues-1203448727/|title=\u2018The Masked Singer\u2019 Season 3: New Changes, Tougher Clues and \u2018Big Names\u2019 in the Cast|first=Elizabeth|last=Wagmeister|date=December 19, 2019|access-date=February 20, 2020|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\n===Costumes===\nThe celebrities' costumes are designed by [[Emmy Award]] winner Marina Toybina.

2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This ambition was evident in many of the season's costumes. Tree was experimental; Toybina and her team challenged themselves to question \"what fabric can do\" by creating something new and different. Meanwhile, Fox was steampunk-inspired and the Penguin's triple tail coat was [[samurai]]-like and had its mask [[chrome plating|chromed]] in silver. Ice Cream was also innovative; the costume was formed during a complicated process of sculpting the head \"out of foam and [waxing it] onto the shoulder.\" As opposed to than stereotypical black and red accents, Toybina wanted to create a sleek costume for Black Widow by experimenting with texture and movement for its design, and rather than designing the expected appearance of a Leopard, Toybina relegated animal print to the costume's mask only and instead created a vintage look with a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] dress and large collar. Toybina says she wanted to push the boundaries of costume design and created a \"theatrical environment\" made of petals surrounding the face mask of the Flower. In order to confuse viewers, the celebrity inside the Flamingo saw out of a peephole in the neck instead of the head to hide their true height.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/> \n\nMovie and cultural influences were also present in the season; the [[hippie]]-like Eagle embodied [[Americana]] and was influenced by [[rock and roll|rock]] musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], while the Panda was imagined as a playful costume that would appeal to younger viewers of the show as the necklace was inspired by [[gumball machine|gumball machines]] and the clothing [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]]-like. Skeleton was heavily inspired by the character [[Jack Skellington]] of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and included a top hat made of foam. In the case of the Egg, the costume was requested by a contestant. The end result, which was described as \"somewhere between the runway and [[Lady Gaga]],\" incorporated egg features in four different ways: the costume's mask was a [[boiled egg]], the hat was a [[fried egg]], the intricacy of the [[breastplate]] (which was hand-beaded) represented a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], and the [[overcoat]] resembled a cracked [[eggshell]]. Toybina inserted the beads and stones into the costume by hand, which she says transforms the costume's darkness and sex appeal into beauty onstage.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/> \n\nIncreasing the mobility of the celebrities inside the costumes was also a focus of the season's designs, Toybina says.<ref name=\"TW Oct 2\"/> For safety purposes, Toybina had to reduce the extravagance of Ladybug's face mask so as to make it tight to the face and instead accentuated the volume of the body of the costume. Alternatively, the mask is the main feature of the street-inspired Rottweiler costume in order to allow the celebrity to move freely onstage. One of the last costumes that was created for the season was Thingamajig, which Toybina says resembles a grandfather and an elf with its long bead and ears. Contrary to popular belief, Toybina insists the costume was not made to resemble asparagus, rather, it was born out of pure creativity.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/>\n\nThe third season featured eighteen new costumes. In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons. A fan favorite costume from the first season, Monster, was reimagined as a female (Miss Monster) to create a \"fun and outgoing\" costume that kids would enjoy, while White Tiger was designed to resemble an Egyptian [[List of war deities|warrior]] \"[[King of the Gods|god of all gods]].\"<ref name=\"EW Jan 17\">{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Rachel|title=''The Masked Singer'' reveals White Tiger costume for season 3, plus hints about celebrity under the mask |url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/17/the-masked-singer-white-tiger-costume-season-3-celebrity-identity-clues/|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=March 28, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200118051128/https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/17/the-masked-singer-white-tiger-costume-season-3-celebrity-identity-clues/|archivedate=January 18, 2020|date=January 17, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Series overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! colspan=\"2\" | Number of\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Duration\n! colspan=\"3\" | Finalists\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Celebrities\n! style=\"width:5%;\" | Weeks\n! background:gold;\" align=\"center\" | Winner\n! background:silver;\" align=\"center\"| Runner-up\n! background:tan;\" align=\"center\" | Third place\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|1]]\n| 12\n| 9\n| January 2 \u2013 February 27, 2019\n| [[T-Pain]]<br>as \"Monster\"\n| [[Donny Osmond]]<br>as \"Peacock\"\n| [[Gladys Knight]]<br>as \"Bee\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[The Masked Singer (American season 2)|2]]\n| 16\n| 10\n| September 25 \u2013 December 18, 2019\n| [[Wayne Brady]]<br>as \"Fox\"\n| [[Chris Daughtry]]<br>as \"Rottweiler\"\n| [[Adrienne Bailon]]<br>as \"Flamingo\"\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|3]]\n| 18\n| 14<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=''The Masked Singer'': Fox Alternative Boss On Format Tweaks In Expanded Season 3 & More Guest Judges|url=https://deadline.com/2020/01/the-masked-singer-season-3-expansed-spoilers-details-fox-alternative-boss-format-tweaks-more-guest-judges-1202823886/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=January 7, 2020|date=January 7, 2020}}</ref>\n| February 2, 2020 \u2013 present\n! colspan=3|TBA\n|-\n|}\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Awards and nominations===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!
