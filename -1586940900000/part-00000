Developed by [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] and [[Creatures (company)|Ape]] and published by [[Nintendo]], it is a compilation of [[nonogram]] logic puzzles. The game stars [[Mario]] who chisels away at puzzle grids to form pictures. The game initially received positive reviews, with reviewers citing its length and addictive nature as a positive, but its grid sizes and absence of typical Mario elements as a negative.\n\nAlthough the game sold well in Japan, the game flopped in English-speaking regions. As a result of this, the game was followed by two sequels, ''[[Mario's Super Picross]]'' and ''Picross 2'', released only in Japan. The next Picross game published by Nintendo to be released in English-speaking regions would be ''[[Picross DS]]'' in 2OO7, twelve years later. Due to its limited sales, the game is somewhat of a cult classic. The game is also available on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] through its [[Virtual Console]] service.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Gameplay of Mario's Picross.png|thumb|left|An example of a 15 by 15 Kinoko puzzle.

The continued success of these games in the Japan region saw Nintendo create the ''Picross NP'' series in 1999, a Japan-exclusive series of games meant to promote other, larger games or series. These games were meant for use with the Japan-only [[Nintendo Power (cartridge)|Nintendo Power]] peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

Developed by [[Jupiter (company)|Jupiter]] and [[Creatures (company)|Ape]] and published by [[Nintendo]], it is a compilation of [[nonogram]] logic puzzles. The game stars [[Mario]] who chisels away at puzzle grids to form pictures. The game initially received positive reviews, with reviewers citing its length and addictive nature as a positive, but its grid sizes and absence of typical Mario elements as a negative.\n\nAlthough the game sold well in Japan, the game flopped in English-speaking regions. As a result of this, the game was followed by two sequels, ''[[Mario's Super Picross]]'' and ''Picross 2'', released only in Japan. The next Picross game published by Nintendo to be released in English-speaking regions would be ''[[Picross DS]]'' in 2007, twelve years later. Due to its limited sales, the game is somewhat of a cult classic. The game is also available on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] through its [[Virtual Console]] service.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Gameplay of Mario's Picross.png|thumb|left|An example of a 15 by 15 Kinoko puzzle.

Sakthivel hates his youngest son Chinnarasu (Sarath Kumar). Sakthivel's daughter's wedding is fixed, and Nandini ([[Devayani (actress)|Devayani]]) is the groom's sister. She meets Chinnarasu during her brother's wedding and wonders why Sakthivel dislikes him. Chinnarasu's sidekick Rasappa ([[Manivannan]]) tells a flashback to Nandini.\n\nChinnarasu was weak in studies from childhood. He was in love with his relative Gowri ([[Priya Raman]]), and elders decide to get them married. However, Gowri is educated, and she attempts suicide, thinking that Chinnarasu is not a perfect match for her as he is uneducated and illiterate. Chinnarasu saves Gowri and cancels the marriage proposal, but blames himself and does not reveal the truth. This angers Sakthivel, thinking that Chinnarasu did not respect his words and stopped talking to him.\n\nNandini gets impressed understanding Chinnarasu's kind heart and develops an affection towards him. Nandini proposes to Chinnarasu, for which he does not agree. Later, he too understands her true love and accepts. Both get their marriage registered, but Sakthivel gets angry knowing about this and asks the couple to vacate the home.

He was in love with his relative Gowri ([[Priya Raman]]), and elders decide to get them married. However, Gowri is educated, and she attempts suicide, thinking that Chinnarasu is not a perfect match for her as he is uneducated and illiterate. Chinnarasu saves Gowri and cancels the marriage proposal, but blames himself and does not reveal the truth. This angers Sakthivel, thinking that Chinnarasu did not respect his words and stopped talking to him.\n\nNandini gets impressed understanding Chinnarasu's kind heart and develops an affection towards him. Nandini proposes to Chinnarasu, for which he does not agree. Later, he too understands her true love and accepts.

Among those let go is Eric Dale (Tucci), head of [[risk management]]. Dale tries to speak about his current, unfinished project, first with human resources staff and then with desk head Will Emerson (Bettany), but is told that this is no longer his concern. While being escorted out of the building he meets one of his risk analysts, Peter Sullivan (Quinto), and gives him a [[USB stick]] to look at with a vague instruction to \"be careful.\"\n\nSullivan works late that night to finish Dale's project, and discovers that current [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] in the firm's portfolio of [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] has exceeded the [[Value at risk|historical volatility levels]] of the positions. Because of excessive [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]], if the portfolio's value decreases by 25%, the loss will be greater than the value of the firm itself and the firm will go bankrupt. Sullivan and his colleague, junior analyst Seth Bregman (Badgley), tell Emerson about the situation. Emerson alerts floor head Sam Rogers (Spacey), who also returns to the office. They attempt to contact Dale, but the company shut off his phone and he hasn't yet returned home.\n\nThe firm's managers hold emergency meetings in the middle of the night in which division head Jared Cohen (Baker), chief risk management officer Sarah Robertson (Moore), and other senior executives discuss their options. Finally, CEO John Tuld (Irons) is called in. Sullivan explains the nature of the problem: the firm needs about a month to layer its MBS products, so the assets stay on the company's books longer than they might prefer, but because they are essentially mortgages (which are generally viewed as \"low risk\") the firm has been able to \"push the leverage\" beyond what they would otherwise be willing or allowed to do. He also explains that his projection of losses greater than the [[Market capitalization|market value of the company]] is only in a 'music slowing' scenario (using Tuld's analogy), noting that if the 'music were to stop', the scenario would be considerably worse.\n\nCohen's plan is for the firm to quickly dump all of the [[toxic assets]] in a [[fire sale]] before the market learns of their worthlessness, thereby limiting the firm's exposure. Tuld favors the plan, comparing the economic situation to one of musical chairs: when the music stops, the last one standing will be left with only toxic, worthless securities. Rogers opposes Cohen's plan, warning that dumping all of their toxic assets, spreading the risk throughout the financial sector, will destroy the firm's relationships with its [[counterparties]], and cripple the market for the foreseeable future. He also warns Cohen that their customers will quickly learn of the firm's plans once they realize that the firm is only selling the toxic securities, but is not buying any new ones.\n\nBy early morning, Dale is found back at his home in [[Brooklyn]]. Emerson tries to convinces him to return to the office, saying that the firm will not pay him his severance and other benefits unless he agrees to participate in their plan, but Dale continues to resist. Emerson also tells Seth he'll probably lose his job in the crisis, but will get a large severance, while explaining to him the amoral, cyclical nature of the markets. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Robertson, Cohen, and Tuld were aware of the risks in the weeks leading up to the crisis. Tuld offers Robertson up as the [[scapegoat]], putting the blame of the crisis on her and forcing her resignation. Dale arrives, apparently convinced by Tuld's representatives that returning truly is in his best interests. Dale and Robertson are instructed to remain in the office all day and do nothing in return for an increase to their severance packages. Robertson expresses regret for not doing more to prevent the crisis.\n\nWith the markets yet to open, Tuld convinces Rogers to go along with Cohen's plan. In a speech to his traders in preparation for the fire sale, Rogers warns them that, by participating, they are effectively ruining their reputations and ending their careers in the industry, but offers a $1.4 million bonus to those able to sell 93% of their assigned securities, with further $1.3 million bonuses if the entire sales floor can reach 93% as a whole. As the markets open, Emerson and the traders immediately begin rapidly selling off their securities and quickly arouse suspicion and anger from their buyers as the hours pass. By the closing bell, the firm has taken tremendous losses, dumping positions for cents on the dollar, but is successful in selling off all the toxic assets.\n\nCohen tells Rogers there will be another round of layoffs, but Rogers will keep his job. Angry that he was retained, Rogers confronts Tuld, telling him that he wants to cash in on his options and severance pay and leave the firm. Tuld dismisses his protests, claiming that the current crisis is no different from various [[bear market]]s of the past, and that sharp gains and losses are simply part of the [[economic cycle]]. He persuades Rogers to stay at the firm for another two years, promising that there will be a lot of money to be made from the coming crisis. Cohen brings in Sullivan, whom Tuld intends to promote. Rogers reluctantly accepts Tuld's deal, but says it's only because he needs the money.\n\nRogers buries his dog in his former (now his ex-wife's) front yard in the middle of the night, and learns from her that their son's financial firm took a big hit but survived the day's trading. The screen cuts to black and the credits roll as the sound of Rogers shoveling dirt continues.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Kevin Spacey @ San Diego Comic-Con 2008 - b.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Kevin Spacey portrays Sam Rogers.]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Sam Rogers, head of sales, Will's boss, and by extension Peter's and Seth's.\n* [[Zachary Quinto]] as Peter Sullivan, one of Eric's risk analysts, who first uncovers the crisis.\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as John Tuld, the CEO of the firm, who is flown in to deal with the crisis.\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Will Emerson, head of trading, who was Eric's boss until his departure.\n* [[Simon Baker]] as Jared Cohen, division chief for the firm, who reports directly to Tuld.\n* [[Penn Badgley]] as Seth Bregman, one of Eric's junior risk analysts, who is dragged along for the ride.\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Sarah Robertson, chief risk management officer, and colleague of Cohen's.\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Eric Dale, head of risk management under Sam and Will, who is fired in the layoffs.\n* [[Aasif Mandvi]] as Ramesh Shah, an unspecified senior management officer (possibly the company's General Counsel) from \"upstairs\".\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] as Mary Rogers, Sam's ex-wife.\n* [[Ashley Williams (actress)|Ashley Williams]] as Heather Burke, one of the junior HR officers responsible for the layoffs.\n* [[Susan Blackwell]] as Lauren Bratberg, one of the senior HR officers responsible for the layoffs.\n* [[Al Sapienza]] as Louis Carmelo, Tuld's personal advisor and aide.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June&nbsp;21, 2010, in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"Dash\"/> More than 80% of the action was shot on the 42nd floor of [[One Penn Plaza]], which had recently been vacated by a trading firm.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Benjamin |url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/zachary-quinto-2011-10 |title=What\u2019s Up, Spock?: He might be a famous Vulcan, but Zachary Quinto has no problem being fully human |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=October 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Chesto |url=http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/massmarkets/2011/10/22/director-of-margin-call-didnt-need-a-big-budget-to-concisely-depict-wall-streets-mortgage-meltdown/ |title=Director of \"Margin Call\" didn\u2019t need a big budget to depict Wall Street's mortgage meltdown |work=WickedLocal.com |access-date=2011-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025235930/http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/massmarkets/2011/10/22/director-of-margin-call-didnt-need-a-big-budget-to-concisely-depict-wall-streets-mortgage-meltdown/ |archive-date=2011-10-25 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in [[Park City, Utah]].

The score was orchestrated by musician Nathan Larson.\n\nThe film made its premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 25, 2011, and opened in theaters nationwide in the United States on October 21, 2011, grossing $5,354,039 in domestic ticket receipts. It was screened at 199 theaters during its widest release in cinemas. It earned an additional $14,150,000 in business through international release to top out at a combined $19,504,039 in gross theatrical revenue. It was a ground-breaking day-and-date release that earned more than $10,000,000 in video-on-demand sales during its initial theatrical release. Preceding its theatrical release, ''Margin Call'' was met with positive critical reviews. The [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] editions of the film were released in the United States on December 20, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nAn unnamed [[investment bank]] begins a mass layoff on the trading floor during a normal business day. Among those let go is Eric Dale (Tucci), head of [[risk management]]. Dale tries to speak about his current, unfinished project, first with human resources staff and then with desk head Will Emerson (Bettany), but is told that this is no longer his concern. While being escorted out of the building he meets one of his risk analysts, Peter Sullivan (Quinto), and gives him a [[USB stick]] to look at with a vague instruction to \"be careful.\"\n\nSullivan works late that night to finish Dale's project, and discovers that current [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] in the firm's portfolio of [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] has exceeded the [[Value at risk|historical volatility levels]] of the positions. Because of excessive [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]], if the portfolio's value decreases by 25%, the loss will be greater than the value of the firm itself and the firm will go bankrupt. Sullivan and his colleague, junior analyst Seth Bregman (Badgley), tell Emerson about the situation. Emerson alerts floor head Sam Rogers (Spacey), who also returns to the office. They attempt to contact Dale, but the company shut off his phone and he hasn't yet returned home.\n\nThe firm's managers hold emergency meetings in the middle of the night in which division head Jared Cohen (Baker), chief risk management officer Sarah Robertson (Moore), and other senior executives discuss their options. Finally, CEO John Tuld (Irons) is called in. Sullivan explains the nature of the problem: the firm needs about a month to layer its MBS products, so the assets stay on the company's books longer than they might prefer, but because they are essentially mortgages (which are generally viewed as \"low risk\") the firm has been able to \"push the leverage\" beyond what they would otherwise be willing or allowed to do. He also explains that his projection of losses greater than the [[Market capitalization|market value of the company]] is only in a 'music slowing' scenario (using Tuld's analogy), noting that if the 'music were to stop', the scenario would be considerably worse.\n\nCohen's plan is for the firm to quickly dump all of the [[toxic assets]] in a [[fire sale]] before the market learns of their worthlessness, thereby limiting the firm's exposure. Tuld favors the plan, comparing the economic situation to one of musical chairs: when the music stops, the last one standing will be left with only toxic, worthless securities. Rogers opposes Cohen's plan, warning that dumping all of their toxic assets, spreading the risk throughout the financial sector, will destroy the firm's relationships with its [[counterparties]], and cripple the market for the foreseeable future. He also warns Cohen that their customers will quickly learn of the firm's plans once they realize that the firm is only selling the toxic securities, but is not buying any new ones.\n\nBy early morning, Dale is found back at his home in [[Brooklyn]]. Emerson tries to convinces him to return to the office, saying that the firm will not pay him his severance and other benefits unless he agrees to participate in their plan, but Dale continues to resist. Emerson also tells Seth he'll probably lose his job in the crisis, but will get a large severance, while explaining to him the amoral, cyclical nature of the markets. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Robertson, Cohen, and Tuld were aware of the risks in the weeks leading up to the crisis. Tuld offers Robertson up as the [[scapegoat]], putting the blame of the crisis on her and forcing her resignation. Dale arrives, apparently convinced by Tuld's representatives that returning truly is in his best interests. Dale and Robertson are instructed to remain in the office all day and do nothing in return for an increase to their severance packages. Robertson expresses regret for not doing more to prevent the crisis.\n\nWith the markets yet to open, Tuld convinces Rogers to go along with Cohen's plan. In a speech to his traders in preparation for the fire sale, Rogers warns them that, by participating, they are effectively ruining their reputations and ending their careers in the industry, but offers a $1.4 million bonus to those able to sell 93% of their assigned securities, with further $1.3 million bonuses if the entire sales floor can reach 93% as a whole. As the markets open, Emerson and the traders immediately begin rapidly selling off their securities and quickly arouse suspicion and anger from their buyers as the hours pass. By the closing bell, the firm has taken tremendous losses, dumping positions for cents on the dollar, but is successful in selling off all the toxic assets.\n\nCohen tells Rogers there will be another round of layoffs, but Rogers will keep his job. Angry that he was retained, Rogers confronts Tuld, telling him that he wants to cash in on his options and severance pay and leave the firm. Tuld dismisses his protests, claiming that the current crisis is no different from various [[bear market]]s of the past, and that sharp gains and losses are simply part of the [[economic cycle]]. He persuades Rogers to stay at the firm for another two years, promising that there will be a lot of money to be made from the coming crisis. Cohen brings in Sullivan, whom Tuld intends to promote. Rogers reluctantly accepts Tuld's deal, but says it's only because he needs the money.\n\nRogers buries his dog in his former (now his ex-wife's) front yard in the middle of the night, and learns from her that their son's financial firm took a big hit but survived the day's trading. The screen cuts to black and the credits roll as the sound of Rogers shoveling dirt continues.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Kevin Spacey @ San Diego Comic-Con 2008 - b.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Kevin Spacey portrays Sam Rogers.]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Sam Rogers, head of sales, Will's boss, and by extension Peter's and Seth's.\n* [[Zachary Quinto]] as Peter Sullivan, one of Eric's risk analysts, who first uncovers the crisis.\n* [[Jeremy Irons]] as John Tuld, the CEO of the firm, who is flown in to deal with the crisis.\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Will Emerson, head of trading, who was Eric's boss until his departure.\n* [[Simon Baker]] as Jared Cohen, division chief for the firm, who reports directly to Tuld.\n* [[Penn Badgley]] as Seth Bregman, one of Eric's junior risk analysts, who is dragged along for the ride.\n* [[Demi Moore]] as Sarah Robertson, chief risk management officer, and colleague of Cohen's.\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Eric Dale, head of risk management under Sam and Will, who is fired in the layoffs.\n* [[Aasif Mandvi]] as Ramesh Shah, an unspecified senior management officer (possibly the company's General Counsel) from \"upstairs\".\n* [[Mary McDonnell]] as Mary Rogers, Sam's ex-wife.\n* [[Ashley Williams (actress)|Ashley Williams]] as Heather Burke, one of the junior HR officers responsible for the layoffs.\n* [[Susan Blackwell]] as Lauren Bratberg, one of the senior HR officers responsible for the layoffs.\n* [[Al Sapienza]] as Louis Carmelo, Tuld's personal advisor and aide.\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June&nbsp;21, 2010, in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"Dash\"/> More than 80% of the action was shot on the 42nd floor of [[One Penn Plaza]], which had recently been vacated by a trading firm.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Benjamin |url=http://nymag.com/movies/features/zachary-quinto-2011-10 |title=What\u2019s Up, Spock?: He might be a famous Vulcan, but Zachary Quinto has no problem being fully human |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=October 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Chesto |url=http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/massmarkets/2011/10/22/director-of-margin-call-didnt-need-a-big-budget-to-concisely-depict-wall-streets-mortgage-meltdown/ |title=Director of \"Margin Call\" didn\u2019t need a big budget to depict Wall Street's mortgage meltdown |work=WickedLocal.com |access-date=2011-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025235930/http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/massmarkets/2011/10/22/director-of-margin-call-didnt-need-a-big-budget-to-concisely-depict-wall-streets-mortgage-meltdown/ |archive-date=2011-10-25 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival in [[Park City, Utah]].

It is also a [[horror movie]], with disaster lurking like an unseen demon outside the skyscraper windows and behind the computer screens. It is also a [[Sitcom|workplace comedy]] of sorts. The crackling, syncopated dialogue and the plot, full of reversals and double crosses, owe an obvious debt to [[David Mamet]]\u2019s profane fables of deal-making [[machismo]].
