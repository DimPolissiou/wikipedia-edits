A dairy is typically located on a dedicated [[dairy farming|dairy farm]] or in a section of a multi-purpose farm (mixed farm) that is concerned with the harvesting of milk.\n\nTerminology differs between countries. For example, in the [[United States]], an entire dairy farm is commonly called a \"dairy\". The building or farm area where milk is harvested from the cow is often called a \"milking parlor\" or \"parlor\". Except in the case of smaller dairies, where cows are often put on pasture, and usually milked in \"stanchion barns\". The farm area where milk is stored in bulk tanks is known as the farm's \"milk house\". Milk is then hauled (usually by [[truck]]) to a \"dairy plant\" = also referred to as a \"dairy\" - where raw milk is further processed and prepared for commercial sale of [[dairy products]]. In [[New Zealand]], farm areas for milk harvesting are also called \"milking parlours\", and are historically known as \"milking sheds\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} As in the [[United States]], sometimes milking sheds are referred to by their type, such as \"herring bone shed\" or \"pit parlour\". Parlour design has evolved from simple barns or sheds to large rotary structures in which the workflow (throughput of cows) is very efficiently handled. In some countries, especially those with small numbers of animals being milked, the farm may perform the functions of a dairy plant, processing their own milk into salable [[dairy products]], such as [[butter]], [[cheese]], or [[yogurt]]. This on-site processing is a traditional method of producing specialist milk products, common in Europe.\n\nIn the United States a ''dairy'' can also be a place that processes, distributes and sells [[dairy product]]s, or a room, building or establishment where milk is stored and processed into milk products, such as [[butter]] or [[cheese]]. In [[New Zealand English]] the singular use of the word ''[[dairy (store)|dairy]]'' almost exclusively refers to a [[corner shop]], or [[superette]]. This usage is historical as such shops were a common place for the public to buy milk products.\n\nAs an attributive, the word ''dairy'' refers to milk-based products, derivatives and processes, and the animals and workers involved in their production: for example [[dairy cattle]], [[dairy goat]]. A dairy [[farm]] produces milk and a dairy [[factory]] processes it into a variety of dairy products. These establishments constitute the global '''dairy industry''', a component of the [[food industry]].\n\n== History ==\nMilk producing animals have been domesticated for thousands of years. Initially, they were part of the [[subsistence farming]] that [[nomads]] engaged in. As the community moved about the country, their animals accompanied them. Protecting and feeding the animals were a big part of the [[symbiotic relationship]] between the animals and the [[herd]]ers.\n\nIn the more recent past, people in [[agriculture|agricultural societies]] owned dairy animals that they milked for domestic and local (village) consumption, a typical example of a [[cottage industry]]. The animals might serve multiple purposes (for example, as a draught animal for pulling a [[plow]] as a youngster, and at the end of its useful life as [[meat]]). In this case, the animals were normally milked by hand and the herd size was quite small, so that all of the animals could be milked in less than an hour\u2014about 10 per milker. These tasks were performed by a ''dairymaid'' (''dairywoman'') or ''dairyman''. The word ''dairy'' harkens back to Middle English ''dayerie'', ''deyerie'', from ''deye'' (female servant or dairymaid) and further back to Old English ''d\u00e6ge'' (kneader of bread).\n\nWith [[Industrial Revolution| industrialization]] and [[urbanization]], the supply of milk became a commercial industry, with specialized [[List of breeds of cattle|breeds of cattle]] being developed for dairy, as distinct from [[beef]] or [[Working animals#Animals used for their strength|draught]] animals. Initially, more people were employed as milkers, but it soon turned to [[Mechanization| mechanization]] with machines designed to do the milking.\n\n[[File:Milking-a-cow-past.jpg|thumb|Farmer milking a cow by hand]]\nHistorically, the [[milking]] and the [[Food processing|processing]] took place close together in space and time: on a [[dairy farming|dairy farm]]. People milked the animals by hand; on farms where only small numbers are kept, hand-milking may still be practiced. Hand-milking is accomplished by grasping the [[teat]]s (often pronounced ''tit'' or ''tits'') in the hand and expressing milk either by squeezing the fingers progressively, from the [[udder]] end to the tip, or by squeezing the teat between thumb and index finger, then moving the hand downward from udder towards the end of the teat. The action of the hand or fingers is designed to close off the milk duct at the udder (upper) end and, by the movement of the fingers, close the duct progressively to the tip to express the trapped milk. Each half or quarter of the udder is emptied one milk-duct capacity at a time.\n\nThe ''stripping'' action is repeated, using both hands for speed. Both methods result in the milk that was trapped in the [[milk duct]] being squirted out the end into a bucket that is supported between the knees (or rests on the ground) of the milker, who usually sits on a low stool.\n\nTraditionally the cow, or cows, would stand in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]] or paddock while being milked. Young stock, [[cattle|heifers]], would have to be trained to remain still to be milked. In many countries, the cows were tethered to a post and milked.\n\n==Structure of the industry==\n[[File:Wawa Dairy Farms.JPG|thumb|[[Wawa Dairy Farms]] in [[Pennsylvania]]]]\nWhile most countries produce their own milk products, the structure of the dairy industry varies in different parts of the world. In major milk-producing countries most milk is distributed through whole sale markets. In Ireland and Australia, for example, farmers' co-operatives own many of the large-scale processors, while in the United States many farmers and processors do business through individual contracts. In the United States, the country's 196 [[farmers' cooperatives]] sold 86% of milk in the U.S. in 2002, with five cooperatives accounting for half that. This was down from 2,300 cooperatives in the 1940s.<ref name=\"rurdev\">{{cite book\n | url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/pub/cir116.pdf\n | chapter=Cooperatives in the Dairy Industry\n | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development\n | title=Cooperative Information, Report 1, Section 16\n | date=September 2005\n | url-status=dead\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012183148/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/pub/cir116.pdf\n | archivedate=2010-10-12\n }}</ref> In developing countries, the past practice of farmers marketing milk in their own neighborhoods is changing rapidly.

This is notably the case in the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

A limited antitrust exemption was created for U.S. dairy cooperatives by the [[Capper\u2013Volstead Act]] of 1922. In the 1930s, some U.S. states adopted price controls, and Federal Milk Marketing Orders started under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and continue in the 2000s. The Federal Milk Price Support Program began in 1949.<ref name=\"rurdev\" /> The [[Northeast Dairy Compact]] regulated wholesale milk prices in New England from 1997 to 2001.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.dairycompact.org/prices.htm\n |title       = Monthly Compact, Federal Order #1, and Over-Order Prices for Class I Milk Since the Compact Regulation Took Effect in July of 1997\n |publisher   = Northeast Dairy Compact Commission\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090703182704/http://www.dairycompact.org/prices.htm\n |archivedate = 2009-07-03\n}}</ref>\n\nPlants producing liquid milk and products with short shelf life, such as yogurts, creams and soft cheeses, tend to be located on the outskirts of urban centres close to consumer markets. Plants manufacturing items with longer shelf life, such as butter, milk powders, cheese and whey powders, tend to be situated in rural areas closer to the milk supply.  Most large processing plants tend to specialise in a limited range of products. Exceptionally, however, large plants producing a wide range of products are still common in Eastern Europe, a holdover from the former centralized, supply-driven concept of the market under Communist governments.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Thomas|last2=Taylor|first2=Robert|title=Scientific farm animal production: an introduction to animal science|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-8120343986}}<!--|accessdate=13 April 2015--></ref>\n\nAs processing plants grow fewer and larger, they tend to acquire bigger, more automated and more efficient equipment.

Producers must adjust the mix of milk which is sold in liquid form vs. processed foods (such as butter and cheese) depending on changing supply and demand.<ref name=\"rurdev\" />\n\n==Farming==\n{{main|Dairy farming}}\n{{See also|Dairy cattle}}\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4794 Milking cow.jpg|thumb|A cow being milked in [[Mandatory Palestine|British Palestine]], 1936]]\nWhen it became necessary to milk larger cows, the cows would be brought to a [[shed]] or [[Barn (building)|barn]] that was set up with stalls ([[milking stall]]s) where the cows could be confined their whole life while they were milked. One person could milk more cows this way, as many as 20 for a skilled worker. But having cows standing about in the yard and shed waiting to be milked is not good for the cow, as she needs as much time in the paddock grazing as is possible. It is usual to restrict the twice-daily milking to a maximum of an hour and a half each time. It makes no difference whether one milks 10 or 1000 cows, the milking time should not exceed a total of about three hours each day for any cow as they should be in stalls and laying down as long as possible to increase comfort which will in turn aid in milk production.  A cow is physically milked for only about 10 minutes a day depending on her milk letdown time and the number of milkings per day.\n\nAs [[herd]] sizes increased there was more need to have efficient milking machines, sheds, milk-storage facilities ([[Bulk tank|vats]]), bulk-milk transport and shed cleaning capabilities and the means of getting cows from paddock to shed and back.\n\nAs herd numbers increased so did the problems of [[animal health]]. In [[New Zealand]] two approaches to this problem have been used. The first was improved [[veterinary medicine]]s (and the government regulation of the medicines) that the farmer could use. The other was the creation of ''veterinary clubs'' where groups of farmers would employ a [[Veterinary medicine|veterinarian]] (vet) full-time and share those services throughout the year. It was in the vet's interest to keep the animals healthy and reduce the number of calls from farmers, rather than to ensure that the farmer needed to call for service and pay regularly.\n\nThis daily milking routine goes on for about 300 to 320 days per year that the cow stays in milk. Some small herds are milked once a day for about the last 20 days of the production cycle but this is not usual for large herds. If a cow is left unmilked just once she is likely to reduce milk-production almost immediately and the rest of the season may see her ''dried off'' (giving no milk) and still consuming feed. However, once-a-day milking is now being practised more widely in New Zealand for profit and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] reasons. This is effective because the fall in milk yield is at least partially offset by labour and cost savings from milking once per day. This compares to some intensive farm systems in the [[United States]] that milk three or more times per day due to higher milk yields per cow and lower marginal [[labor costs]].\n\nFarmers who are contracted to supply liquid milk for human consumption (as opposed to milk for processing into [[butter]], [[cheese]], and so on\u2014see [[milk]]) often have to manage their [[herd]] so that the contracted number of cows are in milk the year round, or the required minimum milk output is maintained. This is done by mating cows outside their natural mating time so that the period when each cow in the herd is giving maximum production is in rotation throughout the year.\n\nNorthern hemisphere farmers who keep cows in barns almost all the year usually manage their herds to give continuous production of milk so that they get paid all year round. In the southern hemisphere the [[cooperative]] dairying systems allow for two months on no productivity because their systems are designed to take advantage of maximum grass and milk production in the spring and because the milk processing plants pay bonuses in the dry (winter) season to carry the farmers through the mid-winter break from milking. It also means that cows have a rest from milk production when they are most heavily pregnant. Some year-round milk farms are penalised financially for [[overproduction]] at any time in the year by being unable to sell their overproduction at current prices.\n\n[[Artificial insemination]] (AI) is common in all high-production herds in order to improve the genetics of the female offspring which will be raised for replacements.  AI also reduces the need for keeping potentially dangerous bulls on the farm. Male calves are sold to be raised for beef or veal. A cow will calve or freshen about once a year, until she is culled because of declining production, infertility or other health problems. Then the cow will be sold, most often going to slaughter.<ref>https://freefromharm.org/dairyfacts/</ref>\n\n==Industrial processing==\n{{Main|Dairy products}}\n[[File:StanhopeFactory.JPG|thumb|A [[Fonterra]] cooperative dairy factory in Australia]]\n[[File:Fromagerie77.jpg|thumb|Interior of a cheese factory in [[Seine-et-Marne]], France]]\nDairy plants process the raw milk they receive from farmers so as to extend its marketable life. Two main types of processes are employed: heat treatment to ensure the safety of milk for human consumption and to lengthen its shelf-life, and dehydrating dairy products such as butter, hard cheese and milk powders so that they can be stored.\n\n===Cream and butter===\nToday, milk is separated by huge machines in bulk into cream and skim milk. The cream is processed to produce various consumer products, depending on its thickness, its suitability for culinary uses and consumer demand, which differs from place to place and country to country.\n\nSome milk is dried and powdered, some is condensed (by [[evaporation]]) mixed with varying amounts of [[sugar]] and canned. Most cream from New Zealand and Australian factories is made into [[butter]]. This is done by [[churning (butter)|churning]] the cream until the fat globules coagulate and form a monolithic mass. This butter mass is washed and, sometimes, salted to improve keeping qualities. The residual [[buttermilk]] goes on to further processing. The butter is packaged (25 to 50&nbsp;kg boxes) and chilled for storage and sale. At a later stage these packages are broken down into home-consumption sized packs.\n\n===Skimmed milk===\nThe product left after the cream is removed is called skim, or skimmed, milk. To make a consumable liquid a portion of cream is returned to the [[skim milk]] to make ''[[low fat]] milk'' (semi-skimmed) for human consumption. By varying the amount of cream returned, producers can make a variety of low-fat milks to suit their local market. Whole milk is also made by adding cream back to the skim to form a standardized product.  Other products, such as [[calcium]], [[vitamin D]], and flavouring, are also added to appeal to consumers.\n\n===Casein===\n[[Casein]] is the predominant [[phosphoprotein]] found in fresh milk.  It has a very wide range of uses from being a filler for human foods, such as in [[ice cream]], to the manufacture of products such as [[cloth|fabric]], [[adhesive]]s, and [[plastic]]s.\n\n===Cheese===\n{{main|Cheese}}\nCheese is another product made from milk. Whole milk is reacted to form [[curd]]s that can be compressed, processed and stored to form cheese. In countries where milk is legally allowed to be processed without [[pasteurize|pasteurization]], a wide range of cheeses can be made using the bacteria found naturally in the milk. In most other countries, the range of cheeses is smaller and the use of artificial cheese curing is greater. [[Whey]] is also the byproduct of this process. Some people with [[lactose intolerance]] are surprisingly able to eat certain types of cheese. This is because some traditionally made hard [[cheese]]s, and soft ripened cheeses may create less reaction than the equivalent amount of milk because of the processes involved.  Fermentation and higher fat content contribute to lesser amounts of lactose. Traditionally made [[Emmental cheese|Emmental]] or [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] might contain 10% of the lactose found in whole milk. In addition, the aging methods of traditional cheeses (sometimes over two years) reduce their lactose content to practically nothing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilovecheese.com/lactose_intolerant_faqs.asp |title=DairyGood.org &#124; Home |publisher=Ilovecheese.com |accessdate=2014-07-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730190352/http://www.ilovecheese.com/lactose_intolerant_faqs.asp |archivedate=2013-07-30 }}</ref> Commercial cheeses, however, are often manufactured by processes that do not have the same lactose-reducing properties.

Beginning about 1950, and mostly since about 1980, [[lactose]] and many other products, mainly food additives, are made from both casein and cheese whey.\n\n===Yogurt===\n[[Yogurt]] (or yoghurt) making is a process similar to cheese making, only the process is arrested before the curd becomes very hard.\n\n===Milk powders===\nMilk is also processed by various drying processes into powders. Whole milk, skim milk, buttermilk, and whey products are dried into a powder form and used for human and animal consumption.  The main difference between production of powders for human or for animal consumption is in the protection of the process and the product from contamination. Some people drink milk reconstituted from powdered milk, because milk is about 88% water and it is much cheaper to transport the dried product.\n\n===Other milk products===\n[[Kumis]] is produced commercially in [[Central Asia]].  Although it is traditionally made from [[horse|mare]]'s milk, modern industrial variants may use cow's milk instead.\n\n==Milking==\n[[File:SR 4409 6 Wheeled Milk Wagon Didcot Railway Centre.jpg|thumb|Preserved [[Express Dairies]] three-axle Milk Tank Wagon at the [[Didcot Railway Centre]], based on an [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|SR]] chassis]]\n[[File:Waiting for the milk train - geograph.org.uk - 93290.jpg|thumb|[[Milk churn]]s on a railway platform]]\nOriginally, milking and processing took place on the dairy farm itself. Later, cream was separated from the milk by machine on the farm, and transported to a [[factory]] to be made into butter. The skim milk was fed to [[pig]]s. This allowed for the high cost of transport (taking the smallest volume high-value product), primitive trucks and the poor quality of roads. Only farms close to factories could afford to take whole milk, which was essential for cheesemaking in industrial quantities, to them.\n\nOriginally milk was distributed in '[[Pail (container)|pails]]', a lidded bucket with a handle. These proved impractical for transport by road or rail, and so the [[milk churn]] was introduced, based on the tall conical shape of the [[butter churn]]. Later large railway containers, such as the [[British Railway Milk Tank Wagon]] were introduced, enabling the transport of larger quantities of milk, and over longer distances.\n\nThe development of [[refrigeration]] and better road transport, in the late 1950s, has meant that most farmers milk their cows and only temporarily store the milk in large refrigerated [[bulk tank]]s, from where it is later transported by truck to central processing facilities.\n\nIn many European countries, particularly the [[United Kingdom]], milk is then delivered direct to customers' homes by a [[milk float]].\n\nIn the United States, a dairy cow produced about {{convert|5,300|lb|kg}} of milk per year in 1950, while the average [[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein cow]] in 2019 produces more than {{convert|23,000|lb|kg}} of milk per year.<ref>{{cite news |last=O\u2019Hagan |first=Maureen |url=https://undark.org/article/cows-holstein-diversity/ |title=From Two Bulls, 9 Million Dairy Cows |work=[[Undark Magazine]] |date=2019-06-19 |accessdate=2019-06-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Milking machines===\n{{main|Automatic milking}}\n[[File:Melkgeschirr.jpg|thumb|The milking machine extracts milk from all teats.]]\n\nMilking machines are used to harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes inefficient or labour-intensive.  One early model was patented in 1907.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA868|date=August  1907|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=868}}</ref> The milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder.  It is made up of a claw, four teatcups, (Shells and rubber liners) long milk tube, long pulsation tube, and a pulsator.  The claw is an assembly that connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the teatcups to the long pulse tube and long milk tube. (Cluster assembly) Claws are commonly made of stainless steel or plastic or both. Teatcups are composed of a rigid outer shell (stainless steel or plastic) that holds a soft inner liner or ''inflation''.  Transparent sections in the shell may allow viewing of liner collapse and milk flow.  The annular space between the shell and liner is called the pulse chamber.\n\nMilking machines work in a way that is different from hand milking or calf suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to massage milk from the teat by creating a pressure difference across the teat canal (or opening at the end of the teat). Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to the cow.  The vacuum applied to the teat causes congestion of teat tissues (accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the pulsation chamber about once per second (the pulsation rate) to allow the liner to collapse around the end of teat and relieve congestion in the teat tissue. The ratio of the time that the liner is open (milking phase) and closed (rest phase) is called the pulsation ratio.\n\nThe four streams of milk from the teatcups are usually combined in the claw and transported to the milkline, or the collection bucket (usually sized to the output of one cow) in a single milk hose.  Milk is then transported (manually in buckets) or with a combination of airflow and mechanical [[pump]] to a central storage [[Storage tank|vat]] or [[bulk tank]].  Milk is refrigerated on the farm in most countries either by passing through a [[heat-exchanger]] or in the bulk tank, or both.\n\nThe photo to the right shows a bucket milking system with the stainless steel bucket visible on the far side of the cow.  The two rigid stainless steel teatcup shells applied to the front two quarters of the udder are visible.  The top of the flexible liner is visible at the top of the shells as are the short milk tubes and short pulsation tubes extending from the bottom of the shells to the claw.  The bottom of the claw is transparent to allow observation of milk flow.  When milking is completed the vacuum to the milking unit is shut off and the teatcups are removed.\n\nMilking machines keep the milk enclosed and safe from external contamination. The interior 'milk contact' surfaces of the machine are kept clean by a manual or automated  washing procedures implemented after milking is completed.  Milk contact surfaces must comply with regulations requiring  food-grade materials (typically [[stainless steel]] and special plastics and rubber compounds) and are easily cleaned.\n\nMost milking machines are powered by [[Electrical power industry|electricity]] but, in case of electrical failure, there can be an alternative means of motive power, often an [[internal combustion engine]], for the vacuum and milk pumps.\n\n===Milking shed layouts===\n[[File:Pardes Hanna Ag School morning milking.jpg|thumb|Milking parlour at [[Pardes Hanna Agricultural High School]], Israel]]\n\n====Bail-style sheds====\nThis type of milking facility was the first development, after open-paddock milking, for many farmers. The building was a long, narrow, ''lean-to'' shed that was open along one long side. The cows were held in a yard at the open side and when they were about to be milked they were positioned in one of the bails (stalls). Usually the cows were restrained in the bail with a breech chain and a rope to restrain the outer back leg. The cow could not move about excessively and the milker could expect not to be kicked or trampled while sitting on a (three-legged) stool and milking into a bucket. When each cow was finished she backed out into the yard again. The UK bail,  initially developed by Wiltshire dairy farmer Arthur Hosier, was a six standing mobile shed with steps that the cow mounted, so the herdsman didn't have to bend so low. The milking equipment was much as today, a vacuum from a pump, pulsators, a claw-piece with pipes leading to the four shells and liners that stimulate and suck the milk from the teat. The milk went into churns, via a cooler.\n\nAs herd sizes increased a door was set into the front of each bail so that when the milking was done for any cow the milker could, after undoing the leg-rope and with a remote link, open the door and allow her to exit to the pasture. The door was closed, the next cow walked into the bail and was secured. When milking machines were introduced bails were set in pairs so that a cow was being milked in one paired bail while the other could be prepared for milking. When one was finished the machine's cups are swapped to the other cow. This is the same as for ''Swingover Milking Parlours'' as described below except that the cups are loaded on the udder from the side. As herd numbers increased it was easier to double-up the cup-sets and milk both cows simultaneously than to increase the number of bails. About 50 cows an hour can be milked in a shed with 8 bails by one person. Using the same teat cups for successive cows has the danger of transmitting infection, mastitis, from one cow to another. Some farmers have devised their own ways to disinfect the clusters between cows.\n\n====Herringbone milking parlours====\nIn herringbone milking sheds, or parlours, cows enter, in single file, and line up almost perpendicular to the central aisle of the milking parlour on both sides of a central pit in which the milker works (you can visualise a fishbone with the ribs representing the cows and the spine being the milker's working area; the cows face outward). After washing the udder and teats the cups of the milking machine are applied to the cows, from the rear of their hind legs, on both sides of the working area. Large herringbone sheds can milk up to 600 cows efficiently with two people.\n\n====Swingover milking parlours====\nSwingover parlours are the same as herringbone parlours except they have only one set of milking cups to be shared between the two rows of cows, as one side is being milked the cows on the other side are moved out and replaced with unmilked ones. The advantage of this system is that it is less costly to equip, however it operates at slightly better than half-speed and one would not normally try to milk more than about 100 cows with one person.\n[[File:Dairy NSW.JPG|thumb|80-stand rotary dairy that is fully computerised and records milk production]]\n\n====Rotary milking sheds====\nRotary milking sheds (also known as Rotary milking parlor) consist of a turntable with about 12 to 100 individual stalls for cows around the outer edge. A \"good\" rotary will be operated with 24\u201332 (~48\u201350+) stalls by one (two) milkers.  The turntable is turned by an electric-motor drive at a rate that one turn is the time for a cow to be milked completely. As an empty stall passes the entrance a cow steps on, facing the center, and rotates with the turntable. The next cow moves into the next vacant stall and so on. The operator, or milker, cleans the teats, attaches the cups and does any other feeding or whatever husbanding operations that are necessary. Cows are milked as the platform rotates. The milker, or an automatic device, removes the milking machine cups and the cow backs out and leaves at an exit just before the entrance. The rotary system is capable of milking very large herds\u2014over a thousand cows.\n\n====Automatic milking sheds====\n[[Automatic milking]] or 'robotic milking' sheds can be seen in [[Australia]], New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, and many European countries. Current automatic milking sheds use the voluntary milking (VM) method. These allow the cows to voluntarily present themselves for milking at any time of the day or night, although repeat visits may be limited by the farmer through computer software. A [[robot]] arm is used to clean teats and apply milking equipment, while automated gates direct cow traffic, eliminating the need for the farmer to be present during the process.  The entire process is computer controlled.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.roboticdairy.com/indexframe01.htm\n |title=Robotic dairy at Winnindoo, Victoria, Australia\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923005331/http://www.roboticdairy.com/indexframe01.htm\n |archivedate=2007-09-23\n }}</ref>\n\n====Supplementary accessories in sheds====\nFarmers soon realised that a milking shed was a good place to feed cows supplementary foods that overcame local dietary deficiencies or added to the cows' wellbeing and production. Each bail might have a box into which such feed is delivered as the cow arrives so that she is eating while being milked. A computer can read the eartag of each animal to ration the correct individual supplement. A close alternative is to use 'out-of-parlour-feeders', stalls that respond to a transponder around the cow's neck that is programmed to provide each cow with a supplementary feed, the quantity dependent on her production, stage in lactation, and the benefits of the main ration\n\nThe holding yard at the entrance of the shed is important as a means of keeping cows moving into the shed. Most yards have a powered gate that ensures that the cows are kept close to the shed.\n\n[[Water]] is a vital commodity on a dairy farm: cows drink about 20 gallons (80 litres) a day, sheds need water to cool and clean them. Pumps and reservoirs are common at milking facilities. Water can be warmed by heat transfer with milk.\n\n===Temporary milk storage===\nMilk coming from the cow is transported to a nearby storage vessel by the airflow leaking around the cups on the cow or by a special \"air inlet\" (5-10 l/min free air) in the claw. From there it is pumped by a mechanical pump and cooled by a [[heat exchanger]]. The milk is then stored in a large vat, or [[bulk tank]], which is usually refrigerated until collection for processing.\n\n==Waste disposal==\n[[File:Manure spreader 8685.jpg|thumb|Manure spreader going to the field from a dairy farm, [[Elba, New York]].]]\nIn countries where cows are grazed outside year-round, there is little waste disposal to deal with. The most concentrated waste is at the milking shed, where the animal waste may be liquefied (during the water-washing process) or left in a more solid form, either to be returned to be used on farm ground as organic fertilizer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/dairy/manure/surface-irrigation-systems-for-wastewater/|title=Surface irrigation systems for treating milk house wastewater : Dairy Extension : University of Minnesota Extension|website=Extension.umn.edu|accessdate=20 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915004140/http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/dairy/manure/surface-irrigation-systems-for-wastewater/|archivedate=2017-09-15}}</ref>\n\nIn the associated milk processing factories, most of the waste is washing water that is treated, usually by composting, and spread on farm fields in either liquid or solid form. This is much different from half a century ago, when the main products were butter, cheese and casein, and the rest of the milk had to be disposed of as waste (sometimes as animal feed).<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=25030895|title=Milk Waste Disposal|first=Don E.|last=Bloodgood|date=20 November 2017|publisher=|journal=Sewage Works Journal|volume=20|issue=4|pages=695\u2013706|doi=10.2307/25030895}}</ref>\n\nIn dairy-intensive areas, various methods have been proposed for disposing of large quantities of milk. Large application rates of milk onto land, or disposing in a hole, is problematic as the residue from the decomposing milk will block the soil pores and thereby reduce the water infiltration rate through the soil profile. As recovery of this effect can take time, any land-based application needs to be well managed and considered.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.ecohydrology.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/142432/Waste_Management.pdf | title=Environmental Best Practice Guidelines | chapter=Waste Management | publisher=Dairy Catch | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220180710/http://www.ecohydrology.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/142432/Waste_Management.pdf | archivedate=2011-02-20 }}</ref> Other waste milk disposal methods commonly employed include solidification and disposal at a solid waste landfill, disposal at a wastewater treatment plant, or discharge into a sanitary sewer.<ref>{{cite web | title=Fact Sheet: Proper Disposal of Milk Waste | url=http://www.in.gov/idem/files/landcomp_dairyfactsheet.pdf | publisher=Indiana Department of Environmental Management | accessdate=2014-06-07 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924050110/http://www.in.gov/idem/files/landcomp_dairyfactsheet.pdf | archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Associated diseases==\nDairy products manufactured under unsanitary or unsuitable conditions have an increased chance of containing bacteria. Proper [[sanitation]] practices help to reduce the rate of bacterial contamination, and [[pasteurization]] greatly decreases the amount of contaminated milk that reaches the consumer.

A dairy is typically located on a dedicated [[dairy farming|dairy farm]] or in a section of a multi-purpose farm (mixed farm) that is concerned with the harvesting of milk.\n\nTerminology differs between countries. For example, in the [[United States]], an entire dairy farm is commonly called a \"dairy\". The building or farm area where milk is harvested from the cow is often called a \"milking parlor\" or \"parlor\". Except in the case of smaller dairies, where cows are often put on pasture, and usually milked in \"stanchion barns\". The farm area where milk is stored in bulk tanks is known as the farm's \"milk house\". Milk is then hauled (usually by [[truck]]) to a \"dairy plant\" = also referred to as a \"dairy\" - where raw milk is further processed and prepared for commercial sale of [[dairy products]]. In [[New Zealand]], farm areas for milk harvesting are also called \"milking parlours\", and are historically known as \"milking sheds\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} As in the [[United States]], sometimes milking sheds are referred to by their type, such as \"herring bone shed\" or \"pit parlour\". Parlour design has evolved from simple barns or sheds to large rotary structures in which the workflow (throughput of cows) is very efficiently handled. In some countries, especially those with small numbers of animals being milked, the farm may perform the functions of a dairy plant, processing their own milk into salable [[dairy products]], such as [[butter]], [[cheese]], or [[yogurt]]. This on-site processing is a traditional method of producing specialist milk products, common in Europe.\n\nIn the United States a ''dairy'' can also be a place that processes, distributes and sells [[dairy product]]s, or a room, building or establishment where milk is stored and processed into milk products, such as [[butter]] or [[cheese]]. In [[New Zealand English]] the singular use of the word ''[[dairy (store)|dairy]]'' almost exclusively refers to a [[corner shop]], or [[superette]]. This usage is historical as such shops were a common place for the public to buy milk products.\n\nAs an attributive, the word ''dairy'' refers to milk-based products, derivatives and processes, and the animals and workers involved in their production: for example [[dairy cattle]], [[dairy goat]]. A dairy [[farm]] produces milk and a dairy [[factory]] processes it into a variety of dairy products. These establishments constitute the global '''dairy industry''', a component of the [[food industry]].\n\n== History ==\nMilk producing animals have been domesticated for thousands of years. Initially, they were part of the [[subsistence farming]] that [[nomads]] engaged in. As the community moved about the country, their animals accompanied them. Protecting and feeding the animals were a big part of the [[symbiotic relationship]] between the animals and the [[herd]]ers.\n\nIn the more recent past, people in [[agriculture|agricultural societies]] owned dairy animals that they milked for domestic and local (village) consumption, a typical example of a [[cottage industry]]. The animals might serve multiple purposes (for example, as a draught animal for pulling a [[plow]] as a youngster, and at the end of its useful life as [[meat]]). In this case, the animals were normally milked by hand and the herd size was quite small, so that all of the animals could be milked in less than an hour\u2014about 10 per milker. These tasks were performed by a ''dairymaid'' (''dairywoman'') or ''dairyman''. The word ''dairy'' harkens back to Middle English ''dayerie'', ''deyerie'', from ''deye'' (female servant or dairymaid) and further back to Old English ''d\u00e6ge'' (kneader of bread).\n\nWith [[Industrial Revolution| industrialization]] and [[urbanization]], the supply of milk became a commercial industry, with specialized [[List of breeds of cattle|breeds of cattle]] being developed for dairy, as distinct from [[beef]] or [[Working animals#Animals used for their strength|draught]] animals. Initially, more people were employed as milkers, but it soon turned to [[Mechanization| mechanization]] with machines designed to do the milking.\n\n[[File:Milking-a-cow-past.jpg|thumb|Farmer milking a cow by hand]]\nHistorically, the [[milking]] and the [[Food processing|processing]] took place close together in space and time: on a [[dairy farming|dairy farm]]. People milked the animals by hand; on farms where only small numbers are kept, hand-milking may still be practiced. Hand-milking is accomplished by grasping the [[teat]]s (often pronounced ''tit'' or ''tits'') in the hand and expressing milk either by squeezing the fingers progressively, from the [[udder]] end to the tip, or by squeezing the teat between thumb and index finger, then moving the hand downward from udder towards the end of the teat. The action of the hand or fingers is designed to close off the milk duct at the udder (upper) end and, by the movement of the fingers, close the duct progressively to the tip to express the trapped milk. Each half or quarter of the udder is emptied one milk-duct capacity at a time.\n\nThe ''stripping'' action is repeated, using both hands for speed. Both methods result in the milk that was trapped in the [[milk duct]] being squirted out the end into a bucket that is supported between the knees (or rests on the ground) of the milker, who usually sits on a low stool.\n\nTraditionally the cow, or cows, would stand in the [[Field (agriculture)|field]] or paddock while being milked. Young stock, [[cattle|heifers]], would have to be trained to remain still to be milked. In many countries, the cows were tethered to a post and milked.\n\n==Structure of the industry==\n[[File:Wawa Dairy Farms.JPG|thumb|[[Wawa Dairy Farms]] in [[Pennsylvania]]]]\nWhile most countries produce their own milk products, the structure of the dairy industry varies in different parts of the world. In major milk-producing countries most milk is distributed through whole sale markets. In Ireland and Australia, for example, farmers' co-operatives own many of the large-scale processors, while in the United States many farmers and processors do business through individual contracts. In the United States, the country's 196 [[farmers' cooperatives]] sold 86% of milk in the U.S. in 2002, with five cooperatives accounting for half that. This was down from 2,300 cooperatives in the 1940s.<ref name=\"rurdev\">{{cite book\n | url=http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/pub/cir116.pdf\n | chapter=Cooperatives in the Dairy Industry\n | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development\n | title=Cooperative Information, Report 1, Section 16\n | date=September 2005\n | url-status=dead\n | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012183148/http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/rbs/pub/cir116.pdf\n | archivedate=2010-10-12\n }}</ref> In developing countries, the past practice of farmers marketing milk in their own neighborhoods is changing rapidly.

Plants manufacturing items with longer shelf life, such as butter, milk powders, cheese and whey powders, tend to be situated in rural areas closer to the milk supply.  Most large processing plants tend to specialise in a limited range of products. Exceptionally, however, large plants producing a wide range of products are still common in Eastern Europe, a holdover from the former centralized, supply-driven concept of the market under Communist governments.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Field|first1=Thomas|last2=Taylor|first2=Robert|title=Scientific farm animal production: an introduction to animal science|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-8120343986}}<!--|accessdate=13 April 2015--></ref>\n\nAs processing plants grow fewer and larger, they tend to acquire bigger, more automated and more efficient equipment.

Producers must adjust the mix of milk which is sold in liquid form vs. processed foods (such as butter and cheese) depending on changing supply and demand.<ref name=\"rurdev\" />\n\n==Farming==\n{{main|Dairy farming}}\n{{See also|Dairy cattle}}\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4794 Milking cow.jpg|thumb|A cow being milked in [[Mandatory Palestine|British Palestine]], 1936]]\nWhen it became necessary to milk larger cows, the cows would be brought to a [[shed]] or [[Barn (building)|barn]] that was set up with stalls ([[milking stall]]s) where the cows could be confined their whole life while they were milked. One person could milk more cows this way, as many as 20 for a skilled worker. But having cows standing about in the yard and shed waiting to be milked is not good for the cow, as she needs as much time in the paddock grazing as is possible. It is usual to restrict the twice-daily milking to a maximum of an hour and a half each time. It makes no difference whether one milks 10 or 1000 cows, the milking time should not exceed a total of about three hours each day for any cow as they should be in stalls and laying down as long as possible to increase comfort which will in turn aid in milk production.  A cow is physically milked for only about 10 minutes a day depending on her milk letdown time and the number of milkings per day.\n\nAs [[herd]] sizes increased there was more need to have efficient milking machines, sheds, milk-storage facilities ([[Bulk tank|vats]]), bulk-milk transport and shed cleaning capabilities and the means of getting cows from paddock to shed and back.\n\nAs herd numbers increased so did the problems of [[animal health]]. In [[New Zealand]] two approaches to this problem have been used. The first was improved [[veterinary medicine]]s (and the government regulation of the medicines) that the farmer could use. The other was the creation of ''veterinary clubs'' where groups of farmers would employ a [[Veterinary medicine|veterinarian]] (vet) full-time and share those services throughout the year. It was in the vet's interest to keep the animals healthy and reduce the number of calls from farmers, rather than to ensure that the farmer needed to call for service and pay regularly.\n\nThis daily milking routine goes on for about 300 to 320 days per year that the cow stays in milk. Some small herds are milked once a day for about the last 20 days of the production cycle but this is not usual for large herds. If a cow is left unmilked just once she is likely to reduce milk-production almost immediately and the rest of the season may see her ''dried off'' (giving no milk) and still consuming feed. However, once-a-day milking is now being practised more widely in New Zealand for profit and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] reasons. This is effective because the fall in milk yield is at least partially offset by labour and cost savings from milking once per day. This compares to some intensive farm systems in the [[United States]] that milk three or more times per day due to higher milk yields per cow and lower marginal [[labor costs]].\n\nFarmers who are contracted to supply liquid milk for human consumption (as opposed to milk for processing into [[butter]], [[cheese]], and so on\u2014see [[milk]]) often have to manage their [[herd]] so that the contracted number of cows are in milk the year round, or the required minimum milk output is maintained. This is done by mating cows outside their natural mating time so that the period when each cow in the herd is giving maximum production is in rotation throughout the year.\n\nNorthern hemisphere farmers who keep cows in barns almost all the year usually manage their herds to give continuous production of milk so that they get paid all year round. In the southern hemisphere the [[cooperative]] dairying systems allow for two months on no productivity because their systems are designed to take advantage of maximum grass and milk production in the spring and because the milk processing plants pay bonuses in the dry (winter) season to carry the farmers through the mid-winter break from milking. It also means that cows have a rest from milk production when they are most heavily pregnant. Some year-round milk farms are penalised financially for [[overproduction]] at any time in the year by being unable to sell their overproduction at current prices.\n\n[[Artificial insemination]] (AI) is common in all high-production herds in order to improve the genetics of the female offspring which will be raised for replacements.  AI also reduces the need for keeping potentially dangerous bulls on the farm. Male calves are sold to be raised for beef or veal. A cow will calve or freshen about once a year, until she is culled because of declining production, infertility or other health problems. Then the cow will be sold, most often going to slaughter.<ref>https://freefromharm.org/dairyfacts/</ref>\n\n==Industrial processing==\n{{Main|Dairy products}}\n[[File:StanhopeFactory.JPG|thumb|A [[Fonterra]] cooperative dairy factory in Australia]]\n[[File:Fromagerie77.jpg|thumb|Interior of a cheese factory in [[Seine-et-Marne]], France]]\nDairy plants process the raw milk they receive from farmers so as to extend its marketable life. Two main types of processes are employed: heat treatment to ensure the safety of milk for human consumption and to lengthen its shelf-life, and dehydrating dairy products such as butter, hard cheese and milk powders so that they can be stored.\n\n===Cream and butter===\nToday, milk is separated by huge machines in bulk into cream and skim milk. The cream is processed to produce various consumer products, depending on its thickness, its suitability for culinary uses and consumer demand, which differs from place to place and country to country.\n\nSome milk is dried and powdered, some is condensed (by [[evaporation]]) mixed with varying amounts of [[sugar]] and canned. Most cream from New Zealand and Australian factories is made into [[butter]]. This is done by [[churning (butter)|churning]] the cream until the fat globules coagulate and form a monolithic mass. This butter mass is washed and, sometimes, salted to improve keeping qualities. The residual [[buttermilk]] goes on to further processing. The butter is packaged (25 to 50&nbsp;kg boxes) and chilled for storage and sale. At a later stage these packages are broken down into home-consumption sized packs.\n\n===Skimmed milk===\nThe product left after the cream is removed is called skim, or skimmed, milk. To make a consumable liquid a portion of cream is returned to the [[skim milk]] to make ''[[low fat]] milk'' (semi-skimmed) for human consumption. By varying the amount of cream returned, producers can make a variety of low-fat milks to suit their local market. Whole milk is also made by adding cream back to the skim to form a standardized product.  Other products, such as [[calcium]], [[vitamin D]], and flavouring, are also added to appeal to consumers.\n\n===Casein===\n[[Casein]] is the predominant [[phosphoprotein]] found in fresh milk.  It has a very wide range of uses from being a filler for human foods, such as in [[ice cream]], to the manufacture of products such as [[cloth|fabric]], [[adhesive]]s, and [[plastic]]s.\n\n===Cheese===\n{{main|Cheese}}\nCheese is another product made from milk. Whole milk is reacted to form [[curd]]s that can be compressed, processed and stored to form cheese. In countries where milk is legally allowed to be processed without [[pasteurize|pasteurization]], a wide range of cheeses can be made using the bacteria found naturally in the milk. In most other countries, the range of cheeses is smaller and the use of artificial cheese curing is greater. [[Whey]] is also the byproduct of this process. Some people with [[lactose intolerance]] are surprisingly able to eat certain types of cheese. This is because some traditionally made hard [[cheese]]s, and soft ripened cheeses may create less reaction than the equivalent amount of milk because of the processes involved.  Fermentation and higher fat content contribute to lesser amounts of lactose. Traditionally made [[Emmental cheese|Emmental]] or [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]] might contain 10% of the lactose found in whole milk. In addition, the aging methods of traditional cheeses (sometimes over two years) reduce their lactose content to practically nothing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilovecheese.com/lactose_intolerant_faqs.asp |title=DairyGood.org &#124; Home |publisher=Ilovecheese.com |accessdate=2014-07-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730190352/http://www.ilovecheese.com/lactose_intolerant_faqs.asp |archivedate=2013-07-30 }}</ref> Commercial cheeses, however, are often manufactured by processes that do not have the same lactose-reducing properties. Ageing of some cheeses is governed by regulations;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.farmhousecheesemakers.com/pdo-our-provenance/ |title=Example of cheese regulations: \"West Country Farmhouse Cheddar\" must be aged for 9 months |publisher=Farmhousecheesemakers.com |accessdate=2014-07-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711084008/http://www.farmhousecheesemakers.com/pdo-our-provenance// |archivedate=2014-07-11 }}</ref> in other cases there is no quantitative indication of degree of ageing and concomitant lactose reduction, and lactose content is not usually indicated on labels.\n\n===Whey===\nIn earlier times, [[whey]] or '''milk serum''' was considered to be a waste product and it was, mostly, fed to pigs as a convenient means of disposal. Beginning about 1950, and mostly since about 1980, [[lactose]] and many other products, mainly food additives, are made from both casein and cheese whey.\n\n===Yogurt===\n[[Yogurt]] (or yoghurt) making is a process similar to cheese making, only the process is arrested before the curd becomes very hard.\n\n===Milk powders===\nMilk is also processed by various drying processes into powders. Whole milk, skim milk, buttermilk, and whey products are dried into a powder form and used for human and animal consumption.  The main difference between production of powders for human or for animal consumption is in the protection of the process and the product from contamination. Some people drink milk reconstituted from powdered milk, because milk is about 88% water and it is much cheaper to transport the dried product.\n\n===Other milk products===\n[[Kumis]] is produced commercially in [[Central Asia]].  Although it is traditionally made from [[horse|mare]]'s milk, modern industrial variants may use cow's milk instead.\n\n==Milking==\n[[File:SR 4409 6 Wheeled Milk Wagon Didcot Railway Centre.jpg|thumb|Preserved [[Express Dairies]] three-axle Milk Tank Wagon at the [[Didcot Railway Centre]], based on an [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|SR]] chassis]]\n[[File:Waiting for the milk train - geograph.org.uk - 93290.jpg|thumb|[[Milk churn]]s on a railway platform]]\nOriginally, milking and processing took place on the dairy farm itself. Later, cream was separated from the milk by machine on the farm, and transported to a [[factory]] to be made into butter. The skim milk was fed to [[pig]]s. This allowed for the high cost of transport (taking the smallest volume high-value product), primitive trucks and the poor quality of roads. Only farms close to factories could afford to take whole milk, which was essential for cheesemaking in industrial quantities, to them.\n\nOriginally milk was distributed in '[[Pail (container)|pails]]', a lidded bucket with a handle. These proved impractical for transport by road or rail, and so the [[milk churn]] was introduced, based on the tall conical shape of the [[butter churn]]. Later large railway containers, such as the [[British Railway Milk Tank Wagon]] were introduced, enabling the transport of larger quantities of milk, and over longer distances.\n\nThe development of [[refrigeration]] and better road transport, in the late 1950s, has meant that most farmers milk their cows and only temporarily store the milk in large refrigerated [[bulk tank]]s, from where it is later transported by truck to central processing facilities.\n\nIn many European countries, particularly the [[United Kingdom]], milk is then delivered direct to customers' homes by a [[milk float]].\n\nIn the United States, a dairy cow produced about {{convert|5,300|lb|kg}} of milk per year in 1950, while the average [[Holstein Friesian cattle|Holstein cow]] in 2019 produces more than {{convert|23,000|lb|kg}} of milk per year.<ref>{{cite news |last=O\u2019Hagan |first=Maureen |url=https://undark.org/article/cows-holstein-diversity/ |title=From Two Bulls, 9 Million Dairy Cows |work=[[Undark Magazine]] |date=2019-06-19 |accessdate=2019-06-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Milking machines===\n{{main|Automatic milking}}\n[[File:Melkgeschirr.jpg|thumb|The milking machine extracts milk from all teats.]]\n\nMilking machines are used to harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes inefficient or labour-intensive.  One early model was patented in 1907.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ud8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA868|date=August  1907|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=868}}</ref> The milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder.  It is made up of a claw, four teatcups, (Shells and rubber liners) long milk tube, long pulsation tube, and a pulsator.  The claw is an assembly that connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the teatcups to the long pulse tube and long milk tube. (Cluster assembly) Claws are commonly made of stainless steel or plastic or both. Teatcups are composed of a rigid outer shell (stainless steel or plastic) that holds a soft inner liner or ''inflation''.  Transparent sections in the shell may allow viewing of liner collapse and milk flow.  The annular space between the shell and liner is called the pulse chamber.\n\nMilking machines work in a way that is different from hand milking or calf suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to massage milk from the teat by creating a pressure difference across the teat canal (or opening at the end of the teat). Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to the cow.  The vacuum applied to the teat causes congestion of teat tissues (accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the pulsation chamber about once per second (the pulsation rate) to allow the liner to collapse around the end of teat and relieve congestion in the teat tissue. The ratio of the time that the liner is open (milking phase) and closed (rest phase) is called the pulsation ratio.\n\nThe four streams of milk from the teatcups are usually combined in the claw and transported to the milkline, or the collection bucket (usually sized to the output of one cow) in a single milk hose.  Milk is then transported (manually in buckets) or with a combination of airflow and mechanical [[pump]] to a central storage [[Storage tank|vat]] or [[bulk tank]].  Milk is refrigerated on the farm in most countries either by passing through a [[heat-exchanger]] or in the bulk tank, or both.\n\nThe photo to the right shows a bucket milking system with the stainless steel bucket visible on the far side of the cow.  The two rigid stainless steel teatcup shells applied to the front two quarters of the udder are visible.  The top of the flexible liner is visible at the top of the shells as are the short milk tubes and short pulsation tubes extending from the bottom of the shells to the claw.  The bottom of the claw is transparent to allow observation of milk flow.  When milking is completed the vacuum to the milking unit is shut off and the teatcups are removed.\n\nMilking machines keep the milk enclosed and safe from external contamination. The interior 'milk contact' surfaces of the machine are kept clean by a manual or automated  washing procedures implemented after milking is completed.  Milk contact surfaces must comply with regulations requiring  food-grade materials (typically [[stainless steel]] and special plastics and rubber compounds) and are easily cleaned.\n\nMost milking machines are powered by [[Electrical power industry|electricity]] but, in case of electrical failure, there can be an alternative means of motive power, often an [[internal combustion engine]], for the vacuum and milk pumps.\n\n===Milking shed layouts===\n[[File:Pardes Hanna Ag School morning milking.jpg|thumb|Milking parlour at [[Pardes Hanna Agricultural High School]], Israel]]\n\n====Bail-style sheds====\nThis type of milking facility was the first development, after open-paddock milking, for many farmers. The building was a long, narrow, ''lean-to'' shed that was open along one long side. The cows were held in a yard at the open side and when they were about to be milked they were positioned in one of the bails (stalls). Usually the cows were restrained in the bail with a breech chain and a rope to restrain the outer back leg. The cow could not move about excessively and the milker could expect not to be kicked or trampled while sitting on a (three-legged) stool and milking into a bucket. When each cow was finished she backed out into the yard again. The UK bail,  initially developed by Wiltshire dairy farmer Arthur Hosier, was a six standing mobile shed with steps that the cow mounted, so the herdsman didn't have to bend so low. The milking equipment was much as today, a vacuum from a pump, pulsators, a claw-piece with pipes leading to the four shells and liners that stimulate and suck the milk from the teat. The milk went into churns, via a cooler.\n\nAs herd sizes increased a door was set into the front of each bail so that when the milking was done for any cow the milker could, after undoing the leg-rope and with a remote link, open the door and allow her to exit to the pasture. The door was closed, the next cow walked into the bail and was secured. When milking machines were introduced bails were set in pairs so that a cow was being milked in one paired bail while the other could be prepared for milking. When one was finished the machine's cups are swapped to the other cow. This is the same as for ''Swingover Milking Parlours'' as described below except that the cups are loaded on the udder from the side. As herd numbers increased it was easier to double-up the cup-sets and milk both cows simultaneously than to increase the number of bails. About 50 cows an hour can be milked in a shed with 8 bails by one person. Using the same teat cups for successive cows has the danger of transmitting infection, mastitis, from one cow to another. Some farmers have devised their own ways to disinfect the clusters between cows.\n\n====Herringbone milking parlours====\nIn herringbone milking sheds, or parlours, cows enter, in single file, and line up almost perpendicular to the central aisle of the milking parlour on both sides of a central pit in which the milker works (you can visualise a fishbone with the ribs representing the cows and the spine being the milker's working area; the cows face outward). After washing the udder and teats the cups of the milking machine are applied to the cows, from the rear of their hind legs, on both sides of the working area. Large herringbone sheds can milk up to 600 cows efficiently with two people.\n\n====Swingover milking parlours====\nSwingover parlours are the same as herringbone parlours except they have only one set of milking cups to be shared between the two rows of cows, as one side is being milked the cows on the other side are moved out and replaced with unmilked ones. The advantage of this system is that it is less costly to equip, however it operates at slightly better than half-speed and one would not normally try to milk more than about 100 cows with one person.\n[[File:Dairy NSW.JPG|thumb|80-stand rotary dairy that is fully computerised and records milk production]]\n\n====Rotary milking sheds====\nRotary milking sheds (also known as Rotary milking parlor) consist of a turntable with about 12 to 100 individual stalls for cows around the outer edge. A \"good\" rotary will be operated with 24\u201332 (~48\u201350+) stalls by one (two) milkers.  The turntable is turned by an electric-motor drive at a rate that one turn is the time for a cow to be milked completely. As an empty stall passes the entrance a cow steps on, facing the center, and rotates with the turntable. The next cow moves into the next vacant stall and so on. The operator, or milker, cleans the teats, attaches the cups and does any other feeding or whatever husbanding operations that are necessary. Cows are milked as the platform rotates. The milker, or an automatic device, removes the milking machine cups and the cow backs out and leaves at an exit just before the entrance. The rotary system is capable of milking very large herds\u2014over a thousand cows.\n\n====Automatic milking sheds====\n[[Automatic milking]] or 'robotic milking' sheds can be seen in [[Australia]], New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, and many European countries. Current automatic milking sheds use the voluntary milking (VM) method. These allow the cows to voluntarily present themselves for milking at any time of the day or night, although repeat visits may be limited by the farmer through computer software. A [[robot]] arm is used to clean teats and apply milking equipment, while automated gates direct cow traffic, eliminating the need for the farmer to be present during the process.  The entire process is computer controlled.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.roboticdairy.com/indexframe01.htm\n |title=Robotic dairy at Winnindoo, Victoria, Australia\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923005331/http://www.roboticdairy.com/indexframe01.htm\n |archivedate=2007-09-23\n }}</ref>\n\n====Supplementary accessories in sheds====\nFarmers soon realised that a milking shed was a good place to feed cows supplementary foods that overcame local dietary deficiencies or added to the cows' wellbeing and production. Each bail might have a box into which such feed is delivered as the cow arrives so that she is eating while being milked. A computer can read the eartag of each animal to ration the correct individual supplement. A close alternative is to use 'out-of-parlour-feeders', stalls that respond to a transponder around the cow's neck that is programmed to provide each cow with a supplementary feed, the quantity dependent on her production, stage in lactation, and the benefits of the main ration\n\nThe holding yard at the entrance of the shed is important as a means of keeping cows moving into the shed. Most yards have a powered gate that ensures that the cows are kept close to the shed.\n\n[[Water]] is a vital commodity on a dairy farm: cows drink about 20 gallons (80 litres) a day, sheds need water to cool and clean them. Pumps and reservoirs are common at milking facilities. Water can be warmed by heat transfer with milk.\n\n===Temporary milk storage===\nMilk coming from the cow is transported to a nearby storage vessel by the airflow leaking around the cups on the cow or by a special \"air inlet\" (5-10 l/min free air) in the claw. From there it is pumped by a mechanical pump and cooled by a [[heat exchanger]]. The milk is then stored in a large vat, or [[bulk tank]], which is usually refrigerated until collection for processing.\n\n==Waste disposal==\n[[File:Manure spreader 8685.jpg|thumb|Manure spreader going to the field from a dairy farm, [[Elba, New York]].]]\nIn countries where cows are grazed outside year-round, there is little waste disposal to deal with. The most concentrated waste is at the milking shed, where the animal waste may be liquefied (during the water-washing process) or left in a more solid form, either to be returned to be used on farm ground as organic fertilizer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/dairy/manure/surface-irrigation-systems-for-wastewater/|title=Surface irrigation systems for treating milk house wastewater : Dairy Extension : University of Minnesota Extension|website=Extension.umn.edu|accessdate=20 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915004140/http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/dairy/manure/surface-irrigation-systems-for-wastewater/|archivedate=2017-09-15}}</ref>\n\nIn the associated milk processing factories, most of the waste is washing water that is treated, usually by composting, and spread on farm fields in either liquid or solid form. This is much different from half a century ago, when the main products were butter, cheese and casein, and the rest of the milk had to be disposed of as waste (sometimes as animal feed).<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=25030895|title=Milk Waste Disposal|first=Don E.|last=Bloodgood|date=20 November 2017|publisher=|journal=Sewage Works Journal|volume=20|issue=4|pages=695\u2013706|doi=10.2307/25030895}}</ref>\n\nIn dairy-intensive areas, various methods have been proposed for disposing of large quantities of milk. Large application rates of milk onto land, or disposing in a hole, is problematic as the residue from the decomposing milk will block the soil pores and thereby reduce the water infiltration rate through the soil profile. As recovery of this effect can take time, any land-based application needs to be well managed and considered.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.ecohydrology.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/142432/Waste_Management.pdf | title=Environmental Best Practice Guidelines | chapter=Waste Management | publisher=Dairy Catch | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220180710/http://www.ecohydrology.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/142432/Waste_Management.pdf | archivedate=2011-02-20 }}</ref> Other waste milk disposal methods commonly employed include solidification and disposal at a solid waste landfill, disposal at a wastewater treatment plant, or discharge into a sanitary sewer.<ref>{{cite web | title=Fact Sheet: Proper Disposal of Milk Waste | url=http://www.in.gov/idem/files/landcomp_dairyfactsheet.pdf | publisher=Indiana Department of Environmental Management | accessdate=2014-06-07 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924050110/http://www.in.gov/idem/files/landcomp_dairyfactsheet.pdf | archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Associated diseases==\nDairy products manufactured under unsanitary or unsuitable conditions have an increased chance of containing bacteria. Proper [[sanitation]] practices help to reduce the rate of bacterial contamination, and [[pasteurization]] greatly decreases the amount of contaminated milk that reaches the consumer. Many countries have required government oversight and regulations regarding dairy production, including requirements for [[pasteurization]].\n* [[Leptospirosis]] is an infection that can be transmitted to people who work in dairy production through exposure to urine or to contaminated water or soil.<ref>{{cite web | title = Leptospirosis in Cattle | publisher = [[National Animal Disease Information Service]] (UK) | url = http://www.nadis.org.uk/bulletins/leptospirosis-in-cattle.aspx | accessdate = 2014-06-07 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140619205649/http://www.nadis.org.uk/bulletins/leptospirosis-in-cattle.aspx | archivedate = 2014-06-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Causes of leptospirosis | publisher = National Health Service (UK) | url = http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Leptospirosis/Pages/causes.aspx | accessdate = 2014-06-07 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140512204135/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Leptospirosis/Pages/Causes.aspx | archivedate = 2014-05-12 }}</ref>\n* [[Cowpox]] is a virus that today is rarely found in either cows or humans.

In the 1950s snooker went into a period of decline and the championship was not held after 1952, although an unofficial championship was held until 1957. In 1964 the championship was revived on a challenge basis and in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]] the championship became a knock-out event again. Since [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]] it has been played at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], [[England]]. The tournament is currently played over 17 days and ends on the first Monday in May. In the modern era (since 1969), the best record is that of [[Stephen Hendry]], who won the title seven times. [[Steve Davis]] and [[Ray Reardon]] both won six times while [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has won five titles.

Previously the draw had been made early in the season and the players made their own arrangements about the dates and venue of matches. The change in format proved a great success and [[Thurston's Hall]] became the primary venue for professional snooker matches. In the period from 1935 to 1940, nearly all World Championship matches were played there and with good attendances the professionals could make some money from their share of the entrance charges. Because of the importance of gate receipts, dead frames were played out, whatever the state of the game. This had often been the case in the early championships but now became universal.\n\nThere were five entries in [[1935 World Snooker Championship|1935 Championship]].

Ronnie O'Sullivan, the second seed, lost to Ali Carter, while Ding Junhui only made it to the quarter-finals before losing to Barry Hawkins. The final was between two of the \"class of '92\", [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] and [[John Higgins]]. Their rivalry dated back to the late 1990s, although only three of their meetings had been in the World Championships - all in semi-finals, in 1999, 2000 (both won by Williams 17\u201315) and 2011 (won by Higgins 17\u201314). The match was closely contested, Williams coming out on top by 18\u201316 to win the World Championship for the first time since 2003, setting a new record for the longest gap between consecutive World Championship victories. He won \u00a3425,000.  Higgins reached the final again in 2019, only to be beaten 18-9 by [[Judd Trump]]. His prize was a record breaking \u00a3500,000. Trump also bettered O'Sullivan's six centuries in the 2013 final \u2013 making seven \u2013 which was also a record.\n\n== Format ==\nThe format for the World Championship has been largely unchanged since [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]]. It has a knock-out format with 32 players, contested over 17 days ending on the first Monday in May, which is a [[May Day#United Kingdom|public holiday in the United Kingdom]]. Before 1982 there were a number of different formats used for the Championship. In 1980 and 1981, 24 players played in the final stages at the Crucible. The top eight seeds had a bye in the first round while seeds 9 to 16 played in the first round against eight qualifiers. From 1977 to 1979, the first three years at the Crucible, only 16 players reached the final stages, eight seeds playing eight qualifiers in the first round. Before 1980, the final was not always played over a set number of frames- for example, in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]] [[Ray Reardon]] beat [[Perrie Mans]] in a best-of-49 frames match 25\u201318 and, [[1979 World Snooker Championship|the following year]], [[Terry Griffiths]] defeated [[Dennis Taylor]] 24\u201316 in a best-of-47.\n\n16 of the players reach the final stages directly while the other 16 get there through a qualifying competition. The reigning world champion receives a direct entry and is the number one seed (the World Champion is usually seeded 2nd for all ranking tournaments, and The Masters, for the following season, except for the World Championship where is seeded 1st). The remaining direct entries are based on the latest [[Snooker world rankings|world rankings]], players being seeded based on these world rankings. Since the defending champion is normally ranked in the top 16, the top 16 ranked players generally receive a direct entry.\n\nThe first round is played over 19 frames, played in two sessions. The second round and quarter-finals are the best of 25 frames played over three sessions while the semi-finals and final are played over four sessions, the semi-finals being over 33 frames and the final 35 frames. For the first 12 days of the tournament two matches are played concurrently. For the last five days (the semi-finals and final) only one table is used.\n\nPrior to 1997 the semi-finals were played over 31 frames. Occasionally the dates of the Championship are changed. In 1982 the Championship ended on Sunday 16 May while in 1985, 1990 and 1995 it ended on the last Sunday in April. In each of these years the tournament started on a Friday but, as of 2019, this has not happened since.\n\nSeveral changes to the qualifying system came into effect for the 2015 championship. All living world champions would be extended an opportunity to play in the qualifying rounds. The top 16 seeds would still qualify automatically for the first round at the Crucible, but all non-seeded players would have to start in the first of three qualifying rounds. Previously players seeded 17 to 32 only had to win one qualifying match to reach the final stages. The overall championship would increase from 128 to 144 players, with the additional places made available to former world champions and players from emerging countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Snooker: Stephen Hendry and other champions could return|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=23 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425181726/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Winners ==\n{{Main|List of world snooker champions}}\n\n===Top performers of the modern era===\nThe 'modern' era is considered to start in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]], when the championship reverted to a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out tournament]] format from a challenge format.

The first championship was held in [[1927 World Snooker Championship|1927]] and was won by [[Joe Davis]]. Davis won the first 15 championships before retiring from the event, undefeated, after his [[1946 World Snooker Championship|1946]] success. In the 1950s snooker went into a period of decline and the championship was not held after 1952, although an unofficial championship was held until 1957. In 1964 the championship was revived on a challenge basis and in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]] the championship became a knock-out event again. Since [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]] it has been played at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], [[England]]. The tournament is currently played over 17 days and ends on the first Monday in May. In the modern era (since 1969), the best record is that of [[Stephen Hendry]], who won the title seven times. [[Steve Davis]] and [[Ray Reardon]] both won six times while [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has won five titles.

Previously the draw had been made early in the season and the players made their own arrangements about the dates and venue of matches. The change in format proved a great success and [[Thurston's Hall]] became the primary venue for professional snooker matches. In the period from 1935 to 1940, nearly all World Championship matches were played there and with good attendances the professionals could make some money from their share of the entrance charges. Because of the importance of gate receipts, dead frames were played out, whatever the state of the game.

Ronnie O'Sullivan, the second seed, lost to Ali Carter, while Ding Junhui only made it to the quarter-finals before losing to Barry Hawkins. The final was between two of the \"class of '92\", [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] and [[John Higgins]]. Their rivalry dated back to the late 1990s, although only three of their meetings had been in the World Championships - all in semi-finals, in 1999, 2000 (both won by Williams 17\u201315) and 2011 (won by Higgins 17\u201314). The match was closely contested, Williams coming out on top by 18\u201316 to win the World Championship for the first time since 2003, setting a new record for the longest gap between consecutive World Championship victories. He won \u00a3425,000.  Higgins reached the final again in 2019, only to be beaten 18-9 by [[Judd Trump]]. His prize was a record breaking \u00a3500,000. Trump also bettered O'Sullivan's six centuries in the 2013 final \u2013 making seven \u2013 which was also a record.\n\n== Format ==\nThe format for the World Championship has been largely unchanged since [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]]. It has a knock-out format with 32 players, contested over 17 days ending on the first Monday in May, which is a [[May Day#United Kingdom|public holiday in the United Kingdom]]. Before 1982 there were a number of different formats used for the Championship. In 1980 and 1981, 24 players played in the final stages at the Crucible. The top eight seeds had a bye in the first round while seeds 9 to 16 played in the first round against eight qualifiers. From 1977 to 1979, the first three years at the Crucible, only 16 players reached the final stages, eight seeds playing eight qualifiers in the first round. Before 1980, the final was not always played over a set number of frames- for example, in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]] [[Ray Reardon]] beat [[Perrie Mans]] in a best-of-49 frames match 25\u201318 and, [[1979 World Snooker Championship|the following year]], [[Terry Griffiths]] defeated [[Dennis Taylor]] 24\u201316 in a best-of-47.\n\n16 of the players reach the final stages directly while the other 16 get there through a qualifying competition. The reigning world champion receives a direct entry and is the number one seed (the World Champion is usually seeded 2nd for all ranking tournaments, and The Masters, for the following season, except for the World Championship where is seeded 1st). The remaining direct entries are based on the latest [[Snooker world rankings|world rankings]], players being seeded based on these world rankings. Since the defending champion is normally ranked in the top 16, the top 16 ranked players generally receive a direct entry.\n\nThe first round is played over 19 frames, played in two sessions. The second round and quarter-finals are the best of 25 frames played over three sessions while the semi-finals and final are played over four sessions, the semi-finals being over 33 frames and the final 35 frames. For the first 12 days of the tournament two matches are played concurrently. For the last five days (the semi-finals and final) only one table is used.\n\nPrior to 1997 the semi-finals were played over 31 frames. Occasionally the dates of the Championship are changed. In 1982 the Championship ended on Sunday 16 May while in 1985, 1990 and 1995 it ended on the last Sunday in April. In each of these years the tournament started on a Friday but, as of 2019, this has not happened since.\n\nSeveral changes to the qualifying system came into effect for the 2015 championship. All living world champions would be extended an opportunity to play in the qualifying rounds. The top 16 seeds would still qualify automatically for the first round at the Crucible, but all non-seeded players would have to start in the first of three qualifying rounds. Previously players seeded 17 to 32 only had to win one qualifying match to reach the final stages. The overall championship would increase from 128 to 144 players, with the additional places made available to former world champions and players from emerging countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Snooker: Stephen Hendry and other champions could return|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=23 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425181726/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Winners ==\n{{Main|List of world snooker champions}}\n\n===Top performers of the modern era===\nThe 'modern' era is considered to start in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]], when the championship reverted to a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out tournament]] format from a challenge format.
