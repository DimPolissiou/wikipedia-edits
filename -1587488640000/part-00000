In 1920, when Speicher took [[Albert C. Barnes]], founder of the [[Barnes Foundation]], on a tour of Woodtock artists' studios, Barnes bought five of Rohland's monotypes.  Barnes later wrote Rohland, saying the works \"successfully competed in cheerfulness and charm with a bright, crisp day<ref>William Schack, ''Art and Argyrol,'' Sagamore Press, Inc., New York, NY, 1960, p. 110</ref>.\n\n\nBy the early 1920's, Rohland, like other Woodstock artists, was depicting the local landscape in heavy brushstrokes and earthy tones, which some newspaper reviews called \"modernism.\"<ref>Bruce Weber, WAAM Lecture, June 1,2019. See also ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle,\u201c''Woodstock Art Colony Synonymous with Modernism,\u201d Sunday, Nov. 4, 1923, p. 26, \u00a0Newspapers.com.</ref> However, Rohland's watercolors remained bright and fluid.  Local landscape painter and art writer, John Slusser, wrote of Rohland's floral oils and watercolors, \"only a temperament as native to the sun and the soil as the flowers themselves could have produced them.\"<ref>Jean Paul Slusser, Essay on Paul Rohland published in ''The Arts'' June 1928, p. 357.</ref>  Printmaking was a signature art form in Woodstock.  Rohland contributed prints to [[Hervey White|Hervey White's]] publication, ''The Plowshare'', as well as to Woodstock's satirical publication, ''Hue and Cry.'' \n\n== Later career and legacy ==\nRohland exhibited regularly with the Woodstock Artists Association, [[Society of Independent Artists]], Salons of America, the Carnegie Institute, and the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]].  He also had one-man shows, notably in 1939 at the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|Virginia Museum of Fine Art]].  When Rohland traveled for his work, [[Juliana R. Force|Juliana Force]], who would become the first director of the new [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], handled many of his exhibitions and sales through the Whitney Studio Club and Whitney Gallery, where Rohland began exhibiting in 1927.  He showed at the Whitney Museum's first Biennial in 1932.  He continued to participate in Whitney Museum exhibitions through 1942.<ref>Peter Hastings Falk, ''Annual and Biennial Exhibition Record of the Whitney Museum of American Art, 1918 \u2013 1989,'' Sound View Press, Madison, CT 1991 p. 339, and Whitney Museum of American Art archives.</ref>\n\n\n[[Great Depression|The Great Depression]] severely affected his art sales, but Rohland managed to secure three commissions from the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture|Treasury Department's Section of Fine Arts]] for [[United States post office murals|post office murals]].  He executed the [http://statemuseumpa.org/common-canvas/post-office-full-study.pdf ''The Union of the Mountains''], for [[Mount Union, Pennsylvania|Mount Union, PA]], (1937); [https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/richard-russell-federal-building-mural-atlanta-ga/ ''Dogwood and Azaleas'',] for [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur, GA]] (1938); and [https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/post-office-mural-ville-platte-la/ ''Louisiana Bayou''], for [[Ville Platte, Louisiana|Ville Platte, LA]] (1939).<ref>Marlene Park and Gerald Markowitz, ''Democratic Vistas, PO and Public Art in the New Deal,'' Temple University Press, 1984, pp. 206, 212, 226.</ref>\n\n\nIn 1942, Rohland's chronic [[asthma]] worsened, and the couple packed up their [[Ford Model T]] and left Woodstock, traveling south to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]], with their final destination [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], where other Woodstock artists, among them, [[Andrew Dasburg]] and [[John Sloan]], were active.  From 1942 to 1945, Rohland exhibited yearly in the annual exhibition of Painters and Sculptors of the Southwest;<ref>''El Palacio'' catalogues 1942-1945.</ref> hence, he is often considered a \"western\" artist. In ''El Palacio'', August 1943, [[Edgar Lee Hewett]] remarked that Rohland's watercolor, ''[https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/paul-rohland-wpa-muralist-listed-1836259952 Southern Mansion,]'' \"possesses solidity beneath the flickering splashes of color.
