In 1956, Rothbard deprecated the views of Austrian economist [[Fritz Machlup]], stating that Machlup was no praxeologist and calling him instead a \"positivist\" who failed to represent the views of Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard stated that in fact Machlup shared the opposing positivist view associated with economist [[Milton Friedman]].<ref>In Defense of \"Extreme Apriorism\" Murray N. Rothbard Southern Economic Journal, January 1957, pp. 314\u201320</ref> Mises and Machlup had been colleagues in 1920s Vienna before each relocated to the United States and Mises later urged his American protege [[Israel Kirzner]] to pursue his PhD studies with Machlup at [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirzner|first=Israel|title=Interview of Israel Kirzner|url=https://www.mises.org/journals/aen/aen17_1_1.asp|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to libertarian economists [[Tyler Cowen]] and Richard Fink,<ref name=ERE>{{cite journal|last=Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink|title=Inconsistent Equilibrium Constructs: The Evenly Rotating Equilibrium Economy of Mises and Rothbard|journal=American Economic Review|volume=75|issue=4|pages=866\u2013869|year=1985|jstor=1821365}}</ref> Rothbard wrote that the term evenly rotating economy (ERE) can be used to analyze complexity in a world of change. The words ERE had been introduced by Mises as an alternative nomenclature for the mainstream economic method of [[static equilibrium]] and [[general equilibrium]] analysis. Cowen and Fink found \"serious inconsistencies in both the nature of the ERE and its suggested uses\". With the sole exception of Rothbard, no other economist adopted Mises' term and the concept continued to be called \"equilibrium analysis\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gunning|first=Patrick|title=Mises on the Evenly Rotating Economy|journal=Journal of Austrian Economics|volume=3|issue=3|url=https://mises.org/periodical.aspx?Id=4|date=2014-11-23}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2011 article critical of Rothbard's \"reflexive opposition\" to inflation, ''[[The Economist]]'' noted that his views are increasingly gaining influence among politicians and laypeople on the right. The article contrasted Rothbard's categorical rejection of inflationary policies with the monetary views of \"sophisticated Austrian-school monetary economists such as [[George Selgin]] and Larry White\", [who] follow Hayek in treating stability of nominal spending as a monetary ideal\u2014a position \"not all that different from [[Scott Sumner|Mr [Scott] Sumner]]'s\".<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/07/free-marketeers-and-inflation \"free marketeers and inflation.\"] ''The Economist''</ref>\n\nAccording to economist Peter Boettke, Rothbard is better described as a property rights economist than as an Austrian economist.

Specifically, he rejected Mises conviction that ethical values remain subjective and opposed [[utilitarianism]] in favor of principle-based, [[natural law]] reasoning. In defense of his free market views, Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments aimed at demonstrating that interventionist policies made all of society worse off. On the other hand, Rothbard concluded that interventionist policies do in fact benefit some people, including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs. Therefore, unlike Mises, Rothbard argued for an objective, natural law basis for the free market.<ref name=\"Essential\" />{{rp|pages=87\u201389}} He called this principle \"[[self-ownership]]\", loosely basing the idea on the writings of [[John Locke]]<ref>Olsaretti, Serena. 2004.

He instead advocated that until a defendant is convicted, he or she should not be held in prison or jails, writing that \"except in those cases where the criminal has been caught red-handed and where a certain presumption of guilt therefore exists, it is impossible to justify any imprisonment before conviction, let alone before trial. And even when someone is caught red-handed, there is an important reform that needs to be instituted to keep the system honest: subjecting the police and the other authorities to the same law as everyone else. If everyone is supposed to be subject to the same criminal law, then exempting the authorities from that law gives them a legal license to commit continual aggression. The policeman who apprehends a criminal and arrests him, and the judicial and penal authorities who incarcerate him before trial and conviction\u2014all should be subject to the universal law\".

Rothbard gives the example of a thief who stole $15,000 and says he not only would have to return the stolen money, but also provide the victim an additional $15,000, money to which the thief has forfeited his right. The thief would be \"put in a [temporary] state of enslavement to his victim\" if he is unable to pay him immediately. Rothbard also applies his theory to justify beating and torturing violent criminals, although the beatings are required to be proportional to the crimes for which they are being punished.\n\n==== Torture of criminal suspects ====\nIn chapter twelve of ''Ethics'',<ref name=SelfDefense>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/twelve.asp |chapter=Self-Defense |pages=77\u201384 |author=Rothbard, Murray |title=The Ethics of Liberty |publisher=New York University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8147-7506-6}}</ref> Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police.<ref name=\"Callahan\" /> He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime. Writes Rothbard: \"Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault\".<ref name=SelfDefense/> Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to [[Frameup|frame]] the suspect after having tortured him or her.<ref name=\"Callahan\" />\n\n=== Science and scientism ===\nIn an essay condemning \"[[scientism]] in the study of man\", Rothbard rejected the application of [[causal determinism]] to human beings, arguing that the actions of human beings\u2014as opposed to those of everything else in nature\u2014are not determined by prior causes, but by \"[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|free will]]\".<ref>Rothbard, Murray (1960).

It was during this phase that he associated with [[Karl Hess]] and founded ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]'' with [[Leonard Liggio]] and George Resch, which existed from 1965 to 1968.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1984, he edited ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]'', also initially with Hess (although Hess's involvement ended in 1971).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/4330 |title=Karl Hess and the Death of Politics |first=Jeff |last=Riggenbach |date=May 13, 2010 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref> The ''Libertarian Forum'' provided a platform for Rothbard's writing.

In 1956, Rothbard deprecated the views of Austrian economist [[Fritz Machlup]], stating that Machlup was no praxeologist and calling him instead a \"positivist\" who failed to represent the views of Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard stated that in fact Machlup shared the opposing positivist view associated with economist [[Milton Friedman]].<ref>In Defense of \"Extreme Apriorism\" Murray N. Rothbard Southern Economic Journal, January 1957, pp. 314\u201320</ref> Mises and Machlup had been colleagues in 1920s Vienna before each relocated to the United States and Mises later urged his American protege [[Israel Kirzner]] to pursue his PhD studies with Machlup at [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kirzner|first=Israel|title=Interview of Israel Kirzner|url=https://www.mises.org/journals/aen/aen17_1_1.asp|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to libertarian economists [[Tyler Cowen]] and Richard Fink,<ref name=ERE>{{cite journal|last=Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink|title=Inconsistent Equilibrium Constructs: The Evenly Rotating Equilibrium Economy of Mises and Rothbard|journal=American Economic Review|volume=75|issue=4|pages=866\u2013869|year=1985|jstor=1821365}}</ref> Rothbard wrote that the term evenly rotating economy (ERE) can be used to analyze complexity in a world of change. The words ERE had been introduced by Mises as an alternative nomenclature for the mainstream economic method of [[static equilibrium]] and [[general equilibrium]] analysis. Cowen and Fink found \"serious inconsistencies in both the nature of the ERE and its suggested uses\". With the sole exception of Rothbard, no other economist adopted Mises' term and the concept continued to be called \"equilibrium analysis\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gunning|first=Patrick|title=Mises on the Evenly Rotating Economy|journal=Journal of Austrian Economics|volume=3|issue=3|url=https://mises.org/periodical.aspx?Id=4|date=2014-11-23}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2011 article critical of Rothbard's \"reflexive opposition\" to inflation, ''[[The Economist]]'' noted that his views are increasingly gaining influence among politicians and laypeople on the right. The article contrasted Rothbard's categorical rejection of inflationary policies with the monetary views of \"sophisticated Austrian-school monetary economists such as [[George Selgin]] and Larry White\", [who] follow Hayek in treating stability of nominal spending as a monetary ideal\u2014a position \"not all that different from [[Scott Sumner|Mr [Scott] Sumner]]'s\".<ref>[https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/07/free-marketeers-and-inflation \"free marketeers and inflation.\"] ''The Economist''</ref>\n\nAccording to economist Peter Boettke, Rothbard is better described as a property rights economist than as an Austrian economist.

Specifically, he rejected Mises conviction that ethical values remain subjective and opposed [[utilitarianism]] in favor of principle-based, [[natural law]] reasoning. In defense of his free market views, Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments aimed at demonstrating that interventionist policies made all of society worse off. On the other hand, Rothbard concluded that interventionist policies do in fact benefit some people, including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs. Therefore, unlike Mises, Rothbard attempted to assert an objective, natural law basis for the free market.<ref name=\"Essential\" />{{rp|pages=87\u201389}} He called this principle \"[[self-ownership]]\", loosely basing the idea on the writings of [[John Locke]]<ref>Olsaretti, Serena. 2004.

He instead advocated that until a defendant is convicted, he or she should not be held in prison or jails, writing that \"except in those cases where the criminal has been caught red-handed and where a certain presumption of guilt therefore exists, it is impossible to justify any imprisonment before conviction, let alone before trial. And even when someone is caught red-handed, there is an important reform that needs to be instituted to keep the system honest: subjecting the police and the other authorities to the same law as everyone else. If everyone is supposed to be subject to the same criminal law, then exempting the authorities from that law gives them a legal license to commit continual aggression. The policeman who apprehends a criminal and arrests him, and the judicial and penal authorities who incarcerate him before trial and conviction\u2014all should be subject to the universal law\".

Rothbard gives the example of a thief who stole $15,000 and says he not only would have to return the stolen money, but also provide the victim an additional $15,000, money to which the thief has forfeited his right. The thief would be \"put in a [temporary] state of enslavement to his victim\" if he is unable to pay him immediately. Rothbard also applies his theory to justify beating and torturing violent criminals, although the beatings are required to be proportional to the crimes for which they are being punished.\n\n==== Torture of criminal suspects ====\nIn chapter twelve of ''Ethics'',<ref name=SelfDefense>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/twelve.asp |chapter=Self-Defense |pages=77\u201384 |author=Rothbard, Murray |title=The Ethics of Liberty |publisher=New York University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8147-7506-6}}</ref> Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police.<ref name=\"Callahan\" /> He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime. Writes Rothbard: \"Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault\".<ref name=SelfDefense/> Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to [[Frameup|frame]] the suspect after having tortured him or her.<ref name=\"Callahan\" />\n\n=== Science and scientism ===\nIn an essay condemning \"[[scientism]] in the study of man\", Rothbard rejected the application of [[causal determinism]] to human beings, arguing that the actions of human beings\u2014as opposed to those of everything else in nature\u2014are not determined by prior causes, but by \"[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|free will]]\".<ref>Rothbard, Murray (1960).

Rothbard opposed what he considered the overspecialization of the academy and sought to fuse the disciplines of economics, history, ethics and political science to create a \"science of liberty\". Rothbard described the moral basis for his anarcho-capitalist position in two of his books: ''[[For a New Liberty]]'', published in 1973; and ''[[The Ethics of Liberty]]'', published in 1982. In his ''[[Power and Market]]'' (1970), Rothbard describes how a stateless economy might function.\n\n== Political activism ==\nAs a young man, Rothbard considered himself part of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], an [[Anti-statism|anti-statist]] and anti-[[economic interventionism|interventionist]] branch of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

Daytime service makes express stops in Manhattan and local stops in Brooklyn; late night service makes local stops along its entire route.\n\nThe '''Q''' was originally the [[Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation]] (BMT)'s '''1''' service; beginning in 1920, it ran along the Brighton Line in Brooklyn and Broadway Line in Manhattan. In the past, the '''Q''' has run many different service patterns in Brooklyn, Manhattan and [[Queens]], both local and express, including '''QB''' service on the [[Manhattan Bridge]] and '''QT''' service via the [[Montague Street Tunnel]]. From 1988 to 2001, '''Q''' service ran along the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]] in Manhattan, with a bullet colored orange. The '''Q''' also ran in Queens at various points, including to [[Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard (BMT Astoria Line)|Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard]] on the [[BMT Astoria Line]] from 2010 to 2016, [[Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue]] on the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]] during temporary post-9/11 service reroutes, and [[21st Street\u2013Queensbridge (IND 63rd Street Line)|21st Street\u2013Queensbridge]] on the [[63rd Street Lines|IND 63rd Street Line]] until 2001. There was also a '''&lt;Q&gt;''' variant from 2001 to 2004, which ran express on the Brighton Line and terminated at [[Brighton Beach (BMT Brighton Line)|Brighton Beach]]. On January 1, 2017, the '''Q''' was rerouted along the [[Second Avenue Subway]].\n\n==History==\n\n<!-- ===Designation===\n[[File:Bmt triplex no 1.png|thumb|left|90px|Route designation on BMT Triplex equipment]]\n'''Q''' was introduced as a service identifier for the Brighton Beach Express via Broadway (Manhattan) on the rollsigns of the [[R27 (New York City Subway car)|R27]] class of subway cars as they were delivered beginning in 1960 and on all subsequent equipment ordered for the IND/BMT divisions of the New York City subway system. The former designation for the service was the number '''1''', itself introduced in 1924, a designation shared by all Brighton Line mainline services. The letter designations did not appear on earlier equipment that carried the former route numbers. Therefore, older equipment that carried the number '''1''' (notably the [[D-type Triplex (New York City Subway car)|D-type Triplex]]) continued to be signed '''1''' until they were withdrawn from service in 1965.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAlso with the introduction of the [[R27 (New York City Subway car)|R27]] fleet, the mainline local services on the Brighton Line (and other BMT services) were given double letters in conformance with IND practice. Ordinarily this would have produced a '''QQ''' service, but this designation was never used. There were two local services, the Brighton Local via Montague Street Tunnel, designated '''QT''', which operated when the express service was running, and the Brighton Local via Manhattan Bridge, designated '''QB''', which operated when the express did not. The so-called \"Banker's Special\" express, which operated a few trains in the morning and evening rush hours to the [[Wall Street]] financial district was not given a separate designation. As this service continued to use older equipment for years after the letters were introduced, this was not usually a problem. When R27 and later cars were used on these specials, they often carried the '''M''' designation in the morning that was originally (and eventually) used on Myrtle Avenue trains, and the evening sometimes carried '''Q''' or sometimes no designation at all.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nWith the advent of the Chrystie Street services, the '''Q''' designation was suspended as Brighton Line express service was provided by the '''{{NYCS|D}}''' service via 6th Avenue in Manhattan. The '''QT''' and '''QB''' designations were both to be dropped as the Brighton Locals were rerouted to the [[Nassau Street Loop]] in lower Manhattan and through routed to Jamaica via the [[BMT Jamaica Line]]. This service was designated '''{{NYCS|QJ}}'''. The '''QB''' designation was retained as it was decided to run a few special local trains up the [[BMT Broadway Line]] to answer complaints that the new services provided no access to the Broadway Line.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n-->\n\n===1878\u20131920: Original railroad===\nThe predecessor to the subway service known as the '''Q''' today was the '''Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway'''. On July 2, 1878, this [[steam railroad]] began operations on what would become the [[BMT Brighton Line]], from [[Prospect Park (BMT Brighton Line)|Prospect Park]] to the Brighton Beach Hotel in [[Brighton Beach]], which opened at the same time. The Brighton Beach Hotel was located on [[Coney Island]] by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at the foot of modern-day Coney Island Avenue.

By mutual agreement trains of the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway ran on LIRR trackage west to its terminal at [[Atlantic Terminal|Flatbush Avenue]] and Atlantic Avenue, providing a connection to Downtown Brooklyn and ferries to Manhattan. LIRR trains also operated to Brighton Beach from Flatbush Avenue and from its own terminal in [[Long Island City]], with ferry access to [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Initially, service operated during the summer season only. At the end of the 1882 summer season, the LIRR abrogated its agreement allowing Brighton Line trains to access its Flatbush Avenue terminal and beginning with the 1883 summer season, only Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island trains operated between Bedford Terminal and Brighton Beach.\n\nIn 1896, a short elevated extension of the Brighton Beach Line (since reorganized as the Brooklyn & Brighton Beach Railroad) opened to the corner of [[Franklin Avenue\u2013Fulton Street (New York City Subway)|Franklin Avenue and Fulton Street]] in the north. This extension connected to the [[BMT Fulton Street Line|Fulton Street Line]] of the [[Kings County Elevated Railroad]], allowing [[rapid transit]] trains on Fulton Street to operate along the Brighton Line. These trains ran from Brighton Beach, up the Franklin Avenue and Fulton Street lines to the Brooklyn side of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], where walking or transferring to a [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] service connection over the bridge allowed access to [[New York City Hall]] at Park Row in Manhattan.

On June 29, 1950, trains began running there during the evening rush as well.\n\nOn October 17, 1949, the [[BMT Astoria Line|IRT Astoria Line]] in Queens, up to this point operated by the [[Interborough Rapid Transit]] (IRT), was converted to BMT operation. '''1''' Local trains were extended via the [[60th Street Tunnel]] and the BMT Astoria Line to [[Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard (BMT Astoria Line)|Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard]] during rush hours. Number '''2''' [[R (New York City Subway service)|Fourth Avenue Local]] trains also ran here at all times.\n\n===1950s===\nOn April 27, 1950, '''1''' Local trains operated through to Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard all day on weekdays and Saturdays. On June 26, 1952, '''1''' Express trains were extended to 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue on weekdays after the morning rush hour and all day on Saturdays.\n\nThe [[60th Street Tunnel Connection]] opened on December 1, 1955, connecting the Broadway Line to the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]]. '''1''' Local trains were rerouted to this new connector to [[Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue]] in [[Forest Hills, Queens]]. They were replaced on the [[BMT Astoria Line]] by '''1''' Express trains on weekdays. On May 4, 1957, trains running express in Brooklyn started running to Astoria on Saturdays as well, but made local stops in Manhattan as the local trains in Brooklyn now ran to Chambers Street via the BMT Nassau Street Line. The final portion of the Broadway Line's express tracks, between Times Square\u201342nd Street and 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue, was placed in service on May 2, 1957<!--, and were used at all times by West End and Sea Beach Expresses-->. <!--An interesting aspect of this service was that--> '''1''' Brighton Express trains ran local in Manhattan on Saturdays while Brighton Locals ran express here during evenings and on Sundays. This lasted only until the next service change. On October 24, 1957, Brighton Local trains ran via the Manhattan Bridge and local in Manhattan, all day on Sundays as well as evenings and midnight hours. Brighton Express '''1''' service on weekdays began using the express tracks between Times Square\u201342nd Street and 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue.\n\nA December 1957 strike shut down much of the BMT Division. Brighton Local '''1''' trains ran in two sections, from Coney Island via tunnel to 57th Street-Seventh Avenue and from [[Whitehall Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Whitehall Street]] to [[Jamaica\u2013179th Street (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Jamaica\u2013179th Street]] on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Due to the differing unions predominating on the various divisions, the IND was completely knocked out of service, while the IRT ran virtually normal service. The BMT was about half affected, with makeshift service patterns being set up for the duration of the strike.\n\nOn May 28, 1959, '''1''' Brighton Express trains midday on weekdays were cut back to 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue and made local stops in Brooklyn midday. Nassau Specials returned, running via the Montague Street tunnel during the morning rush and via the Manhattan Bridge during the evening rush. As part of the same service change, Brighton Local trains (beginning June 6) ran to Franklin Avenue on Saturdays. This was not seasonal and ran the entire day, being quite distinct from the Sunday service which still operated.\n\n===1960\u20131987: Lettered variants and Chrystie Street Connection===\n<div class=\"thumb tright\">\n[[File:r27endq.gif|90px]]|[[File:r27endqb.gif|90px]]|[[File:r27endqt.gif|90px]]\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\">R27/R32 rollsigns for the '''Q''', '''QB''' and '''QT'''</div>\n</div>\nOn November 15, 1960, with the arrival of the [[R27 (New York City Subway car)|R27 subway cars]], '''1''' service on the Brighton Line was relabeled. Brighton Express service was designated as '''Q''', Brighton Local via the Montague St Tunnel as '''QT''', and Brighton Local via the Manhattan Bridge as '''QB'''. Single letters were used to refer to express lines and double letters for local lines, a practice that began thirty years earlier with the [[Independent Subway System]] (IND), however, no '''QQ''' designation was ever used. <!--However, these designations were not as yet in common usage, and the R27 signs continued to display the old route names. For the above reasons and for the sake of continuity and consistency, these services were referred to by the old route names until the time of the opening of the [[Chrystie Street Connection]]. Moreover, it was deemed more important and informative to indicate how the trains actually operated rather than how the letters were manipulated.--> Despite these new designations, subway communications continued to refer to the services as \"Brighton Local\" and \"Brighton Express\".\n\nOn January 1, 1961, '''Q''' Brighton Express service was cut back from Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard to 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue on weekdays. Saturday daytime service continued to run to Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/25029684135/|title=BMT Riders: Changes In Routes!

The '''QB''' provided off-peak service between Coney Island and Astoria, via Brighton Local and the Manhattan Bridge. Sunday service between Franklin Avenue and Brighton Beach was discontinued on this date, with Sunday service now provided solely by the [[Franklin Avenue Shuttle]] between Prospect Park and Franklin Avenue-Fulton Street. \n\nService between Brighton Beach and Franklin Avenue was merged into the Franklin Avenue Shuttle service on October 14, 1961, and all non-shuttle service between was discontinued in February 1963. The [[R (New York City Subway service)|Fourth Avenue Local ('''RR''')]] now provided Broadway Line service along the Queens Boulevard line on weekdays, and the [[T (New York City Subway service)|West End Express ('''T''')]] was extended from 57th Street-Seventh Avenue to Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard during rush hours. This service change essentially swapped the northern terminals of the Brighton Local and '''RR''', and between the Brighton Express and ('''T'''). Prior to this both Brighton Line-Broadway services operated via the 60th Street Tunnel to Queens. By having the Brighton Express '''Q''' terminate at 57th Street-Seventh Avenue, this change served to keep one Brighton Line service unaffected in the event of a massive delay in the 60th Street Tunnel.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOn April 21, 1962, all Saturday trains on the Brighton Line began making running local, doubling the frequency of service and providing a one-seat ride to Manhattan for riders at local stations. With the arrival of new subway cars to the line, which provided improved running times, trains making local stops between Brighton Beach and Prospect Park did so in only 1.5 minutes longer than existing express service.<ref name=\":132\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FileBrowser.aspx?LinkToFile=FILES_DOC/WAGNER_FILES/06.023.0000.141.1633.PDF#undefined|title=For Immediate Release Sunday, April 19, 1962 #258|date=April 19, 1962|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<!-- On April 2, 1962, Brighton Locals once again ran as locals on the Brighton Line, as at all other times.  -->From February 10 to November 2, 1964, the Brighton Express tracks were closed for platform extensions.

The bridge's north side tracks, which formerly connected to the Broadway Line, now connected to the Sixth Avenue Line express tracks. Originally, the '''{{NYCS|D}}''', running via Sixth Avenue Express and '''{{NYCS|QJ}}''', running via the [[BMT Nassau Street Line]] and [[Montague Street Tunnel]] were to replace all three '''Q''' services on the Brighton Line. The '''Q''' and '''QT''' were eliminated, but due to riders' opposition to the expected loss of all Broadway Line service, the '''QB''' was retained, now running rush hours only in the peak direction, via Brighton Local, the Manhattan Bridge and Broadway Express in Manhattan, between Coney Island and 57th Street-Seventh Avenue. The color scheme introduced for subway lines that day included a red '''QB''' bullet. A short-lived '''[[N (New York City Subway service)|NX]]''' service also provided rush-hour service between Brighton Beach and Coney Island and the Broadway Line, running via the [[BMT Sea Beach Line]] to Manhattan.

Its route emblem, or \"bullet\", is colored {{NYCS const|color|yellow}} since it uses the [[BMT Broadway Line]] in [[Manhattan]].\n\nThe '''Q''' operates at all times between [[96th Street (Second Avenue Subway)|96th Street/Second Avenue]] in the [[Upper East Side]] of Manhattan and [[Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue (BMT Brighton Line)|Stillwell Avenue]] in [[Coney Island]], [[Brooklyn]], via the BMT Broadway Line, the [[Manhattan Bridge]] and the [[BMT Brighton Line]]. Daytime service makes express stops in Manhattan and local stops in Brooklyn; late night service makes local stops along its entire route.\n\nThe '''Q''' was originally the [[Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation]] (BMT)'s '''1''' service; beginning in 1920, it ran along the Brighton Line in Brooklyn and Broadway Line in Manhattan. In the past, the '''Q''' has run many different service patterns in Brooklyn, Manhattan and [[Queens]], both local and express, including '''QB''' service on the [[Manhattan Bridge]] and '''QT''' service via the [[Montague Street Tunnel]]. From 1988 to 2001, '''Q''' service ran along the [[IND Sixth Avenue Line]] in Manhattan, with a bullet colored orange. The '''Q''' also ran in Queens at various points, including to [[Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard (BMT Astoria Line)|Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard]] on the [[BMT Astoria Line]] from 2010 to 2016, [[Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue]] on the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]] during temporary post-9/11 service reroutes, and [[21st Street\u2013Queensbridge (IND 63rd Street Line)|21st Street\u2013Queensbridge]] on the [[63rd Street Lines|IND 63rd Street Line]] until 2001. There was also a '''&lt;Q&gt;''' variant from 2001 to 2004, which ran express on the Brighton Line and terminated at [[Brighton Beach (BMT Brighton Line)|Brighton Beach]]. On January 1, 2017, the '''Q''' was rerouted along the [[Second Avenue Subway]].\n\n==History==\n\n<!-- ===Designation===\n[[File:Bmt triplex no 1.png|thumb|left|90px|Route designation on BMT Triplex equipment]]\n'''Q''' was introduced as a service identifier for the Brighton Beach Express via Broadway (Manhattan) on the rollsigns of the [[R27 (New York City Subway car)|R27]] class of subway cars as they were delivered beginning in 1960 and on all subsequent equipment ordered for the IND/BMT divisions of the New York City subway system. The former designation for the service was the number '''1''', itself introduced in 1924, a designation shared by all Brighton Line mainline services. The letter designations did not appear on earlier equipment that carried the former route numbers. Therefore, older equipment that carried the number '''1''' (notably the [[D-type Triplex (New York City Subway car)|D-type Triplex]]) continued to be signed '''1''' until they were withdrawn from service in 1965.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAlso with the introduction of the [[R27 (New York City Subway car)|R27]] fleet, the mainline local services on the Brighton Line (and other BMT services) were given double letters in conformance with IND practice. Ordinarily this would have produced a '''QQ''' service, but this designation was never used. There were two local services, the Brighton Local via Montague Street Tunnel, designated '''QT''', which operated when the express service was running, and the Brighton Local via Manhattan Bridge, designated '''QB''', which operated when the express did not. The so-called \"Banker's Special\" express, which operated a few trains in the morning and evening rush hours to the [[Wall Street]] financial district was not given a separate designation. As this service continued to use older equipment for years after the letters were introduced, this was not usually a problem. When R27 and later cars were used on these specials, they often carried the '''M''' designation in the morning that was originally (and eventually) used on Myrtle Avenue trains, and the evening sometimes carried '''Q''' or sometimes no designation at all.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nWith the advent of the Chrystie Street services, the '''Q''' designation was suspended as Brighton Line express service was provided by the '''{{NYCS|D}}''' service via 6th Avenue in Manhattan. The '''QT''' and '''QB''' designations were both to be dropped as the Brighton Locals were rerouted to the [[Nassau Street Loop]] in lower Manhattan and through routed to Jamaica via the [[BMT Jamaica Line]]. This service was designated '''{{NYCS|QJ}}'''. The '''QB''' designation was retained as it was decided to run a few special local trains up the [[BMT Broadway Line]] to answer complaints that the new services provided no access to the Broadway Line.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n-->\n\n===1878\u20131920: Original railroad===\nThe predecessor to the subway service known as the '''Q''' today was the '''Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway'''. On July 2, 1878, this [[steam railroad]] began operations on what would become the [[BMT Brighton Line]], from [[Prospect Park (BMT Brighton Line)|Prospect Park]] to the Brighton Beach Hotel in [[Brighton Beach]], which opened at the same time. The Brighton Beach Hotel was located on [[Coney Island]] by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at the foot of modern-day Coney Island Avenue.

By mutual agreement trains of the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway ran on LIRR trackage west to its terminal at [[Atlantic Terminal|Flatbush Avenue]] and Atlantic Avenue, providing a connection to Downtown Brooklyn and ferries to Manhattan. LIRR trains also operated to Brighton Beach from Flatbush Avenue and from its own terminal in [[Long Island City]], with ferry access to [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Initially, service operated during the summer season only. At the end of the 1882 summer season, the LIRR abrogated its agreement allowing Brighton Line trains to access its Flatbush Avenue terminal and beginning with the 1883 summer season, only Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island trains operated between Bedford Terminal and Brighton Beach.\n\nIn 1896, a short elevated extension of the Brighton Beach Line (since reorganized as the Brooklyn & Brighton Beach Railroad) opened to the corner of [[Franklin Avenue\u2013Fulton Street (New York City Subway)|Franklin Avenue and Fulton Street]] in the north. This extension connected to the [[BMT Fulton Street Line|Fulton Street Line]] of the [[Kings County Elevated Railroad]], allowing [[rapid transit]] trains on Fulton Street to operate along the Brighton Line. These trains ran from Brighton Beach, up the Franklin Avenue and Fulton Street lines to the Brooklyn side of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], where walking or transferring to a [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] service connection over the bridge allowed access to [[New York City Hall]] at Park Row in Manhattan.

Three years later, the Brighton Locals and Expresses switched Manhattan access methods with the express using the bridge when it ran and local service using the tunnel except in the evenings and on Sunday, when it too used the bridge. During the 1930s, limited morning rush hour service ran via the south side tracks of the Manhattan Bridge and the [[Nassau Street Loop]] to [[Chambers Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Chambers Street]] on the [[BMT Nassau Street Line]]. On June 29, 1950, trains began running there during the evening rush as well.\n\nOn October 17, 1949, the [[BMT Astoria Line|IRT Astoria Line]] in Queens, up to this point operated by the [[Interborough Rapid Transit]] (IRT), was converted to BMT operation. '''1''' Local trains were extended via the [[60th Street Tunnel]] and the BMT Astoria Line to [[Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard (BMT Astoria Line)|Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard]] during rush hours. Number '''2''' [[R (New York City Subway service)|Fourth Avenue Local]] trains also ran here at all times.\n\n===1950s===\nOn April 27, 1950, '''1''' Local trains operated through to Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard all day on weekdays and Saturdays. On June 26, 1952, '''1''' Express trains were extended to 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue on weekdays after the morning rush hour and all day on Saturdays.\n\nThe [[60th Street Tunnel Connection]] opened on December 1, 1955, connecting the Broadway Line to the [[IND Queens Boulevard Line]]. '''1''' Local trains were rerouted to this new connector to [[Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue]] in [[Forest Hills, Queens]]. They were replaced on the [[BMT Astoria Line]] by '''1''' Express trains on weekdays. On May 4, 1957, trains running express in Brooklyn started running to Astoria on Saturdays as well, but made local stops in Manhattan as the local trains in Brooklyn now ran to Chambers Street via the BMT Nassau Street Line. The final portion of the Broadway Line's express tracks, between Times Square\u201342nd Street and 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue, was placed in service on May 2, 1957<!--, and were used at all times by West End and Sea Beach Expresses-->. <!--An interesting aspect of this service was that--> '''1''' Brighton Express trains ran local in Manhattan on Saturdays while Brighton Locals ran express here during evenings and on Sundays. This lasted only until the next service change. On October 24, 1957, Brighton Local trains ran via the Manhattan Bridge and local in Manhattan, all day on Sundays as well as evenings and midnight hours. Brighton Express '''1''' service on weekdays began using the express tracks between Times Square\u201342nd Street and 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue.\n\nA December 1957 strike shut down much of the BMT Division. Brighton Local '''1''' trains ran in two sections, from Coney Island via tunnel to 57th Street-Seventh Avenue and from [[Whitehall Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Whitehall Street]] to [[Jamaica\u2013179th Street (IND Queens Boulevard Line)|Jamaica\u2013179th Street]] on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Due to the differing unions predominating on the various divisions, the IND was completely knocked out of service, while the IRT ran virtually normal service. The BMT was about half affected, with makeshift service patterns being set up for the duration of the strike.\n\nOn May 28, 1959, '''1''' Brighton Express trains midday on weekdays were cut back to 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue and made local stops in Brooklyn midday. Nassau Specials returned, running via the Montague Street tunnel during the morning rush and via the Manhattan Bridge during the evening rush. As part of the same service change, Brighton Local trains (beginning June 6) ran to Franklin Avenue on Saturdays.

Brighton Express service was designated as '''Q''', Brighton Local via the Montague St Tunnel as '''QT''', and Brighton Local via the Manhattan Bridge as '''QB'''. Single letters were used to refer to express lines and double letters for local lines, a practice that began thirty years earlier with the [[Independent Subway System]] (IND), however, no '''QQ''' designation was ever used. <!--However, these designations were not as yet in common usage, and the R27 signs continued to display the old route names. For the above reasons and for the sake of continuity and consistency, these services were referred to by the old route names until the time of the opening of the [[Chrystie Street Connection]]. Moreover, it was deemed more important and informative to indicate how the trains actually operated rather than how the letters were manipulated.--> Despite these new designations, subway communications continued to refer to the services as \"Brighton Local\" and \"Brighton Express\".\n\nOn January 1, 1961, '''Q''' Brighton Express service was cut back from Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard to 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue on weekdays.

The '''QB''' provided off-peak service between Coney Island and Astoria, via Brighton Local and the Manhattan Bridge. Sunday service between Franklin Avenue and Brighton Beach was discontinued on this date, with Sunday service now provided solely by the [[Franklin Avenue Shuttle]] between Prospect Park and Franklin Avenue-Fulton Street. \n\nService between Brighton Beach and Franklin Avenue was merged into the Franklin Avenue Shuttle service on October 14, 1961, and all non-shuttle service between was discontinued in February 1963. The [[R (New York City Subway service)|Fourth Avenue Local ('''RR''')]] now provided Broadway Line service along the Queens Boulevard line on weekdays, and the [[T (New York City Subway service)|West End Express ('''T''')]] was extended from 57th Street-Seventh Avenue to Astoria-Ditmars Boulevard during rush hours. This service change essentially swapped the northern terminals of the Brighton Local and '''RR''', and between the Brighton Express and ('''T'''). Prior to this both Brighton Line-Broadway services operated via the 60th Street Tunnel to Queens. By having the Brighton Express '''Q''' terminate at 57th Street-Seventh Avenue, this change served to keep one Brighton Line service unaffected in the event of a massive delay in the 60th Street Tunnel.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOn April 21, 1962, all Saturday trains on the Brighton Line began making running local, doubling the frequency of service and providing a one-seat ride to Manhattan for riders at local stations.

The album came two years after the band's founding, after they initially struggled as an alternative to [[grunge|grunge music]], which was prevalent in [[Los Angeles]] during the early 1990s. It was almost entirely arranged and composed by frontman [[Rivers Cuomo]], who also anticipated to lead the band in self-producing the album. However, at the behest of DGC, the band was required to include a producer, and collectively opted for [[The Cars|Cars]] frontman [[Ric Ocasek]]. Most of the recording was conducted at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in [[New York City]] between August and September 1993, a period that coincided with founding guitarist [[Jason Cropper]] being fired and replaced by [[Brian Bell]].\n\nUnder Ocasek's direction, the band opted for a brighter sound, while bassist [[Matt Sharp]] collaborated with Cuomo to ensure that the album contained an overriding sonic concept of treating the guitars and bass as isolated ten-string instruments, thus maximizing its potential when united.<ref name=\"Pitchforklist\">{{cite web | last = DiCrescenzo | first = Brent | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | title = Top 100 Albums of the 1990s | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023195032/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | archivedate = October 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Lyrically, ''Weezer'' focuses on outsiderdom and [[social awkwardness]], while also touching on melancholic themes of love, romance, and familial issues.<ref>https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/weezer-blue-album-power-pop/</ref> \n\n''Weezer'' was supported by the singles \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\", \"[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]\", and \"[[Say It Ain't So]]\", which, alongside their respective [[music video]]s, brought Weezer mainstream success. The album itself peaked at number sixteen on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], and was certified [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] by 1995.

Sharp, who had never sung before joining Weezer, developed his [[falsetto]]: \"I had to sing an octave higher than Rivers. After a lot of practice, I started to get it down.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=85}}</ref>\n\nWeezer rehearsed 15 songs in New York in preparation for the Electric Lady Studios recording sessions. Four songs from this rehearsal would not be attempted for the album: \"Lullaby for Wayne\", \"I Swear It's True\", \"Getting Up and Leaving\", and a reprise version of \"In the Garage\". The other song, an ode to two women who ran the Weezer fanclub called \"Mykel & Carli\", was attempted during the Electric Lady sessions, but was also abandoned (this recording was later released as a digital bonus track on the 2010 compilation ''[[Death to False Metal]]''). A later recording of \"Mykel & Carli\" was featured as a B-side on the \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\" single.<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|pp=88\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe band considered self-producing, but were pressured by [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] to choose a producer. They decided on [[Ric Ocasek]], who had played with the [[The Cars|Cars]].<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=87}}</ref> Ocasek convinced the band to change their [[Pick up (music technology)|guitar pickups]] from the neck to the bridge, resulting in a brighter sound.<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=87}}</ref> Sharp and Cuomo imposed several rules on recording, banning [[Reverberation|reverb]] and insisting on all [[Downpicking|downstrokes]] on guitar.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/weezer-blue-album-25th-anniversary-877089/|title=The Strange Birth and Near Death of Weezer|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|last2=Hiatt|first2=Brian|date=2019-08-28|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref> According to engineer Chris Shaw, the \"overriding concept\" was to treat the guitars and bass as a single, 10-string instrument, playing in unison. Weezer insisted that the guitars were mixed as loudly as those in the [[Radiohead]] song \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\", burying some vocals.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDuring the recording, Cropper learned that his girlfriend was pregnant and began acting erratically.

In 1994, 70s rock had come to mean either a bastardized version of [[Led Zeppelin]] or a bullshit reconstruction of [[punk rock]]. As guitar nerds, Weezer sought influence there but found true inspiration in forgotten bubblegum power-pop like [[Cheap Trick]], [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]], [[20/20 (band)|20/20]], and [[The Quick (U.S. band)|The Quick]]. Most impressively, Rivers Cuomo rescued the thrilling guitar solo from finger-tapping metal and disregarding grunge/punk. A decade later air-guitaring to the album feels far less embarrassing than singing along. With the help of [[Spike Jonze]], Weezer kept joy alive in [[arena rock]], making the critical repositioning of Weezer as some emo touchstone even more absentminded. They called themselves Weezer, knowingly, for chrissakes.<ref name=\"Pitchforklist\">{{cite web | last = DiCrescenzo | first = Brent | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | title = Top 100 Albums of the 1990s | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023195032/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | archivedate = October 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[NME]]'' claimed that the album \"pretty much invented emo's melodic wing\".<ref>{{cite web| last= Lewis| first= Luke| url= http://www.nme.com/reviews/weezer/10951 |title= Album review: Weezer \u2013 'Raditude'| website= [[NME]].com| date= November 2, 2009| access-date= March 6, 2011.</ref> [[AllMusic|AllMusic's]] Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a full 5/5 stars, explaining \"What makes the band so enjoyable is their charming geekiness; instead of singing about despair, they sing about love, which is kind of refreshing in the gloom-drenched world of '90s guitar-pop.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\nSince its release, the Blue Album has featured heavily in various \"must have\" lists compiled by the music media.

It was almost entirely arranged and composed by frontman [[Rivers Cuomo]], who also anticipated to lead the band in self-producing the album. However, at the behest of DGC, the band was required to include a producer, and collectively opted for [[The Cars|Cars]] frontman [[Ric Ocasek]]. Most of the recording was conducted at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in [[New York City]] between August and September 1993, a period that coincided with founding guitarist [[Jason Cropper]] being fired and replaced by [[Brian Bell]].\n\nUnder Ocasek's direction, the band opted for a brighter sound, while bassist [[Matt Sharp]] collaborated with Cuomo to ensure that the album contained an overriding sonic concept of treating the guitars and bass as isolated ten-string instruments, thus maximizing its potential when united.<ref name=\"Pitchforklist\">{{cite web | last = DiCrescenzo | first = Brent | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | title = Top 100 Albums of the 1990s | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023195032/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | archivedate = October 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Lyrically, ''Weezer'' focuses on outsiderdom and [[social awkwardness]], while also touching on melancholic themes of love, romance, and familial issues.<ref>https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/weezer-blue-album-power-pop/</ref> \n\n''Weezer'' was supported by the singles \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\", \"[[Buddy Holly (song)|Buddy Holly]]\", and \"[[Say It Ain't So]]\", which, alongside their respective [[music video]]s, brought Weezer mainstream success.

Sharp, who had never sung before joining Weezer, developed his [[falsetto]]: \"I had to sing an octave higher than Rivers. After a lot of practice, I started to get it down.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=85}}</ref>\n\nWeezer rehearsed 15 songs in New York in preparation for the Electric Lady Studios recording sessions. Four songs from this rehearsal would not be attempted for the album: \"Lullaby for Wayne\", \"I Swear It's True\", \"Getting Up and Leaving\", and a reprise version of \"In the Garage\". The other song, an ode to two women who ran the Weezer fanclub called \"Mykel & Carli\", was attempted during the Electric Lady sessions, but was also abandoned (this recording was later released as a digital bonus track on the 2010 compilation ''[[Death to False Metal]]''). A later recording of \"Mykel & Carli\" was featured as a B-side on the \"[[Undone \u2013 The Sweater Song]]\" single.<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|pp=88\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe band considered self-producing, but were pressured by [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] to choose a producer. They decided on [[Ric Ocasek]], who had played with the [[The Cars|Cars]].<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=87}}</ref> Ocasek convinced the band to change their [[Pick up (music technology)|guitar pickups]] from the neck to the bridge, resulting in a brighter sound.<ref>{{harvnb|Luerssen|2004|p=87}}</ref> Sharp and Cuomo imposed several rules on recording, banning [[Reverberation|reverb]] and insisting on all [[Downpicking|downstrokes]] on guitar.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/weezer-blue-album-25th-anniversary-877089/|title=The Strange Birth and Near Death of Weezer|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|last2=Hiatt|first2=Brian|date=2019-08-28|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref> According to engineer Chris Shaw, the \"overriding concept\" was to treat the guitars and bass as a single, 10-string instrument, playing in unison.

In 1994, 70s rock had come to mean either a bastardized version of [[Led Zeppelin]] or a bullshit reconstruction of [[punk rock]]. As guitar nerds, Weezer sought influence there but found true inspiration in forgotten bubblegum power-pop like [[Cheap Trick]], [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]], [[20/20 (band)|20/20]], and [[The Quick (U.S. band)|The Quick]]. Most impressively, Rivers Cuomo rescued the thrilling guitar solo from finger-tapping metal and disregarding grunge/punk. A decade later air-guitaring to the album feels far less embarrassing than singing along. With the help of [[Spike Jonze]], Weezer kept joy alive in [[arena rock]], making the critical repositioning of Weezer as some emo touchstone even more absentminded. They called themselves Weezer, knowingly, for chrissakes.<ref name=\"Pitchforklist\">{{cite web | last = DiCrescenzo | first = Brent | url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | title = Top 100 Albums of the 1990s | publisher = [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] | accessdate = 2007-09-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071023195032/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/36737-staff-list-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/page_8 | archivedate = October 23, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[NME]]'' claimed that the album \"pretty much invented emo's melodic wing\".<ref>{{cite web| last= Lewis| first= Luke| url= http://www.nme.com/reviews/weezer/10951 |title= Album review: Weezer \u2013 'Raditude'| website= [[NME]].com| date= November 2, 2009| access-date= March 6, 2011.</ref> [[AllMusic|AllMusic's]] Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a full 5/5 stars, explaining \"What makes the band so enjoyable is their charming geekiness; instead of singing about despair, they sing about love, which is kind of refreshing in the gloom-drenched world of '90s guitar-pop.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\n=== Accolades ===\nSince its release, the Blue Album has featured heavily in various \"must have\" lists compiled by the music media.

{"title_page": "Jeff Schneider (artist)", "text_new": "[[File:Jeff Schneider.jpg|thumb|Jeff Schneider]]\n\n'''Jeff Schneider''' (born 1960, Bethesda, Maryland) is an [[United States|American]] artist.\n\n== Life and work ==\n\nEarly on, Schneider showed a keen interest in photography often shooting and processing up to one hundred feet of black & white film a week. Growing increasingly tired of the representational aspects of photography, through darkroom manipulations, Schneider began to essentially abstract the \"objectivity\" of the camera lens. One of his professors at the [[University of South Florida]] suggested he enroll in a figure drawing and art theory class.  Not long after these initial steps into fine art, Schneider attended the 1980 Picasso Retrospective at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. This exhibition confirmed his desire to become an artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bring up the bodies \u2013 and have a good look at them Visual arts round-up|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/visual-art/bring-up-the-bodies-and-have-a-good-look-at-them-visual-arts-round-up-1.2230719|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter he received his BFA in 1983 from [[Miami University]], he worked as an Art Director in commercial design with the John K. Howe Company, painting at night in garages and basements until he acquired a studio in downtown Cincinnati. Soon after, he received a scholarship to the graduate painting program at the [[University of Cincinnati]]. Working with Robert Knipschild and Frank Herrmann he received his master's degree of Fine Art in 1989. Schneider moved to New York City in 1990 to pursue his career in art and quickly became an integral part of the vibrant painting scene there.\n\nEarly in New York, Schneider worked as a studio assistant for many of New York's most recognized artists, notably [[Moira Dryer]], [[Ron Gorchov]], [[Dorothea Rockburne]], [[Janet Fish]], [[Chuck Close]] and [[David Salle]]. By taking advantage of their generational perspectives, this allowed the young artist to see first hand the inner workings of not only their relevant studios but also the gallery system that these artist\u2019s worked within.<ref>{{cite web|title=Up For Grabs|url=http://allenprojectsonline.com/exhibits6.html}}</ref>\n\nHis early exhibitions included \"Presentational Painting\" curated by Sanford Wumfeld and Eileen Roaman at [[Hunter College]] and the \u201cEast-West Cultural Studies\u201d painting show curated by [[Robert Storr (art academic)|Robert Storr]], a relationship that led to numerous projects with Storr at the Museum of Modern Art.\nAs scenes shifted, Schneider began to show his work with a gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn formed by Leah Stuhltrager and Cris Dam, which would lead to three group exhibitions. Schneider\u2019s work was seen as \u201cA blending of male androgyny and American pop cultural\u201d his reference to the \"Cowboy Philosopher\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artforum.com/inprint/issue=198603&id=32473|title=artforum.com / in print|work=artforum.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>  \"...reinforced the patriarchal power dynamic juxtaposed with the sometimes vulnerable and otherwise unassuming female character.\u201d His canvases, \"...Sophisticatedly staged by the artist, draw on inferences through association in our society and culture.\" The narratives struck an accord in the Brooklyn art scene as Schneider continued to exhibit throughout the borough as well as, Manhattan. The relationship with the Dam Stuhltrager Gallery led to his first international exhibition in Madrid, Spain.

Growing increasingly tired of the representational aspects of photography, through darkroom manipulations, Schneider began to essentially abstract the \"objectivity\" of the camera lens. One of his professors at the [[University of South Florida]] suggested he enroll in a figure drawing and art theory class.  Not long after these initial steps into fine art, Schneider attended the 1980 Picasso Retrospective at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. This exhibition confirmed his desire to become an artist.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bring up the bodies \u2013 and have a good look at them Visual arts round-up|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/visual-art/bring-up-the-bodies-and-have-a-good-look-at-them-visual-arts-round-up-1.2230719|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter he received his BFA in 1983 from [[Miami University]], he worked as an Art Director in commercial design with the John K. Howe Company, painting at night in garages and basements until he acquired a studio in downtown Cincinnati. Soon after, he received a scholarship to the graduate painting program at the [[University of Cincinnati]]. Working with Robert Knipschild and Frank Herrmann he received his master's degree of Fine Art in 1989. Schneider moved to New York City in 1990 to pursue his career in art and quickly became an integral part of the vibrant painting scene there.\n\nEarly in New York, Schneider worked as a studio assistant for many of New York's most recognized artists, notably [[Moira Dryer]], [[Ron Gorchov]], [[Dorothea Rockburne]], [[Janet Fish]], [[Chuck Close]] and [[David Salle]]. By taking advantage of their generational perspectives, this allowed the young artist to see first hand the inner workings of not only their relevant studios but also the gallery system that these artist\u2019s worked within.<ref>{{cite web|title=Up For Grabs|url=http://allenprojectsonline.com/exhibits6.html}}</ref>\n\nHis early exhibitions included \"Presentational Painting\" curated by Sanford Wumfeld and Eileen Roaman at [[Hunter College]] and the \u201cEast-West Cultural Studies\u201d painting show curated by [[Robert Storr (art academic)|Robert Storr]], a relationship that led to numerous projects with Storr at the Museum of Modern Art.\nAs scenes shifted, Schneider began to show his work with a gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn formed by Leah Stuhltrager and Cris Dam, which would lead to three group exhibitions. Schneider\u2019s work was seen as \u201cA blending of male androgyny and American pop cultural\u201d his reference to the \"Cowboy Philosopher\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artforum.com/inprint/issue=198603&id=32473|title=artforum.com / in print|work=artforum.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>  \"...reinforced the patriarchal power dynamic juxtaposed with the sometimes vulnerable and otherwise unassuming female character.\u201d His canvases, \"...Sophisticatedly staged by the artist, draw on inferences through association in our society and culture.\" The narratives struck an accord in the Brooklyn art scene as Schneider continued to exhibit throughout the borough as well as, Manhattan. The relationship with the Dam Stuhltrager Gallery led to his first international exhibition in Madrid, Spain. Schneider, along with [[Loren Munk]], Cris Dam and [[William Powhida]] exhibited at Galeria ArteVeintiuno, curated by Javier Duero from the Museo Reina Sofia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Familiarity can breed surprise and delight|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/visual-art/familiarity-can-breed-surprise-and-delight-1.752427|publisher=The Irish Times}}</ref>\n\nAfter the exhibition in Madrid Schneider continued to focus on the European art scene which led to numerous exhibitions with Hillsboro Fine Art in Dublin, Ireland.

In order to play a medal game, a customer must first exchange their cash into medals (metal coins, much like an [[arcade token]]). The rate of medals versus cash varies from arcade to arcade, but usually the cheapest range is from [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]300 all the way up to \u00a510,000.  While many of the medal games simulate gambling, the medals cannot be traded back into cash, but only used to play more games, or exchanged (via paper tickets) for prizes.\n\nThere are many types of medal games, but the two most popular are the gambling type and the pusher game type.\n\n== Gambling type ==\nThe gambling type of medal games has two types of games, those that simulate a [[Las Vegas]] style [[casino]] (Electronic/Mechanical [[roulette]] tables, [[video poker]], video [[blackjack]], [[slot machine]]s, are all very common).\n\nThe other type is video [[horse racing]]. These are often set up in a quite lavish lounge set up, each player has a personal screen,  often with a padded chair, an ashtray and cup holders. All of these personal seats are in front of a very large screen displaying the virtual horse race.\n\nIn the Philippines, video horse racing is also known as \"video karera.\" These games are often raided by police as some proprietors try to evade taxes.\n\n{{anchor|Pusher}}\n\n== Pusher game type ==  \n[[File:Arcade Coin Pusher, detail.jpg|thumb|right|A pusher game in the UK, with both coins (in this case, [[Two pence (British decimal coin)|two pence pieces]]) and small prizes available to win]]\nThese games are characterized by multiple levels filled with medals or coins. Behind these platforms are mechanical \"brooms\" that push the coins forward. When a coin is dropped in, it falls onto one of the platforms and has the chance of pushing other coins (and possibly prizes placed on top of the coins) off the edge and being awarded to the player, unless they fall in the left and right 'lose' side of the edge. Timing in dropping the coin is a skill factor in the game.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, pusher games \u2014 often called \"penny falls\"<ref>https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-the-public/Safer-gambling/Consumer-guides/Quick-guide-fairs-and-fairgrounds.aspx</ref> \u2014 are very popular in arcades, and can often be found at tourist attractions such as theme parks and bowling alleys. Often, these machines use real coins rather than tokens (usually a low denomination such as the [[Two pence (British decimal coin)|2p]] or [[Ten pence (British decimal coin)|10p]]), but otherwise behave in the same way as games that operate with medals or tokens.\n\nVariations on the pusher game can be much more complex.  They often involve a [[Plinko]]-style<ref>A game where a player drops a chip through a sloped series of pegs.  This game is commonly played on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''</ref> chute that causes the coin to drop in which there are different slots the dropped medal can fall into, causing various in game effects.  Some slots may have the machine drop in more coins, others may initiate a video slot machine built into the machine.  From the video slot machine more coins and other bonuses can be awarded.  Many pusher games are connected to one another, some even with shared platforms, to form mega jackpots, sometimes as many as 100,000+ medals.  Sometimes a video mini game can be activated, in which coins must be dropped or rolled to hit specific targets, or buttons on the machine must be pressed in order to play.  For example, a mini game could involve pressing a star shaped button to make [[Mario]] jump and hit coin blocks, which could give coins.\n\nAnother aspect of the pusher games is that they are often themed on things targeted towards children, such as video game and cartoon characters.\n\n== List of games ==\n[[Image:PachinSlot.jpg|thumb|right|Pachin Slot, a medal game similar to a slot
