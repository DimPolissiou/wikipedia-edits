It has been described as a replacement to the 2011 rhythm video game ''[[Rocksmith]]'' rather than a sequel. The game's main focus is the feature that allows players to plug in virtually any [[electric guitar]] or [[bass guitar]] and play. It was announced at Ubisoft's 2013 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] presentation.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{See also|Rocksmith#Gameplay}}\n''Rocksmith 2014'' recommends the use of the \"Hercules\" adapter, a USB cable that connects to the standard {{frac|1|4}}&nbsp;in (6.35&nbsp;mm) output jack of most electric and bass guitars. Other guitars, such as acoustic guitars, may require additional hardware, such as a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rocksmith|url=http://rocksmith.ubi.com/rocksmith/en-US/home/|publisher=Ubisoft|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Rocksmith 2014'' offers three different development paths for lead, rhythm, and bass guitar respectively. It now includes the ability to set song difficulty, rather than having to play the song starting at the lowest difficulty, as in ''Rocksmith''.<ref name=\"ignrockingout\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/16/rocking-out-with-rocksmith-2014|title=Rocking out with Rocksmith 2014|last=Blevins|first=Tal|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}</ref> The game includes a Session Mode, which enables players to perform in [[jam sessions]] with the in-game musicians. Other new modes include an enhanced Master Mode to help with memory-playing and new Guitarcade minigames.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rocksmith 2014 Edition announced for October |date=June 10, 2013 |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/79615/rocksmith-2014-announced-for-october |work=[[shacknews.com]] |accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref> New missions have been added as a way to challenge and direct players towards areas they need to improve upon.<ref name=\"ignrockingout\" />\n\n''Rocksmith 2014'' is intended to be more of a teaching tool than the original game, featuring more than 85 lessons covering bends, accents, slides, and more.

He compared it to foreign language learning courses: \"This is not the second step in guitar playing. Some people might interpret it that way. If you see [[Spanish language|Spanish]] 1 and then Spanish 2, you think that you need to learn Spanish 1 first.\" He described ''Rocksmith 2014'' as a \"replacement\" for the original game rather than a sequel, and argued that its new songs, modes and improvements justified the purchase for people who had already bought the original ''Rocksmith''.<ref name=ign2014>{{Cite web  | last = Goldfarb  | first = Andrew  | title = Ubisoft Discusses Rocksmith, Just Dance 2014  |work=IGN | date = July 1, 2013  | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/01/ubisoft-discusses-rocksmith-just-dance-2014  | accessdate = July 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Rocksmith 2014 Edition \u2014 Remastered===\n\nOn 26 August 2016, Ubisoft announced ''Rocksmith 2014 Edition \u2014 Remastered'', an updated version of the game to be released on 4 October 2016. The new version includes \"a customizable learning curve, expanded practice tools, stat tracking, improved menus and more\". The ''Remastered'' version is a free update to existing versions of the game, but was also released at retail for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One with six additional songs. These six bonus songs have been released as [[Downloadable content|DLC]] for all other users.<ref name=\"polygon-remastered\">{{cite web|title=Rocksmith 2014 Remastered is a game coming out in 2016|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/25/12650392/rocksmith-2014-remastered-release-date-ps4-xbox-one-pc-mac|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 December 2016, Ubisoft released an additional patch for ''Rocksmith 2014 Edition \u2014 Remastered'', which added two new capabilities that removed the requirement for the Real-Tone Cable.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blog.ubi.com/rocksmith-now-supports-acoustic-guitars/|title=Rocksmith Now Supports Acoustic Guitars - UbiBlog - Ubisoft\u00ae|date=2016-12-13|newspaper=UbiBlog - Ubisoft\u00ae|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> The first capability added to the software was Microphone Mode, which allowed players to use USB microphones and input devices that could simulate microphones for both players of acoustic guitars, and electric guitar players using non-Real-Tone cables. While this mode allows for note detection with the software, it disables the ''Rocksmith 2014's'' Authentic Tone capabilities, and players are limited to the \"clean\" guitar sound captured by the software. The second capability added to the software allows players to play along with the note tracks without note detection enabled.\n\nIn April 2020, it was announced that Rocksmith 2014 would receive no further DLC after the [[Opeth]] song pack, as focus was shifting to a new project.<ref>https://theriffrepeater.com/rocksmith-announces-new-rocksmith-project-end-of-weekly-dlc/</ref>\n\n==Track list==\nThe game initially contains 66 playable tracks with over a thousand more available as [[List_of_downloadable_songs_for_Rocksmith|DLC]].\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

It has been described as a replacement to the 2011 rhythm video game ''[[Rocksmith]]'' rather than a sequel. The game's main focus is the feature that allows players to plug in virtually any [[electric guitar]] or [[bass guitar]] and play. It was announced at Ubisoft's 2013 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] presentation.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{See also|Rocksmith#Gameplay}}\n''Rocksmith 2014'' recommends the use of the \"Hercules\" adapter, a USB cable that connects to the standard {{frac|1|4}}&nbsp;in (6.35&nbsp;mm) output jack of most electric and bass guitars. Other guitars, such as acoustic guitars, may require additional hardware, such as a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rocksmith|url=http://rocksmith.ubi.com/rocksmith/en-US/home/|publisher=Ubisoft|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Rocksmith 2014'' offers three different development paths for lead, rhythm, and bass guitar respectively. It now includes the ability to set song difficulty, rather than having to play the song starting at the lowest difficulty, as in ''Rocksmith''.<ref name=\"ignrockingout\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/16/rocking-out-with-rocksmith-2014|title=Rocking out with Rocksmith 2014|last=Blevins|first=Tal|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=August 19, 2013}}</ref> The game includes a Session Mode, which enables players to perform in [[jam sessions]] with the in-game musicians.

He compared it to foreign language learning courses: \"This is not the second step in guitar playing. Some people might interpret it that way. If you see [[Spanish language|Spanish]] 1 and then Spanish 2, you think that you need to learn Spanish 1 first.\" He described ''Rocksmith 2014'' as a \"replacement\" for the original game rather than a sequel, and argued that its new songs, modes and improvements justified the purchase for people who had already bought the original ''Rocksmith''.<ref name=ign2014>{{Cite web  | last = Goldfarb  | first = Andrew  | title = Ubisoft Discusses Rocksmith, Just Dance 2014  |work=IGN | date = July 1, 2013  | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/01/ubisoft-discusses-rocksmith-just-dance-2014  | accessdate = July 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Rocksmith 2014 Edition \u2014 Remastered===\n\nOn 26 August 2016, Ubisoft announced ''Rocksmith 2014 Edition \u2014 Remastered'', an updated version of the game to be released on 4 October 2016. The new version includes \"a customizable learning curve, expanded practice tools, stat tracking, improved menus and more\". The ''Remastered'' version is a free update to existing versions of the game, but was also released at retail for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One with six additional songs. These six bonus songs have been released as [[Downloadable content|DLC]] for all other users.<ref name=\"polygon-remastered\">{{cite web|title=Rocksmith 2014 Remastered is a game coming out in 2016|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/8/25/12650392/rocksmith-2014-remastered-release-date-ps4-xbox-one-pc-mac|website=Polygon|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 December 2016, Ubisoft released an additional patch for ''Rocksmith 2014 Edition \u2014 Remastered'', which added two new capabilities that removed the requirement for the Real-Tone Cable.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://blog.ubi.com/rocksmith-now-supports-acoustic-guitars/|title=Rocksmith Now Supports Acoustic Guitars - UbiBlog - Ubisoft\u00ae|date=2016-12-13|newspaper=UbiBlog - Ubisoft\u00ae|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> The first capability added to the software was Microphone Mode, which allowed players to use USB microphones and input devices that could simulate microphones for both players of acoustic guitars, and electric guitar players using non-Real-Tone cables. While this mode allows for note detection with the software, it disables the ''Rocksmith 2014's'' Authentic Tone capabilities, and players are limited to the \"clean\" guitar sound captured by the software. The second capability added to the software allows players to play along with the note tracks without note detection enabled.\n\nIn April 2020, it was announced that Rocksmith 2014 would receive no further DLC after the Opeth song pack, as focus was shifting to a new project.<ref>https://theriffrepeater.com/rocksmith-announces-new-rocksmith-project-end-of-weekly-dlc/</ref>\n\n==Track list==\nThe game initially contains 66 playable tracks with over a thousand more available as [[List_of_downloadable_songs_for_Rocksmith|DLC]].\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection published in 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|''The Net'']] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953.<ref>Pendo, Stephen.

He was the book critic for [[The Daily Express]] from 1945 and with the ''[[News Review]]'' from 1948 to 1950. He then shifted into publishing, as a director and literary adviser to Evans Brothers, Ltd (1950-1953) and Putnam & Co Ltd (1953-1963). In 1953 he wrote the documentary [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238961/   ''Elizabeth is Queen''] for [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British Path\u00e9]], which received a [[BAFTA]] award. His later poetry, from the collection ''Spill Out'' (1967), took on a more ironic stance, but still vernacular rather than academic, a period reflected in his second Selected Poems collection published in 1973. One of his book blurbs describes him as \"a poet who just missed being an intellectual\".<ref name=white/> Of his novels, ''The Net'' (1952, set in an aeronautical research station) and ''Thin Air'' (1961) were well received.<ref name=times/> [[The Net (1953 film)|''The Net'']] was filmed by director [[Anthony Asquith]] in 1953. His children's books, including the 'Fred and I' series (''Monday Adventure'' etc), and the Hartwarp adventures for younger children, were popular and sold well in the 1950s and 1960s, but haven't remained in print. Between 1949 and 1963 he edited an annual anthology called ''Pick of Today's Short Stories''.\n\n==Private Life==\nOn 30 October 1934 Pudney married Crystal Selwyn Herbert, the daughter of [[A. P. Herbert]], the writer and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] [[Member of Parliament]]. They had two daughters and a son, but were divorced. In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]]. She helped him recover from his alcoholism, to which he publicly confessed in 1965 and emerged cured in 1967. That process became a subject for his writing. In 1976 he developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.<ref name=dnb/> His grandson [[Toby Perkins]] is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''Spring Encounter'' (1933)\n*''Open the Sky'' ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*''Dispersal Point and other Air Poems'' (1942)\n*''The Grass Grew All Round'' (1942)\n*''Beyond This Disregard'' (1943) poems\n*''South of Forty'' (1943) poems\n*''Ten Summers'': Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*''Almanack of Hope'': Sonnets (1944)\n*''Air Force Poetry'' (1944) (anthology, edited with Henry Treese)\n*''Flight above Cloud'' (1944)\n*''World Still There'' (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*''Low Life'' (1947)\n*''Commemorations'' (1948)\n*''Sixpenny Songs'' (1953)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*''Spill Out'': Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*''Spandrels'': Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*''Take This Orange'': Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*''Living in a One-Sided House'' (1976) poems\n*''Writers' Workshop'', poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.

It serves as an epilogue to the 2013\u20132019 original series ''[[Steven Universe]]'' and its follow-up 2019 animated film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]''. It premiered on December 7, 2019 and concluded on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe series focuses on the aftermath of the events of ''Steven Universe'', where humans and Gems coexist in harmony after the end of the war between the Crystal Gems and Homeworld. Without the threats of the Diamonds or corrupted Gems, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] must deal with the everyday challenges that still come with his now relatively peaceful life, and question his new life objectives.\n\nLike the original series, ''Steven Universe Future'' has been critically acclaimed, with the design, music, voice acting, characterization, and prominence of [[LGBT]] themes being similarly praised; ''Future'' has been singled out for addressing issues some had with the original series, for its unique choice of focusing on the aftermath of the main story's climax, and for promoting mental health awareness through its treatment of Steven's experience of [[psychological trauma]].\n\n==Premise and synopsis==\nThe series is set after the events of ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', which itself takes place two years after the ''Steven Universe'' series finale \"[[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|Change Your Mind]]\". In \"Change Your Mind\", teenage protagonist [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] persuaded the Diamonds, the rulers of the intergalactic Gem empire, to cease their abusive, imperialist ways, and to heal the monstrous corrupted Gems that had been menacing the planet Earth. Now, Steven and his friends and family, the Crystal Gems, have constructed Little Homeworld, a community on Earth where humans and Gems can live in harmony. Steven now dedicates his time to inviting Gems to come to Little Homeworld, and educating those who do on how to find their new place in the galaxy.\n\n''Steven Universe Future'' follows Steven's everyday life trying to help Gems find new purpose; it also depicts the disappointments he faces with his new life, including the realization that there are things he cannot fix, and his own feelings of aimlessness after successfully liberating the Gem empire.

Like the original series and ''Steven Universe: The Movie'', the characterization, themes, animation, voice acting, music, and [[LGBT]] representation have been widely praised; ''Future'' in particular is praised for its new ways of exploring previously developed themes (in particular Steven's dedication to solve other characters' problems), and its unconventional choice of focusing on the smaller-scale aftermath of the main storyline. Reviewers have pointed out that it addresses issues several fans and reviewers had with the original series, such as its perceived tendency to solve characters' problems in overly simple ways and to redeem all antagonists.\n\nCaroline Cao of ''[[Slashfilm|/Film]]'' called ''Steven Universe Future'' \"a messy and beautiful tale of trauma, healing, and survival\", stating: \"Sugar and her team are the greatest visual maximalists in animation, pushing imageries to their most emotional and thematic extremes\u2014particularly through the inventiveness of the flexible Fusion metaphor\u2014and unraveling difficult revelations about surviving trauma.\" She praised the exploration of Steven's tendency to help other people with their problems, claiming that \"Steven faces the reoccurring lesson of 'biting more than you can chew.' Steven wants to heal everyone, anything, but falls short, and even unleashes destruction at times. As Future moves forward, Steven will contend with his own management of the new world order he has created, and his mother\u2019s past will continue to haunt his future. Then there's the matter of Steven's newest Gem power that manifests through his rage and insecurities. ''Steven Universe Future'' is on a roll in delivering hard and relevant messages about victimhood and survivorhood solidarity. There are kids and adults alike who need someone to tell them 'I'm sorry for not believing you'.\"<ref name=SlashMessyBeautiful>{{cite web |title=\u2018Steven Universe Future\u2019 Review: A Messy and Beautiful Tale of Trauma, Healing, and Survival |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/steven-universe-future-review/ |publisher=[[Slashfilm|/Film]] |date=December 12, 2019 |accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Mary Sue]]'' called ''Steven Universe Future'' \"fantastic\", praising \"the amazing storytelling\" and the \"beautiful\" animation.<ref name=MarySueFutureFantastic>{{cite web |title=Steven Universe Future Is Fantastic |url=https://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-future-is-fantastic/ |publisher=[[The Mary Sue]] |date=January 3, 2020 |accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref> Reuben Baron of [[Comic Book Resources|CBR]] praised the series for \"challenging Steven's savior mentality\", stating that the first four episodes were \"developing a clear thematic throughline.

It wasn't just that she was inexperienced, but rather she was inexperienced, dangerous, and all too capable of letting her powers run wild in ways that would actively harm others. [...] You see just how Not Over\u2122 Pink basically all of the Gems still are. Pink's legacy is one of the lasting, seemingly unending sadness that the other Gems are attempting to work through. The majority of them don't feel much ill will toward her, but she's still hurting them in ways that only the dead and dearly missed can. There are Gems like Spinel who have all the reasons in the galaxy to hate Pink, but that's not really where any of the people in the series are coming from. Rather, everyone's in different stages of mourning and not a single one of them can really be sure if and when the pain they're dealing with is going to go away.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Pink Diamond Was the Villain of the Decade |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/pink-diamond-was-the-villain-of-the-decade-1840727622 |publisher=[[The Mary Sue]] |date=December 31, 2019 |accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of Shep, a [[Non-binary gender|non-binary]] character who appears in the episode \"Little Graduation\" and is played by non-binary actor [[Indya Moore]], received attention from various outlets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pose star Indya Moore is playing a non-binary character in Steven Universe and we have no moral choice but to stan |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/01/03/indya-moore-steven-universe-future-shep-non-binary-character/ |first=Reiss |last=Smith |publisher=[[PinkNews]] |date=January 3, 2020 |accessdate=January 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=GayTimesMooreJoins>{{cite web |title=Indya Moore joins the cast of Steven Universe as new non-binary character |url=https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/131101/indya-moore-joins-the-cast-of-steven-universe-as-new-non-binary-character/ |publisher=[[Gay Times]] |last=Moore |first=Matt |date=January 5, 2020 |access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref> ''The Mary Sue'' stated that with ''Future'', ''Steven Universe'' \"continues to be one of the most wonderfully diverse shows on television.

It serves as an epilogue to the 2013\u20132019 original series ''[[Steven Universe]]'' and its followup 2019 animated film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]''. It premiered on December 7, 2019 and concluded on March 27, 2020.\n\nThe series focuses on the aftermath of the events of ''Steven Universe'', where humans and Gems coexist in harmony after the end of the war between the Crystal Gems and Homeworld. Without the threats of the Diamonds or corrupted Gems, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] must deal with the everyday challenges that still come with his now relatively peaceful life, and question his new life objectives.\n\nLike the original series, ''Steven Universe Future'' has been critically acclaimed, with the design, music, voice acting, characterization, and prominence of [[LGBT]] themes being similarly praised; ''Future'' has been singled out for addressing issues some had with the original series, for its unique choice of focusing on the aftermath of the main story's climax, and for promoting mental health awareness through its treatment of Steven's experience of [[psychological trauma]].\n\n==Premise and synopsis==\nThe series is set after the events of ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', which itself takes place two years after the ''Steven Universe'' series finale \"[[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|Change Your Mind]]\". In \"Change Your Mind\", teenage protagonist [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven]] persuaded the Diamonds, the rulers of the intergalactic Gem empire, to cease their abusive, imperialist ways, and to heal the monstrous corrupted Gems that had been menacing the planet Earth. Now, Steven and his friends and family, the Crystal Gems, have constructed Little Homeworld, a community on Earth where humans and Gems can live in harmony. Steven now dedicates his time to inviting Gems to come to Little Homeworld, and educating those who do on how to find their new place in the galaxy.\n\n''Steven Universe Future'' follows Steven's everyday life trying to help Gems find new purpose; it also depicts the disappointments he faces with his new life, including the realization that there are things he cannot fix, and his own feelings of aimlessness after successfully liberating the Gem empire. He confronts old foes who are looking for revenge, tries to master a new power that he doesn't fully understand, and is challenged to decide what he wants for his own future.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n{{see also|List of Steven Universe characters}}\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Zach Callison]] as [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]], Onion, Cactus Steven, and Jingle Singer\n* [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]] as [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]]\n* [[Michaela Dietz]] as [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]], and other Quartz Gems\n* [[Deedee Magno Hall]] as [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]], Volleyball, Shell, Brandish, and other Pearls\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Tom Scharpling]] as Greg Universe\n* [[Grace Rolek]] as Connie Maheswaran\n* [[Charlyne Yi]] as Ruby, Eyeball, and other Rubies\n* [[Erica Luttrell]] as Sapphire\n* [[Shelby Rabara]] as Peridot\n* [[Jennifer Paz]] as Lapis Lazuli and other Lapises\n* Miriam Hyman as Bismuth\n* [[Kimberly Brooks]] as Jasper and other Quartz gems\n* [[Sarah Stiles]] as Spinel\n* [[Christine Ebersole]] as White Diamond\n* [[Patti LuPone]] as Yellow Diamond\n* [[Lisa Hannigan]] as Blue Diamond\n* Michelle Maryk as Larimar\n* [[Dee Bradley Baker]] as Lion\n\n===Guest===\n* [[Uzo Aduba]] as Bismuth (\u201cBismuth Casual\u201d) and Khadijah\n* [[Matthew Moy]] as Lars Barriga\n* [[Kate Micucci]] as Sadie Miller\n* [[Reagan Gomez-Preston]] as Jenny Pizza\n* [[Brian Posehn]] as Sour Cream\n* [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] as Priyanka Maheswaran\n* Lamar Abrams as Wy-Six, Jaime, and Daniel\n* [[Indya Moore]] as Shep\n* Johnny Hawkes as Rodrigo and Cookie Cat\n* [[Marieve Herington]] as Jasmine\n* Tahani Anderson as Patricia\n* [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] as Snowflake Obsidian\n* [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Smoky Quartz\n* Alastair James as Rainbow Quartz 2.0\n* Shoniqua Shandai as Sunstone\n* [[Christine Pedi]] as Holly Blue Agate\n* Della Saba as Aquamarine\n* Larissa Gallagher as Bluebird Azurite\n* Chris Jai Alex as Drew the Dog and Announcer\n* [[Jemaine Clement]] as Kerry Moonbeam<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2020/03/20/steven-universe-future-rebecca-sugar-interview-mr-universe-fragments/|title=Steven Universe Future: Rebecca Sugar Talks \"Mr. Universe\" and \"Fragments\"|website=TV Shows|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n* [[Susan Egan]] as Pink Diamond (archive audio)\n\n== Production ==\nAccording to Rebecca Sugar, when she was notified in 2016 that ''Steven Universe'' would be canceled after the end of the fifth season, she prevailed upon Cartoon Network to allow her to produce the followup film, ''Steven Universe: The Movie''.

Like the original series and ''Steven Universe: The Movie'', the characterization, themes, animation, voice acting, music, and [[LGBT]] representation have been widely praised; ''Future'' in particular is praised for its new ways of exploring previously developed themes (in particular Steven's dedication to solve other characters' problems), and its unconventional choice of focusing on the smaller-scale aftermath of the main storyline. Reviewers have pointed out that it addresses issues several fans and reviewers had with the original series, such as its perceived tendency to solve characters' problems in overly simple ways and to redeem all antagonists.\n\nCaroline Cao of ''[[Slashfilm|/Film]]'' called ''Steven Universe Future'' \"a messy and beautiful tale of trauma, healing, and survival\", stating: \"Sugar and her team are the greatest visual maximalists in animation, pushing imageries to their most emotional and thematic extremes\u2014particularly through the inventiveness of the flexible Fusion metaphor\u2014and unraveling difficult revelations about surviving trauma.\" She praised the exploration of Steven's tendency to help other people with their problems, claiming that \"Steven faces the reoccurring lesson of 'biting more than you can chew.' Steven wants to heal everyone, anything, but falls short, and even unleashes destruction at times. As Future moves forward, Steven will contend with his own management of the new world order he has created, and his mother\u2019s past will continue to haunt his future. Then there's the matter of Steven's newest Gem power that manifests through his rage and insecurities. ''Steven Universe Future'' is on a roll in delivering hard and relevant messages about victimhood and survivorhood solidarity.

It wasn't just that she was inexperienced, but rather she was inexperienced, dangerous, and all too capable of letting her powers run wild in ways that would actively harm others. [...] You see just how Not Over\u2122 Pink basically all of the Gems still are. Pink's legacy is one of the lasting, seemingly unending sadness that the other Gems are attempting to work through.
