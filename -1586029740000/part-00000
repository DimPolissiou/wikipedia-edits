Before the arrival of monocultures of ryegrass, both grass [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ley leys] and permanent pasture always contained ''A. millefolium'' at a rate of about 0.3&nbsp;kg/ha. At least one of the reasons for its inclusion in grass mixtures was its deep roots, with leaves rich in minerals. Thus its inclusion helped to prevent mineral deficiencies in the ruminants to which it was fed.\n\nIt was introduced into New Zealand as a drought-tolerant pasture.

{"title_page": "ITU prefix", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2009}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\nThe [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) allocates [[call sign|call sign prefix]]es for [[radio station|radio]] and [[television station|television]] stations of all types. They also form the basis for, but do not exactly match, [[aircraft registration]] identifiers. These prefixes are agreed upon internationally, and are a form of [[country code]]. A call sign can be any number of letters and numerals but each country must only use call signs that begin with the characters allocated for use in that country.\n\nA few countries do not fully comply with these rules. Australian broadcast stations officially have\u2014but do not use\u2014the VL prefix, and Canada uses Chile's CB for its own [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] stations. This is through a special agreement<ref>http://www.trentu.ca/org/trentradio/ic/bpr01.htm</ref> with the government of [[Chile]], which is officially assigned the CB prefix.\n\nWith regard to the second and/or third letters in the prefixes in the list below, if the country in question is allocated all callsigns with A to Z in that position, then that country can also use call signs with the digits 0 to 9 in that position. For example, the [[United States]] is assigned KA&ndash;KZ, and therefore can also use prefixes like KW0 or K1.\n\nMany large countries in turn have internal rules on how and where specific subsets of their callsigns can be used (such as Mexico's XE for AM and XH for FM radio and television broadcasting), which are not covered here.\n\n==Unallocated and unavailable call sign prefixes==\n{{further|Non-ITU prefix}}\n'''Unallocated:''' The following call sign prefixes are available for future allocation by the ITU.

signs]]\n[[Category:Amateur radio call signs]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2009}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\nThe [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) allocates [[call sign|call sign prefix]]es for [[radio station|radio]] and [[television station|television]] stations of all types. They also form the basis for, but do not exactly match, [[aircraft registration]] identifiers. These prefixes are agreed upon internationally, and are a form of [[country code]]. A call sign can be any number of letters and numerals but each country must only use call signs that begin with the characters allocated for use in that country.\n\nA few countries do not fully comply with these rules. Australian broadcast stations officially have\u2014but do not use\u2014the VL prefix, and Canada uses Chile's CB for its own [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] stations. This is through a special agreement<ref>http://www.trentu.ca/org/trentradio/ic/bpr01.htm</ref> with the government of [[Chile]], which is officially assigned the CB prefix.\n\nWith regard to the second and/or third letters in the prefixes in the list below, if the country in question is allocated all callsigns with A to Z in that position, then that country can also use call signs with the digits 0 to 9 in that position. For example, the [[United States]] is assigned KA&ndash;KZ, and therefore can also use prefixes like KW0 or K1.\n\nMany large countries in turn have internal rules on how and where specific subsets of their callsigns can be used (such as Mexico's XE for AM and XH for FM radio and television broadcasting), which are not covered here.\n\n==Unallocated and unavailable call sign prefixes==\n{{further|Non-ITU prefix}}\n'''Unallocated:''' The following call sign prefixes are available for future allocation by the ITU.

In France, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are tending to be replaced by {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} in many people's speech, but the distinction of {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} is present in [[Meridional French]]. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are present.\n* Voiced stops (i.e., {{IPA|/b, d, \u0261/}}) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.\n* Voiceless stops (i.e., {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}) are unaspirated.\n* The velar nasal {{IPA|/\u014b/}} can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: ''parking, camping, swing''. The palatal nasal {{IPA|/\u0272/}} can occur in word initial position (e.g., ''gnon''), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., ''montagne'').\n* French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental {{IPA|/f/~/v/}}, dental {{IPA|/s/~/z/}}, and palato-alveolar {{IPA|/\u0283/~/\u0292/}}. {{IPA|/s/~/z/}} are dental, like the plosives {{IPA|/t/~/d/}} and the nasal {{IPA|/n/}}.\n* French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a [[voiced uvular fricative]], as in {{IPA|[\u0281u]}} ''{{wiktfr|roue}}'', \"wheel\". Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., ''fort''), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill {{IPA|[r]}} occurs in some dialects.\n* Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}} is unvelarised in both onset (''lire'') and coda position (''il''). In the onset, the central approximants {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[\u0265]}}, and {{IPA|[j]}} each correspond to a high vowel, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/y/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} respectively. There are a few [[minimal pair]]s where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur in final position as in {{IPA|/p\u025bj/}} ''{{wiktfr|paye}}'', \"pay\", vs. {{IPA|/p\u025bi/}} ''{{wiktfr|pays}}'', \"country\".\n\nFrench pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:\n* Final single consonants, in particular ''s'', ''x'', ''z'', ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''g,'' are normally silent. (A consonant is considered \"final\" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters ''f'', ''k'', ''q'', and ''l'', however, are normally pronounced. The final '''c''' is sometimes pronounced like in '''bac''', '''sac''', '''roc''' but can also be silent like in '''blanc''' or '''estomac'''. The final ''r'' is usually silent when it follows an ''e'' in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (''hiver'', ''super'', ''cancer'' etc.).\n** When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant ''may'' once again be pronounced, to provide a ''[[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]]'' or \"link\" between the two words. Some liaisons are ''mandatory'', for example the ''s'' in ''les amants'' or ''vous avez''; some are ''optional'', depending on [[dialect]] and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], for example, the first ''s'' in ''deux cents euros'' or ''euros irlandais''; and some are ''forbidden'', for example, the ''s'' in ''beaucoup d'hommes aiment''. The ''t'' of ''et'' is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in [[set phrase]]s like ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n** Doubling a final ''n'' and adding a silent ''e'' at the end of a word (e.g., ''chien'' \u2192 ''chienne'') makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final ''l'' and adding a silent ''e'' (e.g., ''gentil'' \u2192 ''gentille'') adds a [j] sound if the ''l'' is preceded by the letter ''i''.\n* Some monosyllabic function words ending in ''a'' or ''e'', such as ''je'' and ''que'', drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., ''*je ai'' is instead pronounced and spelled \u2192 ''j'ai''). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for ''l'homme qu'il a vu'' (\"the man whom he saw\") and ''l'homme qui l'a vu'' (\"the man who saw him\"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as \"qu'il-a\", while the second breaks as \"qui-l'a\". It can also be noted that, in [[Quebec French]], the second example (''l'homme qui l'a vu'') is more emphasized on ''l'a vu''.\n\n==Writing system==\n\n===Alphabet===\n{{Main|French alphabet|French braille}}\n\nFrench is written with the 26 letters of the basic [[Latin script]], with four diacritics appearing on vowels ([[circumflex]] accent, [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and the [[cedilla]] appearing in \"\u00e7\".\n\nThere are two [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], \"\u0153\" and \"\u00e6\", but they are now often not used because of the layout of the most common keyboards used in French-speaking countries. Yet, they cannot be changed to \"oe\" and \"ae\" in formal and literary texts.\n\n===Orthography===\n{{Main|French orthography|Reforms of French orthography}}\n\nFrench spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as \"debt\"):\n* Old French ''doit'' > French ''doigt'' \"finger\" (Latin ''digitus'')\n* Old French ''pie'' > French ''pied'' \"foot\" [Latin ''pes'' (stem: ''ped-'')]\n\nFrench is a [[Morphophonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] language. While it contains 130 [[grapheme]]s that denote only 36 [[phoneme]]s, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/uA31|title=The contribution of morphological awareness to the spelling of morphemes and morphologically complex words in French|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one-to-one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme, which can be seen in how ''tomber'' and ''tomb\u00e9'' both end with the /e/ phoneme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brissaud|first=Catherine|last2=Chevrot|first2=Jean-Pierre|title=The late acquisition of a major difficulty of French inflectional orthography: The homophonic /E/ verbal endings|journal=Writing Systems Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=129\u201344|doi=10.1093/wsr/wsr003|year=2011|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00785731/file/Brissaud_Chevrot_2011_.pdf}}</ref> Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the ''x'' in ''paix'' is not pronounced though at the end of ''Aix'' it is''.''\n\nAs a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see [[Liaison (French)]]). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: ''pied'', ''aller'', ''les'', ''{{lang|fr|finit}}'', ''beaux''. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: ''beaux-arts'', ''les amis'', ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n\nFrench writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for ''animal'' was ''animals''. The {{IPA|/als/}} sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong {{IPA|/aus/}}. This change was then reflected in the orthography: ''animaus''. The ''us'' ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter ''x'', resulting in a written form ''animax''. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of ''au'' turned into {{IPA|/o/}} so that the ''u'' was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French ''animaux'' (pronounced first {{IPA|/animos/}} before the final {{IPA|/s/}} was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for ''cheval'' pluralized as ''chevaux'' and many others. In addition, ''castel'' pl. ''castels'' became ''ch\u00e2teau'' pl. ''ch\u00e2teaux''.\n* [[Nasal vowel|Nasal]]: ''[[n]]'' and ''m''. When ''n'' or ''m'' follows a vowel or diphthong, the ''n'' or ''m'' becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the ''n'' or ''m'' is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes ''en-'' and ''em-'' are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.\n* [[digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]]: French uses not only [[diacritic]]s to specify its large range of vowel sounds and [[diphthongs]], but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.\n* [[Consonant length|Gemination]]: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, ''illusion'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ilyzj\u0254\u0303]}} and not {{IPA|[il\u02d0yzj\u0254\u0303]}}. But gemination does occur between words. For example, ''une info'' (\"a news item\" or \"a piece of information\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u025b\u0303fo]}}, whereas ''une nympho'' (\"a nymphomaniac\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u02d0\u025b\u0303fo]}}.\n* [[Diacritic|Accents]] are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.\n** Accents that affect pronunciation\n*** The [[acute accent]] (''l'accent aigu'') ''\u00e9'' (e.g., '''''\u00e9'''cole''\u2014school) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[grave accent]] (''l'accent grave'') ''\u00e8'' (e.g., ''\u00e9l'''\u00e8'''ve''\u2014pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[circumflex]] (''l'accent circonflexe'') ''\u00ea'' (e.g. ''for'''\u00ea'''t''\u2014forest) shows that an ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and that an ''\u00f4'' is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}}. In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/\u0251/}} for the letter ''\u00e2'', but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of ''s'' after a vowel, where that letter ''s'' was not pronounced. Thus, ''forest'' became ''for\u00eat'', ''hospital'' became ''h\u00f4pital'', and ''hostel'' became ''h\u00f4tel''.\n*** [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|Diaeresis]] or ''tr\u00e9ma'' (''\u00eb'', ''\u00ef'', ''\u00fc'', ''\u00ff''): over ''e'', ''i'', ''u'' or ''y'',  indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: ''na\u00efve'', ''No\u00ebl''.\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''o'' (''N'''o\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|\u0254\u025b|}}) is nasalized in the regular way if followed by ''n'' (''[[Samo\u00ebns|Sam'''o\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|w\u025b\u0303|}})\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''a'' is either pronounced {{IPA-fr|\u025b|}} (''Raph'''a\u00eb'''l'', ''Isr'''a\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|a\u025b|}}) or not pronounced, leaving only the ''a'' (''[[Madame de Sta\u00ebl|St'''a\u00eb'''l]]'' {{IPA-fr|a|}}) and the ''a'' is nasalized in the regular way if ''a\u00eb'' is followed by ''n'' (''[[Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-S'''a\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303|}})\n****A diaeresis on ''y'' only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts. Some proper names in which ''\u00ff'' appears include ''[[A\u00ff]]'' (commune in ''d\u00e9partement de la [[Marne (department)|Marne]]'', formerly ''A\u00ff-Champagne''), ''Rue des Clo\u00ffs'' (alley in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]]), ''Cro\u00ff'' (family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail, Paris), ''[[:fr:Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff|Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff]]'' (near [[Joigny]]), ''Gh\u00ffs'' (name of Flemish origin spelt ''Gh\u0133s'' where ''\u0133'' in handwriting looked like ''\u00ff'' to French clerks), ''[[L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses]]'' (commune between Paris and [[Orly]] airport), [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]] (author), [[Mo\u00ff-de-l'Aisne]] (commune in '' d\u00e9partement de l'[[Aisne (department)|Aisne]]'' and family name), and ''Le Blanc de Nicola\u00ff'' (an insurance company in eastern France).\n****The diaeresis on ''u'' appears in the Biblical proper names ''Arch\u00e9la\u00fcs'', ''Capharna\u00fcm'', ''Emma\u00fcs'', ''\u00c9sa\u00fc'', and ''Sa\u00fcl'', as well as French names such as [[Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy|Ha\u00fcy]]. Nevertheless, since the 1990 orthographic changes, the diaeresis in words containing ''gu\u00eb'' (such as ''aigu\u00eb'' or ''cigu\u00eb'') may be moved onto the ''u'': ''aig\u00fce'', ''cig\u00fce'', and by analogy may be used in verbs such as ''j'arg\u00fce''.\n****In addition, words coming from German retain their umlaut (''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') if applicable but use often French pronunciation, such as ''K\u00e4rcher'' (trademark of a pressure washer).\n*** The [[cedilla]] (''la c\u00e9dille'') ''\u00e7'' (e.g., ''gar'''\u00e7'''on''\u2014boy) means that the letter ''\u00e7'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the back vowels ''a'', ''o'' and ''u'' (''c'' is otherwise {{IPA|/k/}} before a back vowel). ''C'' is always pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the front vowels ''e'', ''i'', and ''y'', thus ''\u00e7'' is never found in front of front vowels.\n** Accents with no pronunciation effect\n*** The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters ''i'' or ''u'', nor, in most dialects, ''a''. It usually indicates that an ''s'' came after it long ago, as in ''\u00eele'' (''isle'', compare with English ''island'')<!-- [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Rapport_du_Conseil_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise_sur_les_rectifications_orthographiques_de_1990#Accent_circonflexe_.28II.4.29] -->. The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, ''dites'' (you say) / ''d\u00eetes'' (you said), or even ''du'' (of the) / ''d\u00fb'' (past participle for the verb ''devoir'' = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).\n*** All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs ''l\u00e0'' and ''o\u00f9'' (\"there\", \"where\") from the article ''la'' (\"the\" feminine singular) and the conjunction ''ou'' (\"or\"), respectively.\n\nSome proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://fonetik.fr/index-en.html Fon\u00e9tik.fr writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://sites.google.com/site/ortofasil/ Ortofasil writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.alfograf.net/ Alfograf writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://ortograf.net/ Ortograf.net writing system proposal].</ref>\n\nIn 1990, a [[Reforms of French orthography|reform]] accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35496893|title=End of the circumflex? Changes in French spelling cause uproar|date=2016-02-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|French grammar}}\nFrench is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caffarel|first1=Alice|last2=Martin|first2=J.R.|last3=Matthiessen|first3=Christian M.I.M|title=Language Typology: A Functional Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia}}</ref>\n\nFrench grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including\n* the loss of [[Latin declension]]s\n* the loss of the neuter gender\n* the development of grammatical [[article (grammar)|articles]] from Latin [[demonstrative]]s\n* the loss of certain Latin [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and the creation of new tenses from auxiliaries.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nEvery French [[noun]] is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is a \"enseignant\" while a female teacher is a \"enseignante\". However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be \"enseignants\". A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be \"enseignants\". In many situations, and in the case of \"enseignant\", both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular \"le professeur\" or \"la professeur(e)\" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural \"les professeurs\" because \"le\", \"la\", and \"les\" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, \"le dentiste\" refers to a male dentist while \"la dentiste\" refers to a female dentist.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Main|French verbs}}\n\n==== Moods and tense-aspect forms ====\nThe French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the [[indicative mood]] (indicatif), the [[subjunctive mood]] (subjonctif), the [[imperative mood]] (imp\u00e9ratif), and the [[conditional mood]] (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the [[infinitive]] mood (infinitif), the [[present participle]] (participe pr\u00e9sent), and the [[past participle]] (participe pass\u00e9).\n\n===== Finite moods =====\n\n====== Indicative (Indicatif) ======\nThe indicative mood makes use of eight tense-aspect forms. These include the [[Present tense|present]] (pr\u00e9sent), the [[simple past]] ([[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]] and [[pass\u00e9 simple]]), the [[past imperfective]] ([[imparfait]]), the [[pluperfect]] ([[plus-que-parfait]]), the [[simple future]] ([[futur simple]]), the [[future perfect]] ([[futur ant\u00e9rieur]]), and the [[past perfect]] (pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used while the pass\u00e9 simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur seen in literary works.\n\nWithin the indicative mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, plus-que-parfait, futur ant\u00e9rieur, and pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Indicatif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 simple\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimons\n|j'aimais\n|nous aimions\n|j'ai aim\u00e9\n|nous avons aim\u00e9\n|j'aimai\n|nous aim\u00e2mes\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimez\n|tu aimais\n|vous aimiez\n|tu as aim\u00e9\n|vous avez aim\u00e9\n|tu aimas\n|vous aim\u00e2tes\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aimait\n|ils/elles aimaient\n|il/elle a aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles ont aim\u00e9\n|il/elle aima\n|ils/elles aim\u00e8rent\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" |\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur simple\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur ant\u00e9rieur\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aimerai\n|nous aimerons\n|j'aurai aim\u00e9\n|nous aurons aim\u00e9\n|j'avais aim\u00e9\n|nous avions aim\u00e9\n|j'eus aim\u00e9\n|nous e\u00fbmes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimeras\n|vous aimerez\n|tu auras aim\u00e9\n|vous aurez aim\u00e9\n|tu avais aim\u00e9\n|vous aviez aim\u00e9\n|tu eus aim\u00e9\n|vous e\u00fbtes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aimera\n|ils/elles aimeront\n|il/elle aura aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles auront aim\u00e9\n|il/elle avais aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles avaient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle eut aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eurent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Subjunctive (Subjonctif) ======\nThe subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).\n\nWithin the subjunctive mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Subjonctif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimions\n|j'aimasse\n|nous aimassions\n|j'aie aim\u00e9\n|nous ayons aim\u00e9\n|j'eusse aim\u00e9\n|nous eussions aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimiez\n|tu aimasses\n|vous aimassiez\n|tu aies aim\u00e9\n|vous ayez aim\u00e9\n|tu eusses aim\u00e9\n|vous eussiez aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aim\u00e2t\n|ils/elles aimassent\n|il/elle ait aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles aient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle e\u00fbt aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eussent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Imperative (Imperatif) ======\nThe imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense).

The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb ''\u00eatre'' (\"to be\") and the past participle.\n\nExample of the active voice:\n* \"Elle aime le chien.\" ''She loves the dog.''\n* \"Marc a conduit la voiture.\" ''Marc drove the car.''\nExample of the passive voice:\n* \"Le chien est aim\u00e9 par elle.\" ''The dog is loved by her.''\n* \"La voiture \u00e9tait conduite par Marc.\" ''The car was driven by Marc.''\n\n==== Syntax ====\n\n===== Word order =====\nFrench declarative word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb like \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\" when asking a question rather than just \"Vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" Both questions mean the same thing; however, a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question, especially on the second one. Specifically, the first translates into \"Do you speak French?\" while the second one is literally just \"You speak French?\" To avoid inversion while asking a question, 'Est-ce que' (literally 'is it that') may be placed in the beginning of the sentence. \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais ?\" may become \"Est-ce que vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" French also uses [[verb\u2013object\u2013subject]] (VOS) and [[object\u2013subject\u2013verb]] (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe majority of French words derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] or were constructed from [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots. In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a \"popular\" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from [[Classical Latin]]. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:\n* brother: ''[[wikt:fr\u00e8re|fr\u00e8re]]'' / ''[[wikt:fraternel|fraternel]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frater|frater]] / [[wikt:fraternalis|fraternalis]]''\n* finger: ''[[wikt:doigt|doigt]]'' / ''[[wikt:digital|digital]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:digitus|digitus]] / [[wikt:digitalis|digitalis]]''\n* faith: ''[[wikt:foi|foi]]'' / ''[[wikt:fid\u00e8le|fid\u00e8le]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:fides|fides]] / [[wikt:fidelis|fidelis]]''\n* eye: ''[[wikt:\u0153il|\u0153il]]'' / ''[[wikt:oculaire|oculaire]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:oculus|oculus]] / [[wikt:ocularis|ocularis]]''\n\nHowever, a historical tendency to gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:\n* ''[[wikt:rayonnement|rayonnement]]'' / ''radiation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:radiatio|radiatio]]''\n* ''[[wikt:\u00e9teindre|\u00e9teindre]]'' / ''extinguish'' from Latin ''[[wikt:exstinguo#Latin|exstinguere]]''\n* ''[[wikt:noyau|noyau]]'' / ''nucleus'' from Latin ''[[wikt:nucleus#Latin|nucleus]]''\n* ''[[wikt:ensoleillement|ensoleillement]]'' / ''insolation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:insolatio|insolatio]]''\n\nThere are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:\n* thing/cause: ''[[wikt:chose|chose]]'' / ''[[wikt:cause|cause]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:causa|causa]]''\n* cold: ''[[wikt:froid|froid]]'' / ''[[wikt:frigide|frigide]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frigidum|frigidum]]''\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words, because in the evolution from [[Vulgar Latin]], unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.\n\nMore recently the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents<!-- <ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/01/french-fight-franglais-with-alternatives-for-english-technology-terms-590128/|title=French fight franglais with alternatives for English technology terms |author=metrowebukmetro|date=1 October 2012|work=Metro News}}</ref> I'm removing this reference because it gave me a malware warning. --> to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules.

The French word for ''80'' is ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'', literally \"four twenties\", and the word for ''75'' is ''{{lang|fr|soixante-quinze}}'', literally \"sixty-fifteen\". This reform arose after the [[French Revolution]] to unify the counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via [[Breton language|Breton]]) and Viking influences. This system is comparable to the archaic English use of ''score'', as in \"fourscore and seven\" (87), or \"threescore and ten\" (70).\n\nIn Old French (during the [[Middle Ages]]), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. ''vint et doze'' (twenty and twelve) for 32, ''dous vinz et diz'' (two twenties and ten) for 50, ''uitante'' for 80, or ''nonante'' for 90.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Einhorn | first = E. | title = Old French: A Concise Handbook | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1974 | location = Cambridge| page = 110 | isbn = 978-0-521-09838-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]], [[Aostan French]]<ref name=\"Jean-Pierre Martin 1984\">Jean-Pierre Martin, ''Description lexicale du fran\u00e7ais parl\u00e9 en Vall\u00e9e d'Aoste'', \u00e9d.

It is the principal language of writing, school instruction, and administrative use. It is spoken by all educated Haitians and is used in the business sector. It is also used for ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church masses.

The second official language is the recently standardized [[Haitian Creole]], which virtually the entire population of Haiti speaks. Haitian Creole is one of the [[French-based creole languages]], drawing the large majority of its vocabulary from French, with influences from West African languages, as well as several European languages.

In France, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are tending to be replaced by {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} in many people's speech, but the distinction of {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} is present in [[Meridional French]]. In Quebec and Belgian French, the vowels {{IPA|/\u0251/}}, {{IPA|/\u0259/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0153\u0303/}} are present.\n* Voiced stops (i.e., {{IPA|/b, d, \u0261/}}) are typically produced fully voiced throughout.\n* Voiceless stops (i.e., {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}) are unaspirated.\n* The velar nasal {{IPA|/\u014b/}} can occur in final position in borrowed (usually English) words: ''parking, camping, swing''. The palatal nasal {{IPA|/\u0272/}} can occur in word initial position (e.g., ''gnon''), but it is most frequently found in intervocalic, onset position or word-finally (e.g., ''montagne'').\n* French has three pairs of homorganic fricatives distinguished by voicing, i.e., labiodental {{IPA|/f/~/v/}}, dental {{IPA|/s/~/z/}}, and palato-alveolar {{IPA|/\u0283/~/\u0292/}}. {{IPA|/s/~/z/}} are dental, like the plosives {{IPA|/t/~/d/}} and the nasal {{IPA|/n/}}.\n* French has one rhotic whose pronunciation varies considerably among speakers and phonetic contexts. In general, it is described as a [[voiced uvular fricative]], as in {{IPA|[\u0281u]}} ''{{wiktfr|roue}}'', \"wheel\". Vowels are often lengthened before this segment. It can be reduced to an approximant, particularly in final position (e.g., ''fort''), or reduced to zero in some word-final positions. For other speakers, a uvular trill is also common, and an apical trill {{IPA|[r]}} occurs in some dialects.\n* Lateral and central approximants: The lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}} is unvelarised in both onset (''lire'') and coda position (''il''). In the onset, the central approximants {{IPA|[w]}}, {{IPA|[\u0265]}}, and {{IPA|[j]}} each correspond to a high vowel, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/y/}}, and {{IPA|/i/}} respectively. There are a few [[minimal pair]]s where the approximant and corresponding vowel contrast, but there are also many cases where they are in free variation. Contrasts between {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} occur in final position as in {{IPA|/p\u025bj/}} ''{{wiktfr|paye}}'', \"pay\", vs. {{IPA|/p\u025bi/}} ''{{wiktfr|pays}}'', \"country\".\n\nFrench pronunciation follows strict rules based on spelling, but French spelling is often based more on history than phonology. The rules for pronunciation vary between dialects, but the standard rules are:\n* Final single consonants, in particular ''s'', ''x'', ''z'', ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''p'' and ''g,'' are normally silent. (A consonant is considered \"final\" when no vowel follows it even if one or more consonants follow it.) The final letters ''f'', ''k'', ''q'', and ''l'', however, are normally pronounced. The final '''c''' is sometimes pronounced like in '''bac''', '''sac''', '''roc''' but can also be silent like in '''blanc''' or '''estomac'''. The final ''r'' is usually silent when it follows an ''e'' in a word of two or more syllables, but it is pronounced in some words (''hiver'', ''super'', ''cancer'' etc.).\n** When the following word begins with a vowel, however, a silent consonant ''may'' once again be pronounced, to provide a ''[[liaison (linguistics)|liaison]]'' or \"link\" between the two words. Some liaisons are ''mandatory'', for example the ''s'' in ''les amants'' or ''vous avez''; some are ''optional'', depending on [[dialect]] and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], for example, the first ''s'' in ''deux cents euros'' or ''euros irlandais''; and some are ''forbidden'', for example, the ''s'' in ''beaucoup d'hommes aiment''. The ''t'' of ''et'' is never pronounced and the silent final consonant of a noun is only pronounced in the plural and in [[set phrase]]s like ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n** Doubling a final ''n'' and adding a silent ''e'' at the end of a word (e.g., ''chien'' \u2192 ''chienne'') makes it clearly pronounced. Doubling a final ''l'' and adding a silent ''e'' (e.g., ''gentil'' \u2192 ''gentille'') adds a [j] sound if the ''l'' is preceded by the letter ''i''.\n* Some monosyllabic function words ending in ''a'' or ''e'', such as ''je'' and ''que'', drop their final vowel when placed before a word that begins with a vowel sound (thus avoiding a [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]]). The missing vowel is replaced by an apostrophe. (e.g., ''*je ai'' is instead pronounced and spelled \u2192 ''j'ai''). This gives, for example, the same pronunciation for ''l'homme qu'il a vu'' (\"the man whom he saw\") and ''l'homme qui l'a vu'' (\"the man who saw him\"). However, for Belgian French the sentences are pronounced differently; in the first sentence the syllable break is as \"qu'il-a\", while the second breaks as \"qui-l'a\". It can also be noted that, in [[Quebec French]], the second example (''l'homme qui l'a vu'') is more emphasized on ''l'a vu''.\n\n==Writing system==\n\n===Alphabet===\n{{Main|French alphabet|French braille}}\n\nFrench is written with the 26 letters of the basic [[Latin script]], with four diacritics appearing on vowels ([[circumflex]] accent, [[acute accent]], [[grave accent]], [[Umlaut (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and the [[cedilla]] appearing in \"\u00e7\".\n\nThere are two [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], \"\u0153\" and \"\u00e6\", but they are now often not used because of the layout of the most common keyboards used in French-speaking countries. Yet, they cannot be changed to \"oe\" and \"ae\" in formal and literary texts.\n\n===Orthography===\n{{Main|French orthography|Reforms of French orthography}}\n\nFrench spelling, like English spelling, tends to preserve obsolete pronunciation rules. This is mainly due to extreme phonetic changes since the Old French period, without a corresponding change in spelling. Moreover, some conscious changes were made to restore Latin orthography (as with some English words such as \"debt\"):\n* Old French ''doit'' > French ''doigt'' \"finger\" (Latin ''digitus'')\n* Old French ''pie'' > French ''pied'' \"foot\" [Latin ''pes'' (stem: ''ped-'')]\n\nFrench is a [[Morphophonemic orthography|morphophonemic]] language. While it contains 130 [[grapheme]]s that denote only 36 [[phoneme]]s, many of its spelling rules are likely due to a consistency in morphemic patterns such as adding suffixes and prefixes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rdcu.be/uA31|title=The contribution of morphological awareness to the spelling of morphemes and morphologically complex words in French|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> Many given spellings of common morphemes usually lead to a predictable sound. In particular, a given vowel combination or diacritic generally leads to one phoneme. However, there is not a one-to-one relation of a phoneme and a single related grapheme, which can be seen in how ''tomber'' and ''tomb\u00e9'' both end with the /e/ phoneme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brissaud|first=Catherine|last2=Chevrot|first2=Jean-Pierre|title=The late acquisition of a major difficulty of French inflectional orthography: The homophonic /E/ verbal endings|journal=Writing Systems Research|volume=3|issue=2|pages=129\u201344|doi=10.1093/wsr/wsr003|year=2011|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00785731/file/Brissaud_Chevrot_2011_.pdf}}</ref> Additionally, there are many variations in the pronunciation of consonants at the end of words, demonstrated by how the ''x'' in ''paix'' is not pronounced though at the end of ''Aix'' it is''.''\n\nAs a result, it can be difficult to predict the spelling of a word based on the sound. Final consonants are generally silent, except when the following word begins with a vowel (see [[Liaison (French)]]). For example, the following words end in a vowel sound: ''pied'', ''aller'', ''les'', ''{{lang|fr|finit}}'', ''beaux''. The same words followed by a vowel, however, may sound the consonants, as they do in these examples: ''beaux-arts'', ''les amis'', ''pied-\u00e0-terre''.\n\nFrench writing, as with any language, is affected by the spoken language. In Old French, the plural for ''animal'' was ''animals''. The {{IPA|/als/}} sequence was unstable and was turned into a diphthong {{IPA|/aus/}}. This change was then reflected in the orthography: ''animaus''. The ''us'' ending, very common in Latin, was then abbreviated by copyists (monks) by the letter ''x'', resulting in a written form ''animax''. As the French language further evolved, the pronunciation of ''au'' turned into {{IPA|/o/}} so that the ''u'' was reestablished in orthography for consistency, resulting in modern French ''animaux'' (pronounced first {{IPA|/animos/}} before the final {{IPA|/s/}} was dropped in contemporary French). The same is true for ''cheval'' pluralized as ''chevaux'' and many others. In addition, ''castel'' pl. ''castels'' became ''ch\u00e2teau'' pl. ''ch\u00e2teaux''.\n* [[Nasal vowel|Nasal]]: ''[[n]]'' and ''m''. When ''n'' or ''m'' follows a vowel or diphthong, the ''n'' or ''m'' becomes silent and causes the preceding vowel to become nasalized (i.e., pronounced with the soft palate extended downward so as to allow part of the air to leave through the nostrils). Exceptions are when the ''n'' or ''m'' is doubled, or immediately followed by a vowel. The prefixes ''en-'' and ''em-'' are always nasalized. The rules are more complex than this but may vary between dialects.\n* [[digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]]: French uses not only [[diacritic]]s to specify its large range of vowel sounds and [[diphthongs]], but also specific combinations of vowels, sometimes with following consonants, to show which sound is intended.\n* [[Consonant length|Gemination]]: Within words, double consonants are generally not pronounced as geminates in modern French (but geminates can be heard in the cinema or TV news from as recently as the 1970s, and in very refined elocution they may still occur). For example, ''illusion'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ilyzj\u0254\u0303]}} and not {{IPA|[il\u02d0yzj\u0254\u0303]}}. But gemination does occur between words. For example, ''une info'' (\"a news item\" or \"a piece of information\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u025b\u0303fo]}}, whereas ''une nympho'' (\"a nymphomaniac\") is pronounced {{IPA|[yn\u02d0\u025b\u0303fo]}}.\n* [[Diacritic|Accents]] are used sometimes for pronunciation, sometimes to distinguish similar words, and sometimes based on etymology alone.\n** Accents that affect pronunciation\n*** The [[acute accent]] (''l'accent aigu'') ''\u00e9'' (e.g., '''''\u00e9'''cole''\u2014school) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[grave accent]] (''l'accent grave'') ''\u00e8'' (e.g., ''\u00e9l'''\u00e8'''ve''\u2014pupil) means that the vowel is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} instead of the default {{IPA|/\u0259/}}.\n*** The [[circumflex]] (''l'accent circonflexe'') ''\u00ea'' (e.g. ''for'''\u00ea'''t''\u2014forest) shows that an ''e'' is pronounced {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and that an ''\u00f4'' is pronounced {{IPA|/o/}}. In standard French, it also signifies a pronunciation of {{IPA|/\u0251/}} for the letter ''\u00e2'', but this differentiation is disappearing. In the mid-18th century, the circumflex was used in place of ''s'' after a vowel, where that letter ''s'' was not pronounced. Thus, ''forest'' became ''for\u00eat'', ''hospital'' became ''h\u00f4pital'', and ''hostel'' became ''h\u00f4tel''.\n*** [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|Diaeresis]] or ''tr\u00e9ma'' (''\u00eb'', ''\u00ef'', ''\u00fc'', ''\u00ff''): over ''e'', ''i'', ''u'' or ''y'',  indicates that a vowel is to be pronounced separately from the preceding one: ''na\u00efve'', ''No\u00ebl''.\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''o'' (''N'''o\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|\u0254\u025b|}}) is nasalized in the regular way if followed by ''n'' (''[[Samo\u00ebns|Sam'''o\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|w\u025b\u0303|}})\n****The combination of ''e'' with diaeresis following ''a'' is either pronounced {{IPA-fr|\u025b|}} (''Raph'''a\u00eb'''l'', ''Isr'''a\u00eb'''l'' {{IPA-fr|a\u025b|}}) or not pronounced, leaving only the ''a'' (''[[Madame de Sta\u00ebl|St'''a\u00eb'''l]]'' {{IPA-fr|a|}}) and the ''a'' is nasalized in the regular way if ''a\u00eb'' is followed by ''n'' (''[[Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-S'''a\u00eb'''ns]]'' {{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303|}})\n****A diaeresis on ''y'' only occurs in some proper names and in modern editions of old French texts. Some proper names in which ''\u00ff'' appears include ''[[A\u00ff]]'' (commune in ''d\u00e9partement de la [[Marne (department)|Marne]]'', formerly ''A\u00ff-Champagne''), ''Rue des Clo\u00ffs'' (alley in the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]]), ''Cro\u00ff'' (family name and hotel on the Boulevard Raspail, Paris), ''[[:fr:Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff|Ch\u00e2teau du Fe\u00ff]]'' (near [[Joigny]]), ''Gh\u00ffs'' (name of Flemish origin spelt ''Gh\u0133s'' where ''\u0133'' in handwriting looked like ''\u00ff'' to French clerks), ''[[L'Ha\u00ff-les-Roses]]'' (commune between Paris and [[Orly]] airport), [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]] (author), [[Mo\u00ff-de-l'Aisne]] (commune in '' d\u00e9partement de l'[[Aisne (department)|Aisne]]'' and family name), and ''Le Blanc de Nicola\u00ff'' (an insurance company in eastern France).\n****The diaeresis on ''u'' appears in the Biblical proper names ''Arch\u00e9la\u00fcs'', ''Capharna\u00fcm'', ''Emma\u00fcs'', ''\u00c9sa\u00fc'', and ''Sa\u00fcl'', as well as French names such as [[Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy|Ha\u00fcy]]. Nevertheless, since the 1990 orthographic changes, the diaeresis in words containing ''gu\u00eb'' (such as ''aigu\u00eb'' or ''cigu\u00eb'') may be moved onto the ''u'': ''aig\u00fce'', ''cig\u00fce'', and by analogy may be used in verbs such as ''j'arg\u00fce''.\n****In addition, words coming from German retain their umlaut (''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') if applicable but use often French pronunciation, such as ''K\u00e4rcher'' (trademark of a pressure washer).\n*** The [[cedilla]] (''la c\u00e9dille'') ''\u00e7'' (e.g., ''gar'''\u00e7'''on''\u2014boy) means that the letter ''\u00e7'' is pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the back vowels ''a'', ''o'' and ''u'' (''c'' is otherwise {{IPA|/k/}} before a back vowel). ''C'' is always pronounced {{IPA|/s/}} in front of the front vowels ''e'', ''i'', and ''y'', thus ''\u00e7'' is never found in front of front vowels.\n** Accents with no pronunciation effect\n*** The circumflex does not affect the pronunciation of the letters ''i'' or ''u'', nor, in most dialects, ''a''. It usually indicates that an ''s'' came after it long ago, as in ''\u00eele'' (''isle'', compare with English ''island'')<!-- [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Rapport_du_Conseil_sup%C3%A9rieur_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise_sur_les_rectifications_orthographiques_de_1990#Accent_circonflexe_.28II.4.29] -->. The explanation is that some words share the same orthography, so the circumflex is put here to mark the difference between the two words. For example, ''dites'' (you say) / ''d\u00eetes'' (you said), or even ''du'' (of the) / ''d\u00fb'' (past participle for the verb ''devoir'' = must, have to, owe; in this case, the circumflex disappears in the plural and the feminine).\n*** All other accents are used only to distinguish similar words, as in the case of distinguishing the adverbs ''l\u00e0'' and ''o\u00f9'' (\"there\", \"where\") from the article ''la'' (\"the\" feminine singular) and the conjunction ''ou'' (\"or\"), respectively.\n\nSome proposals exist to simplify the existing writing system, but they still fail to gather interest.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://fonetik.fr/index-en.html Fon\u00e9tik.fr writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://sites.google.com/site/ortofasil/ Ortofasil writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.alfograf.net/ Alfograf writing system proposal].</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://ortograf.net/ Ortograf.net writing system proposal].</ref>\n\nIn 1990, a [[Reforms of French orthography|reform]] accepted some changes to French orthography. At the time the proposed changes were considered to be suggestions. In 2016, schoolbooks in France began to use the newer recommended spellings, with instruction to teachers that both old and new spellings be deemed correct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35496893|title=End of the circumflex? Changes in French spelling cause uproar|date=2016-02-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|French grammar}}\nFrench is a moderately [[Inflection|inflected]] language. [[Noun]]s and most [[pronoun]]s are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural, though in most nouns the plural is pronounced the same as the singular even if spelled differently); [[adjective]]s, for number and [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine) of their nouns; [[personal pronoun]]s and a few other pronouns, for [[grammatical person|person]], number, gender, and [[grammatical case|case]]; and [[verb]]s, for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], and the person and number of their [[subject (grammar)|subjects]]. Case is primarily marked using [[word order]] and [[preposition]]s, while certain verb features are marked using [[auxiliary verb]]s. According to the French lexicogrammatical system, French has a rank-scale hierarchy with clause as the top rank, which is followed by group rank, word rank, and morpheme rank. A French clause is made up of groups, groups are made up of words, and lastly, words are made up of morphemes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Caffarel|first1=Alice|last2=Martin|first2=J.R.|last3=Matthiessen|first3=Christian M.I.M|title=Language Typology: A Functional Perspective|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia}}</ref>\n\nFrench grammar shares several notable features with most other Romance languages, including\n* the loss of [[Latin declension]]s\n* the loss of the neuter gender\n* the development of grammatical [[article (grammar)|articles]] from Latin [[demonstrative]]s\n* the loss of certain Latin [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] and the creation of new tenses from auxiliaries.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nEvery French [[noun]] is either masculine or feminine. Because French nouns are not inflected for gender, a noun's form cannot specify its gender. For nouns regarding the living, their grammatical genders often correspond to that which they refer to. For example, a male teacher is a \"enseignant\" while a female teacher is a \"enseignante\". However, plural nouns that refer to a group that includes both masculine and feminine entities are always masculine. So a group of two male teachers would be \"enseignants\". A group of two male teachers and two female teachers would still be \"enseignants\". In many situations, and in the case of \"enseignant\", both the singular and plural form of a noun are pronounced identically. The article used for singular nouns is different from that used for plural nouns and the article provides a distinguishing factor between the two in speech. For example, the singular \"le professeur\" or \"la professeur(e)\" (the male or female teacher, professor) can be distinguished from the plural \"les professeurs\" because \"le\", \"la\", and \"les\" are all pronounced differently. There are some situations where both the feminine and masculine form of a noun are the same and the article provides the only difference. For example, \"le dentiste\" refers to a male dentist while \"la dentiste\" refers to a female dentist.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Main|French verbs}}\n\n==== Moods and tense-aspect forms ====\nThe French language consists of both finite and non-finite moods. The finite moods include the [[indicative mood]] (indicatif), the [[subjunctive mood]] (subjonctif), the [[imperative mood]] (imp\u00e9ratif), and the [[conditional mood]] (conditionnel). The non-finite moods include the [[infinitive]] mood (infinitif), the [[present participle]] (participe pr\u00e9sent), and the [[past participle]] (participe pass\u00e9).\n\n===== Finite moods =====\n\n====== Indicative (Indicatif) ======\nThe indicative mood makes use of eight tense-aspect forms. These include the [[Present tense|present]] (pr\u00e9sent), the [[simple past]] ([[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]] and [[pass\u00e9 simple]]), the [[past imperfective]] ([[imparfait]]), the [[pluperfect]] ([[plus-que-parfait]]), the [[simple future]] ([[futur simple]]), the [[future perfect]] ([[futur ant\u00e9rieur]]), and the [[past perfect]] (pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur). Some forms are less commonly used today. In today's spoken French, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 is used while the pass\u00e9 simple is reserved for formal situations or for literary purposes. Similarly, the plus-que-parfait is used for speaking rather than the older pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur seen in literary works.\n\nWithin the indicative mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, plus-que-parfait, futur ant\u00e9rieur, and pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur all use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Indicatif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 simple\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimons\n|j'aimais\n|nous aimions\n|j'ai aim\u00e9\n|nous avons aim\u00e9\n|j'aimai\n|nous aim\u00e2mes\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimez\n|tu aimais\n|vous aimiez\n|tu as aim\u00e9\n|vous avez aim\u00e9\n|tu aimas\n|vous aim\u00e2tes\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aimait\n|ils/elles aimaient\n|il/elle a aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles ont aim\u00e9\n|il/elle aima\n|ils/elles aim\u00e8rent\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" |\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur simple\n| colspan=\"2\" |Futur ant\u00e9rieur\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieur\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aimerai\n|nous aimerons\n|j'aurai aim\u00e9\n|nous aurons aim\u00e9\n|j'avais aim\u00e9\n|nous avions aim\u00e9\n|j'eus aim\u00e9\n|nous e\u00fbmes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimeras\n|vous aimerez\n|tu auras aim\u00e9\n|vous aurez aim\u00e9\n|tu avais aim\u00e9\n|vous aviez aim\u00e9\n|tu eus aim\u00e9\n|vous e\u00fbtes aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aimera\n|ils/elles aimeront\n|il/elle aura aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles auront aim\u00e9\n|il/elle avais aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles avaient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle eut aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eurent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Subjunctive (Subjonctif) ======\nThe subjunctive mood only includes four of the tense-aspect forms found in the indicative: present (pr\u00e9sent), simple past (pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9), past imperfective (imparfait), and pluperfect (plus-que-parfait).\n\nWithin the subjunctive mood, the pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9 and plus-que-parfait use auxiliary verbs in their forms.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Subjonctif\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pr\u00e9sent\n| colspan=\"2\" |Imparfait\n| colspan=\"2\" |Pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9\n| colspan=\"2\" |Plus-que-parfait\n|-\n|\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|Singular\n|Plural\n|-\n|1st Person\n|j'aime\n|nous aimions\n|j'aimasse\n|nous aimassions\n|j'aie aim\u00e9\n|nous ayons aim\u00e9\n|j'eusse aim\u00e9\n|nous eussions aim\u00e9\n|-\n|2nd Person\n|tu aimes\n|vous aimiez\n|tu aimasses\n|vous aimassiez\n|tu aies aim\u00e9\n|vous ayez aim\u00e9\n|tu eusses aim\u00e9\n|vous eussiez aim\u00e9\n|-\n|3rd Person\n|il/elle aime\n|ils/elles aiment\n|il/elle aim\u00e2t\n|ils/elles aimassent\n|il/elle ait aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles aient aim\u00e9\n|il/elle e\u00fbt aim\u00e9\n|ils/elles eussent aim\u00e9\n|}\n\n====== Imperative (Imperatif) ======\nThe imperative is used in the present tense (with the exception of a few instances where it is used in the perfect tense).

The active voice is unmarked while the passive voice is formed by using a form of verb ''\u00eatre'' (\"to be\") and the past participle.\n\nExample of the active voice:\n* \"Elle aime le chien.\" ''She loves the dog.''\n* \"Marc a conduit la voiture.\" ''Marc drove the car.''\nExample of the passive voice:\n* \"Le chien est aim\u00e9 par elle.\" ''The dog is loved by her.''\n* \"La voiture \u00e9tait conduite par Marc.\" ''The car was driven by Marc.''\n\n==== Syntax ====\n\n===== Word order =====\nFrench declarative word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] although a pronoun object precedes the verb. Some types of sentences allow for or require different word orders, in particular [[inversion (linguistics)|inversion]] of the subject and verb like \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\" when asking a question rather than just \"Vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" Both questions mean the same thing; however, a rising inflection is always used on both of them whenever asking a question, especially on the second one. Specifically, the first translates into \"Do you speak French?\" while the second one is literally just \"You speak French?\" To avoid inversion while asking a question, 'Est-ce que' (literally 'is it that') may be placed in the beginning of the sentence. \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais ?\" may become \"Est-ce que vous parlez fran\u00e7ais ?\" French also uses [[verb\u2013object\u2013subject]] (VOS) and [[object\u2013subject\u2013verb]] (OSV) word order. OSV word order is not used often and VOS is reserved for formal writings.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe majority of French words derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] or were constructed from [[Latin]] or [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots. In many cases a single etymological root appears in French in a \"popular\" or native form, inherited from Vulgar Latin, and a learned form, borrowed later from [[Classical Latin]]. The following pairs consist of a native noun and a learned adjective:\n* brother: ''[[wikt:fr\u00e8re|fr\u00e8re]]'' / ''[[wikt:fraternel|fraternel]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frater|frater]] / [[wikt:fraternalis|fraternalis]]''\n* finger: ''[[wikt:doigt|doigt]]'' / ''[[wikt:digital|digital]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:digitus|digitus]] / [[wikt:digitalis|digitalis]]''\n* faith: ''[[wikt:foi|foi]]'' / ''[[wikt:fid\u00e8le|fid\u00e8le]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:fides|fides]] / [[wikt:fidelis|fidelis]]''\n* eye: ''[[wikt:\u0153il|\u0153il]]'' / ''[[wikt:oculaire|oculaire]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:oculus|oculus]] / [[wikt:ocularis|ocularis]]''\n\nHowever, a historical tendency to gallicise Latin roots can be identified, whereas English conversely leans towards a more direct incorporation of the Latin:\n* ''[[wikt:rayonnement|rayonnement]]'' / ''radiation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:radiatio|radiatio]]''\n* ''[[wikt:\u00e9teindre|\u00e9teindre]]'' / ''extinguish'' from Latin ''[[wikt:exstinguo#Latin|exstinguere]]''\n* ''[[wikt:noyau|noyau]]'' / ''nucleus'' from Latin ''[[wikt:nucleus#Latin|nucleus]]''\n* ''[[wikt:ensoleillement|ensoleillement]]'' / ''insolation'' from Latin ''[[wikt:insolatio|insolatio]]''\n\nThere are also noun-noun and adjective-adjective pairs:\n* thing/cause: ''[[wikt:chose|chose]]'' / ''[[wikt:cause|cause]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:causa|causa]]''\n* cold: ''[[wikt:froid|froid]]'' / ''[[wikt:frigide|frigide]]'' from Latin ''[[wikt:frigidum|frigidum]]''\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the Latin source of native French words, because in the evolution from [[Vulgar Latin]], unstressed syllables were severely reduced and the remaining vowels and consonants underwent significant modifications.\n\nMore recently the linguistic policy of the French language academies of France and Quebec has been to provide French equivalents<!-- <ref>{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/01/french-fight-franglais-with-alternatives-for-english-technology-terms-590128/|title=French fight franglais with alternatives for English technology terms |author=metrowebukmetro|date=1 October 2012|work=Metro News}}</ref> I'm removing this reference because it gave me a malware warning. --> to (mainly English) imported words, either by using existing vocabulary, extending its meaning or deriving a new word according to French morphological rules.

The French word for ''80'' is ''{{lang|fr|quatre-vingts}}'', literally \"four twenties\", and the word for ''75'' is ''{{lang|fr|soixante-quinze}}'', literally \"sixty-fifteen\". This reform arose after the [[French Revolution]] to unify the counting systems (mostly vigesimal near the coast, because of Celtic (via [[Breton language|Breton]]) and Viking influences. This system is comparable to the archaic English use of ''score'', as in \"fourscore and seven\" (87), or \"threescore and ten\" (70).\n\nIn Old French (during the [[Middle Ages]]), all numbers from 30 to 99 could be said in either base 10 or base 20, e.g. ''vint et doze'' (twenty and twelve) for 32, ''dous vinz et diz'' (two twenties and ten) for 50, ''uitante'' for 80, or ''nonante'' for 90.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Einhorn | first = E. | title = Old French: A Concise Handbook | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1974 | location = Cambridge| page = 110 | isbn = 978-0-521-09838-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Belgian French]], [[Swiss French]], [[Aostan French]]<ref name=\"Jean-Pierre Martin 1984\">Jean-Pierre Martin, ''Description lexicale du fran\u00e7ais parl\u00e9 en Vall\u00e9e d'Aoste'', \u00e9d.

He is the main protagonist of the series, who receives [[Soul Reaper (Bleach)|Soul Reaper]] powers after befriending [[Rukia Kuchiki]], the Soul Reaper assigned to patrol around the fictional city of Karakura Town. These powers come at the cost of Rukia's own, and as a result, Ichigo concedes to work as Rukia's stand-in, fighting to protect people from evil spirits called [[List of Bleach characters#Secondary characters|Hollows]] and sending good spirits, [[Bleach (manga)#Character types|wholes]], to a dimension known as the [[Bleach (manga)#Plot|Soul Society]]. In addition to the manga series, Ichigo appears in many other pieces of ''Bleach'' media, including the [[Bleach (anime)|anime]] series, the four featured films, the two [[original video animation]]s, [[Rock opera|rock musicals]], several [[List of Bleach video games|video games]], [[light novel]]s and the [[Bleach (2018 film)|2018 live-action film]].\n\nKubo said that Ichigo was created to replace Rukia as the protagonist of the series because he felt she wasn't suited for the role. His character has been well received among both readers and reviewers. Ichigo is often featured in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' character popularity polls. He was consistently ranked as the most popular character in ''Bleach''.<ref name=\"Popularity2\"/> The 2007 Japanese ''[[Newtype]]'' magazine polls ranked Ichigo as one of the top 100 most-loved anime characters. Reviewers of the series have praised his personality, though some consider him to be a stereotypical [[anti-hero]]. Merchandise based on Ichigo's likeness has been released, including toys, clothing and action figures. In the animated adaptations of ''Bleach'', Ichigo is voiced by [[Masakazu Morita]] in Japanese.<ref name=\"japvoice\">{{cite episode|title=\u6b7b\u795e\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f\u65e5|number=1|series=Bleach|credits=TV Tokyo, Dentsu, Studio Pierrot|network=TV Tokyo|airdate=October 5, 2004}}</ref> In the English adaptations, he is voiced by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]].<ref name=\"Engvoice\">{{cite episode|title=A Soul Reaper is Born! |number=1|series=Bleach|credits=TV Tokyo, Dentsu, Studio Pierrot|network=Cartoon Network|airdate=September 8, 2006}}</ref> In the live-action film, he is played by [[Sota Fukushi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/08/18-1/sota-fukushi-to-lead-live-action-bleach-movie|title=Sota Fukushi To Lead Live-Action \"Bleach\" Movie|author=|date=|website=crunchyroll.com}}</ref>\n\n==Creation and conception==\nWhen drawing the manga series, Kubo commented that [[Rukia Kuchiki]], the first ''Bleach'' character he introduced, was originally intended to be the [[protagonist]].

The coffins were assembled over the bodies which had become mummified. Bergman excavated 12 burials and recovered approximately 200 artifacts that were transported back to Stockholm.

The male burials were marked with the oar-shaped posts, while the female burials were marked with the phallic posts. Bows and arrows were found with the male burials. The posts and coffins may be painted red. Each coffin is made of two massive pieces of plank assembled over the body, resembling an overturned boat, and then covered with cowhides. A few special tombs containing females have an extra rectangular coffin on top covered with layers of mud. Small masks of human faces and wooden human figures may accompany the burials.
