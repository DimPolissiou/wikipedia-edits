A major religious hub in [[India]], it is the [[Holy city|holiest]] of the seven sacred cities (''[[Sapta Puri]]'') in [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], and played an important role in the development of [[Buddhism]] and [[Ravidassia]]. Varanasi lies along [[National Highway 2 (India, old numbering)|National Highway 2]] and is served by [[Varanasi Junction railway station]] and [[Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport]].\n\nVaranasi grew as an important industrial centre famous for its [[muslin]] and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, \"[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma]]\", at nearby [[Sarnath]]. The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when [[Adi Shankara]] established the [[Shaivism|worship of Shiva]] as an official sect of Varanasi. During the Muslim rule through the Middle Ages, the city continued as an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, [[mysticism]] and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of cultural importance and religious education. [[Tulsidas]] wrote his epic poem on [[Rama|Rama's]] life called ''[[Ram Charit Manas]]'' in Varanasi.

The [[Benares State|Kingdom of Benares]] was given official status by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947.

The city is known worldwide for its many [[Ghats in Varanasi|ghats]], embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the [[Dashashwamedh Ghat]], the Panchganga Ghat, the [[Manikarnika Ghat]] and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead and the [[Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi]] are kept here.\n\nThe [[Ramnagar Fort]], near the eastern bank of the Ganges, was built in the 18th century in the [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] style of [[architecture]] with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. Among the estimated 23,000 temples in Varanasi are [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] of Shiva, the [[Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple]], and the [[Durga Mandir, Varanasi|Durga Temple]]. The [[Kashi Naresh]] ([[Maharaja]] of Kashi) is the chief cultural patron of Varanasi, and an essential part of all religious celebrations. An educational and musical centre, many prominent Indian philosophers, poets, writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the [[Benares gharana]] form of [[Hindustani classical music]] was developed.

During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.<ref>[[Edward Sachau]], 1910, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html ''Alberuni's India''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303145703/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html |date=3 March 2018 }}, p. 147, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.

A major religious hub in [[India]], it is the [[Holy city|holiest]] of the seven sacred cities (''[[Sapta Puri]]'') in [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]], and played an important role in the development of [[Buddhism]] and [[Ravidassia]]. Varanasi lies along [[National Highway 2 (India, old numbering)|National Highway 2]] and is served by [[Varanasi Junction railway station]] and [[Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport]].\n\nVaranasi grew as an important industrial centre famous for its [[muslin]] and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, \"[[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta|The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma]]\", at nearby [[Sarnath]]. The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when [[Adi Shankara]] established the [[Shaivism|worship of Shiva]] as an official sect of Varanasi. During the Muslim rule through the Middle Ages, the city continued as an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, [[mysticism]] and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of cultural importance and religious education. [[Tulsidas]] wrote his epic poem on [[Rama|Rama's]] life called ''[[Ram Charit Manas]]'' in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the [[Bhakti movement]] were born in Varanasi, including [[Kabir]] and [[Ravidas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/culture/spirit-kabir-took-ancient-ghats-benares|title=When the spirit of Kabir took over the ancient ghats of Benares|date=30 November 2019|website=The Sunday Guardian Live|language=en-US|access-date=29 December 2019}}</ref> [[Guru Nanak]] visited Varanasi for [[Maha Shivaratri]] in 1507, a trip that played a large role in the founding of [[Sikhism]].\n\nIn the 16th century, Varanasi experienced a cultural revival under the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]] who patronised the city, and built two large temples dedicated to [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]], though much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and [[Brahmin]] kings. The [[Benares State|Kingdom of Benares]] was given official status by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947. The city is governed by the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the [[Parliament of India]] by the current Prime Minister of India [[Narendra Modi]], who won the [[Lok Sabha]] elections in 2014 by a huge margin. [[Silk weaving in Varanasi|Silk weaving]], carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as do the [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] and [[Bharat Heavy Electricals]].

The city is known worldwide for its many [[Ghats in Varanasi|ghats]], embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the [[Dashashwamedh Ghat]], the Panchganga Ghat, the [[Manikarnika Ghat]] and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead and the [[Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi]] are kept here.\n\nThe [[Ramnagar Fort]], near the eastern bank of the Ganges, was built in the 18th century in the [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] style of [[architecture]] with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. Among the estimated 23,000 temples in Varanasi are [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] of Shiva, the [[Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple]], and the [[Durga Mandir, Varanasi|Durga Temple]]. The [[Kashi Naresh]] ([[Maharaja]] of Kashi) is the chief cultural patron of Varanasi, and an essential part of all religious celebrations. An educational and musical centre, many prominent Indian philosophers, poets, writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the [[Benares gharana]] form of [[Hindustani classical music]] was developed. One of Asia's largest residential universities is [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU). The Hindi-language nationalist newspaper, ''[[Aj (newspaper)|Aj]]'', was first published in 1920.\n\n== Etymology ==\nTraditional etymology links \"Varanasi\" to the names of two [[Ganges]] tributaries forming the city's borders: [[Varuna River|Varuna]], still flowing in northern Varanasi, and Assi, today a small stream in the southern part of the city, near Assi Ghat.

During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.<ref>[[Edward Sachau]], 1910, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html ''Alberuni's India''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303145703/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html |date=3 March 2018 }}, p. 147, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.

In the fifth century, the ceremony of the oils was transferred from the Holy Saturday Vigil to Holy Thursday during a special Mass for that purpose, distinct from the Mass of the Lord's Supper. In the decree renewing this rite [[Pope Paul VI]] said:\u201cThe Chrism Mass is one of the principal expressions of the fullness of the bishop\u2019s priesthood and signifies the closeness of the priests with him.\u201d<ref name=Baltimore/>\n[[File:BlessingChrism.jpg|thumb|Blessing Chrism]]\nThe Holy Oils are:\n* [[Chrism]] \u2013 used in the sacraments of [[Baptism]], [[Confirmation in the Catholic Church|Confirmation]] and [[Holy orders in the Catholic Church|Holy Orders]], as well as for the consecration of altars and the dedication of churches.<ref>[http://www.stjames-cathedral.org/Events/2017/album-chrismmass.aspx \"Chrism Mass 2017\", St. James Cathedral, Seattle, April 6, 2017]</ref>\n* the [[oil of catechumens]] \u2013 also used in the sacrament of Baptism, and\n* the oil of the sick \u2013 used in the rite of the [[Anointing of the Sick]]\n\nThe oil of the catechumens and chrism are used on the upcoming [[Holy Saturday]] at the [[Easter Vigil]], for the [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]] of those entering the church. While the Oil of the Catechumens and the Oil of the Sick, are simply \"blessed,\" the Sacred Chrism is \"consecrated,\". Holy chrism is a mixture of olive oil and balsam, an aromatic resin. Balsam is poured into the oil, which gives it a sweet smell intended to remind those who encounter it of the \"odor of sanctity\" to which those who are marked with it, are called to strive. The bishop breathes over the vessel containing the chrism, a gesture which symbolizes the Holy Spirit coming down to consecrate this oil, and recalls the actions of Jesus in John 20:22, when he breathed on the apostles and said, \"Receive the Holy Spirit...\"<ref name=Jalbert/><ref name=Baltimore>[https://www.archbalt.org/about-us/our-bishops/cardinal-obrien/articles/chism-mass.cfm \"Chrism Mass\", ''Catholic Review'', Archdiocese of Baltimore, March 27, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413153522/https://www.archbalt.org/about-us/our-bishops/cardinal-obrien/articles/chism-mass.cfm |date=13 April 2017 }}</ref>\n\nWith respect to Anglicanism, the 1979 [[Book of Common Prayer]] (p.&nbsp;307) calls for chrism to be consecrated by the bishop. In many dioceses, the consecration of chrism by the bishop may be done at a service of reaffirmation of ordination vows during Holy Week. During the Chrism Eucharist, the Bishop will bless the oils used throughout the next year for baptisms and healing. In addition, the Bishop and clergy in attendance will reaffirm their Ordination Vows.<ref name=Tennessee/>\n\n===Eastern Christianity===\n====Eastern Orthodoxy====\n[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|left|Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]])]]\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[liturgical colour]]s are brighter, white being common. On this day alone during Holy Week, the fast is relaxed to permit consumption of wine and oil.\n\nThe primary service of this day is [[Vespers]] combined with the [[Liturgy of St. Basil|Liturgy of St. Basil the Great]] at which is read the first Passion Gospel ({{bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1}}), known as the \"Gospel of the Testament\", and many of the normal hymns of the Divine Liturgy are substituted with the following [[troparion]]:\n\n<blockquote>''Of Thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God, accept me today as a communicant; for I will not speak of Thy [[Sacred Mysteries|Mystery]] to Thine enemies, neither will I give Thee a kiss like Judas. But like the [[The Good Thief (Christianity)|Thief]] will I confess Thee: Remember me, O Lord, in Thy [[Paradise|Kingdom]].''</blockquote>\n\nWhen necessary to replenish the [[Church tabernacle#Reserved sacrament|sacrament for communing the sick at a time not following a divine liturgy]], an additional [[Lamb (Liturgy)|Lamb (Host)]] is consecrated on this day, [[Intinction#Eastern Christianity|intincted]], covered, and left to dry until Holy Saturday when it is divided, completely dried with a candle flame, and the pieces placed in the [[Church tabernacle#Communion for the Sick|artophorion]].\n\nIn [[cathedral]]s and [[monasteries]] the ceremony of the [[Washing of Feet]] is normally performed.\n\nWhen there is need to [[consecrate]] more [[chrism]], that is performed by patriarchs and other heads of the various [[autocephalous]] churches.\n\n[[File:Passion Gospels - Great Thursday -- Annunciation, Toronto, 2015.JPG|right|thumb| Reading of the 12th Passion Gospel on Great and Holy Thursday]]\nIn the evening, after the Liturgy, all of the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] are changed to black or some other dark colour, to signify the beginning of the Passion. Anticipating the Matins of Friday morning, the Holy Passion service of the reading of the '''Twelve Gospels''' is conducted. In these readings Christ's last instructions to his disciples are presented, as well as the prophecy of the drama of the Cross, Christ's prayer, and his new commandment. The twelve readings are:\n*{{bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||John|18:1\u201329|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201375|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||John|18:28\u201319:16|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:3\u201332|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||Mark|15:16\u201332|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:33\u201354|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||Luke|23:32\u201349|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||John|19:19\u201337|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||Mark|15:43\u201347|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||John|19:38\u201342|KJV}}\n*{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:62\u201366|KJV}}\nBeginning on Holy and Great Thursday, the [[Memorial service (Orthodox)#Lity|memorial service for the dead]] is forbidden until after [[Thomas Sunday]].\n{{clear}}\n{{Lent_calendar.svg}}\n\n=====Local customs=====\n* In Greek practice, the [[Sacrament|Mystery]] of [[Unction]] is performed on [[Holy Wednesday|Great Wednesday]] as preparation for the reception of Holy Communion on Great Thursday and Pascha, a custom that originated when Greece was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control and parish priests, being uneducated, were not permitted to hear confession, so this sacrament, by which sins are believed to be forgiven, came to be performed.\n* In Greek tradition, a procession is made during the service of the Twelve Passion Gospels. It takes place after the reading of the fifth gospel during the singing of \"Today He Who Hung\". During this procession, a large cross with the body of Christ is carried throughout the church while lights are extinguished, bells are slowly tolled, and the faithful prostrate themselves. The cross, with Christ's body hung upon it, is placed in front of the Royal Doors. The icon of Christ on the cross (sometimes with nails affixing it) is struck upon the hands and feet with a stone multiple times, and is then stood up in front of the church, where it is censed.\n* In some Slavic traditions, a lesser procession is made after the Twelve Passion Gospels immediately prior to the dismissal with an icon of Christ's crucifixion which is placed on the central icon stand, where it is censed by the clergy, and then venerated.\n\n====Oriental Orthodoxy====\n{{Empty section|date=March 2018}}\nOriental Orthodoxy including Coptic (Egyptian) and Ethiopian Orthodoxy which is under papacy of Pope Tawadros II The Copts celebrate Covenant Thursday on 16 April which is 1 week after the Catholics celebrate it. They have praises and vespers every day of week and on Thursday and Saturday they stay praising God and reading about the First Liturgy and Judas\u2019 Betrayal. On Saturday they sing praises for the Entrance of the Messiah in Hades freeing all of the faithful ones including Moses and Abraham etc.\n\n==Customs and names from around the world==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Bishop Sebouh - Washing of Feet.jpg|thumb|Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian ([[Armenian Apostolic Church]]) washing the feet of children during the Washing of Feet ceremony]]\n* If statues and crucifixes have been covered during Passion Time (the last 2 weeks of Lent, at least in the 1962 Catholic missal), the crucifix covers are allowed to be white instead of purple for Holy Thursday.\n* Maundy Thursday celebrations in the [[United Kingdom]] (also called [[Royal Maundy]]) today involve the [[Monarch]] offering \"alms\" to deserving senior citizens, one man and one woman for each year of the sovereign's age. These coins, known as [[Maundy money]] or Royal Maundy, are distributed in red and white purses, and is a custom dating back to [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. The red purse contains regular currency and is given in place of food and clothing; the white purse has money in the amount of one penny for each year of the Sovereign's age. Since 1822, rather than ordinary money, the Sovereign gives out [[Maundy money#Maundy coinage|Maundy coins]],<ref>[http://www.royalmint.com/RoyalMint/web/site/Corporate/Corp_british_coinage/Maundy_Money.asp The Royal Mint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328121720/http://www.royalmint.com/RoyalMint/web/site/Corporate/Corp_british_coinage/Maundy_Money.asp |date=28 March 2007 }}</ref> which are specially minted 1, 2, 3 and 4 penny pieces, and are legal tender. The service at which this takes place rotates around English and Welsh churches, though in 2008 it took place for the first time in [[Northern Ireland]] at [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Armagh Cathedral]]. Until the death of King [[James II of England|James II]], the [[Monarch]] would also wash the feet of the selected poor people. There is an old sketch, done from life, of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] washing people's feet on Maundy Thursday. \n* The popular [[German (language)|German]] name ''Gr\u00fcndonnerstag'' means either \"mourning Thursday\" or \"green Thursday\".<ref>The word is of medieval origin and may refer to the possible use of green vestments on this day in some regions, or to a custom of eating green salad or pancakes (cf. [http://germazope.uni-trier.de/Projects/WBB/woerterbuecher/dwb/wbgui?lemid=GG26646 Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]). The name could also derive from [[Old High German]] ''gr\u012bnan'' (\"mourn\" or \"wail\", cf. Engl. ''groan''), referring to the death of Jesus or the [[penitent]]s' return to the [[eucharist]] on this day in older times (K. K\u00fcppers, \"Gr\u00fcndonnerstag\", In ''Lexikon des Mittelalters'', vol. IV,, DTV, Munich, 2003).</ref>\n* In the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], the day is called ''Zelen\u00fd \u010dtvrtek'' or ''Zelen\u00fd \u0161tvrtok'' respectively, again meaning \"Green Thursday\". It is because the typical meals of this day were made of fresh, green vegetables etc. From that day there is no usage of the [[church bell]]s until [[Holy Saturday]], here called \"White Saturday\", because \"they have flown to [[Rome]]\" (a euphemism), in some regions they are replaced by groups of children walking round their village (or around the church) and making noise with wooden rattles. This is to announce to the people approaching beginning of the liturgy and call the people to the church.\n* The tradition of silent bells is found also in [[Luxembourg]]: the bells fall silent until Easter, because \"they have flown to Rome for Confession\", so children take to the streets, calling people to church with melancholy wooden rattling.<ref>Festivals of Western Europe, by Dorothy Gladys Spicer, 1958</ref>\n* In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], the day is called ''Witte Donderdag'' (White Thursday) referring to the [[liturgical colour]] of the day.\n* In [[Malta]], Holy Thursday is known as ''\u0126amis ix-Xirka'' (Communion Thursday) and the tradition of [[Seven Churches Visitation|visiting seven churches]] (see below) is called ''is-seba' visti'' or is-Sepulkri.\n* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Maundy Thursday is ''Dydd Iau Cablyd''.\n* In [[Sweden]] Maundy Thursday (sk\u00e4rtorsdagen) is connected to old folklore as the day of the witches. Young children often dress up as witches and knock on doors getting coins or candy for easter eggs.\n* In [[Bulgaria]] Maundy Thursday is called ''Veliki Chetvurtuk'' (Great Thursday), and is traditionally the day when people color their easter eggs and perform other household chores geared toward preparing for ''Razpeti Petuk'' (Crucifixion Friday), ''Velika Subota'' (Great Saturday) and ''Velikden'' (Easter Day).\n* In [[Kerala]] State in [[India]], the day is called as ''[[Pesaha]]''(\u0d2a\u0d46\u0d38\u0d39), a [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] word derived from the Aramaic or Syriac word for [[Passover]]. Maundy Thursday and following Good Friday are observed as statewide public holiday declared by the [[Government of Kerala]], given the high number of Christians in the state.<ref name=\"newindianexpress\">{{cite news |title=Kerala government releases list of holidays for 2019 |url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2018/oct/20/government-releases-list-of-holidays-for-2019-1887493.html |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=The New Indian Express}}</ref> The tradition of consuming ''[[Pesaha appam]]'' or ''Indariyappam'' is customary after special longer [[Holy Qurbana]], which are conducted on the or at midnight till morning in churches of Saint Thomas Christians. On the evening before Good Friday the Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they use a sweet drink call ''Pesaha Paal'' made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread. On the Pesaha night the bread is steamed in a new vessel, immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out the steam so that the bread will not rise. This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members after prayers. In some families, ''Pesaha Paal'' a creamy dip made up of jaggery and coconut milk is used along with the Pesaha bread. If the family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but some of the Saint Thomas Christian neighbours share their bread with them.<ref>Sunish George J Alumkalnal, (2013). \"[https://www.nasrani.net/2012/11/11/pesaha-celebration-of-nasranis-a-socio-cultural-analysis/ Pesaha celebration of Nasranis: a sociocultural analysis].\" ''Journal of Indo Judaic studies'' '''13''', pp.&nbsp;57\u201371</ref> The Saint Thomas Christians diaspora also celebrate this day by having Holy Communion services in the parishes according to their respective liturgies. The tradition of washing feet by priests is practiced in every parish commemorating [[Jesus]] washing the feet of his disciples symbolizing humbleness.\n* In the [[Philippines]], the day is officially known as ''Huwebes Santo'' or \"Maundy Thursday\" (the term \"Holy Thursday\" is rarely used). Most businesses are closed during the [[Easter Triduum]], with shopping malls opening on Black Saturday. Terrestrial television and radio stations either go completely off-air during the Triduum or operate on shorter hours with special programming; cable channels usually retain their normal programming.

In the UK, civil servants were traditionally granted a half-day holiday (known as \"privilege leave\") on this date, but that was abolished after 2012.\n\n===Seven Churches Visitation===\n{{main|Seven Churches Visitation}}\nThe tradition of visiting seven churches on Holy Thursday is an ancient practice, probably originating in [[Rome]].<ref name=Hill>{{Cite web |url=http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/join-7-church-visits |title=Hill, William. \"Join the 7-church visits\", Diocese of Pittsburgh, April 11, 2014 |access-date=30 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521120610/http://diopitt.org/pittsburgh-catholic/join-7-church-visits |archive-date=21 May 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and occurs among the faithful in countries around the world.\n\nIn [[India]], the custom is to visit fourteen churches, one per [[Station of the Cross]]. Traditionally, this is performed on Maundy Thursday evening but is more often done on the morning of Good Friday or on any day of Lent. Usually, whole families would participate, customarily [[Fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church|fasting]] for the duration of the rite. It is also undertaken by parish devotional groups.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], the tradition is called ''[[Visita Iglesia]]'' ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], \"church visit\"), where people visit churches to pray, usually reciting the [[Stations of the Cross]]. The Stations are often distributed amongst one, seven, or fourteen churches; the custom until the 1970s was to pray all fourteen in each church. It is a chiefly urban custom, as churches are located closer to each other in [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], and supposedly because it originates in visiting the seven churches of [[Intramuros]] that stood until the 1945 [[Bombing of Manila]].<ref>Of the seven, only [[Manila Cathedral]] and [[San Agustin Church, Manila|San Agust\u00edn Church]] remain ''[[in situ]]'' following the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]].</ref> The original purpose of the ritual was to venerate the [[Blessed Sacrament]] in the [[Altar of Repose]] on Maundy Thursday night, but since no prayers were prescribed (apart from those for the [[Pope]]), the Stations of the Cross were recited. Some Filipino liturgists{{who|date=March 2013}}, however, have sought to revive the original vigil before the Blessed Sacrament, and have composed prayers to guide contemporary worshippers.\n\nIn [[Singapore]], the visiting of churches occurs shortly after the evening Mass of the Last Supper. Prayers at each church consist of seven repetitions of the [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Ave Maria]], and the ''[[Gloria Patri]]''. Due to the new trend of late Mass times (sometimes 7 or 8&nbsp;pm) to allow for more churchgoers, eight churches are the maximum number visited (even in the city area, where these are closer to each other than in outer residential areas) before these close at midnight. A festive atmosphere exists, with the sale of drinks, [[hot cross bun]]s and other local snacks like the traditional ''kueh ko chee''. Observant Catholics have a 'Last Supper' meal in anticipation of the next day's fast.\n\n==See also==\n{{Death of Jesus |Holy Week}}\n* [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]\n* [[Easter Triduum]]\n* [[Friday of Sorrows|Friday of Sorrows (Friday before Palm Sunday)]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[wikt:maundy|Maundy]]\n* [[Paschal cycle]]\n* [[Tenebrae (service)]]\n* [[Thursday of the Dead]]\n* [[Tristis est anima mea (responsory)]], second responsory for the Tenebrae at Maundy Thursday\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{CathEncy|wstitle=Maundy Thursday}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|Maundy Thursday}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-homily-for-chrism-mass-full-text Pope Francis, \"Homily for Chrism Mass\", ''News.va'', March 28, 2013]\n* [http://www.saintcd.com/2017/04/09/chrism-mass-its-symbols-and-their-meaning/ Cosentino, Tony. \"Chrism Mass: its Symbols and Their Meaning\", Diocese of St. Catherine's, Ontario]\n\n{{-}}\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Philippine national holidays}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Thursday observances]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:April observances]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Greece]]\n[[Category:Greek traditions]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Honduras]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Peru]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Spain]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Venezuela]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Iceland]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Norway]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Christian holiday commemorating the Last Supper}}\n{{About||the 2006 film|Maundy Thursday (film)}}\n{{redirect|Holy Thursday}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Infobox holiday\n|holiday_name = Maundy Thursday\n|image = Simon ushakov last supper 1685.jpg\n|caption = ''The Mystical Supper'', [[Icon]] by [[Simon Ushakov]] (1685)\n|nickname = Holy Thursday<br />Covenant Thursday<br />Great and Holy Thursday<br />Thursday of Mysteries<br />Shere from the word shere (meaning \"clean\" or \"bright\") or Sheer Thursday\n|observedby = Christians\n|date{{LASTYEAR}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{LASTYEAR}}}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{LASTYEAR}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|date{{CURRENTYEAR}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{CURRENTYEAR}} |cite=y}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{CURRENTYEAR}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|date{{NEXTYEAR}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR}}}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|date{{NEXTYEAR|2}} = {{Unbulleted list \n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR|2}}}} (Western)\n  | {{Moveable date |holiday=Maundy Thursday (Eastern) |format=infobox |year={{NEXTYEAR|2}}}} (Eastern) }}\n|observances = [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]; distribution of [[Maundy money]]\n|type = [[Christianity|Christian]] / [[Civic holiday|Civic]]\n|significance = Commemorates the [[Foot washing|Maundy]] and [[Last Supper]] of [[Jesus Christ]]\n|relatedto = [[Holy Week]]\n|frequency = annual\n|duration = 1 day\n}}\n'''Maundy Thursday''' (also known as '''Holy Thursday''', '''Covenant Thursday''', '''Great and Holy Thursday''', '''Sheer Thursday''', and '''Thursday of Mysteries''', among other names) is the Christian holy day falling on the Thursday before [[Easter]].

It takes place after the reading of the fifth gospel during the singing of \"Today He Who Hung\". During this procession, a large cross with the body of Christ is carried throughout the church while lights are extinguished, bells are slowly tolled, and the faithful prostrate themselves. The cross, with Christ's body hung upon it, is placed in front of the Royal Doors. The icon of Christ on the cross (sometimes with nails affixing it) is struck upon the hands and feet with a stone multiple times, and is then stood up in front of the church, where it is censed.\n* In some Slavic traditions, a lesser procession is made after the Twelve Passion Gospels immediately prior to the dismissal with an icon of Christ's crucifixion which is placed on the central icon stand, where it is censed by the clergy, and then venerated.\n\n====Oriental Orthodoxy====\n{{Empty section|date=March 2018}}\nOriental Orthodoxy including Coptic (Egyptian) and Ethiopian Orthodoxy which is under papacy of Pope Tawadros II The Copts celebrate Covenant Thursday on 16 April which is 1 week after the Catholics celebrate it.

It is because the typical meals of this day were made of fresh, green vegetables etc. From that day there is no usage of the [[church bell]]s until [[Holy Saturday]], here called \"White Saturday\", because \"they have flown to [[Rome]]\" (a euphemism), in some regions they are replaced by groups of children walking round their village (or around the church) and making noise with wooden rattles. This is to announce to the people approaching beginning of the liturgy and call the people to the church.\n* The tradition of silent bells is found also in [[Luxembourg]]: the bells fall silent until Easter, because \"they have flown to Rome for Confession\", so children take to the streets, calling people to church with melancholy wooden rattling.<ref>Festivals of Western Europe, by Dorothy Gladys Spicer, 1958</ref>\n* In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], the day is called ''Witte Donderdag'' (White Thursday) referring to the [[liturgical colour]] of the day.\n* In [[Malta]], Holy Thursday is known as ''\u0126amis ix-Xirka'' (Communion Thursday) and the tradition of [[Seven Churches Visitation|visiting seven churches]] (see below) is called ''is-seba' visti'' or is-Sepulkri.\n* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Maundy Thursday is ''Dydd Iau Cablyd''.\n* In [[Sweden]] Maundy Thursday (sk\u00e4rtorsdagen) is connected to old folklore as the day of the witches. Young children often dress up as witches and knock on doors getting coins or candy for easter eggs.\n* In [[Bulgaria]] Maundy Thursday is called ''Veliki Chetvurtuk'' (Great Thursday), and is traditionally the day when people color their easter eggs and perform other household chores geared toward preparing for ''Razpeti Petuk'' (Crucifixion Friday), ''Velika Subota'' (Great Saturday) and ''Velikden'' (Easter Day).\n* In [[Kerala]] State in [[India]], the day is called as ''[[Pesaha]]''(\u0d2a\u0d46\u0d38\u0d39), a [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] word derived from the Aramaic or Syriac word for [[Passover]].

It is made with unleavened flour and they use a sweet drink call ''Pesaha Paal'' made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread. On the Pesaha night the bread is steamed in a new vessel, immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out the steam so that the bread will not rise. This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members after prayers. In some families, ''Pesaha Paal'' a creamy dip made up of jaggery and coconut milk is used along with the Pesaha bread. If the family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but some of the Saint Thomas Christian neighbours share their bread with them.<ref>Sunish George J Alumkalnal, (2013). \"[https://www.nasrani.net/2012/11/11/pesaha-celebration-of-nasranis-a-socio-cultural-analysis/ Pesaha celebration of Nasranis: a sociocultural analysis].\" ''Journal of Indo Judaic studies'' '''13''', pp.&nbsp;57\u201371</ref> The Saint Thomas Christians diaspora also celebrate this day by having Holy Communion services in the parishes according to their respective liturgies. The tradition of washing feet by priests is practiced in every parish commemorating [[Jesus]] washing the feet of his disciples symbolizing humbleness.\n* In the [[Philippines]], the day is officially known as ''Huwebes Santo'' or \"Maundy Thursday\" (the term \"Holy Thursday\" is rarely used). Most businesses are closed during the [[Easter Triduum]], with shopping malls opening on Black Saturday.

It is also undertaken by parish devotional groups.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], the tradition is called ''[[Visita Iglesia]]'' ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], \"church visit\"), where people visit churches to pray, usually reciting the [[Stations of the Cross]]. The Stations are often distributed amongst one, seven, or fourteen churches; the custom until the 1970s was to pray all fourteen in each church. It is a chiefly urban custom, as churches are located closer to each other in [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], and supposedly because it originates in visiting the seven churches of [[Intramuros]] that stood until the 1945 [[Bombing of Manila]].<ref>Of the seven, only [[Manila Cathedral]] and [[San Agustin Church, Manila|San Agust\u00edn Church]] remain ''[[in situ]]'' following the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]].</ref> The original purpose of the ritual was to venerate the [[Blessed Sacrament]] in the [[Altar of Repose]] on Maundy Thursday night, but since no prayers were prescribed (apart from those for the [[Pope]]), the Stations of the Cross were recited. Some Filipino liturgists{{who|date=March 2013}}, however, have sought to revive the original vigil before the Blessed Sacrament, and have composed prayers to guide contemporary worshippers.\n\nIn [[Singapore]], the visiting of churches occurs shortly after the evening Mass of the Last Supper. Prayers at each church consist of seven repetitions of the [[Lord's Prayer]], [[Ave Maria]], and the ''[[Gloria Patri]]''. Due to the new trend of late Mass times (sometimes 7 or 8&nbsp;pm) to allow for more churchgoers, eight churches are the maximum number visited (even in the city area, where these are closer to each other than in outer residential areas) before these close at midnight. A festive atmosphere exists, with the sale of drinks, [[hot cross bun]]s and other local snacks like the traditional ''kueh ko chee''. Observant Catholics have a 'Last Supper' meal in anticipation of the next day's fast.\n\n==See also==\n{{Death of Jesus |Holy Week}}\n* [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]]\n* [[Easter Triduum]]\n* [[Friday of Sorrows|Friday of Sorrows (Friday before Palm Sunday)]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[wikt:maundy|Maundy]]\n* [[Paschal cycle]]\n* [[Tenebrae (service)]]\n* [[Thursday of the Dead]]\n* [[Tristis est anima mea (responsory)]], second responsory for the Tenebrae at Maundy Thursday\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{CathEncy|wstitle=Maundy Thursday}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|Maundy Thursday}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-homily-for-chrism-mass-full-text Pope Francis, \"Homily for Chrism Mass\", ''News.va'', March 28, 2013]\n* [http://www.saintcd.com/2017/04/09/chrism-mass-its-symbols-and-their-meaning/ Cosentino, Tony. \"Chrism Mass: its Symbols and Their Meaning\", Diocese of St. Catherine's, Ontario]\n\n{{-}}\n{{Easter}}\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Philippine national holidays}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Thursday observances]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:April observances]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Greece]]\n[[Category:Greek traditions]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Colombia]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Honduras]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Peru]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Spain]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Venezuela]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Iceland]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Norway]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maundy_Thursday"}
