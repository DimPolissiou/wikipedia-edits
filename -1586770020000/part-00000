Each presidency maintained its own army, and it was not until the end of the 19th century that a unified command was established for the British Indian Army. For more than fifty years, the [[Madras Army]] was engaged in the struggle for control of [[South India]] and was largely responsible for the British defeat of [[Tipu Sultan]] and the [[French India|French]]. It also took an active part in the wars against the [[Maratha Empire|Mahrattas]], dispatched a number of overseas expeditions and played a major role in the conquest and pacification of [[Burma]].<ref name=\"Ahmad 2006\">Ahmad, Maj RN, and Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (2006). ''Unfaded Glory: The 8th Punjab Regiment 1798\u20131956''. Abbottabad: The Baloch Regimental Centre.</ref> The Baloch Regiment's Madrassi origins are derived from the five battalions it inherited from 8th Punjab Regiment in 1956. The 1st Battalion was raised in 1798 at [[Masulipatam]], as 3rd Extra Battalion of Madras Native Infantry and was known as ''MacLeod ki Paltan'' (MacLeod\u2019s Battalion) after the officer, who raised it. It was designated as 1st Battalion 15th Regiment in 1800, and 29th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry in 1824. The battalion was dispatched to [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] to suppress a [[Kandyan Wars#The third war (1817\u20131818)|rebellion of the Sinhalese]] in 1818. In 1832, it was stationed at [[Malacca]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], when it was again engaged in suppressing a revolt in the State of [[Naning]].<ref name=\"Ahmad 2012\">Ahmad, Lt Col Rifat Nadeem. (2012). ''The Gallant One: War Services of First Battalion The Baloch Regiment''. Rawalpindi: The Battalion.</ref> 2, 3, 4 & 5 Baloch were also raised as battalions of Madras Infantry in 1799\u20131800. In 1824, they were designated as the 30th, 31st, 32nd & 33rd Madras Native Infantry respectively. The 30th & 32nd Regiments took part in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War|First Burma War]], while the 30th, 31st & 33rd fought in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War|Third Anglo-Mahratta War]] of 1817. The 31st Regiment, then known as 1st Battalion 16th Regiment (or [[Trichinopoly]] [[Light Infantry]]), greatly distinguished itself at the [[Battle of Mahidpur]]. It was styled as Light Infantry in 1811, as reward for a 25-mile forced march in support of a retreating force; when it arrived just in time to turn the tables in a minor engagement near [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]]. The 33rd Regiment first made its name in the [[Travancore War]] in 1809, when the battalion repulsed a force of 3000 rebels at Cochin. All four battalions saw considerable action in [[Central India Campaign (1858)|Central India]] against the Marathas during the Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]-58.<ref>Phythian-Adams, Lt Col EG.

Watercolour by Alex Hunter, 1846.jpg|thumb|right|[[89th Punjabis|29th Madras Native Infantry]] (1 Baloch).<br>Watercolour by Alex Hunter, 1846.|215px]]\nBetween 1890 and 1893, the five battalions were moved to Burma and reconstituted with Punjabi Muslims, [[Sikh]]s and other North Indians. Their designations were changed to 29th (7th Burma Battalion), 30th (5th Burma Battalion), 31st (6th Burma Battalion), 32nd (4th Burma Battalion) and 33rd (3rd Burma Battalion) Regiments of Madras Infantry. In 1901, these cumbersome titles were simplified by removing all mention of Madras and the five regiments were styled as the 29th and 30th Burma Infantry, 31st Burma Light Infantry, 32nd and 33rd Burma Infantry. These Burma Battalions were created to police the new territories acquired in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Third Burma War]] and pacify the rebellious hill tribes inhabiting the frontier regions of Burma. In 1903, all Madras regiments had sixty added to their numbers, requiring another change in designation to [[89th Punjabis|89th]] and [[90th Punjabis]], [[91st Punjabis (Light Infantry)]], [[92nd Punjabis]] and [[93rd Burma Infantry]]. After the [[First World War]], the five Burma Battalions were grouped together to form the 8th Punjab Regiment in 1922. These frontier battalions had adopted uniforms of drab colour (a pinkish shade of [[khaki]]) when they moved to Burma and the 8th Punjab Regiment retained drab as its regimental colour with blue facings.<ref name=\"Ahmad 2006\"/>\n\n===The Bombay Army===\nThe senior battalion of what became the [[10th Baluch Regiment]] in 1922, was raised in 1820, as the 2nd (Marine) Battalion 12th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. In 1838, as the 24th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, it stormed and captured the city of [[Colony of Aden|Aden]] ([[Yemen]]) as part of a punitive expedition sent to rid the area of pirates. The 26th Bombay Native Infantry was raised in 1825, as the 2nd Extra Battalion of Bombay Native Infantry, changing its name a year later. In 1843, the British conquered [[Sindh]] after defeating the ruling confederacy of Baloch chieftains. General [[Charles James Napier|Sir Charles Napier]], the British commander, was much impressed by the ferocious courage of his Balochi opponents and decided to recruit them for local service within Sindh. As a result, two irregular battalions of [[Bombay Army]], the 1st and 2nd Belooch (old spelling of Baluch) Battalions were raised in 1844 and 1846 at [[Karachi]]. In 1856, the 2nd Belooch Battalion was dispatched to fight in the [[Anglo-Persian War|Persian War in 1856\u201357]], a campaign frequently overshadowed by the events of the Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Meanwhile, the 1st Belooch Battalion was dispatched on foot across the Sindh desert in May, to join the siege artillery train on its way to [[Siege of Delhi|Delhi]]; the only Bombay unit to join the Delhi Field Force. The battalion was brought into line in 1861, for its services in North India and it became the 27th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry in the post-Mutiny realignment. 2nd Belooch, in the meantime, had qualified for a similar change in status and became the 29th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry.<ref name=\"Gaylor 1991\">{{cite book|last=Gaylor|first=John|title=Sons of John Company: The Indian and Pakistan Armies 1903\u201391|publisher=Stroud: Spellmount|year=1991}}</ref><ref name=\"Cadell, Sir Patrick 1938\">Cadell, Sir Patrick.

The system was widely practised in the Indian Cavalry.

These battalions soon earned a formidable reputation in and around [[Jacobabad]] for keeping the peace on the Sindh frontier. In 1861, the first of these was accorded regular status, becoming the 30th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry or Jacob's Rifles, while the second was disbanded.<ref name=\"Cadell, Sir Patrick 1938\"/>\nIn 1862, the 2nd Beloochees went to [[China]] to suppress the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. Two years later, they became the first foreign troops to be stationed in [[Japan]], when two companies were sent to [[Yokohama]] to guard the British legation. Meanwhile, the 1st Beloochees greatly distinguished themselves in the long and arduous [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|Abyssinian Campaign]] of 1868 and were made Light Infantry as a reward. All Baloch battalions took part in the [[Second Afghan War]] of 1878\u201380, where the Jacob's Rifles suffered heavy casualties at the [[Battle of Maiwand]]. The 1st Belooch Regiment again distinguished itself in 1885\u201387 during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Third Burma War]]. In 1891, the 24th and 26th Bombay Infantry also became 'Balochi', when they were reconstituted with [[Pathans]], [[Balochis]] and [[Hazaras]], and localized in Baluchistan; becoming the 24th and 26th (Baluchistan) Regiments of Bombay Infantry. The 24th and 27th Regiments saw active service in [[British East Africa]] in 1896\u201399, while the 26th and Jacob's Rifles went to China in 1900 to suppress the [[Boxer Rebellion]].\n\nIn 1903, the 24th, 26th, 27th, 29th, and 30th had one hundred added to their numbers as part of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s [[Kitchener Reforms|reforms]], emerging as the [[124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry]], [[126th Baluchistan Infantry]], [[127th Baluch Light Infantry]], [[129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis]] and [[130th Baluchis|130th Jacob\u2019s Baluchis]].<ref name=\"Gaylor 1991\"/><ref name=\"Cadell, Sir Patrick 1938\"/><ref name=\"Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin 1998\">Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin.

These forces were engaged in support of the British during the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1848\u201349 and the Great Rebellion of 1857. In 1889, a small force from Bahawalpur was accepted as [[Imperial Service Troops]], placing them at the disposal of the British for use in emergencies. However, it was not until the 20th century that these units began training on modern lines. In 1901, [[Bahawalpur State]] raised a camel baggage train with an escort of mounted infantry, called the Bahawalpur Imperial Service Mounted Rifles and Camel Transport Corps, which would go on to become the 1st Bahawalpur Sadiq Battalion in 1924. In 1912, the colour of their uniform was khaki with green facings.<ref name=\"Head, RW. 1981\">Head, RW. (1981).

At [[Hollebeke]], during the First Ypres, Sepoy [[Khudadad Khan]] became the first Indian to win the Victoria Cross; Britain's highest decoration for valour. Prior to 1911, Indian soldiers were not eligible for the Victoria Cross. The battalion would go on to serve with distinction in German East Africa alongside 127th QMO Baluch Light Infantry and 130th KGO Baluchis.

The Balochis and Brahuis are two of the main ethnic groups of Balochistan Province of Pakistan. Balochis also constitute a major part of the population of Sindh Province and Southern Punjab. However, in 1925, Balochis and Brahuis were replaced with Hindu [[Dogra]]s because of the difficulty encountered in their recruitment during the war. During the inter-war period, the regiment saw continuous employment on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)#1919\u20131939 (between the wars)|North West Frontier of India]], keeping it in fighting trim for the great test ahead.<ref name=\"Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin 1998\"/>\n\nThe distinctive rifle green and red uniform of the old Baluch battalions was adopted by the entire regiment. The officers wore a red boss surmounted by a silver 'X' on field and forage caps, while the old battalion badges were worn on pagris and helmets by the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th Battalions. It was not until 1945 that a single cap badge was adopted by the regiment on introduction of [[beret]]s during the [[Second World War]]. It consisted of the Roman numeral 'X' within a crescent moon, a Tudor crown above and the title scroll below, all in white metal.

Each presidency maintained its own army, and it was not until the end of the 19th century that a unified command was established for the British Indian Army. For more than fifty years, the [[Madras Army]] was engaged in the struggle for control of [[South India]] and was largely responsible for the British defeat of [[Tipu Sultan]] and the [[French India|French]]. It also took an active part in the wars against the [[Maratha Empire|Mahrattas]], dispatched a number of overseas expeditions and played a major role in the conquest and pacification of [[Burma]].<ref name=\"Ahmad 2006\">Ahmad, Maj RN, and Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin. (2006). ''Unfaded Glory: The 8th Punjab Regiment 1798\u20131956''. Abbottabad: The Baloch Regimental Centre.</ref> The Baloch Regiment's Madrassi origins are derived from the five battalions it inherited from 8th Punjab Regiment in 1956. The 1st Battalion was raised in 1798 at [[Masulipatam]], as 3rd Extra Battalion of Madras Native Infantry and was known as ''MacLeod ki Paltan'' (MacLeod\u2019s Battalion) after the officer, who raised it. It was designated as 1st Battalion 15th Regiment in 1800, and 29th Regiment of Madras Native Infantry in 1824. The battalion was dispatched to [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] to suppress a [[Kandyan Wars#The third war (1817\u20131818)|rebellion of the Sinhalese]] in 1818. In 1832, it was stationed at [[Malacca]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], when it was again engaged in suppressing a revolt in the State of [[Naning]].<ref name=\"Ahmad 2012\">Ahmad, Lt Col Rifat Nadeem. (2012). ''The Gallant One: War Services of First Battalion The Baloch Regiment''. Rawalpindi: The Battalion.</ref> 2, 3, 4 & 5 Baloch were also raised as battalions of Madras Infantry in 1799\u20131800. In 1824, they were designated as the 30th, 31st, 32nd & 33rd Madras Native Infantry respectively. The 30th & 32nd Regiments took part in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War|First Burma War]], while the 30th, 31st & 33rd fought in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War|Third Anglo-Mahratta War]] of 1817. The 31st Regiment, then known as 1st Battalion 16th Regiment (or [[Trichinopoly]] [[Light Infantry]]), greatly distinguished itself at the [[Battle of Mahidpur]]. It was styled as Light Infantry in 1811, as reward for a 25-mile forced march in support of a retreating force; when it arrived just in time to turn the tables in a minor engagement near [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]]. The 33rd Regiment first made its name in the [[Travancore War]] in 1809, when the battalion repulsed a force of 3000 rebels at Cochin. All four battalions saw considerable action in [[Central India Campaign (1858)|Central India]] against the Marathas during the Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]-58.<ref>Phythian-Adams, Lt Col EG.

Watercolour by Alex Hunter, 1846.jpg|thumb|right|[[89th Punjabis|29th Madras Native Infantry]] (1 Baloch).<br>Watercolour by Alex Hunter, 1846.|215px]]\nBetween 1890 and 1893, the five battalions were moved to Burma and reconstituted with Punjabi Muslims, [[Sikh]]s and other North Indians. Their designations were changed to 29th (7th Burma Battalion), 30th (5th Burma Battalion), 31st (6th Burma Battalion), 32nd (4th Burma Battalion) and 33rd (3rd Burma Battalion) Regiments of Madras Infantry. In 1901, these cumbersome titles were simplified by removing all mention of Madras and the five regiments were styled as the 29th and 30th Burma Infantry, 31st Burma Light Infantry, 32nd and 33rd Burma Infantry. These Burma Battalions were created to police the new territories acquired in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Third Burma War]] and pacify the rebellious hill tribes inhabiting the frontier regions of Burma. In 1903, all Madras regiments had sixty added to their numbers, requiring another change in designation to [[89th Punjabis|89th]] and [[90th Punjabis]], [[91st Punjabis (Light Infantry)]], [[92nd Punjabis]] and [[93rd Burma Infantry]]. After the [[First World War]], the five Burma Battalions were grouped together to form the 8th Punjab Regiment in 1922. These frontier battalions had adopted uniforms of drab colour (a pinkish shade of [[khaki]]) when they moved to Burma and the 8th Punjab Regiment retained drab as its regimental colour with blue facings.<ref name=\"Ahmad 2006\"/>\n\n===The Bombay Army===\nThe senior battalion of what became the [[10th Baluch Regiment]] in 1922, was raised in 1820, as the 2nd (Marine) Battalion 12th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. In 1838, as the 24th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, it stormed and captured the city of [[Colony of Aden|Aden]] ([[Yemen]]) as part of a punitive expedition sent to rid the area of pirates. The 26th Bombay Native Infantry was raised in 1825, as the 2nd Extra Battalion of Bombay Native Infantry, changing its name a year later. In 1843, the British conquered [[Sindh]] after defeating the ruling confederacy of Baloch chieftains. General [[Charles James Napier|Sir Charles Napier]], the British commander, was much impressed by the ferocious courage of his Balochi opponents and decided to recruit them for local service within Sindh. As a result, two irregular battalions of [[Bombay Army]], the 1st and 2nd Belooch (old spelling of Baluch) Battalions were raised in 1844 and 1846 at [[Karachi]]. In 1856, the 2nd Belooch Battalion was dispatched to fight in the [[Anglo-Persian War|Persian War in 1856\u201357]], a campaign frequently overshadowed by the events of the Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Meanwhile, the 1st Belooch Battalion was dispatched on foot across the Sindh desert in May, to join the siege artillery train on its way to [[Siege of Delhi|Delhi]]; the only Bombay unit to join the Delhi Field Force. The battalion was brought into line in 1861, for its services in North India and it became the 27th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry in the post-Mutiny realignment. 2nd Belooch, in the meantime, had qualified for a similar change in status and became the 29th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry.<ref name=\"Gaylor 1991\">{{cite book|last=Gaylor|first=John|title=Sons of John Company: The Indian and Pakistan Armies 1903\u201391|publisher=Stroud: Spellmount|year=1991}}</ref><ref name=\"Cadell, Sir Patrick 1938\">Cadell, Sir Patrick.

These battalions soon earned a formidable reputation in and around [[Jacobabad]] for keeping the peace on the Sindh frontier. In 1861, the first of these was accorded regular status, becoming the 30th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry or Jacob's Rifles, while the second was disbanded.<ref name=\"Cadell, Sir Patrick 1938\"/>\nIn 1862, the 2nd Beloochees went to [[China]] to suppress the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. Two years later, they became the first foreign troops to be stationed in [[Japan]], when two companies were sent to [[Yokohama]] to guard the British legation. Meanwhile, the 1st Beloochees greatly distinguished themselves in the long and arduous [[1868 Expedition to Abyssinia|Abyssinian Campaign]] of 1868 and were made Light Infantry as a reward. All Baloch battalions took part in the [[Second Afghan War]] of 1878\u201380, where the Jacob's Rifles suffered heavy casualties at the [[Battle of Maiwand]]. The 1st Belooch Regiment again distinguished itself in 1885\u201387 during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Third Burma War]]. In 1891, the 24th and 26th Bombay Infantry also became 'Balochi', when they were reconstituted with [[Pathans]], [[Balochis]] and [[Hazaras]], and localized in Baluchistan; becoming the 24th and 26th (Baluchistan) Regiments of Bombay Infantry. The 24th and 27th Regiments saw active service in [[British East Africa]] in 1896\u201399, while the 26th and Jacob's Rifles went to China in 1900 to suppress the [[Boxer Rebellion]].\n\nIn 1903, the 24th, 26th, 27th, 29th, and 30th had one hundred added to their numbers as part of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s [[Kitchener Reforms|reforms]], emerging as the [[124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry]], [[126th Baluchistan Infantry]], [[127th Baluch Light Infantry]], [[129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis]] and [[130th Baluchis|130th Jacob\u2019s Baluchis]].<ref name=\"Gaylor 1991\"/><ref name=\"Cadell, Sir Patrick 1938\"/><ref name=\"Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin 1998\">Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin.

These forces were engaged in support of the British during the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1848\u201349 and the Great Rebellion of 1857. In 1889, a small force from Bahawalpur was accepted as [[Imperial Service Troops]], placing them at the disposal of the British for use in emergencies. However, it was not until the 20th century that these units began training on modern lines. In 1901, [[Bahawalpur State]] raised a camel baggage train with an escort of mounted infantry, called the Bahawalpur Imperial Service Mounted Rifles and Camel Transport Corps, which would go on to become the 1st Bahawalpur Sadiq Battalion in 1924. In 1912, the colour of their uniform was khaki with green facings.<ref name=\"Head, RW. 1981\">Head, RW. (1981).

At [[Hollebeke]], during the First Ypres, Sepoy [[Khudadad Khan]] became the first Indian to win the Victoria Cross; Britain's highest decoration for valour.

These included Aden, where they carried out the first opposed sea-borne assault landing in modern warfare, Egypt, Gallipoli, France, Mesopotamia, [[Mohmand Blockade|North-West Frontier of India]], Salonika and Russian [[Transcaucasia]].<ref name=\"Ahmad 2012\"/><ref>Geoghegan, Col NM, and Campbell, Capt MHA.

The Balochis and Brahuis are two of the main ethnic groups of Balochistan Province of Pakistan. Balochis also constitute a major part of the population of Sindh Province and Southern Punjab. However, in 1925, Balochis and Brahuis were replaced with Hindu [[Dogra]]s because of the difficulty encountered in their recruitment during the war. During the inter-war period, the regiment saw continuous employment on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)#1919\u20131939 (between the wars)|North West Frontier of India]], keeping it in fighting trim for the great test ahead.<ref name=\"Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin 1998\"/>\n\nThe distinctive rifle green and red uniform of the old Baluch battalions was adopted by the entire regiment. The officers wore a red boss surmounted by a silver 'X' on field and forage caps, while the old battalion badges were worn on pagris and helmets by the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th Battalions. It was not until 1945 that a single cap badge was adopted by the regiment on introduction of [[beret]]s during the [[Second World War]]. It consisted of the Roman numeral 'X' within a crescent moon, a Tudor crown above and the title scroll below, all in white metal. The badges of rank were in black metal with red cloth edging, while the [[lanyard]] was of rifle green cord with two red runners. Another distinctive feature of Baluchi uniforms were plain silver ball buttons worn on service and mess dresses.<ref name=\"Poulsom and Ahmad 2011\"/><ref>''Dress Regulations (India) 1931''.

In light of the association of the constituent regiments with Burma, it was appropriate that the new regiment should adopt [[Chinthe]] \u2013 the mythical Burmese lion-dragon guardian of Buddhist [[pagoda]]s, as its emblem in 1927. The cap badge was in white metal with blue backing, while the badges of rank were in [[gilding metal]]. The uniform was of drab colour with blue facings. The lanyard was also of drab colour.<ref name=\"Ahmad 2006\"/>\n\nIn 1917, '''Bahawalpur''' State raised the Imperial Service Double Company, which was designated as 2nd Bahawalpur Household Infantry in 1922 and redesignated as 2nd Bahawalpur Haroon Infantry a year later. In 1921, Bahawalpur joined the Indian State Forces Scheme, placing its two infantry battalions at the disposal of the Government of India. The '''Bahawalpur Infantry''' was mostly composed of Punjabi Muslims. Their uniforms underwent numerous changes, until settling for grey colour in 1930.<ref name=\"Head, RW. 1981\"/><ref name=\"Ahmed, Maj Gen Rafiuddin 2000\"/> Ceremonial headdress included the distinctive '[[fez (hat)|fez]]', which was unique to the Bahawalpur State Forces.

It has also visited foreign countries such as [[Jordan]] and [[Turkey]] in 1976 and 1981 respectively. Protocol activities it participates in include the [[Pakistan Day]] Parade, accreditation ceremonies for the [[President of Pakistan]] as well as public events such as the [[South Asian Federation Games]] (where the band performed in 1989 and 2004). In addition to the Band, the Army School of Music, which was raised in Abbottabad in 1956, was linked with the Baloch Regimental Centre from 1965 to

Indian media was active since the late 18th century. The print media started in India as early as 1780. Radio broadcasting began in 1927. Indian media is among the oldest in the world. It dates back even before the reign of [[Ashoka]]. Media in India has been free and independent throughout most of its history. However, there have been periods when it was muzzled. The period of emergency (1975\u20131977), declared by [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], was the brief period when India's media was faced with potential government retribution.<ref>http://www.nimc-india.com/history-mass-media-india.html</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=History of Mass Media in India |url=http://www.nimc-india.com/history-mass-media-india.html |publisher=[[National Institute of Mass Communication]] |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> Many of the media are controlled by large, for-profit corporations, which reap revenue from [[advertising]], [[subscriptions]], and sale of [[copyright]]ed material.

It ensures that the Indian press is free and responsible. If the press is to function effectively as the watchdog of public interest, it must have a secure freedom of expression, unfettered and unhindered by any authority, organised bodies or individuals. It ensures that the press must, therefore, scrupulously adhere to accepted norms of journalistic ethics and maintain high standards of professional conduct.\n \nWhere the norms are breached and the freedom is defiled by unprofessional conduct, a way must exist to check and control it. But, control by the government or official authorities may prove destructive of this freedom. Therefore, the best way is to let the peers of the profession, assisted by a few discerning laymen to regulate it through a properly structured representative impartial machinery. Hence, the Press Council of India was established.<ref>http://presscouncil.nic.in/Content/29_3_History.aspx</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe traditional print media, but also the television media, are largely family-owned and often partake in [[self-censorship]], primarily due to political ties by the owner and the [[The Establishment|establishment]]. However, the [[new media]] are generally more professional and corporate-owned, though these, too, have been acquired or affiliated with established figures. At the same time, the Indian media, viewed as \"feisty,\" have also not reported on issues of the media itself.<ref>{{cite web |title='Managing' India's media |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/11/india-media-20131119151238287298.html |website=www.aljazeera.com |accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref> \n\n== Print ==\n[[File:Akashvani Bhavan in New Delhi.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The headquarters of ''[[Doordarshan]]'', for which experimental telecast started in September 1959.

It ensures that the Indian press is free and responsible. If the press is to function effectively as the watchdog of public interest, it must have a secure freedom of expression, unfettered and unhindered by any authority, organised bodies or individuals. It ensures that the press must, therefore, scrupulously adhere to accepted norms of journalistic ethics and maintain high standards of professional conduct.\n \nWhere the norms are breached and the freedom is defiled by unprofessional conduct, a way must exist to check and control it. But, control by the government or official authorities may prove destructive of this freedom. Therefore, the best way is to let the peers of the profession, assisted by a few discerning laymen to regulate it through a properly structured representative impartial machinery. Hence, the Press Council of India was established.<ref>http://presscouncil.nic.in/Content/29_3_History.aspx</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe traditional print media, but also the television media, are largely family-owned and often partake in [[self-censorship]], primarily due to political ties by the owner and the [[The Establishment|establishment]].
