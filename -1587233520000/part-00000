Lind]], combined arms can be distinguished from the concept of \"supporting arms\" as follows:\n<blockquote>Combined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him more vulnerable to another. In contrast, supporting arms is hitting the enemy with two or more arms in sequence, or if simultaneously, then in such combination that the actions the enemy must take to defend himself from one also defends himself from the other(s).<ref>{{cite book |title=Maneuver Warfare Handbook|author=Lind, William S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdHDg-IunLoC |page=12 |publisher=Westview Press |date=1985}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough the lower-[[Military rank|echelon]] units of a combined arms team may be of similar types, a balanced mixture of such units are combined into an effective higher-echelon unit, whether formally in a table of organization or informally in an ''[[ad hoc]]'' solution to a battlefield problem. For example, an [[armored division]]\u2014the modern paragon of combined arms doctrine\u2014consists of a mixture of [[infantry]], [[tank]], [[artillery]], [[reconnaissance]], and perhaps even [[helicopter]] units, all coordinated and directed by a unified [[command structure]].<ref>{{cite media |url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLorCiYziMQ-j08Z5o6U-0g |medium=video |title=Combined Arms Breach |publisher=OEC G&V |year=c. 2015 |quote=This visualization was developed for the Maneuver Center of Excellence and is closely based upon the National Training Center Breach and Assault exercise executed circa 1990. This visualization demonstrates viable TTPs as discussed in ATTP 3-90-4 for the conduct of the combined arms breach against a hypothetical enemy.}}</ref>\n\nAlso, most modern military units can, if the situation requires it, call on yet more branches of the military, such as infantry requesting bombing or shelling by [[military aircraft|fighter or bomber aircraft]] or [[navy|naval forces]] to augment their ground offensive or protect their land forces. The mixing of arms is sometimes pushed down below the level where homogeneity ordinarily prevails, for example by temporarily attaching a tank company to an infantry battalion.\n\n==Ancient warfare==\nCombined arms operations date back to antiquity, where armies would usually field a screen of [[skirmisher]]s to protect their spearmen during the approach to contact. Especially in the case of the Greek [[hoplites]], however, the focus of military thinking lay almost exclusively on the heavy infantry. In more elaborate situations armies of various nationalities fielded different combinations of light, medium, or heavy infantry, cavalry, chariotry, camelry, elephantry, and artillery (mechanical weapons). Combined arms in this context was how to best use the cooperating units, variously armed with side-arms, spears, or missile weapons in order to coordinate an attack to disrupt and then destroy the enemy.\n\n[[Philip II of Macedon]] greatly improved upon the limited combined arms tactics of the Greek city-states and combined the newly created Macedonian phalanx with heavy cavalry and other forces. The phalanx would hold the opposing line in place, until the heavy cavalry could smash and break the enemy line by achieving [[local superiority]].\n\nThe pre-Marian [[Roman Legion]] was a combined arms force and consisted of five classes of troops. Lightly equipped [[velites]] acted as skirmishers armed with light javelins. The [[hastati]] and [[principes]] formed the main attacking strength of the legion with sword and [[pilum]], whilst the [[triarii]] formed the defensive backbone of the legion fighting as a [[phalanx]] with long spears and large shields. The fifth class were the [[equites]] (the cavalry) used for scouting, pursuit and to guard the flanks.\n\nAfter the [[Marian reforms]] the Legion was notionally a unit of heavy infantrymen armed with just [[gladius|sword]] and [[pilum]], and fielded with a small attached auxiliary skirmishers and missile troops, and incorporated a small cavalry unit.\n\nThe legion was sometimes also incorporated into a higher-echelon combined arms unit \u2014 e.g., in one period it was customary for a general to command two legions plus two similarly sized units of auxiliaries, lighter units useful as screens or for combat in rough terrain.\n\nThe army of the [[Han Dynasty]] is also an example, fielding m\u00eal\u00e9e infantry, crossbowmen, and cavalry (ranging from horse archers to heavy lancers).\n\nCivilizations such as the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]s and [[Sassanid]]s also were known to have fielded a combination of infantry supported by powerful cavalry.\n\n==Middle Ages==\nAt the [[Battle of Hastings]] (1066) English infantry fighting from behind a shield wall were defeated by a Norman army consisting of archers, infantry and mounted knights (cavalry). One of the tactics used by the Normans was to tempt the English to leave the shield wall to attack retreating Norman infantry only to destroy them in the open with cavalry. Likewise Scottish [[sheltron]]s \u2013 which had been developed to counter the charges by English heavy cavalry, and had been used successfully against English cavalry at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] (1297) \u2013 were destroyed at the [[Battle of Falkirk]] (1298) by English archers acting in concert with mounted knights. Both Hastings and Falkirk showed how combined arms could be used to defeat enemies relying on only one arm.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=John |year=2010 |title=Knights and Heroes, Fantasy and Folklore |id=Set 2 |publisher=ABDO Publishing Company |isbn=9781617842856 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkN6AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA18&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe English victories of [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] were examples of a simple form of combined arms, with a combination of dismounted knights forming a foundation for formations of English [[English longbow|longbowmen]]. The lightly protected longbowmen could down their French opponents at a distance, whilst the armoured men-at-arms could deal with any Frenchmen who made it to the English lines. This is the crux of combined arms: to allow a combination of forces to achieve what would be impossible for its constituent elements to do alone.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages military forces used combined arms as a method of winning battles and furthering a war leader or king's long term goals. Some historians claim that during the Middle Ages there was no strategic or tactical art to military combat. Kelly DeVries uses the Merriam-Webster definition of combat \"as a general military engagement\".<ref name=DeVries1966>{{cite book |author=DeVries, Kelly |year=1996 |title=Infantry Warfare in the early Fourteenth Century |page=18 |location=Rochester, NY |publisher=Boydell Press}}</ref> In the pursuit of a leader's goals and self-interest tactical and strategic thinking was used along with taking advantage of the terrain and weather in choosing when and where to give battle. The simplest example is the combination of different specialties such as archers, infantry, cavalry (knights or shock mounted troops), and even peasant militia. At times, each force fought on its own and won or lost depending on the opposing military competence. During the Middle Ages leaders utilized a combination of these skilled and unskilled forces to win battles. An army that has multiple skills available can engage a larger force that incorporates mainly one or two types of troops. \n\nEach type of military formation \u2013 infantry, archers, cavalry, or peasant \u2013 has certain advantages that the other does not have. Infantry allows a force to hold ground and in the event of overwhelming enemy forces withdraw into terrain that mounted troops cannot maneuver as easily, thus negating the advantage of the horse. Archers provide standoff with their bows or crossbows. Cavalry can maneuver faster and provide fast attack before the enemy has had time to prepare defenses. Peasants are more numerous and cheaper on the royal coffers. Over the long term the army can cross-train and learn the skills of the specialties to increase [[combat effectiveness]]. This is known as a combat multiplier today. The combination of the different skills help provide a commander the flexibility to minimize risk when it comes to engagements. The overall objective of any military force is to fight and win, while also preserving the largest number of combatants to carry on the larger strategic aims of the king. This can be seen in some of the engagements during the Middle Ages.\n\n===Examples of combined arms use in battle===\nThe effective use of combined arms can \u2013 in conjunction with strategic and tactical considerations \u2013 overwhelm opposing forces even numerically superior forces. The use of terrain and weather can also aid in the use of combined arms to bring about the desired results of the commander of a military force.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Kelly |last1=DeVries |first2=Robert Douglas |last2=Smith |title=Medieval Military Technology |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2012}}</ref><ref name=DeVries1966/>\n\n;Crecy-en-Ponthieu:\nMid-1346, at [[Battle of Crecy|the battle of Crecy-en-Ponthieu]], an English army numbering between 3,000\u201320,000&nbsp;mixed troops set up a defensive line for the oncoming French forces numbering nearly 100,000&nbsp;mixed troops. The English being in a defensive position dismounted their knights to augment the infantry forces on the lines of defense. It is unclear from the sources of the location of the English archers, either on the flanks, intermingled with the line troops, or behind the lines; the most likely was that they were formed up along the flanks according to prior positions in previous battles. The French arrived on the battlefield and sent their crossbowmen in advance of the cavalry to assault the English lines. The effectiveness of the crossbowmen was limited by rain having soaked the strings of the crossbows reducing its effectiveness. The English archers had been able to keep their bow strings dry and only used them when the crossbowmen were in range. This led to the massacre of the crossbowmen and a retreat of the survivors who were then trampled by the advancing French cavalry. This also disrupted an already disorganized advance after a long march to the battlefield by the cavalry. The piecemeal assault of the French forces would lead to an English victory.\n\n;Battle of Morgarten:\nIn 1315, Swiss peasants, archers, and infantry [[Battle of Morgarten|at Morgarten were able to ambush]] a larger Austrian force. The Swiss had rebelled against Austrian rule and funneled the Austrian forces into easily defended passes in the Swiss mountains. The peasants and archers on the high ground effectively rained down arrows and rocks to disorganize the Austrian forces and the infantry charged in forcing the advance guard to retreat into the main body causing more confusion, as well as a general military retreat by the Austrian military.\n\n;Battle of Auberoche:\nIn 1345, an English army of about 1,200&nbsp;men had been moving through the P\u00e9rigord region of Gascony.

The Oda army erected [[palisade]]s to protect their [[ashigaru]] [[Tanegashima (gun)|musketeers]] that shot down the Takeda cavalry while their [[samurai]] cut down any enemies who managed to approach [[Melee weapon|melee]] range.\n\nThe 17th century saw increasing use of combined arms at lower (regimental) level. King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] was the proponent of the idea. For fire support he attached teams of \"commanded musketeers\" to cavalry units and fielded light 3-pounder guns to provide infantry units with organic artillery.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the concept of the legion was revived. Legions now consisted of [[musket]]eers, [[light infantry]], [[dragoon]]s and [[artillery]] in a [[brigade]] sized force. These legions often combined professional military personnel with [[militia]]. Perhaps the most notable example is the use of [[light cavalry]], [[light infantry]] and light [[horse artillery]] in advance detachments by France's [[La Grande Arm\u00e9e]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\n===Napoleonic Wars===\nAfter 25&nbsp;years of near continuous warfare, the armies that met at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] were organised in a similar manner\u2013into corps which contained infantry, cavalry and artillery (see [[Order of battle of the Waterloo Campaign]]), and used similar combined arms tactics. Within each corps were divisions of infantry or cavalry made up of brigades and an artillery unit. An army would usually also have reserves of all three arms under the direct command of the army commander which could be sent in support of any corps or division of a corps to increase any arm which the army general considered necessary. The [[Battle of Waterloo#The French cavalry attack|great French cavalry charge]] commanded by [[Marshal Ney]] during the battle failed to break Wellington's squares of infantry and Ney's failure to supplement his cavalry with sufficient horse artillery to break the squares open is usually given as a major contributing factor in the failure.

During the ground assault phase, tanks and other [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]]s supported by attack aircraft swept over remaining forces. The front line moved forward at upwards of 40\u201350&nbsp;km/h at the upper limit of the Army's tracked vehicles.\n\nIn 2000, the US Army began developing a new set of doctrines intended to use information superiority to wage warfare. Six pieces of equipment were crucial for this: [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]], an airborne look-down radar [[JSTARS]], [[GPS]], the lowly [[SINCGARS]] [[VHF]] digital radio, and ruggedized [[Personal computer|PC]]s. The mix is supplemented by satellite photos and passive reception of enemy radio emissions, forward observers with digital target designation, specialized scouting aircraft, anti-artillery radars and [[gun-laying]] software for artillery. Everything feeds into the network.\n\nBased on this doctrine, many US ground vehicles moved across the landscape alone. If they encountered an enemy troop or vehicle concentration, they would assume a defensive posture, lay down as much covering fire as they could, [[target designation|designate the target]]s for requested air and artillery assets. Within a few minutes, on station aircraft would direct their missions to cover the ground vehicle. Within a half-hour heavy attack forces would concentrate to relieve the isolated vehicle. In an hour and a half the relieved vehicle would be resupplied.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Armoured warfare]]\n* [[Battlegroup (army)]]\n* [[Blitzkrieg]]\n* [[Close air support]]\n* [[Organic unit]]\n* [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]]\n* [[Network-centric warfare]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web |last=House |first=Jonathan M. |title=Toward Combined Arms Warfare: A survey of 20th-century tactics, doctrine, and organization |format=pdf |url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/house.pdf |agency=US Army Command General Staff College |publisher=University Press of the Pacific |year=1984}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Perry |first=Roland |title=Monash: The outsider who won a war |publisher=Random House |location=Sydney |year=2004}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Combined Arms}}\n[[Category:Armoured warfare]]\n[[Category:Warfare post-1945]]\n[[Category:Warfare by type]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{expert needed|Military history|reason=Confusing article|date=November 2009}}\n{{confusing|date=November 2009}}\n{{refimprove|date=April 2009}}\n}}\n[[File:Vietnam, Man\u00f6ver, 1963.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Aircraft, infantry and tanks working together, Vietnam War]]\n{{history of war}}\n\n'''Combined arms''' is an approach to [[war]]fare which seeks to integrate different [[combat arms]] of a [[military]] to achieve mutually complementary effects (for example, using infantry and armor in an urban environment, where one supports the other, or both support each other).<ref>{{cite book |title=ADRP 3-0: Unified Land Operations |publisher=Department of the Army |date=16 May 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2014 |pages=1\u201314 |url=http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp3_0.pdf |format=pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322114809/http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp3_0.pdf |archive-date=22 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to strategist [[William S. Lind]], combined arms can be distinguished from the concept of \"supporting arms\" as follows:\n<blockquote>Combined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him more vulnerable to another. In contrast, supporting arms is hitting the enemy with two or more arms in sequence, or if simultaneously, then in such combination that the actions the enemy must take to defend himself from one also defends himself from the other(s).<ref>{{cite book |title=Maneuver Warfare Handbook|author=Lind, William S. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdHDg-IunLoC |page=12 |publisher=Westview Press |date=1985}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough the lower-[[Military rank|echelon]] units of a combined arms team may be of similar types, a balanced mixture of such units are combined into an effective higher-echelon unit, whether formally in a table of organization or informally in an ''[[ad hoc]]'' solution to a battlefield problem. For example, an [[armored division]]\u2014the modern paragon of combined arms doctrine\u2014consists of a mixture of [[infantry]], [[tank]], [[artillery]], [[reconnaissance]], and perhaps even [[helicopter]] units, all coordinated and directed by a unified [[command structure]].<ref>{{cite media |url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLorCiYziMQ-j08Z5o6U-0g |medium=video |title=Combined Arms Breach |publisher=OEC G&V |year=c. 2015 |quote=This visualization was developed for the Maneuver Center of Excellence and is closely based upon the National Training Center Breach and Assault exercise executed circa 1990.

The mixing of arms is sometimes pushed down below the level where homogeneity ordinarily prevails, for example by temporarily attaching a tank company to an infantry battalion.\n\n==Ancient warfare==\nCombined arms operations date back to antiquity, where armies would usually field a screen of [[skirmisher]]s to protect their spearmen during the approach to contact. Especially in the case of the Greek [[hoplites]], however, the focus of military thinking lay almost exclusively on the heavy infantry. In more elaborate situations armies of various nationalities fielded different combinations of light, medium, or heavy infantry, cavalry, chariotry, camelry, elephantry, and artillery (mechanical weapons). Combined arms in this context was how to best use the cooperating units, variously armed with side-arms, spears, or missile weapons in order to coordinate an attack to disrupt and then destroy the enemy.\n\n[[Philip II of Macedon]] greatly improved upon the limited combined arms tactics of the Greek city-states and combined the newly created Macedonian phalanx with heavy cavalry and other forces. The phalanx would hold the opposing line in place, until the heavy cavalry could smash and break the enemy line by achieving [[local superiority]].\n\nThe pre-Marian [[Roman Legion]] was a combined arms force and consisted of five classes of troops. Lightly equipped [[velites]] acted as skirmishers armed with light javelins. The [[hastati]] and [[principes]] formed the main attacking strength of the legion with sword and [[pilum]], whilst the [[triarii]] formed the defensive backbone of the legion fighting as a [[phalanx]] with long spears and large shields. The fifth class were the [[equites]] (the cavalry) used for scouting, pursuit and to guard the flanks.\n\nAfter the [[Marian reforms]] the Legion was notionally a unit of heavy infantrymen armed with just [[gladius|sword]] and [[pilum]], and fielded with a small attached auxiliary skirmishers and missile troops, and incorporated a small cavalry unit.\n\nThe legion was sometimes also incorporated into a higher-echelon combined arms unit \u2014 e.g., in one period it was customary for a general to command two legions plus two similarly sized units of auxiliaries, lighter units useful as screens or for combat in rough terrain.\n\nThe army of the [[Han Dynasty]] is also an example, fielding m\u00eal\u00e9e infantry, crossbowmen, and cavalry (ranging from horse archers to heavy lancers).\n\nCivilizations such as the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]s and [[Sassanid]]s also were known to have fielded a combination of infantry supported by powerful cavalry.\n\n==Middle Ages==\nAt the [[Battle of Hastings]] (1066) English infantry fighting from behind a shield wall were defeated by a Norman army consisting of archers, infantry and mounted knights (cavalry). One of the tactics used by the Normans was to tempt the English to leave the shield wall to attack retreating Norman infantry only to destroy them in the open with cavalry. Likewise Scottish [[sheltron]]s \u2013 which had been developed to counter the charges by English heavy cavalry, and had been used successfully against English cavalry at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] (1297) \u2013 were destroyed at the [[Battle of Falkirk]] (1298) by English archers acting in concert with mounted knights. Both Hastings and Falkirk showed how combined arms could be used to defeat enemies relying on only one arm.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=John |year=2010 |title=Knights and Heroes, Fantasy and Folklore |id=Set 2 |publisher=ABDO Publishing Company |isbn=9781617842856 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LkN6AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA18&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe English victories of [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] were examples of a simple form of combined arms, with a combination of dismounted knights forming a foundation for formations of English [[English longbow|longbowmen]]. The lightly protected longbowmen could down their French opponents at a distance, whilst the armoured men-at-arms could deal with any Frenchmen who made it to the English lines. This is the crux of combined arms: to allow a combination of forces to achieve what would be impossible for its constituent elements to do alone.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages military forces used combined arms as a method of winning battles and furthering a war leader or king's long term goals. Some historians claim that during the Middle Ages there was no strategic or tactical art to military combat. Kelly DeVries uses the Merriam-Webster definition of combat \"as a general military engagement\".<ref name=DeVries1966>{{cite book |author=DeVries, Kelly |year=1996 |title=Infantry Warfare in the early Fourteenth Century |page=18 |location=Rochester, NY |publisher=Boydell Press}}</ref> In the pursuit of a leader's goals and self-interest tactical and strategic thinking was used along with taking advantage of the terrain and weather in choosing when and where to give battle. The simplest example is the combination of different specialties such as archers, infantry, cavalry (knights or shock mounted troops), and even peasant militia. At times, each force fought on its own and won or lost depending on the opposing military competence. During the Middle Ages leaders utilized a combination of these skilled and unskilled forces to win battles. An army that has multiple skills available can engage a larger force that incorporates mainly one or two types of troops. \n\nEach type of military formation \u2013 infantry, archers, cavalry, or peasant \u2013 has certain advantages that the other does not have. Infantry allows a force to hold ground and in the event of overwhelming enemy forces withdraw into terrain that mounted troops cannot maneuver as easily, thus negating the advantage of the horse. Archers provide standoff with their bows or crossbows. Cavalry can maneuver faster and provide fast attack before the enemy has had time to prepare defenses. Peasants are more numerous and cheaper on the royal coffers. Over the long term the army can cross-train and learn the skills of the specialties to increase [[combat effectiveness]]. This is known as a combat multiplier today. The combination of the different skills help provide a commander the flexibility to minimize risk when it comes to engagements. The overall objective of any military force is to fight and win, while also preserving the largest number of combatants to carry on the larger strategic aims of the king. This can be seen in some of the engagements during the Middle Ages.\n\n===Examples of combined arms use in battle===\nThe effective use of combined arms can \u2013 in conjunction with strategic and tactical considerations \u2013 overwhelm opposing forces even numerically superior forces. The use of terrain and weather can also aid in the use of combined arms to bring about the desired results of the commander of a military force.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Kelly |last1=DeVries |first2=Robert Douglas |last2=Smith |title=Medieval Military Technology |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2012}}</ref><ref name=DeVries1966/>\n\n;Crecy-en-Ponthieu:\nMid-1346, at [[Battle of Crecy|the battle of Crecy-en-Ponthieu]], an English army numbering between 3,000\u201320,000&nbsp;mixed troops set up a defensive line for the oncoming French forces numbering nearly 100,000&nbsp;mixed troops. The English being in a defensive position dismounted their knights to augment the infantry forces on the lines of defense. It is unclear from the sources of the location of the English archers, either on the flanks, intermingled with the line troops, or behind the lines; the most likely was that they were formed up along the flanks according to prior positions in previous battles. The French arrived on the battlefield and sent their crossbowmen in advance of the cavalry to assault the English lines. The effectiveness of the crossbowmen was limited by rain having soaked the strings of the crossbows reducing its effectiveness. The English archers had been able to keep their bow strings dry and only used them when the crossbowmen were in range. This led to the massacre of the crossbowmen and a retreat of the survivors who were then trampled by the advancing French cavalry. This also disrupted an already disorganized advance after a long march to the battlefield by the cavalry. The piecemeal assault of the French forces would lead to an English victory.\n\n;Battle of Morgarten:\nIn 1315, Swiss peasants, archers, and infantry [[Battle of Morgarten|at Morgarten were able to ambush]] a larger Austrian force. The Swiss had rebelled against Austrian rule and funneled the Austrian forces into easily defended passes in the Swiss mountains. The peasants and archers on the high ground effectively rained down arrows and rocks to disorganize the Austrian forces and the infantry charged in forcing the advance guard to retreat into the main body causing more confusion, as well as a general military retreat by the Austrian military.\n\n;Battle of Auberoche:\nIn 1345, an English army of about 1,200&nbsp;men had been moving through the P\u00e9rigord region of Gascony. The French army had caught up [[Battle of Auberoche|outside the town of Auberoche but did not know the English had hidden in the woods]] near where the French had encamped upon arrival.

The result: an infantry unit increased in effectiveness by a factor of four for its size, when supported with helicopter-delivered ammunition, food and fuel.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stanton |first=Shelby |year=1999 |title=The 1st Cav[elry] in Vietnam: Anatomy of a division |pages=111\u2013132 |publisher=Presidio Press |location=Novato}}</ref> In time the US Army in Vietnam also learned to combine helicopter operations and [[airmobile infantry]] with the armoured and [[artillery]] units operating from [[fire support base]]s as well as the US [[brown-water navy]] and [[USAF]] [[Close Air Support]] units supporting them.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schlight |first=John |title=Help from Above: Air Force close air support of the Army 1946\u20131973 |year=2003 |pages=299\u2013352 |publisher=Air Force History and Museums Program |location=Washington, D.C.}}\n</ref>\n\n===Post Cold War (1991 to present)===\n[[File:2013.2.27 \uc721\uad70 26\uc0ac\ub2e8 \uc7a5\uac11\ud558\ucc28\uc804\ud22c\ud6c8\ub828 Republic of Korea Army 26th Division (11918611034).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|South Korean [[K1 88-Tank|K-1 tanks]], combat vehicles and infantry in Gyeonggi Province]]\nIn the 1991 [[Gulf War]] a mix of strikes by fixed-wing aircraft including [[carpet bombing]] and precision bombing was used in combination with large numbers of strikes by attack helicopters. During the ground assault phase, tanks and other [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]]s supported by attack aircraft swept over remaining forces. The front line moved forward at upwards of 40\u201350&nbsp;km/h at the upper limit of the Army's tracked vehicles.\n\nIn 2000, the US Army began developing a new set of doctrines intended to use information superiority to wage warfare. Six pieces of equipment were crucial for this: [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]], an airborne look-down radar [[JSTARS]], [[GPS]], the lowly [[SINCGARS]] [[VHF]] digital radio, and ruggedized [[Personal computer|PC]]s. The mix is supplemented by satellite photos and passive reception of enemy radio emissions, forward observers with digital target designation, specialized scouting aircraft, anti-artillery radars and [[gun-laying]] software for artillery. Everything feeds into the network.\n\nBased on this doctrine, many US ground vehicles moved across the landscape alone. If they encountered an enemy troop or vehicle concentration, they would assume a defensive posture, lay down as much covering fire as they could, [[target designation|designate the target]]s for requested air and artillery assets. Within a few minutes, on station aircraft would direct their missions to cover the ground vehicle. Within a half-hour heavy attack forces would concentrate to relieve the isolated vehicle. In an hour and a half the relieved vehicle would be resupplied.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Armoured warfare]]\n* [[Battlegroup (army)]]\n* [[Blitzkrieg]]\n* [[Close air support]]\n* [[Organic unit]]\n* [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]]\n* [[Network-centric warfare]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web |last=House |first=Jonathan M. |title=Toward Combined Arms Warfare: A survey of 20th-century tactics, doctrine, and organization |format=pdf |url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/house.pdf |agency=US Army Command General Staff College |publisher=University Press of the Pacific |year=1984}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Perry |first=Roland |title=Monash: The outsider who won a war |publisher=Random House |location=Sydney |year=2004}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Combined Arms}}\n[[Category:Armoured warfare]]\n[[Category:Warfare post-1945]]\n[[Category:Warfare by type]]\n", "name_user": "GMan552", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e15th to 19th centuries", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_arms"}

Translators at 91.1 in Arroyo Seco (K216AL) and at 91.9 in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] (K220AV) went silent with the upgrade to KRRT's transmitter status. At writing, KUNM features a range of locally produced music shows, local and national news coverage, and public affairs programming.\n\nThe call letters \"KUNM\" reference the University of New Mexico. The call letters \"KBOM\" are sardonic humour: the transmitter reaches the [[Trinity site|Trinity Nuclear Test Site]]. \"KRAR\" stands for \"Rio Arriba Radio\", since Espanola is located in [[Rio Arriba County]]. KRRT stands for \"Radio Relay Taos\".\n\nThe station is currently funded through a combination of listener sponsorship, underwriting by local businesses and support from nonprofits, student fees, and various other sources.\n\nListener support accounts for a little over 50% of the station's total annual operating budget.\n\n'''KUNM''' broadcasts in [[HD Radio|HD]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=17 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113014348/http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=17 |archivedate=2014-11-13 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe following brief, and very incomplete, history of KUNM is largely compiled from internal documents, available to any on-air volunteer, written by former station manager Steve van Dresser and long-time station volunteer Claude Stephenson.\n\nKUNM began life in 1960 as KNMD, a [[carrier current]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] radio station on the campus. According to former station manager Steve van Dresser, \"small AM transmitters [were] located in each dorm [at UNM]\" and the Student Union Building. The signal was broadcast... through the [[Alternating current|AC]] power circuits... from about 2 in the afternoon until about 6\".\n\nAccording to longtime station volunteer Claude Stephenson, fraternity and sorority members, as well as other students living off campus, complained that their student fees were being used to pay for a service they could not receive. In 1964, the Radio Board decided the best solution was to obtain a [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) educational broadcast license for a transmitter on Sandia Crest. The board ultimately decided in 1965 to broadcast from a transmitter on top of the Student Union Building \"until the funds [could] be gathered to move [the transmitter] to [Sandia] Crest\". The Board of Regents made the application in March 1966 for a construction permit.\nThe station desired the call letters KUNM but ran into an objection from another Albuquerque radio station: [[KMGA|KBNM]], which had adopted those call letters on March 18, 1966.<ref>[https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=79541 FCC History Cards for KBNM]</ref> As a result, on October 19, 1966, the station went on the air with the provisional call letters '''KLNB'''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1089&context=daily_lobo_1966|work=New Mexico Lobo|date=October 13, 1966|title=Station KUNM Airs As KLNB|accessdate=August 11, 2019|first=Jim|last=Jansson|page=1}}</ref> The station was able to claim the KUNM call letters several weeks later. The original transmitter broadcast with an [[effective radiated power]] of 3,700 watts.\nIt was at roughly this time that [[Ramsey Lewis]]'s \"The In Crowd\" became a part of the station's musical history. According to van Dresser, this is the period during which the station began airing the cutting-edge music of the mid-to-late 1960s. Stephenson dates \"The In Crowd\" as becoming an important musical milestone in the station's history to 1968.\n\nAt the same time, the station was, in his words, \"literally in the middle\" of the \"third most violent [campus] confrontation\" in the wake of the \"[[Cambodian Incursion]]\" during the [[Vietnam War]], during which the [[New Mexico National Guard]] was called out to expel students who \"took over the Student Union Building\". The first and second most violent confrontations, van Dresser reports, occurred at [[Kent State University]] and [[Jackson State University]]. He says KUNM provided a \"feed\" to [[CBS]] news and \"did live networking with [[Pacifica Radio|Pacifica]]\" during the event.\n\nVan Dresser was succeeded by L. A. \"Woody\" Woodworth, formerly the station's program director, as station manager. Woodworth was, in turn, \"I think\", as van Dresser puts it, succeeded by Mike Wolfe.\n\nIn 1974, KUNM filed to move its transmitter to Sandia Crest. [[Hubbard Broadcasting]], owner of [[KKOB (AM)|KOB-AM]]-[[KOB-TV|TV]], filed a petition to deny to the application, but the application was conditionally approved in 1975. KUNM moved its studios from the Student Union Building to O\u00f1ate Hall in 1976, and the Sandia Crest transmitter site was turned on in September of that year.\nKUNM became a member of [[National Public Radio|NPR]] in 1978, following the bankruptcy and closure of [[KFLQ|KIPC]]. Funding for this transition was accomplished through benefit concerts at the Kiva Auditorium in downtown Albuquerque.  The station's first national broadcast contribution was an exclusive interview with [[Manuel Noriega]] by a KUNM news reporter.\n\nKUNM was among the first radio stations to carry [[Amy Goodman]]'s ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' in the mid-199s. John McCall, a UNM law student appointed as Radio Board member, and Spencer Walaitis, a KUNM volunteer and community activist/musician, campaigned for the program and encountered some opposition on the Radio Board.  According to McCall, when the two went to address a volunteer meeting and encourage support for inclusion of ''DN!'' in the program lineup, Walaitis suffered a heart attack shortly after his speech to the volunteers.  He died there in O\u00f1ate Hall despite valiant efforts of the volunteers to save him.  He left behind a wife and young children.  After the death of Spencer Walaitis there was very little opposition to the inclusion of ''DN!'' in the program lineup. {{citation needed|date=March 2008}}  The transmitter atop the crest of the [[Sandia Mountains]] (Sandia Crest) was upgraded to broadcast a digital signal in November 2006.\n\n==Signal expansions==\n\nIn 2008, KUNM launched three high-power repeaters. KBOM in Socorro signed on February 15, 2008, broadcasting from \"Mountain M\" at 88.7&nbsp;MHz. KRAR in Espa\u00f1ola followed on April 1, 2008, with 6,000 watts from Black Mesa on 91.9&nbsp;MHz. Two days later, the new Arroyo Seco station, KRRT 90.9&nbsp;MHz, came into service. The new stations replaced translators at 91.1 in Taos (K220AV) and 91.9 in Arroyo Seco (K216AL).\n==Programming==\nFive times a week, KUNM airs the live call-in show Native America Calling. Native America Calling is the only nationally syndicated call-in talk show focusing on Native American issues.  In fall of 2006, the in-house, half-hour \"Evening Report\" was reformatted to incorporate local and regional news stories into NPR's national newsmagazine [[All Things Considered]] thus eliminating some NPR stories.\n\nEarly weekday afternoons highlight locally produced [[jazz]] programming, and ''Free Form'' which features local hosts playing a wide range of music.  Late mornings feature classical music from [[American Public Media]].  Evening music programming varies from acoustic folk to experimental electronic.\n\nWeekend programming is primarily volunteer-produced music, talk and radio theater programs including a program produced by and with youth,   \"Generation Justice\". The weekend often closes out on Sunday evenings with a broadcast of the national radio theater show [https://playingonair.org Playing On Air].\n\nKUNM broadcasts syndicated programming for several hours each day.  [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) is broadcast during the morning and evening \"drive time\", interspersed with local news.  NPR programming provides national news programs seven days a week. KUNM is an NPR Member station. [[Pacifica Radio]] programming includes [[Democracy Now!]], [[Public Radio International]] programming includes [[Afropop Worldwide]], American Public Media programming includes Performance Today.\n\n==Role of Volunteers at KUNM==\nKUNM is a hybrid station combining characteristics of a public station, complete with National Public Radio and other nationally syndicated programming, with day-time and evening prime time local programming produced by an active base of volunteers from the local community as well as the University of New Mexico student body. Currently there are nearly 100 volunteers producing about 75% of the on-air content.\n\nVolunteers at KUNM have played a central role in the functioning of the station over the years. In 1987 recently hired Station Manager Tim Singleton made it known that the station's ''Morning'' and ''Afternoon Freeform'' programs were to be replaced with more standard NPR-style jazz and classical programming, including nationally syndicated programming produced outside of New Mexico. The response of the volunteers was an 18-month strike, with strong community support, and accompanying first amendment and other legal actions against the University of New Mexico. A settlement was reached in the Fall of 1988, that included a re-vamped Radio Board with a significant amount of say on programming changes, and a Volunteer Agreement that clarifies volunteer rights at the station.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of community radio stations in the United States]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://kunm.org/ KUNM official website]\n{{FM station data|KUNM}}\n{{FM station data|KBOM}}\n{{FM station data|KRAR}}\n{{FM station data|KRRT}}\n*[http://www.nativeamericacalling.com Native America Calling]\n*[http://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/otiahome/ptfp/coverage/nm.htm Public Radio Coverage 2004, New Mexico]\n*[https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=69777 FCC History Cards for KUNM]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Albuquerque Radio}}\n{{TaosNM Radio}}\n{{NPR New Mexico}}\n\n[[Category:Community radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Albuquerque, New Mexico|UNM]]\n[[Category:NPR member stations]]\n[[Category:Public Radio International stations]]\n[[Category:Media in Taos, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:NPR member networks]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1966]]\n[[Category:1966 establishments in New Mexico]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Public radio station of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name                 = KUNM\n| image                = KUNM logo.jpg\n| image_size           = 200px\n| city                 = [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]\n| area                 = [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque area]]\n| branding             = ''New Mexico Public Radio''\n| slogan               = Your neighbors, your world\n| frequency            = 89.9 [[MHz]] {{HD Radio}}\n| translator           = 90.5 K213ET (Eagle Nest)<br>91.1 K216CU (Cuba)<br>91.9 K220EM (Nageezi)\n| repeater             = 88.7 KBOM (Socorro)<br>90.9 KRRT (Arryo Seco)<br>91.9 KRRE (Las Vegas)<br>91.9 KRAR (Espanola)\n| airdate              = October 16, 1966\n| share                = \n| share as of          =  \n| share source         =  \n| format               = [[NPR]]/[[Variety (radio)|Variety]]|\n| power                =\n| erp                  = 21,500 [[watt]]s\n| haat                 = {{convert|1,252.0|m|ft|sp=us}}\n| class                = C\n| facility_id          = 6083\n| coordinates          = {{coord|35|12|44|N|106|26|57|W|region:US_type:city}}\n| callsign_meaning     = '''U'''niversity of '''N'''ew '''M'''exico\n| former_callsigns     = KNMD<br>KNLB\n| affiliations         = [[Pacifica Radio]], [[American Public Media]], [[National Public Radio]], [[Public Radio International]]\n| owner                = Regents of the University of New Mexico\n| licensee             = \n| sister_stations      = [[KRWG (FM)|KRWG]]\n| webcast              = {{listen live|http://www.kunm.org}}\n| website              = [http://www.kunm.org kunm.org]\n}}\n\n'''KUNM''' is a [[public radio|public]] [[radio station]] broadcasting on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] 89.9&nbsp;MHz from high atop Sandia Crest, with broadcasts originating from the third floor of O\u00f1ate Hall, on the campus of the [[University of New Mexico]] (UNM) in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]].\n\nAs of April 3, 2008, KUNM has translators broadcasting at 90.5 in [[Eagle Nest, New Mexico|Eagle Nest]]-[[Cimarron, New Mexico|Cimarron]] (K213ET), 91.1 in [[Cuba]] (K216CU) and at 91.9 in [[Nageezi]] (Dzilth-Na-O-Dit) (K220EM).\n\nIn addition, KUNM has full-power transmitters at 88.7 [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]] (KBOM), 91.9 [[Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico|Espanola]] (KRAR), and 90.9 [[Arroyo Seco, New Mexico|Arroyo Seco]] (KRRT).

Late mornings feature classical music from [[American Public Media]].  Evening music programming varies from acoustic folk to experimental electronic.\n\nWeekend programming is primarily volunteer-produced music, talk and radio theater programs including a program produced by and with youth,   \"Generation Justice\". The weekend often closes out on Sunday evenings with a broadcast of the national radio theater show [https://playingonair.org Playing On Air].\n\nKUNM broadcasts syndicated programming for several hours each day.  [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) is broadcast during the morning and evening \"drive time\", interspersed with local news.  NPR programming provides national news programs seven days a week. KUNM is an NPR Member station. [[Pacifica Radio]] programming includes [[Democracy Now!]], [[Public Radio International]] programming includes [[Afropop Worldwide]], American Public Media programming includes Performance Today.\n\n==Role of Volunteers at KUNM==\nKUNM is a hybrid station combining characteristics of a public station, complete with National Public Radio and other nationally syndicated programming, with day-time and evening prime time local programming produced by an active base of volunteers from the local community as well as the University of New Mexico student body. Currently there are nearly 100 volunteers producing about 75% of the on-air content.\n\nVolunteers at KUNM have played a central role in the functioning of the station over the years. In 1987 recently hired Station Manager Tim Singleton made it known that the station's ''Morning'' and ''Afternoon Freeform'' programs were to be replaced with more standard NPR-style jazz and classical programming, including nationally syndicated programming produced outside of New Mexico. The response of the volunteers was an 18-month strike, with strong community support, and accompanying first amendment and other legal actions against the University of New Mexico. A settlement was reached in the Fall of 1988, that included a re-vamped Radio Board with a significant amount of say on programming changes, and a Volunteer Agreement that clarifies volunteer rights at the station.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of community radio stations in the United States]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://kunm.org/ KUNM official website]\n{{FM station data|KUNM}}\n{{FM station data|KBOM}}\n{{FM station data|KRAR}}\n{{FM station data|KRRT}}\n*[http://www.nativeamericacalling.com Native America Calling]\n*[http://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/otiahome/ptfp/coverage/nm.htm Public Radio Coverage 2004, New Mexico]\n*[https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=69777 FCC History Cards for KUNM]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Albuquerque Radio}}\n{{TaosNM Radio}}\n{{NPR New Mexico}}\n\n[[Category:Community radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Albuquerque, New Mexico|UNM]]\n[[Category:NPR member stations]]\n[[Category:Public Radio International stations]]\n[[Category:Media in Taos, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:NPR member networks]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1966]]\n[[Category:1966 establishments in New Mexico]]\n", "name_user": "Ben76266", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KUNM"}
