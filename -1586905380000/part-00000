Backward compatibility can be used to preserve older software that would have otherwise been lost when a manufacturer decides to stop supporting older hardware. Classic video games are a common example used when discussing the value of supporting older software. The cultural impact of video games is a large part of their continued success, and some believe ignoring backward compatibility would cause these titles to disappear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/192068-backwards-compatibility-is-the-only-way-forward-2495543836.html|title=Backwards Compatibility is the Only Way Forward|date=2015-04-10|website=PopMatters|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> Backward compatibility also acts as an additional selling point for new hardware, as an existing player base can more affordably [[upgrade]] to subsequent generations of a console. This also helps to make up for a lack of content in the early launch of new systems, as users can pull from the previous console's large library of games while developers slowly transition to the new hardware.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://techconnectmagazine.com/what-is-backwards-compatibility/|title=Understanding backwards compatibility and how it benefits gamers|date=2018-08-14|website=Tech Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> \n\nOne example of this is the Sony [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2) which was backward compatible with games for its predecessor [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] (PS1). While the selection of PS2 games available at launch was small, sales of the console were nonetheless strong in 2000-2001 thanks to the large library of games for the preceding PS1. This bought time for the PS2 to grow a large installed base and developers to release more quality PS2 games for the crucial 2001 holiday season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pnpgames.com/blog/?page_id=25|title=Sony Playstation 2(PS2)|last=|first=|date=|website=Pnpgames|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, and despite not being included at launch, Microsoft slowly incorporated backward compatibility for select titles on the Xbox One several years into its product life cycle.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.androidcentral.com/playstation-5-set-be-backward-compatible-remasters-wont-be-necessary|title=Remasters aren't needed if the PS5 is completely backward compatible|date=2019-09-24|website=Android Central|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> Players have racked up over a billion hours with backward compatible games, and it is rumored that next generation console like the PlayStation 5 will also support this feature.<ref name=\":3\" /> A large part of the success and implementation of this feature is that the hardware within newer generation consoles is both powerful and similar enough to legacy systems that older titles can be broken down and re-configured to run on the Xbox One.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2017-xbox-one-x-back-compat-how-does-it-actually-work|title=Xbox One backwards compatibility: how does it actually work?|last=Leadbetter|first=Richard|date=2017-12-09|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref> The backward compatibility program not only supports the previous generation Xbox 360, but also titles from the original Xbox system.<ref name=\":4\" /> Some titles are even given slight visual improvements and additional levels at no cost to the user.

These remasters have found success by appealing both to nostalgic players who remember enjoying the original versions when they were younger, and to newcomers who may not have had the original system it was released on. For most consumers, digital remasters are more appealing than hanging on to bulky cartridges and obsolete hardware. For the manufacturers of consoles, digital re-releases of classic titles are a large benefit. It not only removes the financial drawbacks of supporting older hardware, but also shifts all of the costs of updating software to the developers. The manufacturer gets a new addition to their system with strong name recognition, and the studio does not have to completely develop a game from the ground up.\n\n==Hardware==\nA simple example of both backward and forward compatibility is the introduction of [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]. FM radio was initially [[monaural|mono]], with only one audio channel represented by one [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]. With the introduction of two-channel stereo FM radio, many listeners had only mono FM receivers. Forward compatibility for mono receivers with stereo signals was achieved through sending the sum of both left and right audio channels in one signal and the difference in another signal. That allows mono FM receivers to receive and decode the sum signal while ignoring the difference signal, which is necessary only for separating the audio channels. Stereo FM receivers can receive a mono signal and decode it without the need for a second signal, and they can separate a sum signal to left and right channels if both sum and difference signals are received.

Backward compatibility can be used to preserve older software that would have otherwise been lost when a manufacturer decides to stop supporting older hardware. Classic video games are a common example used when discussing the value of supporting older software. The cultural impact of video games is a large part of their continued success, and some believe ignoring backward compatibility would cause these titles to disappear.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/192068-backwards-compatibility-is-the-only-way-forward-2495543836.html|title=Backwards Compatibility is the Only Way Forward|date=2015-04-10|website=PopMatters|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> Backward compatibility also acts as an additional selling point for new hardware, as an existing player base can more affordably [[upgrade]] to subsequent generations of a console. This also helps to make up for a lack of content in the early launch of new systems, as users can pull from the previous console's large library of games while developers slowly transition to the new hardware.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://techconnectmagazine.com/what-is-backwards-compatibility/|title=Understanding backwards compatibility and how it benefits gamers|date=2018-08-14|website=Tech Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> \n\nOne example of this is the Sony [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2) which was backward compatible with games for its predecessor [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] (PS1). While the selection of PS2 games available at launch was small, sales of the console were nonetheless strong in 2000-2001 thanks to the large library of games for the preceding PS1.

These remasters have found success by appealing both to nostalgic players who remember enjoying the original versions when they were younger, and to newcomers who may not have had the original system it was released on. For most consumers, digital remasters are more appealing than hanging on to bulky cartridges and obsolete hardware. For the manufacturers of consoles, digital re-releases of classic titles are a large benefit. It not only removes the financial drawbacks of supporting older hardware, but also shifts all of the costs of updating software to the developers. The manufacturer gets a new addition to their system with strong name recognition, and the studio does not have to completely develop a game from the ground up.\n\n==Hardware==\nA simple example of both backward and forward compatibility is the introduction of [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]. FM radio was initially [[monaural|mono]], with only one audio channel represented by one [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]. With the introduction of two-channel stereo FM radio, many listeners had only mono FM receivers. Forward compatibility for mono receivers with stereo signals was achieved through sending the sum of both left and right audio channels in one signal and the difference in another signal. That allows mono FM receivers to receive and decode the sum signal while ignoring the difference signal, which is necessary only for separating the audio channels. Stereo FM receivers can receive a mono signal and decode it without the need for a second signal, and they can separate a sum signal to left and right channels if both sum and difference signals are received. Without the requirement for backward compatibility, a simpler method could have been chosen.<ref>{{citation|title=Newnes Radio and RF Engineering Pocket Book|first1=Steve|last1=Winder|first2=Joseph|last2=Carr|edition=3|date=2002|publisher=Newnes|isbn=9780080497471|pp=121\u2013123}}</ref>\n\nFull backward compatibility is particularly important in computer [[instruction set]] architectures, one of the most successful being the [[x86]] family of [[microprocessor]]s.

The purifying structure of the Sanskrit language removes these imperfections. The early Sanskrit grammarian [[Da\u1e47\u1e0din]] states, for example, that much in the Prakrit languages is etymologically rooted in Sanskrit, but involve \"loss of sounds\" and corruptions that result from a \"disregard of the grammar\". Da\u1e47\u1e0din acknowledged that there are words and confusing structures in Prakrit that thrive independent of Sanskrit.

There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothick and the Celtick [sic], though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the Old Persian might be added to the same family.\n|William Jones, 1786|quoted by Thomas Burrow in ''The Sanskrit Language''{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|p=6}}}}\n\nIn order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]] states that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in the Indian subcontinent from the north-west sometime during the early second millennium BCE. Evidence for such a theory includes the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues and the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages]], vocabulary exchange with the non-Indo-European [[Uralic languages]], and the nature of the attested Indo-European words for flora and fauna.{{sfn|Colin P.

A part of the difficulty is the lack of sufficient textual, archaeological and epigraphical evidence for the ancient Prakrit languages with rare exceptions such as Pali, leading to a tendency of [[anachronism|anachronistic]] errors.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Sanskrit and Prakrit languages may be divided into Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE\u2013600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan (600 BCE\u20131000 CE) and New Indo-Aryan (1000 CE\u2013current), each can further be subdivided in early, middle or second, and late evolutionary substages.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}}\n\nVedic Sanskrit belongs to the early Old Indo-Aryan while Classical Sanskrit to the later Old Indo-Aryan stage. The evidence for Prakrits such as Pali (Theravada Buddhism) and Ardhamagadhi (Jainism), along with Magadhi, Maharashtri, Sinhala, Sauraseni and Niya (Gandhari), emerge in the Middle Indo-Aryan stage in two versions\u2014archaic and more formalized\u2014that may be placed in early and middle substages of the 600 BCE\u20131000 CE period.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Two literary Indic languages can be traced to the late Middle Indo-Aryan stage and these are Apabhramsa and Elu (a form of literary Sinhalese). Numerous North, Central, Eastern and Western Indian languages, such as Hindi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Nepali, Braj, Awadhi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, and others belong to the New Indo-Aryan stage.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}}\n\nThere is an extensive overlap in the vocabulary, phonetics and other aspects of these New Indo-Aryan languages with Sanskrit, but it is neither universal nor identical across the languages. They likely emerged from a synthesis of the ancient Sanskrit language traditions and an admixture of various regional dialects. Each language has some unique and regionally creative aspects, with unclear origins. Prakrit languages do have a grammatical structure, but like the Vedic Sanskrit, it is far less rigorous than Classical Sanskrit. The roots of all Prakrit languages may be in the Vedic Sanskrit and ultimately the Indo-Aryan language, their structural details vary from the Classical Sanskrit.<ref name=\"Woolner1986p3\"/>{{sfn|Colin P.

The consonantal system is the same, though it systematically enlarged the inventory of distinct sounds. For example, Sanskrit added a voiceless aspirated \"t\u02b0\", to the voiceless \"t\", voiced \"d\" and voiced aspirated \"d\u02b0\" found in PIE languages.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nThe most significant and distinctive phonological development in Sanskrit is vowel-merger, states Stephanie Jamison\u2014an Indo-European linguist specializing in Sanskrit literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} The short ''*e'', ''*o'' and ''*a'', all merge as ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit, while long ''*\u0113'', ''*\u014d'' and ''*\u0101'', all merge as long ''\u0101'' (\u0906). These mergers occurred very early and significantly impacted Sanskrit's morphological system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} Some phonological developments in it mirror those in other PIE languages. For example, the labiovelars merged with the plain velars as in other satem languages. The secondary palatalization of the resulting segments is more thorough and systematic within Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} A series of retroflex dental stops were innovated in Sanskrit to more thoroughly articulate sounds for clarity. For example, unlike the loss of the morphological clarity from vowel contraction that is found in early Greek and related southeast European languages, Sanskrit deployed ''*y'', ''*w'', and ''*s'' intervocalically to provide morphological clarity.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n===Vowels===\n\nThe cardinal vowels (''svaras'') ''i'' (\u0907), ''u'' (\u0909), ''a'' (\u0905) distinguish length in Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman|Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=1\u20139}} The short ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit is a closer vowel than \u0101, equivalent to schwa. The mid-vowels \u0113 (\u090f) and \u014d (\u0913) in Sanskrit are monophthongizations of the Indo-Iranian diphthongs ''*ai'' and ''*au''. The Old Iranian language preserved ''*ai'' and ''*au''.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}} The Sanskrit vowels are inherently long, though often transcribed ''e'' and ''o'' without the diacritic. The vocalic liquid ''r\u0325'' in Sanskrit is a merger of PIE ''*r\u0325'' and ''*l\u0325''. The long ''r\u0325'' is an innovation and it is used in a few analogically generated morphological categories.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Michael Coulson|Richard Gombrich|James Benson|2011|pp=21\u201336}}{{sfn|Colin P.

All the retroflexes in Sanskrit are in \"origin conditioned alternants of dentals, though from the beginning of the language they have a qualified independence\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nRegarding the palatal plosives, the pronunciation is a matter of debate. In contemporary attestation, the palatal plosives are a regular series of palatal stops, supported by most Sanskrit sandhi rules.  However, the reflexes in descendant languages, as well as a few of the sandhi rules regarding ''ch'', could suggest an affricate pronunciation. \n\n''jh'' was a marginal phoneme in Sanskrit, hence its phonology is more difficult to reconstruct; it was more commonly employed in the Middle Indo-Aryan languages as a result of phonological processes resulting in the phoneme.\n\nThe palatal nasal is a conditioned variant of n occurring next to palatal obstruents.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}} The ''anusvara'' that Sanskrit deploys is a conditioned alternant of postvocalic nasals, under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}} Its ''visarga'' is a word-final or morpheme-final conditioned alternant of s and r under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = '''The system of Sanskrit Sounds'''<br />[The] order of Sanskrit sounds works along three principles: it goes from simple to complex; it goes from the back to the front of the mouth; and it groups similar sounds together.

Ruppel|2017|pp=18\u201319}}\n |width = 28%\n |bgcolor=#FFE0BB\n |align  = right\n}}\nThe voiceless aspirated series is also an innovation in Sanskrit but is significantly rarer than the other three series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nWhile the Sanskrit language organizes sounds for expression beyond those found in the PIE language, it retained many features found in the Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages. An example of a similar process in all three, states Jamison, is the retroflex sibilant \u0282 being the automatic product of dental s following i, u, r, and k (mnemonically \"ruki\").{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n===Phonological alternations, sandhi rules===\nSanskrit deploys extensive phonological alternations on different linguistic levels through ''sandhi'' rules (literally, the rules of \"putting together, union, connection, alliance\"). This is similar to the English alteration of \"going to\" as ''gonna'', states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} The Sanskrit language accepts such alterations within it, but offers formal rules for the ''sandhi'' of any two words next to each other in the same sentence or linking two sentences. The external ''sandhi'' rules state that similar short vowels coalesce into a single long vowel, while dissimilar vowels form glides or undergo diphthongization.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} Among the consonants, most external ''sandhi'' rules recommend regressive assimilation for clarity when they are voiced. According to Jamison, these rules ordinarily apply at compound seams and morpheme boundaries.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} In Vedic Sanskrit, the external ''sandhi'' rules are more variable than in Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=11}}\n\nThe internal ''sandhi'' rules are more intricate and account for the root and the canonical structure of the Sanskrit word. These rules anticipate what are now known as the [[Bartholomae's law]] and [[Grassmann's law]]. For example, states Jamison, the \"voiceless, voiced, and voiced aspirated obstruents of a positional series regularly alternate with each other (p \u2248 b \u2248 b\u02b0; t \u2248 d \u2248 d\u02b0, etc.; note, however, c \u2248 j \u2248 h), such that, for example, a morpheme with an underlying voiced aspirate final may show alternants{{clarify|date=March 2019|reason=alternations?}} with all three stops under differing internal sandhi conditions\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}} The velar series (k, g, g\u02b0) alternate with the palatal series (c, j, h), while the structural position of the palatal series is modified into a retroflex cluster when followed by dental. This rule create two morphophonemically distinct series from a single palatal series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nVocalic alternations in the Sanskrit morphological system is termed \"strengthening\", and called ''guna'' and ''vriddhi'' in the preconsonantal versions. There is an equivalence to terms deployed in Indo-European descriptive grammars, wherein Sanskrit's unstrengthened state is same as the zero-grade, ''guna'' corresponds to normal-grade, while ''vriddhi'' is same as the lengthened-state.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The qualitative ablaut is not found in Sanskrit just like it is absent in Iranian, but Sanskrit retains quantitative ablaut through vowel strengthening.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The transformations between unstrengthened to ''guna'' is prominent in the morphological system, states Jamison, while ''vriddhi'' is a particularly significant rule when adjectives of origin and appurtenance are derived. The manner in which this is done slightly differs between the Vedic and the Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}}{{sfn|Colin P.

Similarly, the syllable may have an internal vowel of any weight. The Vedic Sanskrit shows traces of following the Sievers-Edgerton Law, but Classical Sanskrit doesn't. Vedic Sanskrit has a pitch accent system, states Jamison, which were acknowledged by Panini, but in his Classical Sanskrit the accents disappear.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} Most Vedic Sanskrit words have one accent. However, this accent is not phonologically predictable, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} It can fall anywhere in the word and its position often conveys morphological and syntactic information.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} According to Masica, the presence of an accent system in Vedic Sanskrit is evidenced from the markings in the Vedic texts. This is important because of Sanskrit's connection to the PIE languages and comparative Indo-European linguistics.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\nSanskrit, like most early Indo-European languages, lost the so-called \"laryngeal consonants (cover-symbol ''*H'') present in the Proto-Indo-European\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} This significantly impacted the evolutionary path of the Sanskrit phonology and morphology, particularly in the variant forms of roots.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n==Morphology==\n{{Main|Sanskrit grammar}}\n{{See also|Vedic Sanskrit grammar}}\nThe basis of Sanskrit morphology is the root, states Jamison, \"a morpheme bearing lexical meaning\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} The verbal and nominal stems of Sanskrit words are derived from this root through the phonological vowel-gradation processes, the addition of affixes, verbal and nominal stems. It then adds an ending to establish the grammatical and syntactic identity of the stem. According to Jamison, the \"three major formal elements of the morphology are (i) root, (ii) affix, and (iii) ending; and they are roughly responsible for (i) lexical meaning, (ii) derivation, and (iii) inflection respectively\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nA Sanskrit word has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Affix''{{su|b=0-n}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=0\u20131}}\n\nThe root structure has certain phonological constraints. Two of the most important constraints of a \"root\" is that it does not end in a short \"a\" (\u0905) and that it is monosyllabic.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} In contrast, the affixes and endings commonly do. The affixes in Sanskrit are almost always suffixes, with exceptions such as the augment \"a-\" added as prefix to past tense verb forms and the \"-na/n-\" infix in single verbal present class, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nA verb in Sanskrit has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Tense-Aspect}} + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Mood}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=Personal-Number-Voice}}\n\nAccording to Ruppel, verbs in Sanskrit express the same information as other Indo-European languages such as English.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\"/> Sanskrit verbs describe an action or occurrence or state, its embedded morphology informs as to \"who is doing it\" (person or persons), \"when it is done\" (tense) and \"how it is done\" (mood, voice). The Indo-European languages differ in the detail. For example, the Sanskrit language attaches the affixes and ending to the verb root, while the English language adds small independent words before the verb. In Sanskrit, these elements co-exist within the word.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\">{{cite book|author=A. M.

The finite verbs of Classical Sanskrit have the following grammatical categories: person, number, voice, tense-aspect, and mood. According to Jamison, a portmanteau morpheme generally expresses the person-number-voice in Sanskrit, and sometimes also the ending or only the ending. The mood of the word is embedded in the affix.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nThese elements of word architecture are the typical building blocks in Classical Sanskrit, but in Vedic Sanskrit these elements fluctuate and are unclear. For example, in the ''Rigveda'' [[preverb]]s regularly occur in [[tmesis]], states Jamison, which means they are \"separated from the finite verb\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} This indecisiveness is likely linked to Vedic Sanskrit's attempt to incorporate accent. With nonfinite forms of the verb and with nominal derivatives thereof, states Jamison, \"preverbs show much clearer univerbation in Vedic, both by position and by accent, and by Classical Sanskrit, tmesis is no longer possible even with finite forms\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nWhile roots are typical in Sanskrit, some words do not follow the canonical structure.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} A few forms lack both inflection and root. Many words are inflected (and can enter into derivation) but lack a recognizable root. Examples from the basic vocabulary include kinship terms such as ''m\u0101tar-'' (mother), ''nas-'' (nose), ''\u015bvan-'' (dog). According to Jamison, pronouns and some words outside the semantic categories also lack roots, as do the numerals. Similarly, the Sanskrit language is flexible enough to not mandate inflection.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe Sanskrit words can contain more than one affix that interact with each other. Affixes in Sanskrit can be athematic as well as thematic, according to Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Athematic affixes can be alternating. Sanskrit deploys eight cases, namely nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nStems, that is \"root + affix\", appear in two categories in Sanskrit: vowel stems and consonant stems. Unlike some Indo-European languages such as Latin or Greek, according to Jamison, \"Sanskrit has no closed set of conventionally denoted noun declensions\". Sanskrit includes a fairly large set of stem-types.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=17\u201318}} The linguistic interaction of the roots, the phonological segments, lexical items and the grammar for the Classical Sanskrit consist of four Paninian components. These, states Paul Kiparsky, are the ''Astadhyaayi'', a comprehensive system of 4,000 grammatical rules, of which a small set are frequently used; ''Sivasutras'', an inventory of ''anubandhas'' (markers) that partition phonological segments for efficient abbreviations through the ''pratyharas'' technique; ''Dhatupatha'', a list of 2,000 verbal roots classified by their morphology and syntactic properties using diacritic markers, a structure that guides its writing systems; and, the ''Ganapatha'', an inventory of word groups, classes of lexical systems.<ref name=Kiparsky59>{{cite book|author=Paul Kiparsky|editor=E.F.K.

These differ in the types of endings and what these endings mark in the grammatical context.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} Pronouns and nouns share the same grammatical categories, though they may differ in inflection. Verb-based adjectives and participles are not formally distinct from nouns. Adverbs are typically frozen case forms of adjectives, states Jamison, and \"nonfinite verbal forms such as infinitives and gerunds also clearly show frozen nominal case endings\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n===Tense and voice===\nThe Sanskrit language includes five tenses: present, future, past imperfect, past [[aorist]] and past perfect.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> It outlines three types of voices: active, passive and the middle.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> The middle is also referred to as the mediopassive, or more formally in Sanskrit as ''parasmaipada'' (word for another) and ''atmanepada'' (word for oneself).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%\"\n|+Voice in Sanskrit, Stephanie Jamison{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|Ruppel gives the following endings for the \"present indicative active\" in the Sanskrit language: 1st dual: -va\u1e25, 1st plural: -ma\u1e25, 2nd dual: -tha\u1e25, 2nd plural: -tha and so on.{{sfn|A.

For example, the ''Rigveda'' includes perfect and a marginal pluperfect. Classical Sanskrit simplifies the \"present\" system down to two tenses, the perfect and the imperfect, while the \"aorist\" stems retain the aorist tense and the \"perfect\" stems retain the perfect and marginal pluperfect.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=21}} The classical version of the language has elaborate rules for both voice and the tense-aspect system to emphasize clarity, and this is more elaborate than other Indo-European languages. The evolution of these systems can be seen from the earliest layers of the Vedic literature to the late Vedic literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n===Gender, mood===\nSanskrit recognizes three numbers\u2014singular, dual, and plural.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} The dual is a fully functioning category, used beyond naturally paired objects such as hands or eyes, extending to any collection of two. The elliptical dual is notable in the Vedic Sanskrit, according to Jamison, where a noun in the dual signals a paired opposition.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Illustrations include ''dy\u0101v\u0101'' (literally, \"the two heavens\" for heaven-and-earth), ''m\u0101tar\u0101'' (literally, \"the two mothers\" for mother-and-father).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} A verb may be singular, dual or plural, while the person recognized in the language are forms of \"I\", \"you\", \"he/she/it\", \"we\" and \"they\".<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\nThere are three persons in Sanskrit: first, second and third.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}} Sanskrit uses the 3\u00d73 grid formed by the three numbers and the three persons parameters as the paradigm and the basic building block of its verbal system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nThe Sanskrit language incorporates three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} All nouns have inherent gender, but with some exceptions, personal pronouns have no gender. Exceptions include demonstrative and anaphoric pronouns.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Derivation of a word is used to express the feminine. Two most common derivations come from feminine-forming suffixes, the ''-\u0101-'' (\u0906, R\u0101dh\u0101) and ''-\u012b-'' (\u0908, Rukm\u012bn\u012b). The masculine and neuter are much simpler, and the difference between them is primarily inflectional.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman| Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=59, 79, 91, 113}} Similar affixes for the feminine are found in many Indo-European languages, states Burrow, suggesting links of the Sanskrit to its PIE heritage.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|pp= 191\u2013194}}\n\nPronouns in Sanskrit include the personal pronouns of the first and second persons, unmarked for gender, and a larger number of gender-distinguishing pronouns and adjectives.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Examples of the former include ''ah\u00e1m'' (first singular), ''vay\u00e1m'' (first plural) and ''y\u016by\u00e1m'' (second plural). The latter can be demonstrative, deictic or anaphoric.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Both the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit share the ''s\u00e1/t\u00e1m'' pronominal stem, and this is the closest element to a third person pronoun and an article in the Sanskrit language, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nIndicative, potential and imperative are the three mood forms in Sanskrit.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\n===Prosody, meter===\n{{main|Sanskrit prosody}}\nThe Sanskrit language formally incorporates [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]].<ref name=jameslochtefeldsca140/> By the late Vedic era, this developed into a field of study and it was central to the composition of the Hindu literature including the later Vedic texts.

Further, a closer examination reveals that they all have the similar basic graphic principles, the same ''varnamala'' (literally, \"garland of letters\") alphabetic ordering following the same logical phonetic order, easing the work of historic skilled scribes writing or reproducing Sanskrit works across the Indian subcontinent.{{sfn|Dhanesh Jain|George Cardona|2007|pp=70\u201371, 75\u201376 in Chapter 3 by Salomon}}{{refn|group=note|Salomon states that these shared graphic principles that combine syllabic and alphabetic writing are distinctive for Indic scripts when contrasted with other major world languages.

The system most commonly used today is the IAST ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration]]), which has been the academic standard since 1888. [[ASCII]]-based transliteration schemes have also evolved because of difficulties representing Sanskrit characters in computer systems. These include [[Harvard-Kyoto]] and [[ITRANS]], a transliteration scheme that is used widely on the Internet, especially in Usenet and in email, for considerations of speed of entry as well as rendering issues. With the wide availability of [[Unicode]]-aware web browsers, IAST has become common online. It is also possible to type using an [[alphanumeric keyboard]] and transliterate to Devanagari using software like Mac OS X's international support.\n\nEuropean scholars in the 19th century generally preferred Devanagari for the transcription and reproduction of whole texts and lengthy excerpts. However, references to individual words and names in texts composed in European Languages were usually represented with Roman transliteration. From the 20th century onwards, because of production costs, textual editions edited by Western scholars have mostly been in [[Romanised]] transliteration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shashir.autodidactus.org/shashir_umich/sanskrit_transcription.html|title=Modern Transcription of Sanskrit|publisher=autodidactus.org}}</ref>\n\n===Epigraphy===\nThe earliest known stone inscriptions in Sanskrit are in the Brahmi script from the first century BCE.{{sfn|Salomon|1998|pp=86\u201387}}{{refn|group=note|Some scholars date these to the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jan Gonda|authorlink=Jan Gonda|title=Visnuism and Sivaism: A Comparison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khrmDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA166|year=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-1-4742-8082-2|pages=166 note 243}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=James Hegarty|title=Religion, Narrative and Public Imagination in South Asia: Past and Place in the Sanskrit Mahabharata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMSoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-64589-1|pages=46 note 118}}</ref>}}{{refn|group=note|Prakrit inscriptions of ancient India, such as those of Ashoka, are older.

Pata\u00f1jali acknowledged that Prakrit is the first language, one instinctively adopted by every child with all its imperfections and later leads to the problems of interpretation and misunderstanding. The purifying structure of the Sanskrit language removes these imperfections. The early Sanskrit grammarian [[Da\u1e47\u1e0din]] states, for example, that much in the Prakrit languages is etymologically rooted in Sanskrit, but involve \"loss of sounds\" and corruptions that result from a \"disregard of the grammar\". Da\u1e47\u1e0din acknowledged that there are words and confusing structures in Prakrit that thrive independent of Sanskrit.

There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the Gothick and the Celtick [sic], though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the Sanscrit; and the Old Persian might be added to the same family.\n|William Jones, 1786|quoted by Thomas Burrow in ''The Sanskrit Language''{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|p=6}}}}\n\nIn order to explain the common features shared by Sanskrit and other Indo-European languages, the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory]] states that the original speakers of what became Sanskrit arrived in the Indian subcontinent from the north-west sometime during the early second millennium BCE. Evidence for such a theory includes the close relationship between the Indo-Iranian tongues and the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages]], vocabulary exchange with the non-Indo-European [[Uralic languages]], and the nature of the attested Indo-European words for flora and fauna.{{sfn|Colin P.

A part of the difficulty is the lack of sufficient textual, archaeological and epigraphical evidence for the ancient Prakrit languages with rare exceptions such as Pali, leading to a tendency of [[anachronism|anachronistic]] errors.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Sanskrit and Prakrit languages may be divided into Old Indo-Aryan (1500 BCE\u2013600 BCE), Middle Indo-Aryan (600 BCE\u20131000 CE) and New Indo-Aryan (1000 CE\u2013current), each can further be subdivided in early, middle or second, and late evolutionary substages.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}}\n\nVedic Sanskrit belongs to the early Old Indo-Aryan while Classical Sanskrit to the later Old Indo-Aryan stage. The evidence for Prakrits such as Pali (Theravada Buddhism) and Ardhamagadhi (Jainism), along with Magadhi, Maharashtri, Sinhala, Sauraseni and Niya (Gandhari), emerge in the Middle Indo-Aryan stage in two versions\u2014archaic and more formalized\u2014that may be placed in early and middle substages of the 600 BCE\u20131000 CE period.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=50\u201357}} Two literary Indic languages can be traced to the late Middle Indo-Aryan stage and these are Apabhramsa and Elu (a form of literary Sinhalese). Numerous North, Central, Eastern and Western Indian languages, such as Hindi, Gujarati, Sindhi, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Nepali, Braj, Awadhi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, and others belong to the New Indo-Aryan stage.{{sfn|Colin P.

They likely emerged from a synthesis of the ancient Sanskrit language traditions and an admixture of various regional dialects. Each language has some unique and regionally creative aspects, with unclear origins. Prakrit languages do have a grammatical structure, but like the Vedic Sanskrit, it is far less rigorous than Classical Sanskrit.

The consonantal system is the same, though it systematically enlarged the inventory of distinct sounds. For example, Sanskrit added a voiceless aspirated \"t\u02b0\", to the voiceless \"t\", voiced \"d\" and voiced aspirated \"d\u02b0\" found in PIE languages.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nThe most significant and distinctive phonological development in Sanskrit is vowel-merger, states Stephanie Jamison\u2014an Indo-European linguist specializing in Sanskrit literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} The short ''*e'', ''*o'' and ''*a'', all merge as ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit, while long ''*\u0113'', ''*\u014d'' and ''*\u0101'', all merge as long ''\u0101'' (\u0906). These mergers occurred very early and significantly impacted Sanskrit's morphological system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} Some phonological developments in it mirror those in other PIE languages. For example, the labiovelars merged with the plain velars as in other satem languages. The secondary palatalization of the resulting segments is more thorough and systematic within Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}} A series of retroflex dental stops were innovated in Sanskrit to more thoroughly articulate sounds for clarity. For example, unlike the loss of the morphological clarity from vowel contraction that is found in early Greek and related southeast European languages, Sanskrit deployed ''*y'', ''*w'', and ''*s'' intervocalically to provide morphological clarity.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n===Vowels===\n\nThe cardinal vowels (''svaras'') ''i'' (\u0907), ''u'' (\u0909), ''a'' (\u0905) distinguish length in Sanskrit, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman|Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=1\u20139}} The short ''a'' (\u0905) in Sanskrit is a closer vowel than \u0101, equivalent to schwa. The mid-vowels \u0113 (\u090f) and \u014d (\u0913) in Sanskrit are monophthongizations of the Indo-Iranian diphthongs ''*ai'' and ''*au''. The Old Iranian language preserved ''*ai'' and ''*au''.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}} The Sanskrit vowels are inherently long, though often transcribed ''e'' and ''o'' without the diacritic. The vocalic liquid ''r\u0325'' in Sanskrit is a merger of PIE ''*r\u0325'' and ''*l\u0325''. The long ''r\u0325'' is an innovation and it is used in a few analogically generated morphological categories.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=9}}{{sfn|Michael Coulson|Richard Gombrich|James Benson|2011|pp=21\u201336}}{{sfn|Colin P.

However, the northwestern dialect only had \"r\", while the eastern dialect probably only had \"l\", states Masica.

All the retroflexes in Sanskrit are in \"origin conditioned alternants of dentals, though from the beginning of the language they have a qualified independence\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nRegarding the palatal plosives, the pronunciation is a matter of debate. In contemporary attestation, the palatal plosives are a regular series of palatal stops, supported by most Sanskrit sandhi rules.  However, the reflexes in descendant languages, as well as a few of the sandhi rules regarding ''ch'', could suggest an affricate pronunciation. \n\n''jh'' was a marginal phoneme in Sanskrit, hence its phonology is more difficult to reconstruct; it was more commonly employed in the Middle Indo-Aryan languages as a result of phonological processes resulting in the phoneme.\n\nThe palatal nasal is a conditioned variant of n occurring next to palatal obstruents.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}} The ''anusvara'' that Sanskrit deploys is a conditioned alternant of postvocalic nasals, under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}} Its ''visarga'' is a word-final or morpheme-final conditioned alternant of s and r under certain sandhi conditions.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = '''The system of Sanskrit Sounds'''<br />[The] order of Sanskrit sounds works along three principles: it goes from simple to complex; it goes from the back to the front of the mouth; and it groups similar sounds together. [...] Among themselves, both the vowels and consonants are ordered according to where in the mouth they are pronounced, going from back to front.\n |source = \u2014 A. M.

Ruppel|2017|pp=18\u201319}}\n |width = 28%\n |bgcolor=#FFE0BB\n |align  = right\n}}\nThe voiceless aspirated series is also an innovation in Sanskrit but is significantly rarer than the other three series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=9\u201310}}\n\nWhile the Sanskrit language organizes sounds for expression beyond those found in the PIE language, it retained many features found in the Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages. An example of a similar process in all three, states Jamison, is the retroflex sibilant \u0282 being the automatic product of dental s following i, u, r, and k (mnemonically \"ruki\").{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=10}}\n\n===Phonological alternations, sandhi rules===\nSanskrit deploys extensive phonological alternations on different linguistic levels through ''sandhi'' rules (literally, the rules of \"putting together, union, connection, alliance\"). This is similar to the English alteration of \"going to\" as ''gonna'', states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} The Sanskrit language accepts such alterations within it, but offers formal rules for the ''sandhi'' of any two words next to each other in the same sentence or linking two sentences. The external ''sandhi'' rules state that similar short vowels coalesce into a single long vowel, while dissimilar vowels form glides or undergo diphthongization.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} Among the consonants, most external ''sandhi'' rules recommend regressive assimilation for clarity when they are voiced. According to Jamison, these rules ordinarily apply at compound seams and morpheme boundaries.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=10\u201311}} In Vedic Sanskrit, the external ''sandhi'' rules are more variable than in Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=11}}\n\nThe internal ''sandhi'' rules are more intricate and account for the root and the canonical structure of the Sanskrit word. These rules anticipate what are now known as the [[Bartholomae's law]] and [[Grassmann's law]]. For example, states Jamison, the \"voiceless, voiced, and voiced aspirated obstruents of a positional series regularly alternate with each other (p \u2248 b \u2248 b\u02b0; t \u2248 d \u2248 d\u02b0, etc.; note, however, c \u2248 j \u2248 h), such that, for example, a morpheme with an underlying voiced aspirate final may show alternants{{clarify|date=March 2019|reason=alternations?}} with all three stops under differing internal sandhi conditions\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}} The velar series (k, g, g\u02b0) alternate with the palatal series (c, j, h), while the structural position of the palatal series is modified into a retroflex cluster when followed by dental. This rule create two morphophonemically distinct series from a single palatal series.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nVocalic alternations in the Sanskrit morphological system is termed \"strengthening\", and called ''guna'' and ''vriddhi'' in the preconsonantal versions. There is an equivalence to terms deployed in Indo-European descriptive grammars, wherein Sanskrit's unstrengthened state is same as the zero-grade, ''guna'' corresponds to normal-grade, while ''vriddhi'' is same as the lengthened-state.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The qualitative ablaut is not found in Sanskrit just like it is absent in Iranian, but Sanskrit retains quantitative ablaut through vowel strengthening.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}} The transformations between unstrengthened to ''guna'' is prominent in the morphological system, states Jamison, while ''vriddhi'' is a particularly significant rule when adjectives of origin and appurtenance are derived. The manner in which this is done slightly differs between the Vedic and the Classical Sanskrit.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=12}}{{sfn|Colin P.

Similarly, the syllable may have an internal vowel of any weight. The Vedic Sanskrit shows traces of following the Sievers-Edgerton Law, but Classical Sanskrit doesn't. Vedic Sanskrit has a pitch accent system, states Jamison, which were acknowledged by Panini, but in his Classical Sanskrit the accents disappear.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} Most Vedic Sanskrit words have one accent. However, this accent is not phonologically predictable, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} It can fall anywhere in the word and its position often conveys morphological and syntactic information.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} According to Masica, the presence of an accent system in Vedic Sanskrit is evidenced from the markings in the Vedic texts. This is important because of Sanskrit's connection to the PIE languages and comparative Indo-European linguistics.{{sfn|Colin P. Masica|1993|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\nSanskrit, like most early Indo-European languages, lost the so-called \"laryngeal consonants (cover-symbol ''*H'') present in the Proto-Indo-European\", states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=13}} This significantly impacted the evolutionary path of the Sanskrit phonology and morphology, particularly in the variant forms of roots.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n==Morphology==\n{{Main|Sanskrit grammar}}\n{{See also|Vedic Sanskrit grammar}}\nThe basis of Sanskrit morphology is the root, states Jamison, \"a morpheme bearing lexical meaning\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} The verbal and nominal stems of Sanskrit words are derived from this root through the phonological vowel-gradation processes, the addition of affixes, verbal and nominal stems. It then adds an ending to establish the grammatical and syntactic identity of the stem. According to Jamison, the \"three major formal elements of the morphology are (i) root, (ii) affix, and (iii) ending; and they are roughly responsible for (i) lexical meaning, (ii) derivation, and (iii) inflection respectively\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nA Sanskrit word has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Affix''{{su|b=0-n}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=0\u20131}}\n\nThe root structure has certain phonological constraints. Two of the most important constraints of a \"root\" is that it does not end in a short \"a\" (\u0905) and that it is monosyllabic.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} In contrast, the affixes and endings commonly do. The affixes in Sanskrit are almost always suffixes, with exceptions such as the augment \"a-\" added as prefix to past tense verb forms and the \"-na/n-\" infix in single verbal present class, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nA verb in Sanskrit has the following canonical structure:{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n:''Root'' + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Tense-Aspect}} + ''Suffix''{{su|b=Mood}} + ''Ending''{{su|b=Personal-Number-Voice}}\n\nAccording to Ruppel, verbs in Sanskrit express the same information as other Indo-European languages such as English.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\"/> Sanskrit verbs describe an action or occurrence or state, its embedded morphology informs as to \"who is doing it\" (person or persons), \"when it is done\" (tense) and \"how it is done\" (mood, voice). The Indo-European languages differ in the detail. For example, the Sanskrit language attaches the affixes and ending to the verb root, while the English language adds small independent words before the verb. In Sanskrit, these elements co-exist within the word.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p31\">{{cite book|author=A. M.

The finite verbs of Classical Sanskrit have the following grammatical categories: person, number, voice, tense-aspect, and mood. According to Jamison, a portmanteau morpheme generally expresses the person-number-voice in Sanskrit, and sometimes also the ending or only the ending. The mood of the word is embedded in the affix.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nThese elements of word architecture are the typical building blocks in Classical Sanskrit, but in Vedic Sanskrit these elements fluctuate and are unclear. For example, in the ''Rigveda'' [[preverb]]s regularly occur in [[tmesis]], states Jamison, which means they are \"separated from the finite verb\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}} This indecisiveness is likely linked to Vedic Sanskrit's attempt to incorporate accent. With nonfinite forms of the verb and with nominal derivatives thereof, states Jamison, \"preverbs show much clearer univerbation in Vedic, both by position and by accent, and by Classical Sanskrit, tmesis is no longer possible even with finite forms\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=15}}\n\nWhile roots are typical in Sanskrit, some words do not follow the canonical structure.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} A few forms lack both inflection and root. Many words are inflected (and can enter into derivation) but lack a recognizable root. Examples from the basic vocabulary include kinship terms such as ''m\u0101tar-'' (mother), ''nas-'' (nose), ''\u015bvan-'' (dog). According to Jamison, pronouns and some words outside the semantic categories also lack roots, as do the numerals. Similarly, the Sanskrit language is flexible enough to not mandate inflection.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe Sanskrit words can contain more than one affix that interact with each other. Affixes in Sanskrit can be athematic as well as thematic, according to Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Athematic affixes can be alternating. Sanskrit deploys eight cases, namely nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nStems, that is \"root + affix\", appear in two categories in Sanskrit: vowel stems and consonant stems. Unlike some Indo-European languages such as Latin or Greek, according to Jamison, \"Sanskrit has no closed set of conventionally denoted noun declensions\". Sanskrit includes a fairly large set of stem-types.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=17\u201318}} The linguistic interaction of the roots, the phonological segments, lexical items and the grammar for the Classical Sanskrit consist of four Paninian components. These, states Paul Kiparsky, are the ''Astadhyaayi'', a comprehensive system of 4,000 grammatical rules, of which a small set are frequently used; ''Sivasutras'', an inventory of ''anubandhas'' (markers) that partition phonological segments for efficient abbreviations through the ''pratyharas'' technique; ''Dhatupatha'', a list of 2,000 verbal roots classified by their morphology and syntactic properties using diacritic markers, a structure that guides its writing systems; and, the ''Ganapatha'', an inventory of word groups, classes of lexical systems.<ref name=Kiparsky59>{{cite book|author=Paul Kiparsky|editor=E.F.K.

These differ in the types of endings and what these endings mark in the grammatical context.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}} Pronouns and nouns share the same grammatical categories, though they may differ in inflection. Verb-based adjectives and participles are not formally distinct from nouns. Adverbs are typically frozen case forms of adjectives, states Jamison, and \"nonfinite verbal forms such as infinitives and gerunds also clearly show frozen nominal case endings\".{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=15\u201316}}\n\n===Tense and voice===\nThe Sanskrit language includes five tenses: present, future, past imperfect, past [[aorist]] and past perfect.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> It outlines three types of voices: active, passive and the middle.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/> The middle is also referred to as the mediopassive, or more formally in Sanskrit as ''parasmaipada'' (word for another) and ''atmanepada'' (word for oneself).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60%\"\n|+Voice in Sanskrit, Stephanie Jamison{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|Ruppel gives the following endings for the \"present indicative active\" in the Sanskrit language: 1st dual: -va\u1e25, 1st plural: -ma\u1e25, 2nd dual: -tha\u1e25, 2nd plural: -tha and so on.{{sfn|A.

For example, the ''Rigveda'' includes perfect and a marginal pluperfect. Classical Sanskrit simplifies the \"present\" system down to two tenses, the perfect and the imperfect, while the \"aorist\" stems retain the aorist tense and the \"perfect\" stems retain the perfect and marginal pluperfect.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=21}} The classical version of the language has elaborate rules for both voice and the tense-aspect system to emphasize clarity, and this is more elaborate than other Indo-European languages. The evolution of these systems can be seen from the earliest layers of the Vedic literature to the late Vedic literature.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n===Gender, mood===\nSanskrit recognizes three numbers\u2014singular, dual, and plural.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} The dual is a fully functioning category, used beyond naturally paired objects such as hands or eyes, extending to any collection of two. The elliptical dual is notable in the Vedic Sanskrit, according to Jamison, where a noun in the dual signals a paired opposition.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Illustrations include ''dy\u0101v\u0101'' (literally, \"the two heavens\" for heaven-and-earth), ''m\u0101tar\u0101'' (literally, \"the two mothers\" for mother-and-father).{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} A verb may be singular, dual or plural, while the person recognized in the language are forms of \"I\", \"you\", \"he/she/it\", \"we\" and \"they\".<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\nThere are three persons in Sanskrit: first, second and third.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|p=20}} Sanskrit uses the 3\u00d73 grid formed by the three numbers and the three persons parameters as the paradigm and the basic building block of its verbal system.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=20\u201321}}\n\nThe Sanskrit language incorporates three genders: feminine, masculine and neuter.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} All nouns have inherent gender, but with some exceptions, personal pronouns have no gender. Exceptions include demonstrative and anaphoric pronouns.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}} Derivation of a word is used to express the feminine. Two most common derivations come from feminine-forming suffixes, the ''-\u0101-'' (\u0906, R\u0101dh\u0101) and ''-\u012b-'' (\u0908, Rukm\u012bn\u012b). The masculine and neuter are much simpler, and the difference between them is primarily inflectional.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Robert P. Goldman| Sally J Sutherland Goldman|2002|pp=59, 79, 91, 113}} Similar affixes for the feminine are found in many Indo-European languages, states Burrow, suggesting links of the Sanskrit to its PIE heritage.{{sfn|Thomas Burrow|2001|pp= 191\u2013194}}\n\nPronouns in Sanskrit include the personal pronouns of the first and second persons, unmarked for gender, and a larger number of gender-distinguishing pronouns and adjectives.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Examples of the former include ''ah\u00e1m'' (first singular), ''vay\u00e1m'' (first plural) and ''y\u016by\u00e1m'' (second plural). The latter can be demonstrative, deictic or anaphoric.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}} Both the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit share the ''s\u00e1/t\u00e1m'' pronominal stem, and this is the closest element to a third person pronoun and an article in the Sanskrit language, states Jamison.{{sfn|Jamison|2008|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nIndicative, potential and imperative are the three mood forms in Sanskrit.<ref name=\"Ruppel2017p34\"/>\n\n===Prosody, meter===\n{{main|Sanskrit prosody}}\nThe Sanskrit language formally incorporates [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metres]].<ref name=jameslochtefeldsca140/> By the late Vedic era, this developed into a field of study and it was central to the composition of the Hindu literature including the later Vedic texts.
